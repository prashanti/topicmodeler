The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	The Baltimore Sun Jay Hancock column: Energy inflation and the cold driving utility bills up  	Jay Hancock, The Baltimore Sun  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	861 words  	Jan. 31--Sam and Heather Travaglini turn down the heat pump when they're away or asleep. They bought efficient fluorescent bulbs.LiNeBrEaKThey never put the thermostat higher than 70 degrees, even though the basement has trouble making it into the 60s. Heather "always has a blanket on," even when she's upstairs, her husband says.LiNeBrEaKSo what did they do to deserve a $265 Baltimore Gas and Electric bill this month? LiNeBrEaK"It is the highest bill that I have received" since they bought their Columbia townhouse three years ago, says Sam Travaglini. "I kind of anticipate that the next one is going to be even higher."LiNeBrEaKMetro Baltimore is freezing, worried about the recession and wondering why BGE bills are higher than ever even as the cost of gasoline, electricity and other energy has plunged.LiNeBrEaKBlame a cold winter and BGE's purchase of electricity last year when energy prices were hitting record heights. The popped energy bubble should eventually mean moderately lower BGE bills.LiNeBrEaK"In 2010, I think we'll see in the range of 5 to 10 percent potential drops in retail electric rates," says Mark Case, BGE's senior vice president of strategy and regulatory affairs. Natural gas rates could go down by much more.LiNeBrEaKBut the long-term trend for all energy prices is still upward.LiNeBrEaKThis winter's electric bills include costs for carbon emissions and renewable fuels that are likely to grow as the country tackles climate change. Marylanders will also pay for new generation at Calvert Cliffs, where BGE parent Constellation Energy plans to add a third nuclear unit, and elsewhere.LiNeBrEaKMany would be thrilled with a $265 BGE bill. The Baltimore Sun'sweather blogger, Frank Roylance, says his passed $300 for only the second time in a dozen years. (Blog post title: "Yeeoweee!") Mine was $357, the highest I can remember. Tales of $700 bills and higher from people in older, poorly insulated homes are common.LiNeBrEaKDeregulation is still a factor, of course. BGE used to sell relatively inexpensive electricity from its own coal and nuclear plants. But Maryland lawmakers allowed BGE's unregulated parent to take over the generators while BGE has to shop for more-expensive juice on the open market.LiNeBrEaKFull deregulation, however, kicked in almost three years ago. Today's extra-high bills come from last year's energy inflation and this year's shivers.LiNeBrEaKThis winter, temperatures are 8 percent lower than normal, BGE says. That translates into as much as 10 percent more kilowatts burned -- or higher if you have a heat pump or baseboard heaters.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, household kilowatts are about 10 percent more expensive than last winter because BGE locked up its supply in advance, before prices dipped. While not purchasing at the peak in June and July, it still bought above today's depressed levels.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, BGE bought much of this winter's natural gas last summer, during the boom.LiNeBrEaKSo neither natural gas nor electricity customers have yet benefited from the crash in energy prices. The wholesale cost of both decatherms and kilowatts has fallen by 40 percent or more from last summer's highs, mimicking the price of gasoline.LiNeBrEaKGas consumers will see bigger and sooner relief than electricity customers because BGE is locked in longer for electricity costs. Gas users should see a big decrease by late spring. Electricity prices will come down gradually as BGE's older, expensive contracts expire.LiNeBrEaKBut probably not for long.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the recession has diminished growth in electricity consumption and postponed the day of Maryland blackouts and brownouts, at some point we have to build new generators. One way or another electricity customers will pay.LiNeBrEaKWe're also beginning to pay for the considerable carbon emitted by coal-powered generators that have powered the mid-Atlantic economy for a century. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a consortium of Maryland and nine other nearby states, auctioned the first carbon-emissions permits last fall and builds the cost into what BGE users and other customers pay.LiNeBrEaKTougher federal proposals to cap carbon emissions could raise wholesale megawatt costs by about 10 percent to 65 percent, calculates PJM Interconnection, which manages the mid-Atlantic grid. That's pocketbook pain beyond what anybody is experiencing now. And this is bad enough.LiNeBrEaKDenise Miller's latest BGE bill was $560.LiNeBrEaK"Paying this much for gas and electricity -- you don't have that extra to do anything else" like go to restaurants, says the Columbia nurse. "I feel like we're paying all this money and not getting our money's worth" because the power frequently dies during storms.LiNeBrEaKHer family turns off lights when they leave rooms. They don't keep the night porch lights on anymore. They're talking about lowering the thermostat from 69 degrees to 67.LiNeBrEaK"I'm thinking this is crazy," she says.

The Boston Herald 		January 31, 2009 Saturday   ALL EDITIONS	EDITORIAL;   California dreamin' 		EDITORIAL; Pg. 012  	304 words  	President Barack Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine its refusal to grant California a waiver so it can set its own auto exhaust standards. This is grandstanding. LiNeBrEaKWhat would California's plan do? It would impose gasoline mileage standards on cars sold in that state (and in any state that adopts the California rule - and you know Massachusetts wouldn't be far behind) identical to the new federal standards (averaging 35 miles per gallon instead of the current 27. 5 mpg) but four years ahead of schedule, 2016 instead of 2020.LiNeBrEaKThat's all!

Brattleboro Reformer (Vermont)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	Energy efficiency project seeks volunteers  	Bob Audette, Brattleboro Reformer, Vt.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	568 words  	Jan. 31--BRATTLEBORO -- Brattleboro Climate Protection is looking for volunteers to help bring energy-saving programs to town residents.LiNeBrEaKThe town is partnering with Efficiency Vermont to introduce the Vermont Community Energy Mobilization Project, which is designed to help homeowners learn about how to save energy, said Paul Cameron, director of Brattleboro Climate Protection. LiNeBrEaKVCEM trains local volunteers to conduct free home visits designed to help homeowners learn about energy-saving opportunities.LiNeBrEaKThe project is a pilot program, he said, and Brattleboro is one of 10 towns approved to test it out.LiNeBrEaKBrattleboro qualified for the program, said Cameron, because of its reputation of working for energy efficiency and the large number of people in the community who are willing to spend time as volunteers.LiNeBrEaK"They looked at our track record."LiNeBrEaKVolunteers will help homeowners identify whether their home energy use is efficient, will provide information about additional ways to reduce energy costs and will help them find area professionals trained to make energy-efficiency improvements.LiNeBrEaKVolunteers will also install free Energy Star compact fluorescent light bulbs, water-saving devices and, if applicable, programmable thermostats.LiNeBrEaKEfficiency Vermont funds the cost of installed energy-saving products and volunteer training.LiNeBrEaKBrattleboro Climate Protection is a nonprofit organization that worksLiNeBrEaKclosely with the town to develop effective local solutions to global climate change.LiNeBrEaK"In Vermont, we take care of each other, especially when times are difficult," said Cameron. "This is a great opportunity to help our friends and neighbors and learn about energy efficiency while saving energy and money."LiNeBrEaKCameron said he is looking for at least 30 volunteers who would like to participate in the project. The Rotary Club has promised Cameron up to 10 volunteers, he said, but more are needed.LiNeBrEaK"The number of homes receiving assessments will depend on how many local residents volunteer for the effort."LiNeBrEaKA volunteer training session will take place on Sunday, Feb. 15, from 1 to 4 p.m., at the Windham Regional Career Center at 131 Fairground Road in Brattleboro.LiNeBrEaKThe training sessions are open to anyone who would like to attend, said Cameron, and not just Brattleboro residents.LiNeBrEaKThose interested should register with Cameron at 802-251-8135. The registration deadline is Feb. 6.LiNeBrEaKBrattleboro residents interested in having a free home energy visit, which are scheduled to be done by mid-April, should contact Cameron as well.LiNeBrEaK"Recent fluctuating fuel prices have heightened Vermonters' interest in reducing energy use in their homes," Cameron said. "Many people are unaware of whether or not their homes are wasting energy, what actions they can take to reduce their utility bills, and where to turn for help. We're very pleased to be a part of what promises to be a positive experience for volunteers and homeowners alike."

The Clover Herald (South Carolina)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	Poll: Global warming a low priority  	Aaron Lee, The Daily Progress, Charlottesville, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	570 words  	Jan. 31--Global warming is hanging from the bottom rung of Americans' priority ladder, a new Pew survey shows.LiNeBrEaKBut some opinion pollsters and scientists don't find that surprising.LiNeBrEaK"Its immediacy is not on the same level as a job or health care," said Chris Borick, a pollster and professor at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.LiNeBrEaKIn December, Borick presented survey data at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs that suggested 72 percent of Americans believe there is "solid evidence the Earth is warming." LiNeBrEaKHowever, according to a nationwide survey conducted earlier this month by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, "global warming" ranked last on a list of 20 priorities among 1,500 adults.LiNeBrEaKTopping the list were the economy, jobs and terrorism, in that order.LiNeBrEaKBut the stimulus package being kicked around Washington could mean advancing environmental initiatives -- such as developing green technologies -- even if it isn't primarily being billed that way, Borick said.LiNeBrEaK"A way that [President Barack Obama is] selling a lot of these [stimulus] issues right now is not so much on protecting the climate, but as ways to create jobs and stimulate the economy," Borick said.LiNeBrEaKIn the three years since Pew added it to its annual priority survey, the global warming category has not risen higher than 17th, with 38 percent of people considering it a priority in 2007. This is the second consecutive year it has ranked 20th, dropping 5 percent from 2008 to 30 percent this year.LiNeBrEaKCategories seeing the largest boost among priorities include "jobs," which saw a 21 percent hike between 2008 and 2009, followed by "economy," which was a concern for 85 percent of people surveyed.LiNeBrEaKBrian Balogh, chairman of Governing America in a Global Era at the Miller Center, said it wasn't until the last quarter of the 20th century that policy makers began marrying environmental initiatives with economic stimulus.LiNeBrEaK"That would have been preposterous in the 1960s," Balogh said.LiNeBrEaKSid Milkis, professor of government and foreign affairs at UVa, said people often prioritize with their pocketbooks and that talk of alternative energy with fewer carbon emissions may have slacked off because the price of gasoline recently dropped.LiNeBrEaKMilkis said the president scattered references to environmental initiatives throughout his campaign, but believes it may be the end of Obama's first term, or the first part of a possible second term, before he's able to push a larger environmental agenda.LiNeBrEaKHoward Epstein, an associate professor of environmental science at UVa, said issues ranking higher on the Pew list, such as the economy, energy and the environment, all tie to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"What they're saying in other ways is that [global warming] is important," Epstein said.LiNeBrEaKWhile the economy category ranked No. 1, the Pew survey showed energy moved up one percentage point between 2008 and 2009, while the environment dropped by 15 percent. Health care also took a hit, down 10 percent this year.

Daily News (New York) 		January 31, 2009 Saturday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	IN OTHER WORDS  	By Adam Sommers  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 23  	339 words  	The story: The financial meltdown rolls on and consultant Joshua Shapiro says it's not only big companies making job cuts. "The small- and medium-size companies that are so dependent on bank credit are withering on the vine," he says. LiNeBrEaKIn other words: Big and small, it doesn't matter. Every company is laying people off. I just wish the newspapers and TV would shut up about it already. SHUT UP! SHUT THE HECK UP! I get it. We're all going broke, and our kids will be forced to sell apples. But please leave us alone and go find your own cardboard box to die in.LiNeBrEaKThe story: Melody Morales sues Hawaiian Tropic Zone in Times Square, claiming bias because they didn't give her a job as a bikini waitress. "Not to brag," she says, "but I look good in a bikini. I could have done a perfect job."LiNeBrEaKIn other words: Here, check this out! And this! And even THIS. Oooh, sorry, didn't mean to hit you. Got a little carried away. If you fold up a five I'll show you the EXTRA SPECIAL moves I was saving for Hawaiian Tropic.LiNeBrEaKThe story: The Pope reinstates a bishop who thinks the Holocaust was baloney. Says Bishop Richard Williamson, "I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against - is hugely against - 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers."LiNeBrEaKIn other words: Heck, I believe anything. Like when Mommy told me Santa was REAL, that priests DON'T have gay sex and the police HAD to take Daddy away on a secret 20-year spy mission. (Keep it quiet, he's still undercover in Krapistan.)LiNeBrEaKThe story: Iceland's government falls apart with Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir (Her friends just call her Fdjadndukjuk) being blasted by Prime Minister Geir Haarde. "It was an unreasonable demand for the smaller party to demand the premiership over the larger party," says Haarde.LiNeBrEaKIn other words: I don't blame any party for this. It's all global warming. The glaciers have melted, people are sunbathing. They've lost their minds.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	Watercolorist Tony Foster's paintings of 'extraordinary places' being shown at Gerald Peters Gallery  	Michael Granberry, The Dallas Morning News  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	847 words  	Jan. 31--No less a figure than Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has written of Tony Foster's art: "In some of his winterscapes, you can practically feel the paint freezing on the paper."LiNeBrEaKFoster is, like Kennedy, an environmentalist, troubled by global warming. For Foster, it is both his Earth and his muse. He has climbed halfway up Mount Everest three times. He has made numerous trips to the Grand Canyon, to rain forests and deserts and the mouths of live volcanoes.LiNeBrEaKHe specializes in watercolors and as a native of Great Britain was inspired by the great H.M.W. Turner. But Foster's watercolors are painted on site, on what he calls the edge of the world. LiNeBrEaKHe revels in describing "what it's like to live in these places for a while, what happens to you, what the weather's like, what you see, what you hear, who you're with. "LiNeBrEaKFoster's work is the last exhibition at the soon-to-close Gerald Peters Gallery on Dragon Street in Dallas' Design District. "Tony Foster: Searching for a Bigger Subject" runs through Feb. 14, the last day of regular hours at the gallery. Foster's work is for sale, with prices ranging from $6,800 to $60,000.LiNeBrEaKThe locales featured in the Dallas show are the Grand Canyon and Mount Everest, although in the past quarter-century, this 62-year-old adventurer from Cornwall, England, has traveled all over the planet. He lives where he paints, no matter how cold or difficult the landscape. What makes his art unusual is that some of his canvases are 3-by-6 feet, painted on site -- even if the "site" is halfway up Everest.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, during his first trip to the world's tallest mountain, he climbed to 17,600 feet -- Everest is more than 29,000 feet high -- and almost died from altitude sickness.LiNeBrEaK"Your hands swell up, your feet, your brain, your face, all your organs. You feel sicker and sicker," he says, sitting near his paintings during a recent visit to the Gerald Peters Gallery. "There's not enough oxygen. The air is too thin to breathe. You start making bad decisions because your brain is swollen."LiNeBrEaKHe couldn't put his gloves on and grew furious, nearly 18,000 feet high, at the REI salesman who sold him the gloves. They didn't fit because his hands were swollen, a fact he couldn't comprehend because his brain was swollen and his judgment impaired.LiNeBrEaKOn the third day, he coughed up blood, which even an addled Foster knew could not be normal. He descended to a clinic at 16,000 feet to seek treatment. He returned to Everest a year later with his unfinished painting and applied the finishing touches in 2006.LiNeBrEaKOnce in a Costa Rican rain forest, he had to flee a horde of wild peccaries. They surrounded him on a riverbank, clattering their teeth in anger. "It was like taking a suitcase full of false teeth, dumping them on the floor and hearing them clatter," he says.LiNeBrEaKHe has never painted Texas, but for his next major project, he will paint the Rio Grande. In an earlier incarnation, he worked as a pop artist, painting "bunny girls and hot rods and even American football." The latter includes a painting of Dallas Cowboys reaching skyward for a football, a la soldiers planting the flag at Iwo Jima.LiNeBrEaKBut the artist admits he knows nothing about American football or the Dallas Cowboys, hence his conversion to a different kind of art.LiNeBrEaK"The truth is, pop artists use a lot of secondhand imagery, and I got fed up using secondhand imagery," he says. "Although the subjects were visually interesting, I found that I didn't care about them. Finally, I thought, 'I ought to do pictures about things I really care about.' "LiNeBrEaKHe cares about Henry David Thoreau -- "I had read Thoreau, and I used to be a hippie," he says with a laugh -- so he went to New England to paint its deepest pockets of wilderness. He found he loved being in places "where you could spend days on end and see no evidence of human beings."LiNeBrEaKHe loves the challenge of painting in such isolated places, which allow him to see that the world is changing and not for the better. He has seen icebergs melting in Greenland and floods ravaging Nepal.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the Gerald Peters show, Foster's work also is the subject of a lavish new book, Painting At The Edge of The World: The Watercolours of Tony Foster (University of Washington Press, $75), to which Kennedy contributed the foreword.LiNeBrEaKHe hopes the book and the Dallas show serve as "a celebration of these extraordinary places. They're very fragile, and they need protecting."Plan your lifeLiNeBrEaK"Tony Foster: Searching for a Bigger Subject" will be on view through Feb. 14 at the Gerald Peters Gallery, 1019 Dragon St. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays or by appointment.

The Joplin Globe (Missouri)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Trim pork from stimulus package  	The Joplin Globe, Mo.  	COMMENTARY  	342 words  	Jan. 31--The time has come to see if President Barack Obama meant it when he called for a new type of leadership in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKThe House on Wednesday passed an $819 billion economic stimulus package by a vote of 244-188. Republicans voted unanimously in opposition despite Obama's requests for bipartisan support. LiNeBrEaKOne of the reasons for the GOP's lack of support is clear. The bill has more pork than a charity ham and bean feed. Look at some of this stuff:LiNeBrEaK* $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts to assist struggling museums and galleries.LiNeBrEaK* $650 million for additional digital TV conversion coupons.LiNeBrEaK* $87 million for expanded family planning services.LiNeBrEaK* $670 million for rebuilding restrooms and other facilities at national parks.LiNeBrEaK* $400 million for global-warming research.LiNeBrEaKWe're not saying that these projects don't deserve a look. But they should go through the same congressional scrutiny as any other budget item.LiNeBrEaKThese projects don't have much to do with the package's intended goal. The bill also funds power-grid development, bridge and highway repair, education and clean water projects -- things that have obvious links to job creation and economic stimulation.LiNeBrEaKObama and Senate leaders are working on a compromise. Republicans are pressing for more tax cuts to go into the bill, and Obama has appeared receptive.LiNeBrEaKMake no mistake: This is a test for Republicans as well.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	456 words  	Jan. 31--Carbon dioxide limits could affect the price of electricity in Lebanon next year, Lebanon Utilities General Manager Mike Martin said Monday.LiNeBrEaKMartin was to attend a meeting of the Indiana Municipal Power Association Friday to discuss the impact of proposed pollution restrictions on coal-using electrical generating plants. Lebanon and 50 other cities and towns participate in IMPA, buying and generating electricity. LiNeBrEaK"We're going to see some movement this year" on legislation to control carbon emissions, although laws probably won't take effect until 2010, Martin told the Board of Works and Public Safety.LiNeBrEaKIt would be unfair, Martin said, for Lebanon Utility customers to bear the cost of carbon restrictions that are transferred to other countries.LiNeBrEaK"The community will need to become mobilized to help shape this legislation and protect our local economy," Martin said.LiNeBrEaK"We definitely have to take a grass-roots approach to this," Martin said.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired plants create carbon dioxide, a gas tied to increased heating of the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKIn the last 200 years, humans have been a "significant contributing factor" to global warming, which most scientists believe is changing the earth's climate, according to a story from the NewsWise information service.LiNeBrEaKEighty-two percent of 3,146 climatologists and earth scientists surveyed by a team from the University of Chicago agreed human activity is a significant factor in a rise in mean global temperatures.LiNeBrEaKNinety percent agreed that the earth is warmer than it was before 1800, NewsWise said. The study was published Jan. 16 in Eos, Transactions, American Geophysical Union.LiNeBrEaKA U.S. coal industry group, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, has said that so-called "clean coal" plants, with significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, can be built.LiNeBrEaKThe environmental group Reality Coalition, however, has aired TV ads saying "there is no such thing as clean coal."LiNeBrEaKBoth groups are accurate, according to FactCheck.org.LiNeBrEaKThe technology exists to build clean coal plants, but they would be expensive, factcheck.org said in a Jan. 22 posting on its Web site.LiNeBrEaKNone of the 616 coal-fired generating plants that were operating in 2006 could be considered "clean," or free of carbon dioxide emissions, FactCheck.org said in an analysis.LiNeBrEaKOn the WebLiNeBrEaKwww.factcheck.org	TALKS and MEETINGS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); COAL INDUSTRY (89%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); CITY LIFE (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); INTERNET and WWW (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); CITIES (72%); RESEARCH REPORTS (67%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (66%); WEB SITES (50%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)  	Crime/law  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (79%) EARTH (79%); ILLINOIS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 31, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090131-IL-Carbon-caps-could-raise-local-rates-0131  	Newspaper  	IL  	2009    																
The New York Post 		January 31, 2009 Saturday 	STIMULUS SPLITS SENATE DEMS  	CHARLES HURT Bureau Chief   	Sports+Late City Final; Pg. 6  	458 words  	WASHINGTON - President Obama's stimulus plan could be in deep trouble with members of his own party in the Senate, a key Democratic lawmaker said yesterday.  LiNeBrEaK"I don't even know how many Democrats will vote for it as it stands today," Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) told Fox News.   LiNeBrEaKNelson, who represents one of the most reliably conservative states in the country, has been an instrumental figure among a group of centrist senators who break logjams in a chamber that requires large majorities to pass legislation.  LiNeBrEaKObama's proposed spending bill - which has ballooned to $819 billion - has been harshly ridiculed for being wasteful.  LiNeBrEaKAll week, Republicans have pored over the text and found hundreds of millions of dollars in proposed spending on everything from polar icebreakers to supercomputers for calculating global warming.  LiNeBrEaKAfter a great deal of high-profile courting from Obama, every Republican in the House voted against the bill, along with 11 Democrats.  LiNeBrEaKThe Senate takes up the wounded legislation next week. Obama hopes to sign it sometime in February.  LiNeBrEaK"What I'm hoping to do is bring together a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats and offer changes that will attract others and improve the bill," Nelson said.  LiNeBrEaKWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Obama does not regret his efforts to win Republican support in the House for his spending plan, adding that the president would continue those efforts in the Senate.  LiNeBrEaK"The president will continue to do whatever is possible to get this bill going and to get it moved quickly to his desk," Gibbs said.  LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, experts said the plan would devote tens of billions of dollars to causes that have little to do with jolting the country out of recession.  LiNeBrEaKThere's $345 million for Agriculture Department computers, $650 million for TV converter boxes, $15 billion for college scholarships - worthy, perhaps, but not likely to put many Americans back to work quickly.  LiNeBrEaKThe bill would devote $2. 1 billion to pay off a looming shortfall in public housing accounts, $870 million to combat the flu and $400 million to slow the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia.  LiNeBrEaK"I have communicated to the administration that there are parts of this package that don't meet the test that they themselves established of temporary, timely and targeted," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND).  LiNeBrEaKObama pushed hard for the bill yesterday as he created a task force, headed by Vice President Joe Biden, that will seek ways to boost working families amid a recession he said is "like the American dream in reverse."  LiNeBrEaK"This isn't just an economic concept - this is a continuing disaster for America's working families," he said.

LiNeBrEaKObviously, a president gets a necessary pass on driving in a big (i.e., safe) car.  LiNeBrEaKBut it turns out that Obama keeps the Oval Office at near-tropical heat levels. The New York Times reports that he doesn't wear a suit jacket at his desk because he has "cranked up the thermostat."  LiNeBrEaKExplained adviser David Axelrod: "He's from Hawaii, OK? He likes it warm. You could grow orchids in there."  LiNeBrEaKSo would the rest of us, if we could afford it.  LiNeBrEaKBut talk about "Do as I say, not as I do."

The New York Times 		January 31, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	The Next Step on Warming  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 24  	408 words  	It seemed that every chance he got, President Bush ignored or flat out refused to address the problem of climate change. So we were greatly encouraged by President Obama's swift announcement that he is likely to approve California's request to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles -- a request the Bush administration denied.  LiNeBrEaK  The logical next step would be for Mr. Obama to quickly address the Supreme Court's 2007 decision ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to examine the effects of greenhouse gases and to regulate them if necessary. Mr. Bush dodged that one, too. LiNeBrEaK  The court instructed the agency to first determine whether global warming pollution threatened public health and welfare -- known as an ''endangerment finding'' under the Clean Air Act -- and, if so, to devise emissions standards for vehicles. LiNeBrEaK  Lisa Jackson, the agency's new administrator, said in a memo to her employees last week that she intended to honor her ''obligation to address climate change under the Clean Air Act.'' But there is resistance from some members of Congress and parts of the business community who fear that regulating vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to economy-wide controls on greenhouse gases from all sources, including industry.LiNeBrEaK  Stephen Johnson, Mr. Bush's E.P.A. administrator, initially tried to do the right thing. He ordered his staff to write an endangerment finding and craft regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. In December 2007, he sent the entire package to the White House, which not only chose to ignore the findings but refused to open the e-mail message that contained them. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Johnson then ordered up a laborious public rule-making process that essentially went nowhere and allowed Mr. Bush to retire to Texas without having done much of anything. Ms. Jackson is eager to get the process back on track. LiNeBrEaK  Nobody, including the administrator, is under any illusions that the E.P.A. alone can solve climate change. Congress will have to take ownership of the issue by authorizing major public investments in clean-energy technologies and by putting a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in order to unlock private investment. LiNeBrEaK  But smart regulation can begin to advance the ball. For starters, it would force industry to look for ways to make cars that are much more fuel-efficient. It would help goad Congress into action. It is also, as the Supreme Court has pointed out, the law.

The New York Times 		January 31, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	Rising Acidity Is Threatening Food Web of Oceans, Science Panel Says  	By CORNELIA DEAN  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 12  	495 words  	The oceans have long buffered the effects of climate change by absorbing a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. But this benefit has a catch: as the gas dissolves, it makes seawater more acidic. Now an international panel of marine scientists says this acidity is accelerating so fast it threatens the survival of coral reefs, shellfish and the marine food web generally.  LiNeBrEaK  The panel, comprising 155 scientists from 26 countries and other international groups, is not the first to point to growing ocean acidity as an environmental threat. For example, a group of eminent scientists convened by The Nature Conservancy issued a similar assessment in August.  But the new report's blunt language and international backing give its assessment unusual force. It called for ''urgent action'' to sharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK  ''Severe damages are imminent,'' the group said Friday in a statement summing up its deliberations at a symposium in Monaco last October. The statement, called the Monaco Declaration, said increasing acidity was interfering with the growth and health of shellfish and eating away at coral reefs, processes that would eventually affect marine food webs generally. LiNeBrEaK  Already, the group said, there have been detectable decreases in shellfish and shell weights, and interference with the growth of coral skeletons.LiNeBrEaK  Jeremy B. C. Jackson, a coral expert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego who has no connection to the Monaco report, said ''there is just no doubt'' that the acidification of the oceans is a major problem. ''Nobody really focused on it because we were all so worried about warming,'' he said, ''but it is very clear that acid is a major threat.''LiNeBrEaK  Carbon dioxide, principally from the burning of fossil fuels, is the major component of greenhouse gas emissions, which have risen steadily since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. LiNeBrEaK  Oceans absorb about a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions, the group said, but as the gas dissolves in the oceans it produces carbonic acid. LiNeBrEaK  The group says acidity of ocean surface waters has increased by 30 percent since the 17th century. LiNeBrEaK  ''The chemistry is so fundamental and changes so rapid and severe that impacts on organisms appear unavoidable,'' according to James Orr, who headed the symposium's scientific committee. Dr. Orr is a chemical oceanographer at the Marine Environmental Laboratory in Monaco, an affiliate of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations body.LiNeBrEaK  According to the declaration, ''ocean acidification may render most regions chemically inhospitable to coral reefs by 2050.'' The group said that acidification could be controlled only by limiting future atmospheric levels of the gas. Other strategies, including ''fertilizing'' the oceans to encourage the growth of tiny marine plants that take up carbon dioxide, may actually make the problem worse in some regions, it said.

COMMENTARY  	543 words  	Jan. 31--THREE UPLiNeBrEaKOK, so you've read all the bad news about Super Bowl economics. Hotels aren't filling up, tickets are still available, TV ads aren't selling at the normal clip. But we all know where the country will be Sunday evening: somewhere watching as the Pittsburgh Steelers take on the Arizona Cardinals. Want evidence? Roughly 40 million people watched the conference championship games two weeks ago. The big game unites us in a way politicians never will. LiNeBrEaKFrancis Chester hasn't yet fetched his pitchfork, but as a sheep farmer, he likely has one somewhere close at hand. Of course, Chester also is a lawyer who has taken to stirring the masses over Augusta County's reassessment. He vows that if supervisors don't heed his call for a rollback after residential values soared by 27. 7 percent, he'll take his case to court. Here's to refusing to accept a raw deal.LiNeBrEaKThat chill you're feeling these days is the resurgence of frosty weather, which Al Gore told us was supposed to give way to the emerging global meltdown. It's so darn cold out there that even global warming's advocates on the left are bailing on a concept that the sane among the rest of us thought was half-baked anyway. "Global warming is over," said retired Navy meteorologist Martin Hertzberg, a lifelong liberal Democrat.LiNeBrEaKTHREE DOWNLiNeBrEaKIt was a good week for late-night comics and a bad one. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich took a swift kick to the backside from the state Senate, which voted 59-0 to remove him from office after the House impeached him for abuse of power. Not a solitary strand in his mountainous hairdo was knocked from place. But plenty of tears were shed, by late-night comics. What now? Of course, they never could outdo Blago himself, who disclosed with straight face to the fair dames of "The View" that he was being persecuted "because I did things for people." Now that's comedy.LiNeBrEaKCopy from one, it's plagiarism; copy from two, it's research. Hey, that's a good line. Glad we thought of it. Or actually, Puritan poet John Milton thought of it. Southern Illinois University is facing a familiar problem. Turns out the school lifted text from Indiana University for its new plagiarism policy in 2007. That year, university President Glenn Poshard was accused of stealing copy for his doctoral dissertation and master's thesis. Well, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Or so somebody else said once.LiNeBrEaKWalter Curt is taking his money and prowess in raising it and sprinting like his pants are on fire. The well-heeled Shenandoah Valley businessman has quit as the Virginia Republican Party's top fundraiser. Why? "The organization is dysfunctional," he says. And that's a problem all of the sudden?

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		January 31, 2009 Saturday   All Editions	YOUR VIEWS  		OPINION; YOUR VIEWS; Pg. A11  	924 words  	?Much ado about (almost) nothing?LiNeBrEaKI extend my sympathy to the kids who didn?t get to attend the inaugural events that were paid for by their parents. But the headline "Tour company besieged" (Page A-1, Jan. 27) and its front-page location are over the top.LiNeBrEaK* If the Congressional Youth Leadership Council responsible for the problem was "besieged," there must have been many more cases than the two reported by the state Division of Consumer Affairs and the three cited in the news story. The article states that the council sponsored "more than 15,000 students, including 1,000 from New Jersey." Considering the numbers, the few reported incidents suggest that the company performed exceptionally well. LiNeBrEaK* Some parents hold the company responsible because Shane Hedges, one of its executives, was convicted of negligent homicide in 2001. The incident happened more than seven years ago; Hedges admitted his guilt and paid his dues. As far as we know, he has been acting responsibly ever since. Don?t we believe in giving people a second chance?LiNeBrEaK* A parent complained that her daughter was denied medical attention for a migraine. Not having a medical history, a lay person may be reluctant to offer medications to a stranger. The parent should appreciate the fact that the person who refused the medication may have acted in her daughter?s best interests.LiNeBrEaKThe company is trying to make amends, and life does have its disappointments. So please spare us the histrionic front-page headline, and spare us from seeing the same story day after day.LiNeBrEaKIn a world "besieged" by poverty, war, illness and global warming, this story seems, in the master?s words, "Much ado about nothing." Or almost nothing.LiNeBrEaKCarol S. WeinbergLiNeBrEaKCloster, Jan. 27LiNeBrEaKInsulting behavior at inaugurationLiNeBrEaKI was appalled at what was said and done at the inauguration. Effigies of President Bush were hung in trees, and people were given shoes to throw at them. President Bush, Laura Bush, Vice President Cheney and Lynne Cheney were booed and cursed as they left the inauguration.LiNeBrEaKAt public performances the night before the inauguration, Rappers Jay Z and Young Jeezy performed a rap song calling the Bushes vulgar names and saying, "Our president is now in power."LiNeBrEaKWhen Don Imus and Michael Richards made racist remarks about black people, they were publicly vilified. Imus was forced from his job; Richards was forced to make a public apology.LiNeBrEaKThere have been no public outcries over Jay Z and Young Jeezy?s performances. There have been no charges of insensitivity toward whites. Their comments insulted all who helped achieve the miracle of Obama reaching the highest office in the land.LiNeBrEaKIf Obama lives up to all his promise and proves worthy of all the adulation, all the more power to him. But it is too early to tell. We must be cautious of the Democratic socialistic ideals behind Obama.LiNeBrEaKBonnie RaymondLiNeBrEaKClifton, Jan. 25LiNeBrEaKMadoff acting solo is hard to believeLiNeBrEaKI would like to support the contention that there had to be several other players in Bernard Madoff?s $50 billion Ponzi scheme ("Madoff could not have acted alone," Your Views, Jan. 9)LiNeBrEaKI, too, have been a certified public accountant for decades. As an auditor for one of what used to be a "Big Eight" accounting firm, I was heavily involved in the regulatory reporting process.LiNeBrEaKI cannot imagine Madoff?s activities could have continued undetected for more than 10 years. We need to seriously examine the role of the two-man accounting firm that certified the Madoff financial statements.LiNeBrEaKErnie BuonocoreLiNeBrEaKWyckoff, Jan. 9LiNeBrEaKFootball: No solution to nation?s problemsLiNeBrEaKOne night recently, I settled in to watch an evening of commercials. The economy needs some spurring and I am willing to do my part. After all, the ads encouraged me to buy any number of items that I don?t really need and can?t really afford. But my country needs me to step up and further exacerbate the problems we are having. It?s called the American Way.LiNeBrEaKMuch to my consternation, the commercials kept being interrupted by a football game. How are we ever going to get out of our present situation if we don?t put all of our efforts into solving the problem? A football game ? do we really need that? Just imagine how much commercial time is lost showing a sporting event. The participants, in this case, should have been in their classrooms studying.LiNeBrEaKWe are never going to get out of this mess unless we get down to the nitty-gritty. A football game is not the answer.LiNeBrEaKJohn P. DonoghueLiNeBrEaKRiver Vale, Jan. 12LiNeBrEaKInsincere concern for later generationsLiNeBrEaKA number of Republican members of Congress are speaking out in opposition to the Obama stimulus plan, stating that we cannot place the cost burden on future generations. Their words are, at best, disingenuous and reek of politics as usual.LiNeBrEaKWhere was their concern for our kids when they voted in unison for the Bush tax cuts that favored the rich and turned the surplus left by the Clinton administration into deficits that sent the national debt spiraling upward? Where was the outrage when they continuously voted in lock step to provide billions upon billions to rebuild Iraq while our own domestic needs were ignored?LiNeBrEaKWhile Republicans controlled Congress, future generations were all but forgotten. Without question, deficit spending must be ended; however, the economic crisis our nation is suffering through must take priority at this time. We need all members of Congress to put aside partisan politics and work together to get our country back on its feet.LiNeBrEaKChuck BaileyLiNeBrEaKBarnegat, Jan. 26LiNeBrEaKThe writer is a former Closter resident.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		January 31, 2009 Saturday 	America's finest blog  	CHRIS REED  	OPINION; Pg. B-7  	734 words  	These are edited excerpts from editorial writer Chris Reed's Opinion blog. Readers are encouraged to respond to him at chris.reed@uniontrib.comLiNeBrEaK`Winter of Discontent': The Brit blueprint for CaliforniaLiNeBrEaKI've spent a long time looking for historical precedents to what we've seen in Sacramento since 2001. I refer to the control that unions have come to wield over Democratic lawmakers. It's unique and can't be found even in more liberal states such as New York and Wisconsin.LiNeBrEaKNow I've found a precedent: Great Britain in winter 1978-79. After Prime Minister James Callaghan tried to use the government's control of the economy to limit pay raises that were spurring enormous inflation, trade unions let him know who was boss. Auto workers forced Callaghan to let their pay go up by more than the 5 percent limit. This led truck drivers to strike, keeping gas and food from consumers, medicine from hospitals and animal feed from farmers, to disastrous consequence. It prompted copycat strikes by train drivers, ambulance drivers, nurses and grave diggers. All got their way, securing big pay hikes from a cowed British government. LiNeBrEaKThis became known as Britain's "Winter of Discontent," and led to Margaret Thatcher's sweeping to power and beginning to reform a broken nation.LiNeBrEaKObviously, the circumstances are different. But there is a key parallel between Britain then and California now: the stifling influence of union power. Taxpayers are told, even by a Republican governor, that spending simply must go up 8 percent a year. The state schools chief co-hosts press conferences with a teachers union exec. State prison guards have as much authority as their nominal bosses. State legislators -- forced by unions to come up with more revenue -- pretend as if they can raise taxes on a simple majority vote. The state controller refuses to furlough state workers.LiNeBrEaKIf it weren't for the initiative process, union power would reign supreme.LiNeBrEaKIt shouldn't be this way. Arnold Schwarzenegger was supposed to be our Margaret Thatcher, the pol who rolled back the unions' overreach. But he quit trying after two years -- the work was just too hard.LiNeBrEaKThatcher was the "Iron Lady." For all his macho posturing, Arnold has been an IMINO -- an Iron Man In Name Only.LiNeBrEaKClimate change: Moralistic approach will yield ruinLiNeBrEaKThe National Academy of Sciences released a landmark study this week. Experts from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Switzerland and France concluded that "greenhouse gas levels currently expected by mid-century will produce devastating long-term droughts and a sea-level rise that will persist for 1,000 years regardless of how well the world curbs future emissions of carbon dioxide," per The Washington Post's account.LiNeBrEaKThe implications of this are obvious: Whatever modest ameliorative measures we have undertaken, they're not nearly enough. This means that:LiNeBrEaK1) We should try to think out of the box to find ways to drastically slow global warming. Credible scientists believe there are at least two promising approaches. Google "carbon sequestration" and "geoengineering" to learn more about them.LiNeBrEaK2) We should begin preparing for a time when coastal areas are inundated and remaining land areas become hotter, for worse or better.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, the climate change debate to date has been framed on quasi-religious grounds: We are paying the price for our abuse of Gaia! We must repent for our materialism! Hummer owners, Hell awaits Thee! In other words, Al Gore-style moralistic rhetoric that depicts the conventional approach to fighting global warming -- using less power, water and resources, etc; having smaller "carbon footprints," etc. -- as God's work. New Age greeniness is next to saintliness.LiNeBrEaKBut re-read what the scientists say, and it's obvious that won't cut it. We need something much more dramatic in trying to reduce global warming -- and we need to be much more pragmatic in preparing for its effects.LiNeBrEaKI can hear the windbag green moralists revving up already. "Don't you know that faith in science is what destroyed the world? Don't you know that if we just adjust to global warming that we're accepting and perpetuating our role in an environmental holocaust?"LiNeBrEaKSorry, but I'd prefer trying something that might work to treating environmental chaos as a teachable moment in a global green Sunday School.LiNeBrEaKOnline: To check out Reed's blog, go to opinionblog.uniontrib.com	WAGES and SALARIES (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); BLOGS and MESSAGE BOARDS (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); LABOR UNIONS (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (77%); LEGISLATORS (76%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS (75%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS and AUDITORS (75%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (75%); EMISSIONS (72%); TRUCK DRIVERS (72%); CLIMATE CHANGE (72%); AUTOMOTIVE WORKERS (71%); TEACHER UNIONS (71%); TAX INCREASES (71%); GOVERNORS (70%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (70%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (70%); PRIME MINISTERS (69%); CORRECTIONS WORKERS (69%); HEADS OF STATE and GOVERNMENT (69%); ANIMAL FOODS (67%); TAXES and TAXATION (67%); CLIMATOLOGY (63%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (63%); OCEANOGRAPHY (63%); SCIENCE NEWS (63%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (63%); LIVESTOCK FEED (52%); PRESS CONFERENCES (50%)  	AMERICA'S FINEST PRODUCTS (58%); JUMPMUSIC.COM INC (58%); WASHINGTON POST CO (50%); PURESPECTRUM INC (58%)  	NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (50%); NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING (50%); NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS (50%); NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS (50%)  	SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (92%); SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (91%); FRANCE (79%); SWITZERLAND (72%)  	February 3, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The San Diego Union-Tribune   		ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (52%)  	BLOG;   	1 DRAWING; PHOTOBY: John Overmyer  				WPO (NYSE) (50%)  								
San Jose Mercury News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	January was not San Jose's warmest month, but still  	Mike Swift, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	713 words  	Jan. 31--As she flipped on the air conditioning during her morning commute to Silicon Valley from Berkeley on Friday, it struck Ruth Storm as kind of strange that she'd need the A/C in January.LiNeBrEaKBut as she sat in her T-shirt on her lunch break in downtown Los Altos, munching a sandwich in the brilliant sun, the Calgary native concluded that it wasn't so bad. "I got on Facebook and said, 'I can't believe it's not summer.' And my Canadian friends were all like, 'Damn you Californians,' " Storm said with a smile. LiNeBrEaKWhile January's chilly nights have kept the month from being the warmest on record in San Jose, the average daily high temperature of 63. 16 degrees, with one day left in the month, is the third-warmest since 1893, according to data collected by Golden Gate Weather Services.LiNeBrEaKFriday's high temperature was 67 degrees in San Jose, about six degrees above normal, and what normally is one of the two coldest months of the year will end today with a forecast high temperature of 66 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKAnd for the entire Bay Area, climate scientists at San Jose State University say it may well turn out to be the warmest January on record.LiNeBrEaK"You can't tie this to global warming right now," said Eugene Cordero, a climate scientist at San Jose State University. "But this is the kind of thing we expect to see happening more and more often, so it's a harbinger of what's to come."LiNeBrEaKClimate scientists won't beLiNeBrEaKable to make a final pronouncement about whether this was the Bay Area's warmest January until Jan. 31 is in the books.LiNeBrEaKBut because California is so highly dependent on winter rains and Sierra snowpack that could be affected by climate change, the abnormally warm weather "is something to be concerned about," said Cordero, the author of "Cool Cuisine: Taking the Bite out of Global Warming," a book about how food choices can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. "Obviously, our water resources are linked to this."LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that the same high-pressure system producing the warm, cloudless days and cool nights is also steering Pacific storm systems north of California. The result is that both San Jose and San Francisco have only had 51 percent of the normal rainfall for this time of the year, according to the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKTime is quickly running out for a wet winter.LiNeBrEaK"Most of the rain falls around January and February in our Mediterrean-type rain pattern, so once we pass February and going into March, it tends to be drier," said Diana Henderson, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. "So if (the rain) doesn't happen now I won't hold my breath to say it will happen after March or April."LiNeBrEaKCordero is bracing for another dry summer.LiNeBrEaK"I think water rations are something we're going to have to be dealing with," he said.LiNeBrEaKForecasters say that while it looks like the Bay Area has a chance for significant rain toward the end of next week, that storm alone won't be enough to get the region back on track. As of Friday, San Jose had received 4. 06 inches of rain this year; normal is 7. 89 inches.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the same high-pressure system that is blocking storms from hitting Northern California is also steering abundant snowfall over the Midwest and the East.LiNeBrEaKSo while the abnormally warm afternoons might have people thinking about climate change in the Bay Area, the weather probably is not prompting the same discussions in much of the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaK"You can't look at any given year, or any given singular weather event, and tie that to climate change," said Jan Null of Golden Gate Weather Services, a professor of meteorology at San Francisco State University. "Climate by definition is long-term averages. Somebody on the East Coast right now, you mention Global Warming to them and they'll say, 'Say what?'

COMMENTARY  	193 words  	Jan. 31--Don't wait for the Santa Clara Valley Water District to order you to use less water. Turn off those sprinklers now. LiNeBrEaKIt'll take a miracle for enough rain and Sierra snow to fall by summer to avoid a drought. And if a blizzard does bail us out, it won't change the fact that we live in a coastal desert. Even in wet years, we use too much water.LiNeBrEaKThe water district, which sells water to suppliers, won't order rationing until March at the earliest. But conservation is needed regardless to allow for continued population growth, let alone the specter of global warming.LiNeBrEaKSo stop watering in winter. And if your yard needs soaking year-round, it's time to face up to the climate we live in and switch to drought-tolerant plants.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 31, 2009 Saturday   FINAL Edition	Marine life gravely threatened by rising ocean acidity, panel warns  	Cornelia Dean, New York Times  	Main News; Pg. A4  	464 words  	 The oceans have long buffered the effects of climate change by absorbing a substantial portion of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. But this benefit has a catch: As the gas dissolves, it makes seawater more acidic. Now an international panel of marine scientists says this acidity is accelerating so fast it threatens the survival of coral reefs, shellfish and the marine food web generally. LiNeBrEaK The panel, comprising 155 scientists from 26 countries and organized by the United Nations and other international groups, is not the first to point to growing ocean acidity as an environmental threat, but its blunt language and international credentials give its assessment unusual force. It called for "urgent action" to sharply reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK "Severe damages are imminent," the group said Friday in a statement summing up its deliberations at a symposium in Monaco last October.LiNeBrEaK The statement, called the Monaco Declaration, said increasing acidity is interfering with the growth and health of shellfish and eating away at coral reefs, processes that would eventually affect marine food webs generally.LiNeBrEaK Already, the group said, there have been detectable decreases in shellfish, shell weights and interference with the growth of coral skeletons.LiNeBrEaK Jeremy Jackson, a coral expert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said "there is just no doubt" that the acidification of the oceans is a major problem. "Nobody really focused on it because we were all so worried about warming," he said, "but it is very clear that acid is a major threat."LiNeBrEaK Carbon dioxide, principally from the burning of fossil fuels, is the major component of greenhouse gas emissions, which have risen steadily since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 18th century.LiNeBrEaK Oceans absorb about a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions, the group said, but as the gas dissolves in the oceans, it produces carbonic acid.LiNeBrEaK The group said acidity of ocean surface waters has increased by 30 percent since the 17th century.LiNeBrEaK "The chemistry is so fundamental and changes so rapid and severe that impacts on organisms appear unavoidable," according to James Orr, who headed the symposium's scientific committee. Orr is a chemical oceanographer at the Marine Environmental Laboratory in Monaco, an affiliate of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. body.LiNeBrEaK According to the declaration, "ocean acidification may render most regions chemically inhospitable to coral reefs by 2050." The group said that acidification can be controlled only by limiting future atmospheric levels of the gas. Other strategies, including "fertilizing" the oceans to encourage the growth of tiny marine plants that take up carbon dioxide might actually make the problem worse in some regions, it said.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 31, 2009 Saturday 	Jan. 31 Additional Readers' letters  	From Mercury News readers  	LETTERS; News; Opinion  	349 words  	"Letters to the Editor"LiNeBrEaKFrom the readers of the Mercury NewsLiNeBrEaKNOTE: The following letters are unedited and reflect only the views of the authorLiNeBrEaKFirst we have the new Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner, the man now responsible for the IRS, carelessly overlooking income on which taxes are due, and then blaming the "complexities" of the tax code as the probable cause. Next we find that the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Daschle, doesn't recognize taxable income when he accumulates it. How the former leader of the Senate Democrats cannot suspect an inconsistency between the one million dollar annual amount paid for his services, and a filing shortfall of $88,333 taxable income in the amount reported on Form 1099, boggles the mind. LiNeBrEaKBut, once these two stalwarts are tapped for positions in the Obama cabinet, clarity of interpretation becomes paramount.LiNeBrEaKSo, Geithner cleans up four years running of underreported income taxes and his appointment is confirmed: Daschle then antes up for three years of missing tax disclosures and now awaits his Senate confirmation. Both will join the most ethical, moral and transparent administration ever to be known in history. Alas.LiNeBrEaKVerne KoeppeLiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKBetsy Fowler (Letters, Jan. 31) claims that Rush Limbaugh hopes President Obama fails. Unfortunately, she does so without providing a scintilla of context. Limbaugh has clearly stated that as a conservative he hopes Obama's liberal policies fail. Big difference! If Obamba is successful in talking down the economy to destroy it and in advancing global warming hysteria for the same end, then I too join with Rush in hoping that Obama fails.LiNeBrEaKClaude BramwellLiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKThe appointments of tax cheats Timothy Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury and Tom Daschle as Secretary of Health and Human Services are a brilliant move on the part of the Obama administration. When the carrot of a cabinet post was held in front of both men, they paid up. President Obama should immediately offer cabinet posts to all tax cheats in the nation.

Turn off those sprinklers now. LiNeBrEaKIt'll take a miracle for enough rain and Sierra snow to fall by summer to avoid a drought.

But conservation is needed regardless to allow for continued population growth, let alone the specter of global warming.LiNeBrEaKSo stop watering in winter.

Seattle Times (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 31, 2009 Saturday 	Seattle's garbage trucks to run on natural gas  	Mike Lindblom, Seattle Times  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	695 words  	Jan. 31--For years, Seattle has operated an aggressive curbside recycling program to reduce the need for expensive landfill space.LiNeBrEaKNow the city seeks to despoil less of the atmosphere by converting its garbage-truck fleet from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG) under new hauling contracts starting March 30.LiNeBrEaKOne contractor, Seattle-based CleanScapes, is buying 40 CNG trucks and building a fueling stop in Georgetown. The other, transcontinental giant Waste Management, is buying 106 trucks to be fueled in South Park. LiNeBrEaKWaste Management's territory will be South and Northwest Seattle, while CleanScapes will cover the northeast and central areas of the city.LiNeBrEaKThis is the second municipal-waste contract for CleanScapes, which runs diesel-powered trucks in Shoreline. President Chris Martin founded his cleaning company in 1997, inspired by the debris in his Pioneer Square neighborhood.LiNeBrEaKA 2008 city ordinance requires the two firms to use either biodiesel or CNG.LiNeBrEaKMartin said the new engines make less noise than diesel engines, especially in the hilly central city. "CNG allows us to operate more quietly at night in those dense, mixed-use areas."LiNeBrEaKWaste Management has more than 600 natural-gas trucks in California, and the Seattle program is part of its national environmental initiative, said Susan Robinson, regional director for public-sector services. "We have a goal of reducing emissions associated with our fleet by 15 percent," she said.LiNeBrEaKCNG trucks are likely to reduce air-polluting particulates at least 90 percent compared with older diesel trucks. New diesel trucks are so clean that they roughly match CNG, said Dennis McLerran, executive director of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.LiNeBrEaKBut the CNG trucks still have an advantage in greenhouse gases, releasing 20 percent less than even the best diesel engines, he said.LiNeBrEaKNatural gas, once thought to be running out, is making a comeback because of better extraction technologies and the discovery of new reserves, McLerran said.LiNeBrEaKWaste Management showed off a new truck last week at a city-owned fueling depot beneath Interstate 90. "It's like filling up a big propane tank," said a supervisor, Steve Aiton. It took less than 20 minutes to fill four tanks atop the green truck to 3,600 pounds per square inch.LiNeBrEaKThe company says it will spend $29 million for trucks and $7. 5 million to build the fueling yard at South Park -- a "slow fill" station where gas is pumped for several hours or overnight. Slower pumping causes less friction and therefore less heat, allowing more gas to reach the tanks.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, garbage costs for the public are going up because of a combination of inflation and a mandatory food-recycling program.LiNeBrEaKMonthly rates will increase from $23 now to $29. 65 in April, a 29 percent boost, for a typical single-family home using a 32-gallon trash can and a 96-gallon yard-waste container. City leaders urge people to save by recycling, but a 20-gallon can will be costlier too, going from $13. 55 now to $17. 55.LiNeBrEaKIt's unclear how much of a role the fuel switch played in the increase.LiNeBrEaKBecause the firms made competitive bids, there was no city analysis of their internal costs, said Hans Van Dusen, a contracts manager for Seattle Public Utilities. A phone survey found residents were willing to pay more for quieter, cleaner trucks, he said.LiNeBrEaKBoth haulers predict that over the entire 10-year contract, their costs for CNG versus diesel will even out. Waste Management's trucks in Seattle are due for replacement anyway, Robinson said.LiNeBrEaKCleanScapes is predicting the fuel will be cheaper than diesel. Pierce Transit burned the equivalent of $1. 21 a gallon to run its all-CNG bus fleet last spring, while other bus agencies paid $4 for diesel.LiNeBrEaKMike Lindblom: 206-515-5631 or mlindblom@seattletimes.com	NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (92%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (90%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES (90%); WASTE MANAGEMENT and REMEDIATION SERVICES (90%); SOLID WASTE COLLECTION (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); MATERIALS RECOVERY and RECYCLING (89%); LANDFILLS (78%); COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (77%); AIR POLLUTION (77%); PARTICULATE MATTER (77%); AIR QUALITY (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); CONSTRUCTION (76%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); ORDINANCES (73%); TRUCKING (72%); BIOFUELS (72%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (70%); CIVIL AVIATION (68%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (67%)  		General  	SEATTLE, WA, USA (99%) WASHINGTON, USA (99%); CALIFORNIA, USA (75%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 31, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090131-SE-Seattle-s-garbage-trucks-to-run-on-natural-gas-0131  	Newspaper  	SE  	2009 Seattle Times

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	412 words  	Jan. 31--ALBANY -- A midwestern-based electric power company is suing the state to block a global warming program aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. LiNeBrEaKChicago-based Indeck Corinth is challenging the Department of Environmental Conservation over the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 10-state effort in the Northeast to limit emissions of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKRGGI is the nation's first "cap and trade" system meant to force down emissions of CO2, a known greenhouse gas that a growing international scientific consensus blames for global climate change.LiNeBrEaKStates in the program set a cap on total CO2 plant emissions beginning this year and are auctioning allowances that plants must have to cover emissions. New York joined RGGI's second auction Dec. 17.LiNeBrEaKIn a lawsuit filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in Saratoga County, Indeck claims DEC failed to set aside enough free allowances to protect power plants that have long-term contracts to sell power and cannot raise prices to cover the extra cost of RGGI.LiNeBrEaKIndeck's lawsuit claims the state illegally joined RGGI without approval from the state Legislature.LiNeBrEaK"We support the intent of the RGGI program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate the effects of global warming," said Indeck president Gerald F. DeNotto. "We simply believe the program is flawed."LiNeBrEaKIndeck sued over its natural gas-fired plant in Corinth. At about 450,000 tons a year, CO2 emissions at the Corinth plant would cost Indeck about $1. 3 million a year under RGGI, company spokesman Peter Barden said.LiNeBrEaKThe plant sells electricity under a 1995 contract with Con Edison that will not expire until 2015, and has no way under the contract to charge more, he said.LiNeBrEaKDEC set aside free allowances for 1. 5 million tons of CO2 to cover companies with long-term contracts, said state Climate Change Director Peter Iwanowicz.

Other ports are Chicago; Gary, Ind.; Duluth, Minn.; Milwaukee; and Superior, Wis.LiNeBrEaKTighter federal legislation is needed to control ballast water discharges to the Great Lakes from the seagoing ships, the Ohio Environmental Council said Thursday in a teleconference looking at the EPA report, Predicting Future Introductions of Nonindigenous Species to the Great Lakes. LiNeBrEaK"This is an urgent wake-up call that we need strong fedLiNeBrEaKeral legislation to plug the drain on any new introductions of exotic, invasive pests in Lake Erie," said spokeswoman Kristy Meyer of the statewide eco-group.LiNeBrEaKThe report looked at 58 potential invasive species. Computer modeling indicates that 14 of those species could easily establish a strong foothold in Lake Erie and shallow water areas of the other Great Lakes.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA report said that 107 foreign ships in 2006-2007 discharged 382 metric tons of ballast water to the Great Lakes.LiNeBrEaKBallast water is used to stabilize the weight of cargo ships. When cargo is unloaded, the substantial weight loss is balanced by bringing an equal weight of water aboard the ship in storage tanks. When the ship reaches a new port, the water from the previous port -- along with any organisms in the water -- is pumped out while new cargo is loaded.LiNeBrEaKThe Great Lakes will likely warm due to global warming and that would make the Great Lakes even more vulnerable to invasive species from the Black and Caspian seas in Russia that hitchhike rides in foreign freighters, the report said.LiNeBrEaKTo date, 185 known species of invasives have been found in the Great Lakes with a new invasive species being found every 28 weeks.LiNeBrEaKInvasive species including the zebra and quagga mussels cost the Great Lakes region about $5 billion a year, according to federal estimates.LiNeBrEaKThe threat at Toledo is especially severe because of the large volume of ballast water discharges, and the welcoming Lake Erie habitat that invasive species would find, Meyer said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are disheartened by Ohio's tighter rules and feel that even-stricter federal rules are needed to curtail the threat, she said.LiNeBrEaKThe Ohio rules, implemented last month, require ships to either exchange their coastal ballast water with open ocean water or to flush their ballast holds with saltwater.LiNeBrEaKThe fear is that many species can survive in freshwater and saltwater, and stricter rules requiring chemical treatment, chlorine, ozone treatment, filters or heat are needed to assure better protection, Meyer said.LiNeBrEaKThe federal report is available at http://www.theoec.org.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Main Edition	Environmental virtue, trauma care, emissions  	JIM WOOTEN; Staff  	@ISSUE; Pg. 18A  	820 words  	Thinking Right's weekend free-for-all. Pick a topic:LiNeBrEaK* When global warming threatens to destroy life on this planet, as Al Gore would have us believe, rush to the intersection of North Highland and Virginia Avenue in Atlanta. That's now a "carbon-neutral zone." In a carbon-neutral zone, the owners of small businesses can feel environmentally virtuous and be identified as such, for fees ranging from $10 a year for a small sweet shop to $600 for a restaurant. It's the environmental version of the good feeling you get for slipping a few coins to a panhandler.LiNeBrEaK* Absolutely, with all deliberate speed the Georgia General Assembly should pass legislation proposed by state Sen. Preston Smith (R-Rome) to make the board of the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council advisory. Quick, yes, advisory. Board members have too many competing agendas. Their primary one should be to help the director, Mack Crawford, accomplish a difficult job without unlimited access to the public treasury. LiNeBrEaK* I've never understood why it's vital to know who owns my mortgage, so long as I have a competent servicing representatives and my payments are properly recorded. Every time I hear a complaint about the inability to determine the actual mortgage-holder, I'm inclined to believe some deadbeat's looking for a loophole to avoid paying an honest debt.LiNeBrEaK* UGA's women gymnastics coach Suzanne Yoculan thinks she's being kept out of the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame because she's sharing a home with Don Leeburn, a powerful member of the Georgia Board of Regents who's still married to somebody else. OK. Reason enough. Next self-declared victim?LiNeBrEaK* Letting California and 13 other states set their own limits on auto emissions does require automakers to build cars for each market, which is inherently inefficient. That, or as the Obama leftists hope, all cars are manufactured to California standards. If that's the regulation, auto companies should be paid from the public till. This is a future problem, incidentally, with having government get in bed with private companies. Car companies become the manufacturing arms of interest-group political agendas.LiNeBrEaK* Survey sez! Sixty-nine percent of Georgians are willing to pay $25 per year or more to fund trauma hospitals statewide. Ah, but there's a catch. They mostly want the levy on somebody else --- with 74 percent supporting higher traffic fines (as Gov. Sonny Perdue proposes) and 61. 3 percent wanting additional taxes on gun sales. The latter prompts the question: Did anybody outside downtown Decatur, Rome, Marietta and Athens get polled? The question on whether people are willing to pay more for this or that should be phrased: "How much in higher taxes are you personally willing to pay to provide...?" Another option is to phrase it this way: "How much are you willing to tax interest groups seeking more of your money for their causes?"LiNeBrEaK* President Obama gets the first dividend check from the Axis of Evil on his new be-nice-and-hope foreign policy. Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defines "change" as abandoning Israel and apologizing to the Islamic world for past sins, while withdrawing U.S. military forces back to the homeland and presumably diverting them to police anti-Muslim hate speech. Live by the buzzword, die by the buzzword.LiNeBrEaK* State Rep. Austin Scott (R-Tifton) wants to be governor. Starting out that journey with a proposal to add a $10 tax to the purchase of auto tags is an odd way to solicit notice.LiNeBrEaK* If a bank's stock price is lower than its yield on a three-month CD and together they don't add up to 5, the economy's bad.LiNeBrEaK* It's not been widely noticed, but U.S. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is becoming an important figure in the conservative movement nationally. He's chairman of the House Republican Study Committee, which had offered a sound alternative to the massive social spending eruption that Pelosi Democrats are passing off as "economic stimulus." The study committee includes 108 of the 178 House Republicans, same as in the last Congress --- except that Republicans lost 20 seats in November. Of 22 Republican freshmen, 20 have joined the policy group Price chairs.LiNeBrEaK* Two coaches who deserved to be fired or removed and were: The one in Texas who had no second thoughts about allowing his girls team to beat another 100-0 and the one in Clayton County who allowed the Jonesboro High School dance team to perform a provocative halftime dance in thigh-high stockings, tiny shorts and tight shirts. The dance team has been disbanded, a proper response from school officials.LiNeBrEaKjwooten@ajc.comLiNeBrEaK* Jim Wooten is associate editorial page editor. His column appears Friday, Sunday and Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKWith Jim Wooten's pending retirement, the AJC is seeking a full-time conservative columnist and editorial board member and has opened the search to the public. The deadline for submission of writing samples and other information is Feb. 1.LiNeBrEaKLearn more at ajc.com/newcolumnist.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Final Edition	U.K. urges Texas to address global warming  	Asher Price American-Statesman staff  	METRO; Pg. B06  	491 words  	They came not with crumpets but with PowerPoints, and they served not bangers and mash but breakfast tacos. Yet on Thursday an auditorium at the Capitol rang with the unmistakable accents of Brits and at one point was graced with an appearance - on videotape - by Prince Charles. LiNeBrEaKThe occasion was a conference on business risks and opportunities in a carbon-constrained world hosted by the United Kingdom's Houston consulate and the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKThe conference, attended by legislative aides, corporate officers and green energy entrepreneurs, was designed to urge Texas lawmakers to address global warming and brief businesses on how they can exploit caps on carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK"At the risk of being a damned nuisance, I want to encourage you to assume a leadership role in creating a pro-business Texas model that lays the foundation for the state to " successfully compete in the coming low-carbon world economy," Prince Charles said in a video address, taped Jan. 22 at St. James's Palace in London.LiNeBrEaKEarnest as the event was, it had the risk of appearing presumptuous in a statehouse whose lawmakers tend to look askance at stepping in line with any other state or nation.LiNeBrEaKThe danger was one the organizers clearly recognized: "We're not in any sense here to present solutions to Texas or tell you what to do," Paul Lynch, the consul general, told an audience of about 200.LiNeBrEaKJim Marston, the head of the Austin office of the Environmental Defense Fund, explained the hosting partnership this way:LiNeBrEaK"We both have funny accents that people in other states can't understand. The Brits have royalty, and some people in Texas think they are royalty."LiNeBrEaKMore seriously, he said, both places have a large oil production industry and have to grapple with external carbon regulations - in the U.K.'s case, from the European Union; in Texas' case, the prospect of federal rules. British businesses have had to figure out ways to prosper under a carbon-counting regime.LiNeBrEaKThere exist no state or federal caps on carbon dioxide emissions, which have been linked to global warming. Washington appears to be edging toward such limits, but key Texas lawmakers and the governor have spurned them, saying they could unfairly punish the state's industries and derail the state's economy.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming legislation got little traction during the 2007 legislative session, and that's unlikely to change, said Jurgen Schmandt , a professor emeritus at the LBJ School of Public Affairs , where he specialized in environmental regulation. He said the state should engage in federal carbon policymaking, in part to steer it in a way that won't harm Texas businesses.LiNeBrEaKThe conference was part of a series of efforts in Texas and around the globe by Britain's foreign office.LiNeBrEaK"What makes this different from other environmental issues is that it's not local: You can't divorce what happens in the U.S. from what happens in the U.K.," Lynch said.LiNeBrEaKasherprice@statesman.com; 445-3643	LEGISLATORS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (89%); GOVERNORS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (76%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (76%); EMISSIONS (76%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); EMBASSIES and CONSULATES (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (75%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (75%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (73%); ECONOMIC NEWS (68%)  			TEXAS, USA (96%) UNITED STATES (96%); UNITED KINGDOM (94%); EUROPE (79%); EUROPEAN UNION (72%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (72%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved  	ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE (57%)  	PRINCE CHARLES (91%)  														
Buffalo News (New York) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   ONLINE EDITION	Finding a place in the community  	By Amy Moritz  	BLOGS; Journey to the Finish Line  	553 words  	Yes, it was a bit cruel. I was supposed to bring back sunshine and warmer temperatures and instead upon my return from Miami, Buffalo was hit with another round of what seems to be endless winter storms.LiNeBrEaKMy apologies to my friends who were counting on the sun. I guess it was confiscated in my checked luggage. Next time, I'll be sure to pack it in my carry-on.LiNeBrEaKGetting back to reality from a few days away is always challenging, particularly for someone like me, who still hasn't fully unpacked from the trip. It's even more difficult when changing climates. What, I need hat and gloves to run outside? My footing may not be solid? LiNeBrEaKYes, I know. Poor me.LiNeBrEaKBut one of the great things upon my return is getting back in touch with friends.LiNeBrEaKI had coffee with Sarah after swim practice the other day. We met through our coach and during last year's training session at Lake Placid. She is amazing, having completed Ironman Lake Placid twice and recently setting a PR at Ironman Arizona.LiNeBrEaKSarah kicks some serious butt.LiNeBrEaKThis was the first time in a long time we got to chat in person and the conversation included details about my run in Miami and her recent Ironman triumph. Sarah was sure to remind me not to downplay my accomplishments -- an easy trap to get into, especially when you're feeling the pain of a half marathon and she, um, ran an Ironman in about 11 hours.LiNeBrEaKBut we also talked about lifestyle. About how some days we have to forgo the night out because we have an early morning training session the next day. Or how we think more about what we eat, even if we've moved away from the OCD of over-the-top nutrition fears into an approach of more moderation.LiNeBrEaKI have friends of all ilks and I cherish all of them, but the ones who end up staying prominent in my life tend to be the ones who are passionated about something. It can be running or triathlon or work or family, but there is something in their life that gets them out of bed in the morning. Connecting with Sarah over coffee in a post-swim workout haze helped me to see how many of those people I have in my life.LiNeBrEaKOf the many things that becoming an athlete has given me, a new circle of friends is pretty high on the list. Sounds obvious, but not always. I never was much of a "joiner" nor did I do well in groups. (I hated group work in school. I would much rather do a project independently.) The more I find people to train with-- either through happenstance or through joining an organized group -- the more connected I feel.LiNeBrEaKIt's more than just about companionship on a long run, although I'm not knocking the company. It's about feeling part of something a bit bigger than yourself. It's about feeding off the energy of other people and having them pull you along when the doubts grow strong. It's about connecting to their stories and having a feeling that your story is finally clear to someone other than the voices living inside your own head.LiNeBrEaKI have a few more days of recovery left, which includes 45 minutes of light spinning and swim workouts. Then it's back to preparations for the Buffalo Marathon.LiNeBrEaKI'll cherish the stories that people tell me of their first marathon experience, or best or worst marathon experience for that matter. Hearing those stories, having those friends, means I'm part of a community now.LiNeBrEaKAnd I'm starting to feel like I belong.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	The Insider: Rich Gordon mulls Assembly run  	BAY AREA NEWS GROUP  	NEWS  	522 words  	Rich Gordon confirmed Thursday that he is exploring the possibility of running for state Assemblyman Ira Ruskin's seat in 2010, when Ruskin will be termed out.LiNeBrEaKGordon is serving his third and final term on the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors. He too will be termed out in 2010, and his thoughts have turned to the future. LiNeBrEaK"I'm in the middle of an exploratory process, talking to friends and supporters of mine to determine if it's something I can really do," said Gordon, confirming a recent newspaper report that suggested he was eyeing Ruskin's 21st District seat.LiNeBrEaKRuskin's district straddles the border between San Mateo County and Santa Clara County. It includes such San Mateo County cities as Atherton, East Palo Alto, San Carlos and Woodside. It also counts Los Altos, Los Gatos and Palo Alto as part of its territory.LiNeBrEaKGordon said that, since he's not well-known in Santa Clara County, he is "making contact with people there to see what kind of support and interest there would be."LiNeBrEaKGordon said he's not aware of anyone else from San Mateo County who's interested in running for Ruskin's seat. Jerry Hill, his former colleague on the board of supervisors, moved to Sacramento last fall after winning the race for the vacated seat of former Assemblyman Gene Mullin, D-South San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKAs for Santa Clara County, Gordon said he's heard that Hal Plotkin, a member of the board of trustees for the Foothill-De Anza Community College District, is "very serious about it and he'll probably run."LiNeBrEaKGordon said he plans to make a decision on whether to run within 45 days.LiNeBrEaKSpeier gets greener: Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, has added a third committee assignment to her congressional workload.LiNeBrEaKThe San Mateo County Democrat announced Thursday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tapped her for the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, which was created in 2007 to focus specifically on strategies to wean America off foreign oil and seek "permanent reductions in emissions and other activities that contribute to climate change and global warming."LiNeBrEaKSpeir also serves on the Financial Services Committee and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.LiNeBrEaK"Global climate change is the most pressing concern facing our planet," Speier said in a statement. "Future generations will judge us on how we respond to this awesome challenge.LiNeBrEaK"It is crucial that we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and work toward a more sustainable society," Speier added. "The good news is, green technologies are the economic engine of the future that will provide good, long-term, skilled jobs and many of these innovative companies are housed here in the Bay Area."LiNeBrEaKSpeier will be in Daly City on Monday morning at Fernando Rivera Intermediate School for a news conference on the effect the federal economic stimulus bill is expected to have on local schools. Speier's office estimates that schools in the 12th Congressional District, which includes the middle and northern portions of San Mateo County, will receive a total of more than $60 million under the bill.LiNeBrEaKFor more of the Insider, visit www.ibabuzz.com/insider .

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	Oakland Tribune letters  	Letters from our readers  	LETTERS  	686 words  	Great driversLiNeBrEaKYOU REALLY have to hand it to AC Transit to have such wonderful drivers. My heart goes out, especially to those courteous ladies who drive the night shifts.LiNeBrEaKI had just come from Youth Uprising Center in East Oakland, where we were setting up a youth theater, and took two buses home.LiNeBrEaKEach was driven by a woman of impeccable charm and courtesy, not to mention total professional aplomb. Oakland and AC Transit should be very, very proud of these ladies. LiNeBrEaKPeter GarlandLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKToo expensiveLiNeBrEaKRECENTLY, ALONG with some late Christmas cards, I received a picture of myself in the mail with a link to a video of me.LiNeBrEaKMy excitement was quickly dampened when I found that a robot camera in Emeryville took it. It showed me looking left for traffic and then turning right on a red light.LiNeBrEaKMy speed was under 15 mph, the date was Dec. 22, the fine   a little over $400. LiNeBrEaKWe have all seen camera controlled intersections debated here. After reviewing the video, I have to admit my guilt. I was at fault because I did not technically come to a complete stop.LiNeBrEaKBut this is not the point of my letter today.LiNeBrEaKWho has not had to wait while people blatantly run lights? It is terrible and unsafe. But turning right on a red on a slow roll is something that if a real cop stopped me might have reviewed my clean driving record and given me a speech instead of a summons.LiNeBrEaKOr perhaps the fact that I, like many, have been laid off for almost a year now and have used up my unemployment benefits months ago when have tempered his judgment to issue a $400 ticket for such a minor infraction.LiNeBrEaKWhy am I whining? I broke the law and got caught.LiNeBrEaKMy point is that in the small enclave of shopping centers and malls that is the new Emeryville there are three of these photo ticket lights, as many as in its larger sprawling community of Berkeley. The fine is excessive, over $100 more than the same infraction across the bridge in San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKThis is an obvious scheme orchestrated by Emeryville to add money to their pockets at the expense of the unsuspecting shopper who ventures into their web.LiNeBrEaKI used to shop in the Emeryville area at least three times a week and I have not been back since getting this missive from Emeryville (which interestingly is processed in Arizona), and I do not intend to return.LiNeBrEaKMost of the stores in the Emeryville area can are more safely visited at other locations. If you do venture into the area, beware, big brother is watching.LiNeBrEaKPhil BrayLiNeBrEaKEl CerritoLiNeBrEaKExcitingLiNeBrEaKTHIS IS in response to the Jan. 26 article, "Obama examines environmental polices of Bush-era".LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has consistently led the way when it comes to global warming and clean energy initiatives, but our efforts were stymied by the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKAfter being stuck in reverse for eight years when it comes to clean energy and global warming policy, President Barack Obama's announcements have taken America from 0 to 60 in six days.LiNeBrEaKFrom here on, science and not special interests will be in the driver's seat in America. With the waiver reconsideration, Californian can look forward to cleaner cars and cleaner air.LiNeBrEaKIt is exciting that Obama is taking seriously protecting our environment and at the same time creating jobs.LiNeBrEaKJeremy MillsLiNeBrEaKFederal Field AssociateLiNeBrEaKEnvironment CaliforniaLiNeBrEaKSan FranciscoLiNeBrEaKFree pressLiNeBrEaKTHANKS VERY much to Editor Martin Reynolds for his excellent reminder that there is a reason why freedom of the press is one of the key liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. (Column, "Journalism holds key to sustaining democracy," Jan. 23).LiNeBrEaKWithout investigative journalists at work in our society, our liberties are at extreme risk.LiNeBrEaKAs the Chauncey Bailey Project has shown here in Oakland, the vigilance of a free press can help focus light on our governmental systems.LiNeBrEaKWe need more, not less, of this kind of strong investigative journalism at all levels of our society. However, because newspapers are forced to cut staff, we are seeing less and not more of this type of effective journalism.LiNeBrEaKThe League of Women Voters continues to give strong support to our First Amendment rights.LiNeBrEaKHelen HutchisonLiNeBrEaKPresident, League of Women Voters of Oakland	LETTERS and COMMENTS (93%); URBAN BUS SYSTEMS (90%); TRAFFIC SIGNALS (73%); CHRISTMAS (70%); UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE (64%); LAYOFFS (64%); RETAILERS (62%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (92%); SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); ARIZONA, USA (66%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 31, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Home Final Edition	POLLUTION CONTROLS;  Instead of cleaning up, coal plant might close 	Kevin Mayhood and Spencer Hunt, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	BUSINESS; Pg. 10C  	622 words  	An Ohio power company says it might close a Belmont County plant instead of installing pollution controls costing $330 million.LiNeBrEaKClosing the R.E. Burger plant would eliminate as many as 105 jobs.LiNeBrEaKDespite that, environmental advocates said a decision to close the plant would be a victory in the battle against climate change and the millions of tons of carbon dioxide that coal-fired power plants emit every year.LiNeBrEaK"This underscores everything we've been saying," said Bruce Nilles, director of the Sierra Club's National Coal Campaign. "Coal, all of a sudden, with all the costs included, doesn't make any sense." LiNeBrEaKThe issue isn't as simple as clean air versus jobs.LiNeBrEaK"We have the money" to install scrubbers, said Ellen Raines, spokeswoman for Akron-based FirstEnergy. "We need more time to decide whether it makes sense in this economy to invest $330 million in this facility."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to installing expensive scrubbers, Nilles lists expected new costs to limit mercury, handle coal ash and install systems that would capture carbon dioxide and inject it deep underground.LiNeBrEaKAnd, according to the federal government, FirstEnergy won't be able to count these emission reductions against expected regulations to limit climate-changing emissions.LiNeBrEaKFirstEnergy is one of six Midwestern and Southern power companies sued by the Clinton administration and Northeastern states in 1999 for violating the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKFirstEnergy agreed to close or clean the Burger plant in a 2005 settlement and to notify the government of its decision by Dec. 31, 2008. The company will be in U.S. District Court in Columbus today seeking an April 15 deadline.LiNeBrEaKThe settlement called for FirstEnergy to reduce emissions at the W.H. Sammis Plant in Stratton, Jefferson County; the Burger plant near Shadyside; the Eastlake plant near Cleveland; and the Bruce Mansfield Plant in Shippingport, Pa., by a total of 212,000 tons annually. The cost is expected to exceed $1. 5 billion.LiNeBrEaKEric Schaeffer, former chief of environmental regulation at the U.S. EPA, who helped put together the suits, has said power companies fought them because of the high costs of installing pollution controls. Delaying the installation saved them millions each year.LiNeBrEaKThe Sammis plant was called one of the nation's largest sources of pollution, annually emitting 205,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and smog-causing nitrous oxides. The plant's emissions will be cut 80 percent.LiNeBrEaKThe deadline to install scrubbers on two coal-fired boilers at Burger or close the plant is Dec. 31, 2010.LiNeBrEaKLarry Merry, director of the Belmont County Port Authority, said local government officials have known for more than a month that the plant might close. LiNeBrEaK"It would be a tremendous hit on the local economy," Merry said. "It's bad enough the 105 or so jobs would be lost, but there are all these other things that add to it."LiNeBrEaKMerry said the plant frequently hires construction crews for maintenance work and truck drivers who deliver coal, and buys some of its coal from county mines.LiNeBrEaKAttorneys for the federal government and the states said FirstEnergy has had nearly four years to figure this out, and the company needs to make the decision now.LiNeBrEaKFirstEnergy, which has 13 power plants in Ohio, reported $12. 8 billion in revenue in 2007. After a sluggish second quarter this year, the company reported its third-quarter profit rose 14 percent, to $471 million, in part because of record power generation, according to published reports.LiNeBrEaKkmayhood@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKshunt@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKBox Story: R.E.

But sales of the Hershey variety chocolate that is more economically priced has really gone through the roof.LiNeBrEaKI have seen a number of M and M commercials prompting people to buy M and M's for their Super Bowl parties.

Daily News (New York) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	JAILED CIA FINK PUSHED SON TO SPY, SEZ FBI  	BY James Gordon Meek  	NEWS; Pg. 19  	325 words  	WASHINGTON - A convicted CIA turncoat was accused yesterday of recruiting his own family from behind bars to spy for Russia.LiNeBrEaKHarold Nicholson, a CIA operations officer for 16 years, was slapped with a 23-year prison stretch in 1997 for spying for Russia's secret intelligence agency, the SVR. LiNeBrEaKU.S. officials later took pity on Nicholson by moving him to a prison near his parents and three kids in Oregon - where he recruited his adult son Nathaniel to pass secrets to Russia, prosecutors said.LiNeBrEaKNathaniel Nicholson, 24, was "trained and tasked" as a spy by his father in order to pass secrets to his handlers that revealed how the FBI originally nabbed the ex-CIA operative.LiNeBrEaKThe son collected $41,000 from the Russians for his father's "past espionage activities," court documents say. "Nicholson utilized his CIA training in instructing [his son Nathaniel] on how to collect the funds from the Russian Federation in a covert and secret manner," prosecutors charged.LiNeBrEaKHe also allegedly conned his parents into hiding the cash; the FBI also said he had hinted to the Russians that another son "may hold some future value" as a traitor. The FBI disclosed that son Jeremiah Nicholson is married to a Russian and serves as a sergeant in the Air Force "with a security clearance."LiNeBrEaKEspionage is the FBI's No. 2 priority behind terrorism, since "global warming has not ended activities of the Cold War," quipped retired top agent Tom Fuentes.LiNeBrEaKThe new case began in 2002, when a citizen tipped the FBI that an imprisoned bank robber had told her Nicholson was trying to communicate with Russian spies.LiNeBrEaKStarting in 2007, Nathaniel Nicholson met Russian agents in Mexico, Peru and Cyprus, where he accepted the cash for passing messages from his dad.LiNeBrEaKThe often comical caper - in which Nathaniel Nicholson traded coded e-mails as "Dick" to a handler named "Nancy" - ended in December 2008 outside a TGI Fridays in Cyprus, where he received a final payment, the papers charge.

Daily Oklahoman  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Democrats, GOP can each claim a winning position  	The Oklahoman, Oklahoma City  	COMMENTARY  	519 words  	Jan. 30--Democrats and Republicans got what they wanted in Wednesday's congressional vote on President Barack Obama's $819 billion economic stimulus package.LiNeBrEaKHouse Democrats won the vote and handed their president his first big legislative victory. Throughout the process, they flexed their majority's muscle and got passage on their terms. "We won the election," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said days before the vote, "we wrote the bill." That they did. LiNeBrEaKDemocrats have a healthy numerical edge in the House and didn't need any Republican votes to pass the legislation. Good thing. They didn't get even one. In that, the GOP got what it wanted. Democrats own the bad economy and Washington's remedy for it.LiNeBrEaKBetter, Republicans can claim opposition to the mix of tax cuts and spending was principled, not obstructionist because so much of the spending is a familiar stew of accumulated Democratic spending priorities with tenuous, at best, connection to rapidly stimulating the economy.LiNeBrEaKThe list of pork spending, boondoggles and pet projects will become better known as the legislation oozes toward the Senate. Republicans say just 12 cents of every dollar in the bill has any stimulus value. "Democrats have turned the 647-page stimulus legislation into an excuse for something that never needs an excuse -- an exercise in wretched excess," writes syndicated columnist George Will. The Wall Street Journal called the bill "a political wonder that manages to spend money on just about every pent-up Democratic proposal of the last 40 years."LiNeBrEaKSome lowlights: $50 million to the National Endowment for the Arts, which apparently is one of the few government-funded entities without its own job-training program. Maybe it will start one. The bill contains $600 million for new cars for the federal fleet. There's $136 billion for new government programs that will slide right into the federal budget baseline for years to come.LiNeBrEaKThe Journal notes that $2 billion is earmarked for childcare subsidies, $400 million for global warming research (didn't Democrats declare the issue settled years ago?) and $650 million to pay for digital TV conversion coupons. Where's the stimulus?LiNeBrEaKMaybe the Senate will improve things. Obama gave lip service to gaining Republican support in the House. Perhaps charm will be a better currency in the other body. The fact is the Democrat-authored legislation was closed to GOP input, and while Obama heard the minority's concerns he didn't act on any of them.LiNeBrEaKIn that, Republicans will reclaim their fiscally conservative brand. It's a gamble. If the economy perks up, they'll pay politically. If it doesn't, they can utter four of the best words heard in Washington: We told you so.

The Denver Post 		January 30, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	God doesn't play favorites  	Mark Kiszla Denver Post Staff Columnist  	SPORTS; Pg. C-01  	762 words  	TAMPA, FLA.LiNeBrEaK- If heaven has a rooting interest in the Super Bowl, then Bible-thumping, touchdown-LiNeBrEaKtossing quarterback Kurt Warner and his conclave of Arizona Cardinals must be a lock to win. No?LiNeBrEaK"One of the funniest questions I've heard during my time at the Super Bowl is: Do you think Kurt Warner is God's favorite quarterback?" said Pittsburgh defensive star Aaron Smith, himself a man of faith. "I don't think God has any favorites."LiNeBrEaKFor many Americans, football is a religious experience. In stadiums throughout the land, devout fans clap their hands and lift voices as one. LiNeBrEaKNobody passes the football and praises the Lord with more passion than Warner. He thanks Jesus in victory. Loudly. Profusely. Repeatedly.LiNeBrEaKOn any given NFL Sunday, church and football mix in very public displays of faith, from an index finger pointed to the sky after TDs to the heads of sweaty players bowed in prayer at the 50-yard line after the game.LiNeBrEaKAnd it makes some people cringe.LiNeBrEaKWhy?LiNeBrEaK"I believe in God, but the other team is praying too. I always wanted to keep my faith to myself. I didn't want to throw it out there," said 69-year-old Billy Kilmer, one of the most ornery quarterbacks ever to strap on a helmet. "We always said the Lord's Prayer in the locker room after the game. That's fine and dandy. But the Lord is looking out for the other guy too. So the whole thing is kind of phony to me."LiNeBrEaKWhile an end-zone dance by Chad Johnson or a vicious hit by Ray Lewis will be telecast on an endless loop for 24 straight hours, using football as a bully pulpit to preach personal beliefs causes eyeballs to roll and microphones to click off faster than you can say "Amen."LiNeBrEaKMaybe the discomfort is caused because, next to sex, religion is the most personal topic we can share. Or perhaps in an uncertain world, it's disquieting to witness athletes so confident in Christian faith. With global warming on his plate, should God have time to worry about anything as superficial as the Cards being seven- point underdogs to Pittsburgh?LiNeBrEaK"I think people get uneasy with religion in football because they don't understand it. You look at scripture, and Jesus says the world will hate you for your faith," said Smith, a Northern Colorado alum who turned to religion a decade ago as a Steelers rookie, when he and his wife had difficulty putting down roots in a new city while dealing with the pressures of athletic stardom.LiNeBrEaKWhen Smith looks you square in the eye and declares how liberating it is to know sports fame is not the most important aspect of his life, you must believe him.LiNeBrEaKIn October, doctors discovered leukemia in the body of 4-year-old Elijah Smith. When a 6-foot-5, 298-pound man heard the diagnosis of his son's condition, the news hit so hard "I wanted to vomit," admitted the Steelers defensive end.LiNeBrEaKThe Smith family does not ask God for football miracles. After chemotherapy, young Elijah is strong enough to join his sisters in Florida for the Super Bowl.LiNeBrEaK"I couldn't have dealt with this challenge without my faith," Smith said.LiNeBrEaKWhile Dallas Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens might be the most outrageous character in the NFL, I would argue Warner is truly the most controversial figure in the league.LiNeBrEaKFor every fan inspired by the story of a two-time MVP who once stocked grocery shelves in Iowa, there seems to be somebody who discounts Warner as holier than thou.LiNeBrEaK"If we calculate God's presence strictly on the fact of winning and losing, then of course it's not going to work. It doesn't make sense. That's us trying to put God in this box," Warner said in the documentary movie "God in the Box."LiNeBrEaKAlthough sports achievement still is linked to purity of effort in modern American folklore, praying for victory is seldom as effective on the football field as a nasty chop block.LiNeBrEaK"I'm Catholic. I used to be an altar boy," said former Cardinals offensive lineman Conrad Dobler, accused of being the dirtiest player in NFL history. "There was no room to be an altar boy on the football field. Some of those defensive guys hated me. But it was never anything personal. My job was to put them on the ground. I was just doing my job."LiNeBrEaKOn any given Super Sunday, the commercials make us witnesses to cola wars, kicking Clydesdales and winners who believe the ultimate reward is going to Disney World.LiNeBrEaKSo should anybody be upset with an NFL quarterback who throws touchdowns in the name of Jesus?LiNeBrEaKIt's just another pitch.LiNeBrEaKMark Kiszla: 303-954-1053 or mkiszla@denverpost.comLiNeBrEaKIn his words.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	Waco legislator Averitt calls for green energy incentives  	Matthew Tresaugue, Houston Chronicle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	594 words  	Jan. 30--Texas, once cool to global warming, should be part of any federal effort to tackle the issue, the likely chairman of the state Senate's powerful natural resources committee said Thursday.LiNeBrEaKSen. Kip Averitt, a Waco Republican, called for state regulators to be involved as President Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress shape legislation to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaK"We have more to lose than anybody," he said at a news conference in Austin. "If and when the federal government does something, Texas needs to be at the table." LiNeBrEaKAveritt made the request as part of a sweeping energy bill that also calls for incentives for new emissions-reducing technology, rebates for the purchase of plug-in hybrid vehicles and more stringent building codes to promote energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and business leaders said they support Averitt's bill, which is based on market-oriented approaches rather than more regulation.LiNeBrEaK"The fact that it's the likely chairman of the natural resources committee gives it a lot of promise that it lacked in the past," said Jim Marston, director of the Environmental Defense Fund's Texas office.LiNeBrEaKWhile the proposed legislation doesn't guarantee that Texas will be part of any federal talks on climate change, it is a recognition that the state should be engaged.LiNeBrEaKFor years, the Republican-controlled Legislature has spurned several efforts to deal directly with global warming. That's because the state is America's power plant and gas pump and thus leads the nation, by far, in emissions of heat-trapping gasses that contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaKGov. Rick Perry, for one, has warned that mandatory carbon caps could cripple the state's energy-dependent economy. During his State of the State speech Tuesday, he again took a confrontational stance with an "increasingly activist" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKFair carbon taxLiNeBrEaKBut Jurgen Schmandt, a distinguished fellow at the Houston Advanced Research Center, said Texas needs some influence in Washington to ensure that increased costs of regulation don't harm the state. Texas, for example, could push for a carbon tax on consumers nationwide rather than one that would penalize the state's high concentration of refineries and chemical plants, he said.LiNeBrEaKVictor Flatt, a University of Houston law professor who has studied environmental legislation, said that states can't afford to wait on the federal government to act.LiNeBrEaK"Those states that adopt some kind of greenhouse-gas requirement or restriction will see some kind of benefit" in federal deliberations, Flatt told a gathering of corporate officials, environmentalists and lawmakers in Austin Thursday. "When you stay out of the game, you lose that first-mover advantage."LiNeBrEaKAveritt's bill would allow state regulators to develop a registry to track emissions of greenhouse gases -- a prelude to reducing emissions and getting credit for the change.LiNeBrEaKSeveral states have taken similar steps. Texas completed a greenhouse-gas inventory in 2002, but ignored EPA's request to regularly report its carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKmatthew.tresaugue@chron.com	ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (77%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); ENERGY REGULATION (77%); TAXES and TAXATION (77%); POWER PLANTS (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (74%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (74%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (74%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (74%); HYBRID VEHICLES (71%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (69%); PETROCHEMICAL MFG (64%); LAW SCHOOLS (63%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (61%); PRESS CONFERENCES (55%); SALES REBATES (54%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (53%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)  		Crime/law  	AUSTIN, TX, USA (92%); HOUSTON, TX, USA (90%) TEXAS, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090130-HO-Waco-legislator-Averitt-calls-for-green-energy-incentives-0130  	Newspaper  	HO  	2009 The Houston Chronicle   	ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE (55%)  	BARACK OBAMA (58%); RICK PERRY (53%)

LiNeBrEaKNATO commanders and lawmakers meeting in Iceland's capital said the Arctic thaw is bringing the prospect of new standoffs between powerful nations.LiNeBrEaK"I would be the last one to expect military conflict - but there will be a military presence," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told reporters. "It should be a military presence that is not overdone, and there is a need for political cooperation and economic cooperation."LiNeBrEaKStrained relationsLiNeBrEaKThe opening up of Arctic sea routes threatens to complicate delicate relations between countries with competing claims to Arctic territory - particularly as exploration for oil and natural gas becomes possible.LiNeBrEaKDe Hoop Scheffer said negotiations involving Russia, NATO and other nations will be key to preventing a future conflict. The NATO chief is expected to meet Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov next week for talks.LiNeBrEaKThe United States, Russia and Canada are among the countries attempting to claim jurisdiction over Arctic territory alongside Nordic nations. Analysts say China is also likely to join a rush to capture energy reserves.LiNeBrEaK"Several Arctic rim countries are strengthening their capabilities, and military activity in the High North region has been steadily increasing," de Hoop Scheffer told delegates.LiNeBrEaKLarger presenceLiNeBrEaKSome scientists predict that Arctic waters could be ice-free in summers by 2013, decades earlier than previously thought. De Hoop Scheffer said trans-Arctic routes are likely to become an alternative to passage through the Suez or Panama canals for commercial shipping.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is not a fanciful idea, it is already a reality, a reality that brings with it certain new challenges, including for NATO," de Hoop Scheffer said.LiNeBrEaKThe NATO chief said an upsurge in energy exploration - and the likelihood of more commercial ships needing emergency rescue - would require a larger NATO presence in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"The end of the Cold War resulted in a marked reduction in military activity in the High North - Iceland would like it to stay that way," Iceland's outgoing Prime Minister Geir Haarde told the conference.LiNeBrEaKLee Willett, head of the maritime studies program at the Royal United Services Institute said that as routes open up, warships from nations seeking to defend claims on energy resources will follow.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 30, 2009 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Waco legislator calls for green incentives;  Republican's energy bill urges state to join fight on climate change 	MATTHEW TRESAUGUE, Staff  	B; Pg. 2  	519 words  	Texas, once cool to global warming, should be part of any federal effort to tackle the issue, the likely chairman of the state Senate's powerful natural resources committee said Thursday. LiNeBrEaKSen. Kip Averitt, a Waco Republican, called for state regulators to be involved as President Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress shape legislation to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaK"We have more to lose than anybody," he said at a news conference in Austin. "If and when the federal government does something, Texas needs to be at the table."LiNeBrEaKAveritt made the request as part of a sweeping energy bill that also calls for incentives for new emissions-reducing technology, rebates for the purchase of plug-in hybrid vehicles and more stringent building codes to promote energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and business leaders said they support Averitt's bill, which is based on market-oriented approaches rather than more regulation.LiNeBrEaK"The fact that he's the likely chairman of the natural resources committee gives it a lot of promise that it lacked in the past," said Jim Marston, director of the Environmental Defense Fund's Texas office.LiNeBrEaKWhile the proposed legislation doesn't guarantee that Texas will be part of any federal talks on climate change, it is a recognition that the state should be engaged.LiNeBrEaKFor years, the Republican-controlled Legislature has spurned several efforts to deal directly with global warming. That's because the state is America's power plant and gas pump and thus leads the nation, by far, in emissions of heat-trapping gasses that contribute to climate change.LiNeBrEaKGov. Rick Perry, for one, has warned that mandatory carbon caps could cripple the state's energy-dependent economy. During his State of the State speech Tuesday, he again took a confrontational stance with an "increasingly activist" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKFair carbon taxLiNeBrEaKBut Jurgen Schmandt, a distinguished fellow at the Houston Advanced Research Center, said Texas needs some influence in Washington to ensure that increased costs of regulation don't harm the state. Texas, for example, could push for a carbon tax on consumers nationwide rather than one that would penalize the state's high concentration of refineries and chemical plants, he said.LiNeBrEaKVictor Flatt, a University of Houston law professor who has studied environmental legislation, said that states can't afford to wait on the federal government to act.LiNeBrEaK"Those states that adopt some kind of greenhouse-gas requirement or restriction will see some kind of benefit" in federal deliberations, Flatt told a gathering of corporate officials, environmentalists and lawmakers in Austin Thursday. "When you stay out of the game, you lose that first-mover advantage."LiNeBrEaKAveritt's bill would allow state regulators to develop a registry to track emissions of greenhouse gases - a prelude to reducing emissions and getting credit for the change.LiNeBrEaKSeveral states have taken similar steps. Texas completed a greenhouse-gas inventory in 2002, but ignored EPA's request to regularly report its carbon emissions.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	Evolution war still rages 200 years after Darwin's birth  	By Robert S. Boyd, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1029 words  	WASHINGTON _ Two centuries after Charles Darwin's birth on Feb. 12, 1809, people still argue passionately about his theory of evolution.LiNeBrEaKWas Darwin right? Should schoolchildren be exposed to contrary views in science class? These two controversies continue to rage, partly because both sides are evenly matched.LiNeBrEaKMost scientists and courts that have ruled on the matter say that overwhelming evidence backs Darwin's explanation of the origin and evolution of species, including humans, by natural selection. LiNeBrEaKMany people, especially religious and social conservatives, strongly disagree.LiNeBrEaKAmong them are "creationists," who take literally the Genesis story that God created the world and mankind in six days no more than 10,000 years ago. Others support "intelligent design," the idea that life is too complex to have arisen without a supernatural "designer," presumably God.LiNeBrEaKPublic opinion surveys consistently have shown that Americans are deeply divided over evolution. The most recent Gallup poll on the issue, in June 2007, found that 49 percent of those surveyed said they believed in evolution and 48 percent said they didn't. Those percentages have stayed almost even for at least 25 years.LiNeBrEaKGallup found a political angle to the split. Two-thirds of Republicans rejected Darwin's theory, while majorities of Democrats and political independents accepted it.LiNeBrEaKA Harris poll published last December found that more people believe in a devil, hell and angels than in evolution.LiNeBrEaKThe controversy is most acute in the public schools, where conservatives want evolution banished from science classes or at least described as "a theory, not a fact."LiNeBrEaKDarwin's supporters counter that to scientists a theory isn't just a guess or a hypothesis but a widely accepted explanation of natural events supported by the best available evidence.LiNeBrEaKAt a recent hearing before Texas' State Board of Education, scientists and social conservatives exchanged fiery arguments over a rule that requires science textbooks to cover "the strengths and weaknesses" of evolutionary theory.LiNeBrEaKDarwin critics control seven of the 15 seats on the board and have the support of Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The chairman of the board, Don McLeroy, a dentist, is a creationist who believes that the Earth is only thousands of years old, not billions as most scientists think. The board will decide the issue in March.LiNeBrEaKLouisiana's State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education adopted guidelines Jan. 15 that allow teachers to use "supplemental materials" that aren't in regular textbooks about "controversial" subjects such as evolution and global warming.LiNeBrEaKLouisiana's new rules "ensure the state's teachers their right to teach the scientific evidence both for and against Darwinian evolution," according to the Seattle-based Discovery Institute, the headquarters of the intelligent design movement.LiNeBrEaK"We fully expect to see the Discovery Institute's book, 'Explore Evolution,' popping up in school districts across the state," Barbara Forrest, a Darwin supporter in Hammond, La., told Science magazine.LiNeBrEaKThe Louisiana school board also eliminated language that had banned the teaching of creationism or intelligent design, saying that the ban is unnecessary.LiNeBrEaK"The creationists got what they wanted," said Patsye Peebles, a retired Louisiana science teacher.LiNeBrEaKThe opposition to the Discovery Institute is led by the National Center for Science Education, a pro-Darwin research center based in Oakland, Calif.LiNeBrEaKThe center contends that intelligent design is a subtle way to introduce religion into science education, which the courts consistently have declared unconstitutional.LiNeBrEaK"The phrase 'strengths and weaknesses' has been spread nationally as a slogan to bring creationism in through the back door," center executive director Eugenie Scott told the Texas school board.LiNeBrEaKSimilar proposals are pending or expected in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina, according to Glenn Branch, the deputy director of the National Center for Science Education.LiNeBrEaK"In a typical year, NCSE will be monitoring about 80 episodes of creationist activity in the United States and abroad," Branch said.LiNeBrEaK"This issue isn't going away," John West, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, wrote in an e-mail to his allies last May. "Although Darwinists are doing their best to shut down and intimidate anyone who raises questions about neo-Darwinism, we still have free speech, and they can't prevent people from hearing about the debate in the public arena, no matter how hard they try."LiNeBrEaKThe theory of evolution itself is evolving. Since Darwin's day, researchers have acquired powerful tools that revealed DNA's role in passing inheritance from generation to generation, something Darwin knew nothing about.LiNeBrEaKAround the middle of the 20th century, this led to the "Modern Synthesis," a major updating of evolutionary theory to accommodate new information. Many biologists are suggesting still another revision, which some call "Modern Synthesis 2. 0."LiNeBrEaKFor example, Darwin described evolution as the growth of a tree, the "Tree of Life." The tree began with a single, original organism at the root, with myriad species branching off from the trunk.LiNeBrEaKBiologists increasingly say that evolution resembles a web or a bush rather than a tree. Microbes constantly swap DNA. Hybrid plants and animals cross species lines, blurring sharp lines between species.LiNeBrEaK"We understand evolution pretty well," said W. Ford Doolittle, a Darwin supporter and biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "It's just that it's more complex than Darwin imagined."LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKDiscovery Institute: http://discovery.org/cscLiNeBrEaKNational Center for Science Education: http://www.ncseweb.org	EVOLUTION THEORY (91%); POLLS and SURVEYS (90%); CREATIONISM (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); CHILDREN (89%); EVIDENCE (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (89%); TEXTBOOKS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (87%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (85%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (85%); PRIMARY and SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (85%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (79%); MATH and SCIENCE EDUCATION (78%); RELIGION (75%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (73%); EDUCATION (69%); SCHOOL BOARDS (67%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (64%); PRIMARY and SECONDARY EDUCATION (64%); SECONDARY SCHOOLS (50%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			SEATTLE, WA, USA (79%) LOUISIANA, USA (92%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); EARTH (79%); TEXAS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	February 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090130-BC-SCI-EVOLUTION  	Newspaper  	WA  	2009 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   		RICK PERRY (52%)  		ARCHIVE GRAPHIC on MCT Direct (from MCT Graphics, 202-383-6064): 20080627 Darwin voyage					WASHINGTON   							
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	Space detectives delve into mystery of missing carbon  	Robert S. Boyd, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	864 words  	Jan. 30--WASHINGTON -- For years, scientists have been trying to solve what they call the "Mystery of the Missing Sinks."LiNeBrEaKNo, they're not talking about misplaced kitchenware. These "sinks" are the world's forests, pastures, crops and soil, which soak up the excess carbon -- in the form of carbon dioxide -- that's a major driver of global warming. Even golf courses and suburban lawns serve as carbon sinks.LiNeBrEaK"Humans dump about 9 million tons of carbon daily into the atmosphere, but only half stays there," said David Crisp, principal investigator for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory. LiNeBrEaKThe rest is returned to Earth, but where much of it ends up is uncertain. About a quarter of the recycled CO2 is drawn into the ocean, and land vegetation absorbs another quarter.LiNeBrEaK"We don't know where the other half is going," said Crisp, who's based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.LiNeBrEaKTo solve the mystery, NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency are sending up complementary scientific satellites. The Japanese Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite was boosted into orbit last Friday. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory is scheduled for launch on Feb. 23.LiNeBrEaKThe two spaceships will circle the Earth on overlapping paths, more than 400 miles high, analyzing plumes of CO2 rising and falling through the air. (CO2 contains two atoms of oxygen for every atom of carbon.)LiNeBrEaK"Carbon dioxide 'sources' increase the local concentrations of this gas. Carbon dioxide 'sinks' reduce the concentrations," Crisp explained at a NASA briefing Thursday.LiNeBrEaKFor example, cities such as New York and Los Angeles are carbon sources year-round. On the other hand, Iowa is a major carbon sink in summer because its cornfields take up tons of CO2.LiNeBrEaK"We want to understand why, how and where these sinks are and what's going to happen in the future," said Anna Michalak, an Orbiting Carbon Observatory team member from the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. 'There's no consensus whether these sinks will increase or decrease."LiNeBrEaKFor example, as the world warms, Arctic tundra is thawing and releasing more CO2. At the same time, forests are expanding farther north, storing more CO2.LiNeBrEaK"We can only account for about half of the carbon that doesn't remain in the atmosphere," said Eric Ianson, Orbiting Carbon Observatory project manager. Identifying where it goes will "help policymakers make informed decisions about carbon management," he said.LiNeBrEaKEarth has only about 100 land stations that are able to measure CO2 with sufficient accuracy. "Large parts of the Earth have no stations at all," Crisp said.LiNeBrEaKScott Denning, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, pointed out that "the 'missing sinks' aren't really missing. They are just poorly understood," he said.LiNeBrEaK"It would be great if we could measure how much carbon every tree, shrub, peat bog and blade of grass takes in. But the world is too big and too diverse and is constantly changing," Denning said. "The solution isn't measuring carbon in trees. The solution is measuring carbon in the air."LiNeBrEaKThe new satellites will let scientists depend less on sometimes inaccurate computer models than they do now and more on data to understand the causes of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. satellite will continuously measure CO2 in patches a little bigger than a square mile, accumulating 8 million observations that will be repeated every 16 days. The Japanese version will monitor wider areas, about 20 square miles, and provide a series of 56,000 snapshots about 60 miles apart that will be repeated every three days.LiNeBrEaKThe images will be taken by spectrographs, instruments that can measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the air with an accuracy of one part in a million.LiNeBrEaK"This approach will provide the first regional-scale, global maps of carbon dioxide over the entire globe," Crisp saidLiNeBrEaKThe $500 million Japanese satellite is supposed to last five years. The $278 million U.S. system is designed for two years.LiNeBrEaKThe two countries intend to collaborate closely. "Fortunately, we have two different systems using very different methods to make these measurements at the same time," Crisp said. "Their orbits will cross several times a day."LiNeBrEaKMartin Heimann, a geochemist at the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany, who isn't a member of the American or Japanese teams, praised the satellites but said that they wouldn't last long enough to do an adequate job.LiNeBrEaK"Some of the most fundamental questions on the mechanisms of the Earth's carbon cycle in a changing climate just cannot be tackled with less than half a decade of data," he wrote in the January issue of Nature Geoscience.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, Denning said that the satellite data would "buy us more time to develop alternative energy and other mitigation measures" against global warming.LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	Wellinghoff: Conserving, performance can coexist  	John G. Edwards, Las Vegas Review-Journal  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	563 words  	Jan. 30--To revitalize the economy and protect the environment, Americans need to save energy, cut dependence on foreign oil and reduce use of fossil fuels, many officials urge.LiNeBrEaKBut that doesn't mean giving up on high-performance cars, Jon Wellinghoff, former Nevada consumer advocate and now acting chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Thursday.LiNeBrEaKWellinghoff showed those attending Preview Las Vegas at the Cox Pavilion a picture of himself in a plug-in, electric hybrid Tesla to make the point. He also showed a picture of Shelby Super Cars Ultimate Aero EV, which goes from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2. 5 seconds. LiNeBrEaK"Electric cars can be sexy, too," Wellinghoff said.LiNeBrEaKVehicles like those and more traditional-looking, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles can wean the country off its addiction to foreign oil, reduce greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and cut urban pollution, he said.LiNeBrEaKDuring a trip to China, he learned that country has 40 million electric vehicles. Most are scooters and bicycles, but the Chinese are starting to build electric cars, he said.LiNeBrEaK"We need to move our economy into the electric system, or they are going to clean our clock."LiNeBrEaKPlug-in hybrids can also save drivers money.LiNeBrEaKThe regulatory chief said the country needs the "Cashback Hybrid." When the Cashback is plugged in, motorists can allow the utility to vary the speed at which the battery recharges so that the utility can more closely match supply and demand for power on the electric grid.LiNeBrEaKIn return, the car owner could obtain cash back or a credit from the utility that makes the electricity free, he said. A Cashback owner could recover the higher cost of owning a plug-in hybrid vehicle in less than three years.LiNeBrEaKWellinghoff also showed a clothes dryer that has an electronic device that would allow the electric utility to cut use for heating when demand peaks if the consumer agreed in return for compensation.LiNeBrEaKResidual heat and tumbling would continue to dry clothes, he said. As a result drying might take a few more minutes.LiNeBrEaKWellinghoff advocated high-efficiency home air conditioners that use water for cooling rather than air, but still conserve more water than would be needed for power generation plants for inefficient, air-cooled air conditioners.LiNeBrEaKHe explained how MGM Mirage's CityCenter will generate some of the electricity it needs and will use waste heat for hot water and space heating.LiNeBrEaKWellinghoff praised NV Energy for boosting its energy conservation incentives programs because they cut power consumption for less than it would cost to produce and deliver the power. The NV Energy program trimmed power consumption last year by 963 million megawatts and eliminated the need for a 270-megawatt power plant.LiNeBrEaKAn even larger energy conservation program at NV Energy would produce more dramatic savings, he said.LiNeBrEaK"It will be more money in your pocket, and ultimately allow you to put more money back into this community," Wellinghoff said.

LiNeBrEaKRoger HillmanLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKHysterical approachLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKSharon Sevigny's economic analysis ("Thanks, Harry," Saturday letter to the editor) was on the money, showing how much it will cost Nevada if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his environmental lobbyists succeed in killing the Yucca Mountain Project. Yucca should be canned only if scientific proof is presented showing that it is unsafe.LiNeBrEaKThe same hysterical approach that has created our oil shortage is now focused on eliminating both nuclear power and the fossil fuels that provide the cheap energy that keeps our economy going. The only proven justification is to create very expensive alternative energy industries. There is still no hard science backing the theory that minor concentrations of carbon dioxide cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKI wonder how much Sen. Reid receives from environmental and alternative energy lobbyists.LiNeBrEaKTom KellerLiNeBrEaKHendersonLiNeBrEaKGasoline pricesLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKWhile the price of gasoline has increased some 31 cents a gallon in the past 30 days, the media - both print and electronic - have been unusually silent. Perhaps I missed it, but no reason for this current increase has been offered by the newspapers or the television watchdogs.LiNeBrEaKSurely with the price of oil at low levels and conservation by the driving public, not withstanding OPEC's cutback in production, a valid reason must exist. I trust that we may soon be enlightened.LiNeBrEaKHerb NixonLiNeBrEaKHendersonLiNeBrEaKThe futureLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKI am writing with sincere hopes that readers may stir up and fight against the proposed budget cuts for Nevada's higher education system.LiNeBrEaKI am 19 years old. I am a student. I am the future. I currently go to UNLV, where I am studying to become a teacher, hoping one day to attain my dream of becoming a history professor somewhere in my home state of Nevada.LiNeBrEaKRight now I feel as though my state does not want me here, either as a student or as a future educator.LiNeBrEaKWhat other conclusion can I come to when the governor proposes to cut education funds in a state that already underfunds education?LiNeBrEaKThe time to speak out is now, people. Do not let your silence or indifference condemn Nevada to oblivion. Contact your legislators, your public servants, and force them to adhere to the will and benefit of the people. LiNeBrEaKAmanda McAteeLiNeBrEaKHendersonLiNeBrEaKReal needsLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKAt last a voice of reason. The Review-Journal's Geoff Schumacher, in his Jan. 23 column, quotes Evan Blythin, a retired communications professor, regarding Nevada's university system. Mr. Blythin opines that having UNLV and UNR compete does not provide what is best for Nevada and the two should consider a consolidation. But as Mr. Schumacher notes, "most faculty" would reject these ideas "because it would thwart their empire building." (Does the name Jim Rogers come to mind?)LiNeBrEaKMore than 50 percent of Nevada's budget goes to education. I am no statistician, but if I were, I could provide the numbers to show how it is terribly overfunded or terribly underfunded, as your priority requires. But as an average person, that seems to be a considerable amount spent compared to what is spent on all the other needs we have.LiNeBrEaKWhile I sympathize with the students at UNLV and UNR who agitate against tuition and fee increases, maybe this is their first lesson in the real world. That being, if you have capital, you are able to have "things." If you do not, you do without.LiNeBrEaKIt would be wonderful if everyone could have a college education provided by the government, but that is not likely. They also need to understand that the state is responsible for providing the "needs" of the people first.LiNeBrEaKJerry Andreoli Jr.LiNeBrEaKLas Vegas	LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (89%); LOBBYING (89%); GASOLINE PRICES (88%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (87%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (87%); NUCLEAR WASTE (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (75%); POLITICAL PARTIES (75%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (75%); HISTORY (75%); SCIENTIFIC METHOD (73%); EDUCATION FUNDING (73%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (71%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (71%); CARTELS (69%); PRICE INCREASES (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); EDUCATION (64%); GASOLINE MARKETS (64%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (64%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (60%); BUDGET (60%) letters; final; word; photo; obama; washington; snow; schools; closed; roger; hillman; tom; keller; herb; nixon; amanda; mcatee; jerry; andreoli; jr.; sevigny; harry; reid; yucca; costs; gasoline; prices; higher; education; budget; cuts; schumacher; unlv; unr; consolidation; blythin  			LAS VEGAS, NV, USA (79%) NEVADA, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	February 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 DR Partners d/b/a Las Vegas Review-Journal All Rights Reserved  		HARRY REID (97%); BARACK OBAMA (59%)  														
The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	World is going green; Detroit should, too  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	522 words  	The following editorial appeared in the Miami Herald on Thursday, Jan. 29:LiNeBrEaKU.S. automakers have used all of their legal and lobbying muscle to fight efforts _ including by California, the nation's biggest state _ to reduce vehicles' greenhouse-gas emissions. Until Jan. 20, they seemed to be winning. Now, the tide is turning _ and that's good for U.S. automakers and the country, too. LiNeBrEaKThe difference is because of the change in the White House. Under the Bush administration, the Environmental Protection Agency refused to grant California a Clean Air Act waiver requiring higher standards for tailpipe emissions. This, despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision acknowledging the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe Big Three automakers have spent millions in legal fees fighting emission standards in courts in California and Vermont as if oblivious to the dire financial straits that led to the $17. 4 billion bailout of General Motors and Chrysler.LiNeBrEaKThe automakers should have realized that change was coming when Congress agreed to lend them billions of dollars. Congress, in no uncertain terms, told the Detroit CEOs that it was time to make smaller, more fuel-efficient cars _ and the CEOs agreed.LiNeBrEaKYet now they are caviling about President Barack Obama's announcement this week that California's tough greenhouse-gas emission standards and higher fuel standards are the way to go and that he expects the EPA to approve the waiver soon.LiNeBrEaKOnce the waiver is approved, 13 other states _ Florida included _ are poised to adopt California's rules. In Florida, this would mean that by 2013, new cars sold in the Sunshine State must reduce heat-trapping emissions by 23 percent; by 2016 that would rise to 30 percent. Together, the 14 states make up 30 percent of domestic automakers' market. An additional five states have indicated their intent to adopt similar rules, which also would improve fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, the Big Three still complain that this will set up a two-tiered system for vehicle-emission standards in the United States. This would happen only if the car makers insist on remaining as retro in their thinking as their argument implies. If California, Florida, New York, New England states and others are demanding cleaner, more efficient vehicles, might not the rest of the states get on board, too? Especially given the growing realization across the country that global warming must be dealt with.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Obama administration, it is clear that the EPA will have to quit dragging its feet and heed the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that it can regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. U.S. automakers have closed their eyes to the reality of a changing world long enough. They have lost a war they never should have fought.LiNeBrEaKVisit The Miami Herald Web edition on the World Wide Web at http://www.herald.com	AUTOMAKERS (94%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (93%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (92%); EMISSIONS (92%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (91%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (90%); LOBBYING (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%); SETTLEMENTS and DECISIONS (75%); INTERNET and WWW (75%); DECISIONS and RULINGS (75%); APPROVALS (75%); SUPREME COURTS (74%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (74%); BAILOUTS (74%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); APPEALS (69%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (90%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (90%)  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (90%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (90%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); FLORIDA, USA (92%); NORTHEAST USA (79%); VERMONT, USA (79%); NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090130-BC-AUTO-EMISSIONS-EDITORIAL  	Newspaper  	MI  	2009 The Miami Herald   	SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES (57%); US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%)  	BARACK OBAMA (83%)  						GMP (PAR) (90%); GMB (BRU) (90%); GM (NYSE) (90%)

A; Pg. 11  	161 words  	Is NATO needed in Arctic?LiNeBrEaKBy apLiNeBrEaKAssociated PressLiNeBrEaKREYKJAVIK, Iceland - NATO will need a military presence in the Arctic as global warming melts frozen sea routes and major powers rush to lay claim to lucrative energy reserves, the military bloc's chief said Thursday. LiNeBrEaKNATO commanders and lawmakers meeting in Iceland's capital said the Arctic thaw is bringing the prospect of new standoffs between powerful nations.LiNeBrEaK"I would be the last one to expect military conflict - but there will be a military presence," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told reporters. "It should be a military presence that is not overdone, and there is a need for political cooperation and economic cooperation."LiNeBrEaKThe opening up of Arctic sea routes once navigable only by icebreakers threatens to complicate delicate relations between countries with competing claims to Arctic territory - particularly as exploration for oil and natural gas becomes possible in once-inaccessible areas.

The New York Times 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Saving Primeval Rain Forests  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1  	1728 words  	The land where Marta Ortega de Wing raised hundreds of pigs until 10 years ago is being overtaken by galloping jungle -- palms, lizards and ants.LiNeBrEaK  Instead of farming, she now shops at the supermarket and her grown children and grandchildren live in places like Panama City and New York. LiNeBrEaK  Here, and in other tropical countries around the world, small holdings like Ms. Ortega de Wing's -- and much larger swaths of farmland -- are reverting back to nature, as people abandon their land and move to the cities in search of better livings. LiNeBrEaK  These new ''secondary'' forests are emerging in Latin America, Asia and other tropical regions at such a fast pace that the trend has set off a serious debate about whether saving primeval rain forest -- an iconic environmental cause -- may be less urgent than once thought. By one estimate, for every acre of rain forest cut down each year, more than 50 acres of new forest are growing in the tropics on land that was once farmed, logged or ravaged by natural disaster.  LiNeBrEaK  ''There is far more forest here than there was 30 years ago,'' said Ms. Ortega de Wing, 64, who remembers fields of mango trees and banana plants. LiNeBrEaK  The new forests, the scientists argue, could blunt the effects of rain forest destruction by absorbing carbon dioxide, the leading heat-trapping gas linked to global warming, one crucial role that rain forests play. They could also, to a lesser extent, provide habitat for endangered species. LiNeBrEaK  The idea has stirred outrage among environmentalists who believe that vigorous efforts to protect native rain forest should remain a top priority. But the notion has gained currency in mainstream organizations like the Smithsonian Institution and the United Nations, which in 2005 concluded that new forests were ''increasing dramatically'' and ''undervalued'' for their environmental benefits. The United Nations is undertaking the first global catalog of the new forests, which vary greatly in their stage of growth.LiNeBrEaK  ''Biologists were ignoring these huge population trends and acting as if only original forest has conservation value, and that's just wrong,'' said Joe Wright,  a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute here, who set off a firestorm two years ago by suggesting that the new forests could substantially compensate for rain forest destruction.LiNeBrEaK  ''Is this a real rain forest?'' Dr. Wright asked, walking the land of a former American cacao plantation that was abandoned about 50 years ago, and pointing to fig trees and vast webs of community spiders and howler monkeys.LiNeBrEaK  ''A botanist can look at the trees here and know this is regrowth,'' he said. ''But the temperature and humidity are right. Look at the number of birds! It works. This is a suitable habitat.'' LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Wright and others say the overzealous protection of rain forests not only prevents poor local people from profiting from the rain forests on their land but also robs financing and attention from other approaches to fighting global warming, like eliminating coal plants.LiNeBrEaK  But other scientists, including some of Dr. Wright's closest colleagues, disagree, saying that forceful protection of rain forests is especially important in the face of threats from industrialized farming and logging. LiNeBrEaK  The issue has also set off a debate over the true definition of a rain forest. How do old forests compare with new ones in their environmental value? Is every rain forest sacred? LiNeBrEaK  ''Yes, there are forests growing back, but not all forests are equal,'' said Bill Laurance,  another senior scientist at the Smithsonian, who has worked extensively in the Amazon. LiNeBrEaK  He scoffed as he viewed Ms. Ortega de Wing's overgrown land: ''This is a caricature of a rain forest!'' he said. ''There's no canopy, there's too much light, there are only a few species. There is a lot of change all around here whittling away at the forest, from highways to development.'' LiNeBrEaK  While new forests may absorb carbon emissions, he says, they are unlikely to save most endangered rain-forest species, which have no way to reach them. LiNeBrEaK  Everyone, including Dr. Wright, agrees that large-scale rain-forest destruction in the Amazon or Indonesia should be limited or managed. Rain forests are the world's great carbon sinks, absorbing the emissions that humans send into the atmosphere, and providing havens for biodiversity. LiNeBrEaK  At issue is how to tally the costs and benefits of forests, at a time when increasing attention is being paid to global climate management and carbon accounting. LiNeBrEaK  Just last month, at climate talks held by the United Nations in Poznan, Poland, the world's environment ministers agreed to a new program through which developing countries will be rewarded for preventing deforestation. But little is known about the new forests -- some of them have never even been mapped -- and they were not factored into the equation at the meetings.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Wright and other scientists say they should be. About 38 million acres of original rain forest are being cut down every year, but in 2005, according to the most recent ''State of the World's Forests Report'' by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, there were an estimated 2. 1 billion acres of potential replacement forest growing in the tropics -- an area almost as large as the United States. The new forest included secondary forest on former farmland and so-called degraded forest, land that has been partly logged  or destroyed by natural disasters like fires and then left to nature. In Panama by the 1990s, the last decade for which data is available, the rain forest is being destroyed at a rate of 1. 3 percent each year. The area of secondary forest is increasing by more than 4 percent yearly, Dr. Wright estimates. LiNeBrEaK  With the heat and rainfall in tropical Panama, new growth is remarkably fast. Within 15 years, abandoned land can contain trees more than 100 feet high. Within 20, a thick rain-forest canopy forms again. Here in the lush, misty hills, it is easy to see rain-forest destruction as part of a centuries-old cycle of human civilization and wilderness, in which each in turn is cleared and replaced by the other. The Mayans first cleared lands here that are now dense forest. The area around Gamboa, cleared when the Panama Canal was built, now looks to the untrained eye like the wildest of jungles. LiNeBrEaK  But Dr. Laurance says that is a dangerous lens through which to view the modern world, where the forces that are destroying rain forest operate on a scale previously unknown. LiNeBrEaK  Now the rain forest is being felled by ''industrial forestry, agriculture, the oil and gas industry -- and it's globalized, where every stick of timber is being cut in Congo is sent to China and one bulldozer does a lot more damage than 1,000 farmers with machetes,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  Globally, one-fifth of the world's carbon emissions come from the destruction of rain forests, scientists say. It is unknown how much of that is being canceled out by forest that is in the process of regrowth. It is a crucial but scientifically controversial question, the answer to which may depend on where and when the forests are growing.LiNeBrEaK  Although the United Nations' report noted the enormous increase of secondary forests, it is unclear how to describe or define them. The 2. 1 billion acres of secondary forests includes a mishmash of land that has the potential to grow into a vibrant faux rain forest and land that may never become more than a biologically shallow tangle of trees and weeds.LiNeBrEaK  ''Our knowledge of these forests is still rather limited,'' said Wulf Killmann, director of forestry products and industry at the United Nations agriculture organization. The agency is in the early phases of a global assessment of the scope of secondary forest, which will be ready in 2011.LiNeBrEaK  The Smithsonian, hoping to answer such questions, is just starting to study a large plot of newly abandoned farmland in central Panama to learn about the regeneration of forests there. LiNeBrEaK  Regenerated forests in the tropics appear to be especially good at absorbing emissions of carbon, but that ability is based on location and rate of growth. A field abandoned in New York in 1900 will have trees shorter than those growing on a field here that was abandoned just 20 years ago. LiNeBrEaK  For many biologists, a far bigger concern  is whether new forests can support the riot of plant and animal species associated with rain forests. Part of the problem is that abandoned farmland is often distant from native rain forest. How does it help Amazonian species threatened by rain-forest destruction in Brazil if secondary forests grow on the outskirts of Panama City? LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Wright -- an internationally respected scientist -- said he knew he was stirring up controversy when he suggested to a conference of tropical biologists that rain forests might not be so bad off. Having lived in Panama for 25 years, he is convinced that scientific assessments of the rain forests' future were not taking into account the effects of population and migration trends that are obvious on the ground. LiNeBrEaK  In Latin America and Asia, birthrates have dropped drastically; most people have two or three children. New jobs tied to global industry, as well as improved transportation, are luring a rural population to fast-growing cities. Better farming techniques and access to seed and fertilizer mean that marginal lands are no longer farmed because it takes fewer farmers to feed a growing population. LiNeBrEaK  Gumercinto Vasquez, a stooped casual laborer who was weeding a field in Chilibre in the blistering sun, said it had become hard for him to find work because so many farms had been abandoned.LiNeBrEaK  ''Very few people around here are farming these days,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Wright, looking at a new forest, sees possibility. He says new research suggests that 40 to 90 percent of rain-forest species can survive in new forest. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Laurance focuses on what will be missing, ticking off species like jaguars, tapirs and a variety of birds and invertebrates.LiNeBrEaK  While he concedes that a regrown forest may absorb some carbon, he insists, ''This is not the rich ecosystem of a rain forest.'' LiNeBrEaK  Still, the fate of secondary forests lies not just in biology. A global recession could erase jobs in cities, driving residents back to the land. LiNeBrEaK  ''Those are questions for economists and politicians, not us,'' Dr. Wright said.

The New York Times 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	From New Administration, Signals of Broader Role for States  	By JOHN SCHWARTZ  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; NEWS ANALYSIS; Pg. 16  	966 words  	The Obama administration seems to be open to a movement known as ''progressive federalism,'' in which governors and activist state attorneys general have been trying to lead the way on environmental initiatives, consumer protection and other issues, several constitutional experts say.LiNeBrEaK  A recent decision by President Obama that could open the way for California and other states to set their own limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks represents a shift in the delicate and often acrimonious relationship between the federal government and the states, legal experts say, possibly signaling a new view of federalism. LiNeBrEaK  ''I think it's quite significant,'' said Samuel Issacharoff, a professor of constitutional law at New York University law school. ''It shows the Obama administration's more benign view of government intervention,'' Professor Issacharoff said, and ''may indicate a spirit of cooperative federalism'' in which Washington will look to the states for new ideas and even a measure of guidance. LiNeBrEaK  Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, who met with the transition team in December to discuss federalism and other issues, said he believed the Obama administration would ''usher in a new era in federal-state relations.'' Members of the new administration, Mr. Miller said, ''are open to what we're talking about, what we're thinking.'' They also appreciate, he said, the fact that state attorneys general often achieve a level of bipartisan cooperation when they band together to pursue lawsuits.LiNeBrEaK  The general trend under previous administrations had favored federal pre-emption, the belief that the best law comes from Washington, a concept still favored by business leaders. LiNeBrEaK  William L. Kovacs, a vice president for environmental and regulatory issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said free-for-all federalism was bad for business and would lead to a ''patchwork of laws impacting a troubled industry.'' Detroit, Mr. Kovacs said, would have to produce different cars for different parts of the country, and the environmental protection agency would grow tremendously to meet the new regulatory burden.LiNeBrEaK  Many liberal thinkers skeptical of states' rights and state actions since the days of segregation have begun to see that the states, to use Justice Louis Brandeis's words from the 1930s, can ''serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.''LiNeBrEaK  Professor Issacharoff said states were often quicker than Washington to spot a problem when it emerged, and so ''it may be the states that have the best initial take on it, and try different regulatory methods until we fasten on a single national solution.''LiNeBrEaK  States have taken up the challenge of consumer protection, addressing issues like predatory lending well before the federal government took action, and often achieving reforms by suing the federal government to force it to enforce its laws and through legal settlements with industry. In October, 11 states reached an $8. 4 billion settlement with Countrywide Financial in which it agreed to modify home loans to help people at risk of foreclosure. And in 2006, 49 states and the District of Columbia reached a $325 million settlement with the Ameriquest Mortgage company to change its policies. LiNeBrEaK  Attorneys general also pressured major universities to adopt a code of conduct regarding their relationships with student lending companies. Eliot Spitzer, the former New York attorney general, achieved a settlement with the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline in 2004 in which it agreed to release more information about the risks to patients that had come out in clinical trials. LiNeBrEaK  The Obama administration, then, is embracing a states' rights movement that a liberal could love. ''The pro-regulatory folks realized in the last eight years that the old line on federal power being the only good power wasn't correct,'' said William Marshall, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who was deputy White House counsel in the Clinton administration and a former solicitor general of Ohio.LiNeBrEaK  ''It doesn't mean you abandon the federal regulatory process -- you don't, of course,'' Mr. Marshall said. ''But you treat it as a floor and not a ceiling.''LiNeBrEaK  He added, ''The Obama administration is signaling that state regulations may very well complement federal regulations, and they can both work together to achieve important goals.''LiNeBrEaK  Still, James E. Tierney, the director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia University Law School, cautioned against reading too much into a single presidential directive. ''I don't think we have a hallmark, sweeping view of states' rights here,'' Mr. Tierney said. He said ''the Obama administration is going to take these one at a time'' and ''will be with the states as long as the states fit in with his view of the national interest.''LiNeBrEaK  And Walter Dellinger, a solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said that the economic rise of the United States, compared with Europe's, in the 1950s could be attributed in large part to the unified American market. Now Europe's markets have unified, Mr. Dellinger noted. ''There is a serious risk that if we decentralize regulations too much, we will, ironically, switch places with Europe,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Tierney, who is a former Maine attorney general, said that while he was an advocate for state power, there were areas where federal power should nonetheless hold sway. ''What the federal government ought to do,'' he said, ''is open the door to the states, and let the states enforce the law that the federal government promulgates.'' LiNeBrEaK  He added, ''This is the opportunity to have the attorneys general join their own government instead of suing their own government.''

Then she might have been Edwina Spoonapple, the young heroine of this charming new musical by Zina Goldrich and Marcy Heisler (''Junie B. Jones'').

Six teenagers, ages 13 through 15, working in pairs, have been teamed with adult theatrical professionals: one adult writes a play for the two young people, and another directs it. The creative partnerships are a result of the Two-on-Two series, part of the 52nd Street Project, which provides theater opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the Clinton neighborhood. Another opportunity arrives with these shows: the opening of the Project's new Manhattan theater. Friday and Saturday at 7: 30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 642-5052, 52project.org. Free, but reservations are required.LiNeBrEaK  'THE FESTIVAL OF THE VEGETABLES' (Saturday and Sunday) Children don't always welcome vegetables, but they should make an exception for these: they're stars in a theater-dance-music piece about the produce-filled dreams of a toddler who falls asleep in a grocery store.

Youth Theater's season are named Judy and Mickey. This musical, a revival from 1999, captures the high spirits of 1930s pop culture, when stars like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney were all the rage. The action takes place in 1939 in Happyville, where the teenage residents decide to boost the economy by putting on a show. (Maybe it will give audience members a few ideas.) (Through Feb. 15.) Saturday and Sunday at 2 and 4 p.m., Wednesday at 10 a.m. and noon, 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan, second floor, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com; $20; $8 for ages 15 and under; premium tickets (with preferred seating), $25 and $15.LiNeBrEaK  'HARRY THE DIRTY DOG' (Saturday and Sunday) Manhattan Children's Theater has revived this 45-minute show, which is a delight for ages 3 to 8 and a source of solace to parents. After all, what if all their bath-hating toddlers were dogs? The play, adapted by Karen Abbott from Gene Zion's book of the same title, follows the adventures of the title character, a usually amiable mutt who has a strong antipathy for soap and water. (Through Feb. 22.) At noon and 2 p.m., 52 White Street, near Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $20.LiNeBrEaK  'HOUSE ABOUT IT' (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) This exhibition gives new meaning to playing house. Created by the Staten Island Children's Museum, the show, whose centerpiece is a child-size house under construction, introduces young visitors to all aspects of the building trades. Activity stations include an architect's office, a space to examine foundation materials and a workbench to practice sawing and drilling. The house offers opportunities for tiling and shingling, and a dollhouse lets young decorators ponder fabrics and furnishings. Hours: Friday, and Tuesday through Thursday, noon to 5 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, (718) 273-2060, statenislandkids.org. Free with admission: $5; free for members.LiNeBrEaK  'JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS' (Friday through Sunday) To children it may sound like the title of a futuristic comic book, but those who attend this production, recommended for ages 8 and older, will soon see that this superhero has ancient roots. Presented by Visible Fictions, this show by Robert Forrest at the New Victory Theater recounts the adventures of Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece in a mere 65 minutes. More amazingly, it does so with only two actors, some action figures and a lot of imagination. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon; 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org; $12. 50, $25 and $35.LiNeBrEaK  'JOSE LIMON: THE MAKING OF AN ARTIST' (Saturday through Monday) This latest production from Making Books Sing, an organization that turns literature for young people into musical theater, is as much about dance as about song.

With book and lyrics by Barbara Zinn Krieger and music by Charles Greenberg, the show will also play in Brooklyn. (Through Feb. 13.)

LiNeBrEaK  'LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD'/'LA CAPERUCITA ROJA' (Saturday) The wolf suffers an identity crisis in this puppet musical version by Manuel Antonio Moran, presented in an easy-to- understand mix of Spanish and English by Teatro SEA, which specializes in Latino theater for children. It seems that Little Red can't be persuaded that the wolf is really a wolf, and soon he begins to doubt himself too (with good reason: what wolf talks and sings?). At 3 p.m., Los Kabayitos Puppet Theater, 107 Suffolk Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 529-1545, sea-online.info; $15; $12. 50 for 2 to 12; free for under 2.LiNeBrEaK  'OPERA EXPLORERS: LIGHTS!

M. Barrie's classic. Presented by the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater as a puppet musical (Daryl Kojak composed the score), it also features a Tiger Lily who's a native of India. Fridays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, at 10: 30 a.m. and noon (with an additional 2: 30 p.m. show on Wednesdays); Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org; $8; $5 for 18 and under.

This musical, by the brothers Robert Reale (music) and Willie Reale (book and lyrics), brings to life their friendship, first imagined by Arnold Lobel in his 1970s series of children's books. A scaled-down version of the show that ran on Broadway in 2004, ''Frog and Toad'' has found a perfect home in Atlantic for Kids, the children's wing of the Atlantic Theater Company. The results are reminiscent of the title characters' picnics: light but still satisfying, and as nourishing as they are unpretentious. (Through March 1.)

Now 92YTriBeCa, a new satellite of the 92nd Street Y, is offering the perfect substitute: B.Y.O.K., or Bring Your Own Kid. As the title implies, this series is devoted to cross-generational fun, and so on Sunday it will present Uncle Rock, or Robert Burke Warren, a former stay-at-home dad and former member of rock bands. A current star among the young, he is inspired by sources like Roald Dahl, Pete Seeger and Shel Silverstein. At 11 a.m., 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org/BYOK; $15.

With just a few words and strokes of his pen, the president ended the war on terror, the war on Islam, the war on science and the war on women.LiNeBrEaKIn his first executive orders, Obama effectively dismantled the elaborate structures that supported the Bush administration's "war on terror." On Jan. 22, he ordered the closure of the Guantanamo prison and a halt to the much-criticized military commission trials. He closed secret CIA prisons, required that the Red Cross have access to detainees and mandated that interrogations of detainees --whether by the military, the CIA or anyone else --comply with the rules laid out in the Army Field Manual. LiNeBrEaKThat means: no more torture. No waterboarding, beatings, sexual humiliations or deprivation of food or medical care.LiNeBrEaKThe war on Islam is also over. Officially, of course, it never existed. But that's how the "war on terror" looked to many around the world, a misunderstanding fueled by the war in Iraq and the irresponsible rhetoric of many Bush administration officials.LiNeBrEaKAfter 9/11, the United States had widespread international support --including within the Islamic world --for military action in Afghanistan to destroy al-Qaida and oust its Taliban hosts. But when that morphed into an open-ended U.S. effort to go to war in more "target-rich" environments (read: Iraq), regardless of the lack of connection to 9/11, U.S. actions struck many Muslims as motivated by generic hostility to Islam. That U.S. officials from George W. Bush on down seemed fuzzy about the differences between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and tended to ignore the very different ideologies that motivate different militant organizations, added to the sense that the U.S. considered Islam itself the problem.LiNeBrEaKBut by giving his first televised interview to al-Arabiya, a channel watched throughout the Arab world, Obama made it clear that the U.S. isn't at war with Islam itself. "Our administration (will) be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida --that . . . espouse terror . . . and people who may disagree with my administration" in legitimate ways.LiNeBrEaKObama also ended the undeclared Bush administration war on science. In his inaugural speech, he promised to "restore science to its rightful place." Reversing years of Bush administration disregard of scientific evidence on global climate change, Obama ordered the Transportation Department to set new fuel-efficiency standards and ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to rethink its Bush-era refusal to allow states to impose anti-pollution standards more stringent than federal ones.LiNeBrEaKThe undeclared war on women? Also over. On Jan. 23, Obama reversed the "Mexico City policy," which prohibited recipients of U.S. foreign-assistance funds from providing abortions or even providing information about abortions. Family planning groups worldwide no longer will have to choose between providing honest information and receiving crucial funding.LiNeBrEaKDon't make the mistake of thinking that these assorted "wars" were only metaphors, incapable of producing real harm. The "war on terror" was practically a gift to Osama bin Laden: Our detention and interrogation policies probably fueled far more terrorism than they prevented. Ditto for the Bush administration's undeclared war against Islam.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's replacement of science with ideology was equally devastating: How many lives will be lost or blighted as we all pay the price for a decade of denial about the human causes of global warming? And some estimate that as many as 500,000 women worldwide have died since 2001 as a result of botched abortions, many of which might have been prevented if the Mexico City policy hadn't pushed abortions and abortion counseling underground in many countries.LiNeBrEaKObama's job is just beginning. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will be far harder to end.LiNeBrEaKStill, not bad for a week's work.LiNeBrEaK2009, the Los Angeles TimesLiNeBrEaKReach Rosa Brooks by e-mail at rbrooks@latimescolumnists.com	MUSLIMS and ISLAM (90%); TERRORISM (90%); PRISONS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (90%); RELIGION (89%); IRAQ WAR (78%); ARMIES (78%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (77%); WAR and CONFLICT (77%); SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); TORTURE (74%); SCIENCE NEWS (71%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (71%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (70%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); CLIMATE CHANGE (62%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (60%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); MILITARY COURTS (70%)  			UNITED STATES (96%); IRAQ (92%); AFGHANISTAN (79%)  	January 31, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	AL-QAEDA (54%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (53%)  														
Palm Beach Post (Florida) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	DU ROSS' ANIMAL PAINTINGS REFLECT CONCERN FOR NATURE  	By JAN SJOSTROM Palm Beach Daily News  	TGIF; Pg. 38  	456 words  	Four years ago, artist Kimberly Du Ross moved from London, her home of 16 years, to New York.LiNeBrEaKSuddenly, her art took an unsettling turn. She made a giant painting of a shark thrusting out of the water, its mouth like an open wound rimmed with teeth. LiNeBrEaK"These are subconscious images that somehow resonated with (me)," the artist said.LiNeBrEaKAt the time, her mother, part-time Palm Beach resident Kate Ford, was tethered to an oxygen tank. Some of the people Du Ross met in New York weren't exactly friendly. She also was disturbed about global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe picture, she realized, recalled her predatory acquaintances, and it was "like gasping for air and nature out of balance, gasping for life," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe shark painting led to other animal paintings referencing environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKAbout 15 large-scale works from the series are on view at the Paul Fisher Gallery in West Palm Beach.LiNeBrEaKNature always has underpinned Du Ross' art, she said.LiNeBrEaK"All my work is derived from nature," she said. "For me, that's what painting is all about -- textures, colors. Everything for me comes directly from nature."LiNeBrEaKThe artist, 51, has visited Palm Beach, where her mother lives, since she was in her 20s. She's painted since she was a child. It's a talent she inherited from her paternal grandmother.LiNeBrEaK"She's always had this love for art," Ford said. "I figure if people have a talent, you should encourage it and support it."LiNeBrEaKThe show at Fisher's gallery came about at the suggestion of mutual friends Robin and Robert Leacock.LiNeBrEaKThe Leacocks were aware of Fisher's interest in wildlife preservation. They also figured his gallery was big enough to accommodate Du Ross' paintings, the largest of which measures 5 feet 5 inches by 6 feet 6 inches.LiNeBrEaKFisher was unaware of Du Ross' connection to Ford when he accepted the show.LiNeBrEaKHe was struck first by the power of the shark image. Then he made the connection between the swimming polar bear and the plight of the animal, which is losing its habitat to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"I saw such intellectual force behind that," he said. "I haven't seen that a lot, and I see a lot of art."LiNeBrEaKWhen she's not painting, Du Ross shoots photographs. Holden Luntz Gallery in Palm Beach has a collection of photographs she shot a couple of years ago in Peru.LiNeBrEaKShe likes to shoot "things I think seem quirky." She's not sure what she wants to work on next, but she might turn her eye on Palm Beach.LiNeBrEaK"I'm back to shooting the strange things I see everywhere I go," she said. "I can tell you I've gotten some pretty strange photographs from Palm Beach. It's some of my best work, in fact."LiNeBrEaKNature's Revenge: Paintings by Kimberly Du Ross.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	Greenhouse gas emissions: Heads out of the sand  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	488 words  	The following editorial appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday, Jan. 29:LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama's executive order on greenhouse gas emissions is a refreshing first step toward reversing the government's harmful inaction on climate change. LiNeBrEaKWith a stroke of his pen, Obama repudiated eight years of the Bush administration's head-in-the-sand approach to global warming. The president directed Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson to consider California's request to establish its own limits for emissions from cars and trucks, action that Bush resisted.LiNeBrEaKIf the EPA approves the application, as expected, it would allow California and other states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, to set tougher emissions standards than the federal government.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey has been at the forefront of efforts to limit carbon dioxide, the gas emitted from vehicle tailpipes and factory smokestacks. In Pennsylvania, cars and trucks produce one-third of the state's air pollution.LiNeBrEaKObama's action won't impact the environment or public health quickly. In the short term, his order is more important as a clear signal that his administration intends to reverse Bush policies and to actively fight global warming. That's a welcome move, and should send a message to other nations that the United States is ready to lead on this issue.LiNeBrEaKThe president also ordered new federal rules directing automakers to start building more fuel-efficient cars, as required by law. This effort places greater costs on the reeling auto industry, but Detroit automakers already bargained for fundamental change when they accepted a bailout by taxpayers.LiNeBrEaKWhile these strong steps make a statement, there is more to be done comprehensively in Washington. A patchwork of varying state standards on air pollution isn't the best way to attack global warming. Congress needs to take a sterner approach with fuel-efficiency standards, and find a way to cap greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.LiNeBrEaKAnd, as opposed as motorists are to the idea, raising the federal gas tax still makes good sense as public policy. It would generate money for needed infrastructure projects and encourage more commuters to drive clean cars or use mass transit. The spike last summer to $4 gasoline showed that consumers can change their habits when prices climb.LiNeBrEaKThe goals are to reduce dependency on oil, to ease the national security risks that come with such dependency, and to gradually ease a building environmental crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe sooner the United States prepares for that future, the better.LiNeBrEaKVisit Philadelphia Online, the Inquirer's World Wide Web site, at http://www.philly.com	EMISSIONS (93%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (91%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (89%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); AIR POLLUTION (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (89%); FUEL TAX (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); BAILOUTS (77%); PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (76%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (75%); MOTOR VEHICLES (75%); APPROVALS (71%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (69%); TAXES and TAXATION (66%); NATIONAL SECURITY (62%); URBAN TRANSIT SYSTEMS (60%); INFRASTRUCTURE (50%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%)  		PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA (78%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (93%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); NEW JERSEY, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090130-BC-AUTO-EMISSIONS-EDITORIAL  	Newspaper  	PH  	2009 Philadelphia Inquirer   	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%)  	BARACK OBAMA (94%); LISA P JACKSON (57%)

NATO will need a military presence in the Arctic as global warming melts frozen sea routes and major powers rush to lay claim to lucrative energy reserves, the military bloc's chief said Thursday. LiNeBrEaKNATO commanders and lawmakers meeting in Iceland's capital said the Arctic thaw is bringing the prospect of new standoffs between powerful nations.LiNeBrEaK"I would be the last one to expect military conflict ? but there will be a military presence," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said.LiNeBrEaKThe United States, Russia and Canada are among countries attempting to claim jurisdiction over Arctic territory alongside Nordic nations.LiNeBrEaKAnalysts say China is also likely to join a rush to capture energy reserves.LiNeBrEaKPriest expresses Holocaust doubtsLiNeBrEaKROME ? A priest in an ultraconservative society recently rehabilitated by Pope Benedict XVI has defended a bishop in his group and joined him in expressing doubts about the Holocaust.LiNeBrEaKWhile making more cautious remarks than Bishop Richard Williamson, the Rev. Floriano Abrahamowicz echoed, in an interview published Thursday by a northern Italian daily, the prelate's doubts that Jews were gassed during World War II.LiNeBrEaK"I know gas chambers existed at least to disinfect. I can't say if anybody was killed in them or not," Abrahamowicz told La Tribuna di Treviso.LiNeBrEaKBenedict lifted Williamson's excommunication and those of three other members of the Society of St. Pius X last week in an effort to bring them back into the church.

Richmond Times - Dispatch (Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Wind and Gas  	Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	473 words  	Jan. 30--Wayne Leonard, the CEO of Entergy, made an interesting point the other day that Virginians should keep in mind as discussions about the state's future proceed. LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago the General Assembly set a goal -- not (as yet) a mandate -- of having 12 percent of the state's electricity come from renewable sources such as wind and solar energy by 2022. This year the legislature is considering a handful of related bills, and it seems reasonable to surmise that future sessions will see an increase, not a decrease, in efforts to incent or require a larger renewable-fuels portfolio.LiNeBrEaKSuch efforts are aimed largely at reducing greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels, especially coal. But as Leonard noted in a guest column in The New York Times, the efforts could produce a perverse result:LiNeBrEaK"Because coal is cheaper than natural gas or oil, it is the least likely to be displaced by solar or wind power. Natural gas has a relatively low carbon content. But it is likely to be the first to be displaced by renewable sources of energy because it is more expensive than coal. That means even a renewable portfolio standard as high as 20 percent would reduce emissions by only a small fraction of what is needed to lower the risk of catastrophic climate change."LiNeBrEaKThis doesn't make renewable energy a bad idea; we were pleased to see that Dominion and another company are working on two wind-energy projects in Tazewell and Wise. Some environmentalists are pleased; others aren't. One UVa scientist recently was quoted bemoaning "the pointless sacrifice of our remnant wild landscape." Wind projects take up a lot of real estate. Dominion is working on a 300-megawatt wind-generation farm in Illinois that will cover 25,000 acres -- and still produce only about half as much energy as the 585-megawatt coal-fired plant slated for Wise, Va., that has caused so much controversy.LiNeBrEaKThe other problem with wind farms is that they produce energy only when it's windy out.LiNeBrEaKWind obviously is not the only renewable energy source. Others include solar, hydroelectric, and biomass. Increasing the use of renewable energy sources remains desirable. But legislators, environmentalists, and the public should keep in mind the tradeoffs and pitfalls involved. Renewable energy comes with its own set of costs -- which might not always be worth the limited reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions that might result.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Metro Edition	LIMBAUGH KNOWS NOT OF WHICH HE SPEAKS  	Robert E. Dixon  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B7  	753 words  	Rush Limbaugh's latest gaffe about the current state of the economy is over the top. Here is a man with absolutely no credentials in anything. He is not an economist, CEO or a scientist. He did go part way through the first semester of junior college before dropping out. And like Al Bundy, he played high school football. This does not stop him from making pronouncements on weighty matters. Instead of looking at all sides of an issue, he draws a conclusion and then finds an "expert" who agrees with him to prove his point. LiNeBrEaKHis comments of several years ago that there is plenty of oil in the world is an example of this thinking. At another time he stated that all of America's population could be jammed into a few counties in Texas in high rises, etc., leaving us with the rest of the country to expand. He forgot to tell us that it takes 10 to 14 acres of farmland to provide the food for every person in the world, leaving us all short in the calorie department. In his denial of global warming, he also forgot to mention that more than 90 percent of the world's scientists believe there is a real problem, and we are part of the problem. Further, he neglected to mention that more than 2,500 meteorologists and climatologists met in Brussels, Belgium, early in 2008 and concluded overwhelmingly that this might be the greatest threat to mankind to date.LiNeBrEaKIn his latest pronouncement, Limbaugh states that he hopes the government bailout will fail. He forgot to mention that it was a lack of government intervention from 1929 to 1932 that got us into the Great Depression. It was only when Franklin Roosevelt took charge that we started to come out of the tailspin. It is easy for him to condemn the latest government plan, because if it fails he will never stand in a bread line like the rest of us. He has made a very good living with his rigid, unbending, lopsided views that he presents on the radio every day. For example, in 1996 he made $9 million. Some 30 million or so Americans listen to him, but 300 million Americans don't hang on his every word. For many of his listeners this is their main source of "news" and they take it as the gospel truth. Yes, he has First Amendment rights but so do the rest of us. For my part I watch and listen to CNBC, where they have real experts giving both sides of the issue.LiNeBrEaKCurrently many believe we are going into another depression. We have an economy that is based 70 percent up consumption of goods, many of which are not produced here in the U.S. Right after 9/11, President Bush admonished the American people to not stay home but go out and spend. At the same time our government and industries, starting with President Clinton's signing of the NAFTA bill in 1994, have done their level best to ship every job they can to Mexico and then to China. At the same time, they started to tear down the paid medical and pension plans for the average worker. So now the average worker is expected to set aside $500,000 in investments if he wants to collect a maximum of $25,000 per year when he retires. He is expected to consume an ever greater amount just to keep our economy going as more and more jobs go overseas. He is expected to spend several thousands of dollars each year for medical insurance that, in many cases, only pays part of their bills. All the while we are encouraged to spend, spend, spend. Max out the plastic and buy houses that you can't afford, etc. Then we get cussed out by "experts" for doing it.LiNeBrEaKThe current buzzword is "green." Develop green technology and we will create jobs in America. In the early 2000s we had a plant in Roanoke employing 500 people making motor controllers for wind-driven generators. They were then shipped as prototypes to India where a plant was scheduled to mass-produce them. Some 5,000 Virginians could have been hired to do the job right here in Roanoke. Don't expect that the factories for this green environment will be built here in the U.S. They will all go overseas with the rest of our jobs.LiNeBrEaKYes, I understand that businesses need to turn a profit. And sadly, after watching CNBC, I wonder if the bailout package will work any better than letting our economy go belly-up like it did from 1929-1932. I would only hope that Limbaugh would make sure his brain is engaged before he puts his mouth in gear. It is the thinking of people like him that has thrown the Republican Party into disarray and has caused people like me to abandon that party in disgust.LiNeBrEaKRobert E.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	Let the light shine in  	By Natalie Dicou Close-Up Staff  	NEWS  	491 words  	Classrooms at Rowland Hall upper and middle schools will be a little dimmer over the next several weeks - and possibly for many years to come.LiNeBrEaKBoth schools have pledged to use natural light instead of electricity to illuminate their classrooms, offices and hallways whenever possible. It is part of the Green Cup Challenge, a friendly competition among 124 schools in 24 states and Canada that kicked off Monday and runs through Feb. 23. LiNeBrEaKStudents will flip off light switches, unplug surge protectors and set their computers to sleep or hibernate in an effort to save as much energy as possible. The Green Cup Challenge will expand to other conservation issues, such as recycling. This year, it focuses on electricity.LiNeBrEaKRowland Hall sustainability consultant Mary Jacquin said she hopes the challenge will lead to long-term changes. Jacquin favors a proactive approach and hopes to inspire students to reduce their energy use.LiNeBrEaK"There are changes we can make that are not beyond us," Jacquin said. "If we sit around and wait for other people to make changes, it's not going to happen."LiNeBrEaKThe school that wins the Green Cup Challenge will have made the biggest percentage decrease to their electricity bill.LiNeBrEaKLast week, the middle and upper schools met to learn about the competition. To get students fired up, the principals engaged in some spirited trash-talking in an onstage skit.LiNeBrEaKAfter asking middle school Principal Stephen Bennhoff if he had a phone, upper school Principal Lee Thomsen landed the following zinger:LiNeBrEaK"I want you to call your mama, because when we get done with this challenge, you are going to go crying to your mama."LiNeBrEaKAfter the principals boasted their school would conserve more energy, the assembly took a sobering turn when Chris Hill, a University of Utah biochemistry professor and Rowland Hall dad, took the stage to talk about the effect electricity production has on the environment.LiNeBrEaK"Electricity generation is the single biggest environmental problem that we face," Hill told students.LiNeBrEaKCurrent production methods make us too dependent on foreign oil, which leads to national security problems, Hill said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough electricity is clean at the point of use, making it is dirty, the professor said, noting that 95 percent of the electricity produced in Utah is made by burning coal - the leading cause of smog, acid rain and global warming.LiNeBrEaKElectricity likely will be created with wind turbines and solar and geothermal energy.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	The rise of a self-defeating auto-industry policy  	The Salt Lake Tribune  	OPINION; Columnists  	654 words  	Washington can't decide whether to save or to smother the American auto industry.LiNeBrEaKA few months ago, GM and Chrysler got $17. 4 billion in federal loans, on grounds that their health is essential to the economy. Now comes news that the Obama administration is acting quickly to approve a waiver for California to impose costly new restrictions on carbon-dioxide emissions from cars.LiNeBrEaKIn a move meant to combat global warming, California wants to mandate a 30 percent reduction in tailpipe emissions by 2016 and a fuel-efficiency standard of 49 miles per gallon by 2020. As many as 13 states will follow California's lead, creating a regulatory patchwork with automakers forced in practice to meet the higher standard. LiNeBrEaKEven California admits that the new strictures will add $1,000 to the cost of vehicles by 2016. The automakers estimate it will add $3,000. So, GM and Chrysler will struggle to shed labor and legacy costs, just to see new regulatory costs imposed by the very political authorities that are putting taxpayer dollars at risk to save them. It's the rise of self-defeating industrial policy.LiNeBrEaKThe auto-emissions standards already imposed on automakers -- the so-called CAFE standards -- have heaped billions of dollars of losses on Detroit. As Holman Jenkins of The Wall Street Journal notes, the American industry takes a hit on the cheaper, lighter cars it manufactures at its high-cost unionized plants to comply with CAFE. It makes such cars profitably overseas and could import them to the U.S. to meet CAFE standards if Congress didn't forbid it in a naked pander to the United Auto Workers.LiNeBrEaKWhen Detroit came to Washington in extremis last year, the rational reaction would have been to lift burdens on it. Instead, the fashionable rap on Detroit was that it had created its own mess by making SUVs on the foolish assumption that gas prices would stay at $1. 50 a gallon forever. This critique was premised on the foolish assumption that gas prices would stay at $4 a gallon forever.LiNeBrEaKAs gas prices have plunged, sales of SUVs and light trucks have picked up again. In December, they were 51 percent of all vehicle sales, a return to the normal pattern of such big vehicles outselling small cars. Drivers simply like the convenience and comfort of the bigger models. Sales of the Toyota hybrid Prius dropped 48 percent in November and 45 percent in December. Even Toyota, more adept at manufacturing small cars, is thought to lose money on every Prius it sells.LiNeBrEaKIf a normal sense of self-preservation were at work, Detroit would howl at another step toward bludgeoning it out of its most profitable line of work. But now its relationship with Washington is as important as its business model. Its executives have to drive to Capitol Hill in hybrid cars to do their begging and pretend that GM's plug-in Volt -- prospectively priced at an outlandish $40,000 per vehicle -- is the car of the future.LiNeBrEaKPolitical cowardice is the better part of valor. Detroit News reporter David Shepardson couldn't get a comment from Chrysler and Ford when he called to ask them about the imminent California waiver. Smart move. An Obama official told the News that "additional tools to support the auto industry will be considered" in response to California's new rules. What Washington giveth it taketh away and giveth yet again.LiNeBrEaKThis contradictory policy is driven by worry over the far-off threat of global warming that hangs over all of Obama's economy policy. At the same time everyone is aflutter with the need to stimulate the economy, Al Gore called in congressional testimony for the imposition this year of a cap-and-trade system, effectively imposing a new tax on energy. As government intervention proliferates, we are about to see industrial policy run by people who don't like industry very much.LiNeBrEaKDetroit wanted a bailout, and it will get it good and hard.LiNeBrEaKRich Lowry can be reached via e-mail: comments.lowry@nationalreview.com	AUTOMAKERS (93%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (89%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (89%); MOTOR VEHICLES (89%); AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (89%); SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (89%); AUTOMOTIVE WORKERS (78%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (76%); IMPORT TRADE (76%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (76%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (76%); APPROVALS (72%); LABOR UNIONS (67%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (66%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (92%); WALL STREET JOURNAL (54%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (92%)  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (92%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	February 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (58%)  						GMP (PAR) (92%); GMB (BRU) (92%); GM (NYSE) (92%); MLTQ (PAR) (92%)  								
The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	Let the light shine in  	By Natalie Dicou Close-up Staff  	ZONE; News  	492 words  	Classrooms at Rowland Hall upper and middle schools will be a little dimmer over the next several weeks -- and possibly for many years to come.LiNeBrEaKBoth schools have pledged to use natural light instead of electricity to illuminate their classrooms, offices and hallways whenever possible. It is part of the Green Cup Challenge, a friendly competition among 124 schools in 24 states and Canada that kicked off Monday and runs through Feb. 23. LiNeBrEaKStudents will flip off light switches, unplug surge protectors and set their computers to sleep or hibernate in an effort to save as much energy as possible. The Green Cup Challenge will expand to other conservation issues, such as recycling. This year, it focuses on electricity.LiNeBrEaKRowland Hall sustainability consultant Mary Jacquin said she hopes the challenge will lead to long-term changes. Jacquin favors a proactive approach and hopes to inspire students to reduce their energy use.LiNeBrEaK"There are changes we can make that are not beyond us," Jacquin said. "If we sit around and wait for other people to make changes, it's not going to happen."LiNeBrEaKThe school that wins the Green Cup Challenge will have made the biggest percentage decrease to their electricity bill.LiNeBrEaKLast week, the middle and upper schools met to learn about the competition. To get students fired up, the principals engaged in some spirited trash-talking in an onstage skit.LiNeBrEaKAfter asking middle school Principal Stephen Bennhoff if he had a phone, upper school Principal Lee Thomsen landed the following zinger:LiNeBrEaK"I want you to call your mama, because when we get done with this challenge, you are going to go crying to your mama."LiNeBrEaKAfter the principals boasted their school would conserve more energy, the assembly took a sobering turn when Chris Hill, a University of Utah biochemistry professor and Rowland Hall dad, took the stage to talk about the effect electricity production has on the environment.LiNeBrEaK"Electricity generation is the single biggest environmental problem that we face," Hill told students. LiNeBrEaKCurrent production methods make us too dependent on foreign oil, which leads to national security problems, Hill said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough electricity is clean at the point of use, making it is dirty, the professor said, noting that 95 percent of the electricity produced in Utah is made by burning coal -- the leading cause of smog, acid rain and global warming.LiNeBrEaKElectricity likely will be created with wind turbines and solar and geothermal energy. For now, it's important to conserve, Hill said.LiNeBrEaKIf you need a reason to conserve, Jacquin said, stick your head out the window and inhale the filthy mixture of air and grime that recently hit the valley.LiNeBrEaK"I have memories of similar [pollution problems] as a child," said Jacquin, who grew up in California. "We didn't know better. There was nobody ... doing anything about it."LiNeBrEaKRowland Hall is now taking steps to do something about it.LiNeBrEaKOnly time will tell which principal will go crying to his mama.LiNeBrEaKndicou@sltrib.com	EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (90%); SCHOOL PRINCIPALS (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); PRIMARY and SECONDARY EDUCATION (89%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (89%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (89%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (89%); POWER PLANTS (77%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (77%); WIND ENERGY (77%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (77%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (76%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (74%); SOLAR ENERGY (72%); GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (72%); AIR POLLUTION (67%); SMOG (62%); ACID RAIN (60%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); NATIONAL SECURITY (50%)  			SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (94%) UTAH, USA (97%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	February 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  				Salt Lake City - Students in Paul Christensen's AP Calculus class at Rowland Hall upper school in Salt Lake City are silhouetted against a row of east facing windows in Paul Christensen's AP Calculus class at Rowland Hall upper school Monday January 26, 2009.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	January was not San Jose's warmest month, but still  	By Mike Swift Mercury News  	BREAKING; Weather; News  	640 words  	As she flipped on the air conditioning during her morning commute to Silicon Valley from Berkeley on Friday, it struck Ruth Storm as kind of strange that she'd need the A/C in January.LiNeBrEaKBut as she sat in her T-shirt on her lunch break in downtown Los Altos, munching a sandwich in the brilliant sun, the Calgary native concluded that it wasn't so bad. "I got on Facebook and said, 'I can't believe it's not summer.' And my Canadian friends were all like, 'Damn you Californians,' " Storm said with a smile.LiNeBrEaKWhile January's chilly nights have kept the month from being the warmest on record in San Jose, the average daily high temperature of 63. 16 degrees, with one day left in the month, is the third-warmest since 1893, according to data collected by Golden Gate Weather Services. LiNeBrEaKFriday's high temperature was 67 degrees in San Jose, about six degrees above normal, and what normally is one of the two coldest months of the year will end today with a forecast high temperature of 66 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKAnd for the entire Bay Area, climate scientists at San Jose State University say it may well turn out to be the warmest January on record.LiNeBrEaK"You can't tie this to global warming right now," said Eugene Cordero, a climate scientist at San Jose State University. "But this is the kind of thing we expect to see happening more and more often, so it's a harbinger of what's to come."LiNeBrEaKClimate scientists won't be able to make a final pronouncement about whether this was the Bay Area's warmest January until Jan. 31 is in the books.LiNeBrEaKBut because California is so highly dependent on winter rains and Sierra snowpack that could be affected by climate change, the abnormally warm weather "is something to be concerned about," said Cordero, the author of "Cool Cuisine: Taking the Bite out of Global Warming," a book about how food choices can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. "Obviously, our water resources are linked to this."LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that the same high-pressure system producing the warm, cloudless days and cool nights is also steering Pacific storm systems north of California. The result is that both San Jose and San Francisco have only had 51 percent of the normal rainfall for this time of the year, according to the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKTime is quickly running out for a wet winter.LiNeBrEaK"Most of the rain falls around January and February in our Mediterrean-type rain pattern, so once we pass February and going into March, it tends to be drier," said Diana Henderson, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. "So if (the rain) doesn't happen now I won't hold my breath to say it will happen after March or April."LiNeBrEaKCordero is bracing for another dry summer.LiNeBrEaK"I think water rations are something we're going to have to be dealing with," he said.LiNeBrEaKForecasters say that while it looks like the Bay Area has a chance for significant rain toward the end of next week, that storm alone won't be enough to get the region back on track. As of Friday, San Jose had received 4. 06 inches of rain this year; normal is 7. 89 inches.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the same high-pressure system that is blocking storms from hitting Northern California is also steering abundant snowfall over the Midwest and the East.LiNeBrEaKSo while the abnormally warm afternoons might have people thinking about climate change in the Bay Area, the weather probably is not prompting the same discussions in much of the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaK"You can't look at any given year, or any given singular weather event, and tie that to climate change," said Jan Null of Golden Gate Weather Services, a professor of meteorology at San Francisco State University. "Climate by definition is long-term averages. Somebody on the East Coast right now, you mention Global Warming to them and they'll say, 'Say what?'

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	GREGOIRE UNVEILS 'GREEN JOBS' LEGISLATION\ BUT TIMING, PACE RAISE CONCERNS IN BAD ECONOMY  	JUDY VUE P-I reporter  	NEWS; Pg. A17  	637 words  	Creating a green economy has always been one of Gov. Chris Gregoire's goals, and she emphasized that Thursday when she unveiled a package of legislation focused on creating green jobs and reducing the state's carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaKThe legislation contains House Bill 1819 and its equivalent Senate Bill 5735. Both bills would implement a cap and trade system in partnership with six states and four Canadian provinces, which are part of a coalition called the Western Climate Initiative. LiNeBrEaKThe system would put a cap on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that major companies produce, and they would need a permit to allow them to keep emitting at or under the set cap.LiNeBrEaKCompanies could auction their permits to one another in an open market and would have to innovate and transition toward using renewable energy. If passed, the program would not take place until 2012.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the cap and trade bill, a proposed $455 million will be invested for projects that emphasize energy efficiency and clean-energy technology. These investments would help support 2,900 jobs for the next two years, according to the Office of Financial Management.LiNeBrEaKGregoire also proposed a tax exemption for plug-in electric vehicles so as to encourage Washington residents to buy electric cars.LiNeBrEaKShe said that Congress was working on similar legislation, but she wanted Washington to take the lead.LiNeBrEaK"Let us be an example of how to do it right," she said at a news conference. "We can have a competitive advantage to reap awards of a green economy."LiNeBrEaKConcerns were raised about moving the legislation forward at such a fast pace in the face of massive layoffs and a bad economy. Some Republicans are particularly worried about it.LiNeBrEaK"I support green jobs, but how many of those blue collar jobs will we lose for green collar jobs?" asked Rep. Shelly Short, R-Addy, who is also the ranking Republican of the Ecology and Parks Committee.LiNeBrEaKClimate change legislation "is moving on such a fast track and that concerns me. (Republicans) are OK with renewable energy, but we don't think it has to be an either-or basis. I don't think we ought to risk this kind of proposal," she said.LiNeBrEaKGregoire acknowledged that unemployment was a problem, but she said that was more reason why investments in a green economy should be made.LiNeBrEaK"This is an opportunity for us to kick-start our economy with transportation projects that are shovel-ready and with green jobs that are shovel-ready. Look at Detroit. It is in much worse economic times than Washington state (because) we continued to produce the vehicle of yesterday. You can't wait to come out of a deep recession. It's time for us to ready ourselves," she said.LiNeBrEaKFour lawmakers showed their support at the press conference, including Sen. Phil Rockefeller, D-Bainbridge Island, who is also the primary sponsor of the bill.LiNeBrEaKThough all the lawmakers who came were Democrats, Rockefeller said it wasn't "universal" among the GOP that they didn't support Gregoire's legislation. "I have a Republican who is going to sign on to it," he said.LiNeBrEaKRockefeller also said that the bill is tailored in a way that would allow for an open dialogue with the business community.LiNeBrEaKGregoire "wants to look at how to set up such a market mechanism so that it works with integrity," he said.LiNeBrEaKIf the proposed cap and trade bill passes, the effects will also be felt by major companies. Puget Sound Energy said it had already been working with Gregoire on the climate change issue for some time.LiNeBrEaK"We're still studying the proposal," said PSE spokesman Andy Wappler. "If we think it's the right steps, we are committed to moving ahead."LiNeBrEaKPublic hearings of both the House and Senate bills will be held in Olympia on Tuesday. Both separate hearings are scheduled at 10 a.m., which is likely to change.LiNeBrEaKMeeting schedules can be found at leg.wa.gov/legislature.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	STEINBERG PARTIES WITH THE ANIMALS  		TBT; SUPER BOWL XLIII; Pg. 47  	387 words  	What is it: One of the Super Bowl's premier annual parties staged by sports agent Leigh Steinberg, the real-life inspiration for the movie Jerry Maguire. LiNeBrEaKWhere and when: 2 to 5 p.m. at Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa.LiNeBrEaKWho will be there: Steinberg boasts that his annual shindig is the counter to the conventional, "dark, noisy, crowded nighttime party," one that traditionally mixes politicians, athletes and celebrities. He said he expects a mix of NFL owners and players, politicians and celebrities including Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey and Michael Phelps. Past attendees include Jerry Jones, Troy Aikman, Warren Moon, Steve Young, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rob Schneider, Jamie Foxx, Oliver Stone and Jay Leno. Over the years, entertainment has ranged from jugglers to performers on stilts to Outkast. Steinberg said Schneider once came dressed as a "bad Richard Simmons." He ate ding-dongs, smoked and ended up under the bar drunk. A camera crew from Leno's show captured the scene and aired it.LiNeBrEaKCan you get in?Absolutely not. It's invitation-only and guests are asked to refrain from asking for autographs.LiNeBrEaKFood: It will include a "taste of Tampa Bay," with several local restaurants offering favorites such as Frenchy's crab soup. Steinberg always makes it a point to serve dishes native to the city, whether it's jambalaya in New Orleans or paella in Miami.LiNeBrEaKUnique themes: Steinberg's party has an eco-friendly theme, with a "green carpet" instead of a red carpet. Steingberg uses the party to promote his Sporting Green Alliance, which aims to use sports to combat global warming and bring environmentally sound initiatives like waterless urinals to stadiums. He's also working in conjunction with the NFL to recycle party waste and donate leftover snacks to the NFL Food Bank. A monitor will be set up so famous guests can connect with soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. "The point is the party stands for something," Steinberg said. "It stands for the philosophy of our firm, which is role modeling and using sports to make a positive change."LiNeBrEaKWhat else? The party will take up about a quarter of the zoo's space, but the zoo will be open for business. A silent auction will raise money for the zoo; Steinberg's mentoring group, Beating The Odds; and Generation Rescue, McCarthy's autism foundation. - Ernest Hooper ehooper@tampabay.com	CELEBRITIES (90%); SPORTS and RECREATION (90%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (90%); SPORTS (90%); ZOOS and AQUARIUMS (89%); STADIUMS and ARENAS (78%); SPORTS AGENTS and PROMOTERS (78%); RESTAURANTS (72%); SPORTS TEAM OWNERSHIP (70%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); FUNDRAISING (67%); FOOD CHARITIES (66%); AUTISM (50%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			TAMPA, FL, USA (92%); JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA (79%); NEW ORLEANS, LA, USA (68%); MIAMI, FL, USA (58%) FLORIDA, USA (92%); LOUISIANA, USA (68%) UNITED STATES (92%); AFGHANISTAN (66%); IRAQ (51%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Times Publishing Company All Rights Reserved  		JAY LENO (70%); MICHAEL PHELPS (57%)  		PHOTO, Getty Images: Leigh Steinberg poses with a friend during his bash at the Super Bowl in Jacksonville.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	UT MAKING STRIDES TOWARD CONSERVATION  	ELISABETH PARKER, Times Staff Writer  	CITY TIMES; Pg. 1  	715 words  	Traditional hotbeds of activism, universities are increasingly incorporating a commitment to the environment into classrooms and campuses.LiNeBrEaKConsider the organic salad bar at the University of California, Berkeley. Or a small school in Maine with only one major - human ecology.LiNeBrEaKBoth are among 602 colleges nationally whose presidents have committed to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions through the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment. LiNeBrEaKZooming in, the list includes the University of Florida, which recycles at every home football game, and the University of South Florida, with a fall guest lecture series on ways to make an environmental difference.LiNeBrEaKAdministrators at the University of Tampa are reviewing their commitment. In October, UT hosted the Earth Charter Climate Change Community Summit and has initiated campus-wide conservation efforts.LiNeBrEaK"I'm in awe as to how this has escalated," said Linda Devine, vice president for UT operations and planning, which recently added "increasing students' awareness of the needs for a healthy and sustainable environment" to UT's value statements.LiNeBrEaKOn the 100-acre campus along the Hillsborough River, administrators added organic and natural foods, including locally grown produce, to campus menu options.LiNeBrEaKLast spring they put up campuswide collection bins for paper recycling. Official stationary is from recycled stock, and some publications, like the faculty/staff newsletter and dining surveys, are now solely electronic.LiNeBrEaKNew campus constructions are equipped with low-flow toilets, shower heads and faucets.LiNeBrEaKAnd high-tech computer-monitored systems adjust temperatures and turn off lights when people leave.LiNeBrEaKUniversities are increasingly being graded on "greenness" by publications such as the Kaplan College Guide, which focused its 2009 issue on environmental responsibility.LiNeBrEaKIn August, the Princeton Review rated 534 schools on a scale from 60 to 99 by environmentally related policies, practices and academic offerings. The University of Florida scored a 97, although the University of South Florida scored only 60. Also, in the magazine's survey of college applicants last school year, 63 percent said a college's environmental commitment could influence their decision to go there.LiNeBrEaK"What's exciting for me personally is watching a new generation of students and staff engaging us globally with the environment," Devine said.LiNeBrEaKFaculty and students realize that some efforts to be more green-friendly may not fit into tight university budgets. But incorporating sustainability on campus is always a balance of efficiency and effectiveness, Devine said.LiNeBrEaK"We recognize we don't operate in a vacuum. Our students, faculty and staff wrap around the globe," she said. "We all want to do things that make good business sense."LiNeBrEaKLast summer at UT, a team of business graduate students worked with Daniel Verreault, an associate professor of accounting, to learn how to incorporate that balance of cost-effective practices in bay area businesses, while making efforts to be socially, economically and environmentally responsible.LiNeBrEaKThe grad students met to design criteria, which focused on people, profits and the planet. They found companies connecting with their local communities, converting to solar power and educating people about ways to be environmentally responsible.LiNeBrEaKAt the Earth Charter summit in October, 15 Tampa area businesses - picked by the grad students - were recognized and the Earth Charter Sustainable Business Coalition was launched. The coalition, made up of top executives and corporate officers, will help to shape Tampa Bay's sustainable economy.LiNeBrEaK"I think a lot of companies are taking sustainability seriously now," said Christine Goodwin, who is pursuing a master's in marketing at UT.LiNeBrEaKThe experience affected her personally. Besides learning how businesses can protect the environment while also looking at the bottom line, she is more conscious of the materials she uses and recycles. For instance, she now uses biodegradable, flushable bags to dispose of her dog's waste.LiNeBrEaK"We should educate people on ways to be sustainable," Verreault said. "It's something I definitely want to leave to our children and grandchildren.LiNeBrEaK"Shouldn't everybody want to do this?"LiNeBrEaKTimes researcher Will Gorham contributed to this story.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Final Edition	Meeting on proposed coal plant draws 100  	SUSAN HYLTON World Staff Writer  	News; Pg. A8  	390 words  	POTEAU An effort to warn residents about the harmful effects of a second coal-fired power plant at the AES Corp.'s Shady Point facility was fueled by demands to know the local impact on public health that the existing plant might already be causing. Area residents also wanted the power giant to be allowed to speak for itself in its effort to build a 630-megawatt coal-fired plant that would provide nearly double the amount of electricity produced at its existing facility in Panama, about 10 miles northwest of Poteau. About 100 people gathered Thursday night at Poteau High School for a meeting hosted by the Center for Energy Matters, a regional resident's group that has launched the "Two is Too Many" campaign.  LiNeBrEaKLundy Kiger, a spokesman for AES Shady Point, was disappointed with the five minutes he was allotted to speak at the two-hour meeting. "AES has the hall from 8 to 9 p.m. If you want to hear our intentions, you have a right to stay," he said as many in the crowd applauded. John Weddle, a physician from Sallisaw, said his biggest concerns about coal-powered plants in general are the undisputed air pollution, mercury emissions and health risks to people with respiratory diseases. Weddle said local statistics are not available to show a direct cause and effect of the existing plant's impact on public health. But "you can't argue that these are clean plants," he said. Coal contains mercury, which can harm the nervous system, and is the biggest fossil-fuel producer of carbon dioxide, which many scientists believe is the biggest contributor to global warming. Those emissions are not regulated. Center for Energy Matters spokesman Harlan Hentges said the cause of global warming can be debated but that there's no debate on other adverse effects of coal plants. Rick Ford of Heavener said AES is a good corporate citizen, and he characterized the Center for Energy Matters as a group of outsiders telling Poteau residents what is best for them. Kiger said the new plant will operate with the "Best Available Control Technology," which is the national standard for pollution control. "We live here. We work here. We raise our children here," he said. "We're as concerned as anyone else."

Jim Inhofe certainly doesn't represent me when he sides with the backwards auto industry against forward-thinking states that are trying to reduce auto emissions. Let's forget about global warming for a minute and just look at the fact that we have the ability to breathe cleaner air and our state just refuses to work in that direction ( and don't get me started on how we are still behind the times in protecting our workers from breathing secondhand smoke in the workplace). Ever wonder why Californians are the ones driving around in CNG and flex-fuel, hybrid and electric cars and have been for several years? Ever wonder why great public transportation is common in other states? Ever wonder why, as one of the states with the richest stores of natural gas, and the state with one of the largest, if not the largest producer of CNG conversion products, we aren't driving around in the less polluting, more fuel efficient, safer CNG vehicles? I don't profess to know the answers to these questions but I support our president and his efforts to help states become better stewards of our Earth and air.

USA TODAY 		January 30, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Old ways cloud the dawn of a new bipartisan era  		NEWS; Pg. 8A  	575 words  	It was just one vote in the early days of a new Congress and a new presidency, but it was hard not to see Wednesday's big zero -- not one of 177 House Republicans supported the economic stimulus bill -- as an ominous sign that Washington is still stuck in the bitterly polarized politics that has blocked progress on big issues for years.LiNeBrEaKThe process was a textbook example of what President Obama was talking about in his inaugural address when he referred to the "recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics." LiNeBrEaKIn this case, Democrats wanted more spending programs; Republicans wanted more tax cuts. The Democratic majority refused to yield, so the Republicans all voted no.LiNeBrEaKNobody can wave a wand and make deep ideological differences disappear, and one purpose of any party is to take a stand and show voters what it believes. But the job of leaders is to try to solve the nation's urgent problems, not just to wage a perpetual election campaign. Any lasting progress on issues with inherently unpopular solutions -- reforming Social Security, fixing health care or immigration, balancing the budget, or dealing with energy and global warming -- requires buy-in and concessions from both parties.LiNeBrEaKThis was a dress rehearsal for those efforts, and it wasn't promising. It's deeply disappointing that at one of the most perilous times in the nation's modern history, House members, egged on by their leaders, reverted to the same tired, tribal partisanship that has long poisoned the House.LiNeBrEaKNeither party is guilt-free here.LiNeBrEaKHouse Democrats drafted the stimulus bill among themselves with little or no Republican input until the measure got to committees, where the Democrats' superior numbers guaranteed they could beat back GOP amendments. Involving Republicans early in the process might have made for a better bill and undercut GOP complaints that they were locked out. The fact that Republicans acted in the same autocratic fashion when they ran the House is no excuse for Democrats to do the same just because, in the words of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, "we won the election."LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, we're not entirely convinced that Republicans would have bargained in good faith had they been asked in early on. GOP members are dogmatic about the virtue of tax cuts, even more so in this instance than Democrats were about the virtue of spending programs. It's laughable that Republicans who borrowed and spent with abandon during the Bush administration are suddenly trying to recast themselves as deficit hawks. Republicans' zeal to say no, and their leaders' rejection of the stimulus plan even before they met with Obama to discuss it, suggest that the party was as interested in scoring political points as it was in crafting a serious economic rescue.LiNeBrEaKObama came to office promising to curb this kind of partisanship, and so far he has been walking the walk. He repeatedly consulted with Republicans and invited leaders from both parties to the White House for drinks after the vote. That's useful, because when political opponents spend time together, it's harder for them to misunderstand and demonize each other.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate takes up the stimulus plan next week. With Democrats short of the 60 votes they need to shut off debate, Republicans wield more power there than they do in the House. We hope the Senate process yields a better bill -- and a clearer glimpse of the president's hoped-for post-partisan era.

A10  	265 words  	By David StringerLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKREYKJAVIK, IcelandLiNeBrEaKNATO will need a military presence in the Arctic as global warming melts frozen sea routes and major powers rush to lay claim to lucrative energy reserves, the military bloc's chief said Thursday. LiNeBrEaKNATO commanders and lawmakers meeting in Iceland's capital said the Arctic thaw is bringing the prospect of new standoffs between powerful nations.LiNeBrEaK"I would be the last one to expect military conflict - but there will be a military presence," NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told reporters. "It should be a military presence that is not overdone, and there is a need for political cooperation and economic cooperation."LiNeBrEaKThe opening of Arctic sea routes once navigable only by icebreakers threatens to complicate relations between countries with competing claims to Arctic territory - particularly as exploration for oil and natural gas becomes possible in once-inaccessible areas.LiNeBrEaKDe Hoop Scheffer said negotiations involving NATO, Russia and other nations will be key to preventing a future conflict. He is expected to meet Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov next week for talks.LiNeBrEaKThe United States, Russia and Canada are among the countries trying to claim jurisdiction over Arctic territory alongside Nordic nations. Analysts say China is also likely to join a rush to capture energy reserves.LiNeBrEaKSome scientists predict that Arctic waters could be ice-free in summers by 2013 . De Hoop Scheffer said trans-Arctic routes are likely to become an alternative to passage through the Suez or Panama canals for commercial shipping.

The Washington Times 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	A Senate gobsmack for the Oracle  	By Wesley Pruden, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; PRUDEN ON POLITICS; A04  	801 words  	Al Gore came to Capitol Hill this week, all decked out in his earth tones, with an old scribe's tale of destruction, doom and disaster. He was rewarded not with questions worthy of the world's greatest deliberate body but with what our English cousins call a "gobsmack." Right on the mouth.LiNeBrEaKIn an ordinary time and at an ordinary place, all iced in and with a wide stretch of the nation shivering in record single-digit misery, more talk about global warming - or "climate change" as we're supposed to call it now - would be regarded as a cheap and cruel joke. Since only a United States senator would leap at an invitation to go on such a snipe hunt, the Senate is where Al showed up with his graphs, factoids and PowerPoint presentation. LiNeBrEaK"We must face up to this urgent and unprecedented threat to the existence of our civilizations," he told a panel of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "This is the most serious challenge the world has ever faced. It could completely end civilization, and it is rushing at us with such speed and force." Even an old newspaperman like Al ran out of hyperbole.LiNeBrEaKBut this is the kind of sucker stuff senators like. Language like this can sell schemes to other incredulous senators worth billions and billions of the dollars ordinary people work long and hard to contribute to the public till. You could see visions of sugarplums dancing behind rheumy Senate eyes.LiNeBrEaKRichard Lugar of Indiana, a Republican who gets along with Democrats better than with his own party, was moved almost to poesy, agreeing with Al that the global warming he described would cause "an almost existential impact." Existentialism, the curse of the common cause, is hard for a senator to define, but he knows it when he thinks he sees it.LiNeBrEaKJohn Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the panel, is a devoted wind surfer at his home in France, so he's understandably concerned that the destruction of the planet as we know it would alter wind currents aloft, even in France, making it difficult to get to dinner on time. Four-star Michelin restaurants rarely hold reservations for tardy Americans. "Share with us, if you could," the senator told Al, "sort of the immediate vision that you see in the transformative process as we move to this new economy."LiNeBrEaK"Geothermal energy," Al replied. "This has great potential, and it's not very far off." Mr. Kerry beamed a happy beam, reassured that the friendly French air might not be disturbed, after all.LiNeBrEaKAl talked his doomsday talk as if the eminent crash of Spaceship Earth is a settled fact unless the senators intervene. The senators, who imagine they have the power to order the sun to quit having sunspots, eagerly agreed.LiNeBrEaKOnly when James Risch of Idaho, a Republican, asked when the last man on earth could expect to be fried, sauteed or parboiled did Al reveal an ever so slight crack in his mortal certainty.LiNeBrEaK"I don't claim the expertise to answer a question like that," he said.LiNeBrEaKSeveral senators paled, as if affrighted by this unexpected doubt of infallibility in Delphi. It was a particularly difficult moment for Johnny Isakson of Georgia, a Republican, who mildly challenged Al with a question about the risks and dangers in spent nuclear fuel. He would have pulled at his forelock if he had one: "I stand to be corrected, and I defer to your position, you're probably right and I'm probably wrong. I'm not questioning you, I'm questioning myself."LiNeBrEaKThe gobsmacking of silly senators aside, Al has good reason to declare the debate over, even if no one else does. A growing number of eminent scientists - thousands at last count - do indeed question Al's "science," and with no tugging of scholarly forelocks.LiNeBrEaKMr. Kerry scoffed at the snow and ice that accompanied Al to Washington as "a little snow" that "does nothing to diminish the reality of the crisis," but many weather scientists have taken due note of the severity of recent winters and the decline in average temperatures over the past decade. Al and his conspirators have changed "global warming crisis" to "climate change."LiNeBrEaKWell, if the weather changes, and most of us have seen it do that with our own eyes, why not change the language of the scam?LiNeBrEaKThis manufactured crisis has cost us plenty already, hobbling oil exploration, preventing the construction of new refineries, even driving up the cost of groceries. None of these hardships touch the senators who feed so well at our expense, of course, and many of them are determined to help Al milk the public cow. The senators don't want an honest debate, either.LiNeBrEaKWe must be thankful for the new hard times. Maybe we can't have Wall Street bailouts and Senate handouts at the same time. Hard times stand between us and the grim consequences of Al and his bad science.LiNeBrEaK* Wesley Pruden is editor emeritus of The Washington Times.

The Washington Times 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	Obama comment gets icy reception  	By Jennifer Harper, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A13  	485 words  	Go ahead. Talk about the weather. We dare you.LiNeBrEaKPolite chitchat, it's not. When President Obama blithely chided Washington locals for shuttering their schools during a junior-grade snowfall, righteous indignation and a media blizzard followed. LiNeBrEaKMore than 500 news stories about Mr. Obama's now infamous "snow jab" appeared within hours. Pundits offered weather puns about icy reactions and flaky behavior. And oh, the irony.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness to this town," Mr. Obama said.LiNeBrEaKOf course, it took a 15-car motorcade to get the president and first lady Michelle Obama for an appointment at their daughter's school on Thursday, a moment not lost on journalists.LiNeBrEaK"The tough Chicagoans arrived back at the White House shortly before 10 a.m.," said the Christian Science Monitor.LiNeBrEaKThe Washington City paper reported a 2,000 percent surge in its Web traffic as cold-hearted bloggers defended their turf. The global press chimed in.LiNeBrEaK"Obama no wimp in winter, but try Ottawa," Toronto's Globe and Mail advised.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the press already was primed for bad weather. The inauguration had been a deep freeze. Al Gore warned Congress about global warming while flakes swirled outside the U.S. Capitol. A fatal ice storm had gripped the Midwest.LiNeBrEaK"People can't get enough of weather news. Weather is the only thing all of us encounter day in, day out - it affects everybody, it's the most common source of conversation," said Ken Reeves, a meteorologist for AccuWeather.LiNeBrEaKHe has a point. Americans take in 300 billion weather forecasts a year, with weather typically ranking among the top 10 news stories each year, according to the Pew Research Center.LiNeBrEaK"So the president throws down the gauntlet about weather, and everybody's going to react," Mr. Reeves added.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Obama's press travails are nothing compared with those of groundhog Punxsutawney Phil.LiNeBrEaK"Media credentialing" has begun for Phil's big moment on Monday, when the corpulent marmot emerges to make his weather prediction from what appears to be a shoe box on a sound stage, as cameras roll and a crowd roars.LiNeBrEaKThe global media is all over this one, too.LiNeBrEaK"We have two TV crews coming from Japan, one from Germany, one from Russia," said Mary Jude, spokeswoman for the event.LiNeBrEaK"The foreign press is much more interested in the historic aspects of Phil - how he started, and so on. The American press wants more news about the parties, the events," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe great state of Pennsylvania is prepared to showcase the Phil brand.LiNeBrEaKFestivities begin Friday - including "Groundhog Comedy Club Night," the "Groundhog Wine Trail Food and Arts Fest" and the "Prognosticators Ball."LiNeBrEaKIn a nod to either Elvis or Vegas, the city of Punxsutawney also offers "Phil's Wedding Chapel," with nuptials performed by the mayor.LiNeBrEaK"It all goes to show you that a lot of people want to know if we're getting six more weeks of winter or spring," observed Ms. Jude.

The Washington Times 		January 30, 2009 Friday 	World is getting colder;  It's the sun, not CO2, that's to blame 	By David J. Bellamy and Mark Duchamp, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	OPED; A23  	700 words  	After the wet and cold centuries of the Little Ice Age (around 1550-1850 A.D.), the world's climate recuperated some warmth, but did not replicate the balmy period known as the Middle Age Warm Period (around 800-1300 A.D.), when the margins of Greenland were green and England had vineyards.LiNeBrEaKClimate began to cool again after World War II, for about 30 years. This is undisputed. The cooling occurred at a time when emissions of C02 were rising sharply from the reconstruction effort and from unprecedented development. It is important to realize that. LiNeBrEaKBy 1978 it had started to warm again, to everybody's relief. But two decades later, after the temperature peaked in 1998 under the influence of El Nino, climate stopped warming for eight years; and in 2007 entered a cooling phase marked by lower solar radiation and a reversal of the cycles of warm ocean temperature in the Atlantic and the Pacific. And here again, it is important to note that this new cooling period is occurring concurrently with an acceleration in CO2 emissions, caused by the emergence of two industrial giants: China and India.LiNeBrEaKTo anyone analyzing this data with common sense, it is obvious that factors other than CO2 emissions are ruling the climate. And the same applies to other periods of the planet's history. Al Gore, in his famous movie "The Inconvenient Truth," had simply omitted to say that for the past 420,000 years that he cited as an example, rises in CO2 levels in the atmosphere always followed increases in global temperature by at least 800 years. It means that CO2 can't possibly be the cause of the warming cycles.LiNeBrEaKSo, if it's not CO2, what is it that makes the world's temperature periodically rise and fall? The obvious answer is the sun, and sea currents in a subsidiary manner.LiNeBrEaKThe tilt of the earth, the shape of the earth's orbit (distance to the sun), and the earth's "wobble" as it turns around the sun are all important factors in the cyclical recurrence of ice ages and interglacial periods. It has been observed that ice ages last about 100,000 years, and warm interglacials only 12,000. And within these warm periods, variations in solar activity cause shorter periods of less-pronounced warming and cooling.LiNeBrEaKThere is no way to know for sure if the present cooling period will last several decades or 100,000 years. Russian scientists have just warned that a fully-blown ice age is not to be ruled out, as about 12,000 years have elapsed since the end of the last one.LiNeBrEaKEntering a new ice age would be a disaster for humanity: billions of people could die from lack of food, from the cold, and from the collapse of the world economy, social strife, war, etc.LiNeBrEaKAnd if what's ahead of us is only a little ice age, the consequences would still be pretty dire. World food reserves are already low, and we can barely feed the current population of the planet. Surfaces of arable land used for bio-fuels and biomass are increasing. Cool and wet summers would cause crop failures as they did in the Little Ice Age (as a result, starving Parisians had taken to the streets, soon sending their king to the guillotine). Winter frost would also bring its share of misery, destroying fruits and vegetables on a large scale.LiNeBrEaKLet's just hope we'll only have a few years of cooling, and that another warming period will follow. But it may be wishful thinking. In any case, there will be hardship during the cold cycle, whatever its length.LiNeBrEaKAs President Obama takes office, and as the European Union is about to waste one trillion euros to de-carbonize the economy (in a bid to stop nonexistent man-made global warming) they would be well-advised to perform a reality check on what's currently happening to the climate. Talking to independent scientists about the positive properties of CO2 (plant food that enhances crops) would also be a good idea.LiNeBrEaKIf they don't, we may be in for mass starvation. And let's not forget that the world population is increasing by about 78 million every year.LiNeBrEaKDavid J. Bellamy is a professor at three British universities and an officer in several conservation organizations. Mark Duchamp, a retired businessman, has investigated global- warming theory and written more than 100 articles.

The Washington Post 		January 30, 2009 Friday   Every Edition	A Ticket to 'Policeman's Balls' Benefit Concerts  	Jen Chaney; washingtonpost.com Staff Writer  	WEEKEND; Pg. WE38  	539 words  	The earnest celebrity benefit has become a well-meaning cliche. Whenever a crisis occurs -- whether it's famine,  global warming or natural disaster -- we practically expect a bunch of famous people to put on a show and urge us to donate cash to the worthy cause. LiNeBrEaKBut the "Secret Policeman's Balls," a series of benefits for Amnesty International born in Great Britain during the late '70s, was a bit different. Yes, like the numerous charity performances it inspired, the "Secret Policeman" effort did something good: specifically, raising money for an organization that takes a stance against human rights violations.  And it did so with typical Monty Pythonesque irreverence. Consider how John Cleese answered a reporter's question in 1981 about Amnesty International: "I think they're a bunch of pinko, tennis-shoe-wearing, untrustworthy, snot-eyed gits. [Pause.] Shouldn't I have said that?"LiNeBrEaKMuch more of that sort of cheeky humor can be found in "The Secret Policeman's Balls" ($39. 99), a three-DVD set released this week  that contains all five of the concert films based on Amnesty International shows from 1976 to 1989. The performers include British comedy veterans (including several members of Monty Python and the influential troupe Beyond the Fringe), then-up-and-comers (Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry and an especially fresh-faced Hugh Laurie) and high-profile musical acts (Pete Townshend, Sting, Duran Duran and Eric Clapton). The results of this sketch-comedy/rock-and-roll hybrid are often hilarious, distinctly British and historically notable as they did indeed kickstart numerous charity movements, from Comic Relief to Live Aid, that would follow.LiNeBrEaKThese films have not been remastered, so don't expect pristine footage. The movies are decades old and they  look it, a fact that may charm those who have warm, fuzzy feelings about the late '70s and '80s and may irritate viewers who expect to see everything they watch in high-definition perfection.LiNeBrEaKFortunately, any frustration caused by the picture quality should be mitigated by the extras, which include additional performance footage; amusing promotional spots and news coverage surrounding the release of the films; a discussion of how the concerts got their name; cheery commentary tracks from "Secret Policeman" producer Martin Lewis; and the entertaining 86-minute BBC documentary "Remember the Secret Policeman's Ball?"LiNeBrEaKOf course, all that may be of interest only to a very niche audience. Monty Python fanatics, students of British comedy and the nostalgia-obsessed will be thrilled to finally have all these films on DVD. As for everyone else? Well, I can promise at least a few laughs and, perhaps more important, a few dollars to Amnesty International. A portion of the proceeds go to the organization.LiNeBrEaKMost Ironic Trivia: During his commentary track for the film "The Secret Policeman's Other Ball," Lewis notes that he got into a huge argument with Bob Geldof, the Boomtown Rats frontman who would go on to organize the Live Aid concerts. Geldof refused to perform in the 1981 concert. Why? He told Lewis that benefit shows were "a complete waste of time." He eventually agreed to perform and clearly had an experience that changed his opinion permanently.

West Central Tribune (Willmar, Minnesota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 30, 2009 Friday 	Move to renewable energy offers opportunities for rural areas  	Tom Cherveny, West Central Tribune, Willmar, Minn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	621 words  	Jan. 30--MILAN -- A week ago Lois Quam was in the United Arab Emirates, where she represented Piper Jaffray and Company of Minneapolis as oil producing states in the Middle East looked at how to invest their petroleum profits in what many see as the future: renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThursday she was in Milan, where many want to make the community and region a leader in that future. LiNeBrEaK"We stand on the brink of a very exciting time in the world," Quam told an audience in the basement of the geothermal-heated Kviteseid Lutheran Church.LiNeBrEaKQuam, who joined Piper Jaffray as managing director of alternative investments in energy and clean technology in 2007, had previously been ranked by Fortune magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in the country in her role as CEO of Ovations, United Health Group. A Lutheran minister's daughter, Quam said her change of focus to alternative energy was inspired by Will Steger's call for action to reduce global climate change.LiNeBrEaKHer message to Milan is that changes as profound as those brought about by the industrial revolution are in the making. The interest in developing renewable energy sources to replace dwindling fossil fuel supplies and reduce carbon dioxide emissions is worldwide, Quam said.LiNeBrEaKShe believes the change to a renewable-based energy economy will be driven by rural areas. They have the physical assets, such as wind and farm-raised biomass. Thanks to the Internet and its ability to shrink distance, rural areas also have an equal footing when it comes to conducting business.LiNeBrEaK"Distance is no longer the most important thing in that," she said. "Point of view matters."LiNeBrEaKIn that, rural areas might just have the real advantage. She predicts that many of the businesses that succeed in creating a new, "green" economy will be small.LiNeBrEaKJust like in the early days of the industrial revolution, many of the largest and seemingly successful companies are the most resistant to the change that is coming, according to Quam.LiNeBrEaK"It's a whole lot harder to change an existing company than to start anew," she said.LiNeBrEaKThere are a host of new, startup companies looking to tap the rural area's biomass, wind and solar resources, according to Doug Cameron, a former Silicon Valley venture capitalist now with Piper Jaffray Investments.LiNeBrEaKCameron said he also sees a growing interest in rebuilding America's chemical industry by replacing oil with biobased materials raised on farms.LiNeBrEaK"Minnesota has great potential," he said. "It could be a leader for biomass worldwide."LiNeBrEaKCameron and Quam said investors are interested in the state's growing renewable energy sector, but also cautioned that capital is difficult to attract for any venture in the current economy.LiNeBrEaK"It is a very difficult time in the financial markets right now to do this, but that will change," said Quam. "Good companies will find ways to get things done."LiNeBrEaKShe and Cameron encouraged Milan and this region to look toward President Obama's economic stimulus plan for the initial capital to launch projects.LiNeBrEaKQuam, who was once honored as the state's leading Norwegian-American, also encouraged Milan to exploit its well-known connections to Norway. The Scandinavian country "gets it" when it comes to renewable energy, and has invested its oil wealth to become one of the world's leaders in renewable energy, she said.

Al Jazeera (Doha, Qatar)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Reporter's diary: Savouring Davos  	Stephen Cole, Al Jazeera, Doha, Qatar  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	706 words  	Jan. 29--DOHA, Qatar -- The world's bankers, meeting at the 39th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, are continuing to enjoy their merry money-go-round of million dollar bonuses even as their customers suffer.LiNeBrEaKMillions of people are losing their jobs around the world; many are at risk of losing their homes while banks are continuing to refuse to lend money even to thriving businesses. LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, the throngs of world bankers and financiers celebrated their first night at Davos with champagne receptions at the $800-a-night Belvedere Hotel.LiNeBrEaKI went to watch the fat cats purring over the lobster cappuccino and the fois gras nibbles.LiNeBrEaK'Crisis, what crisis?'LiNeBrEaKThe attitude seemed to be that this was a great opportunity for bankers to put on their serious faces and talk about solutions while eating and drinking at receptions and dinners taking place all along Davos High Street.LiNeBrEaKThe bankers and world money-men here all blame the politicians; the politicians blame the financiers. It's a good game to play when you have an index-linked pension and the last bonus paid off the mortgage.LiNeBrEaKIf their customers could see them the frustration would be tangible and, I suspect, often violent.LiNeBrEaKBut now the bankers have new masters and an announcement made in Davos at the World Economic Forum that some of them are no longer in the driving seat would have raised cheers from Africa to the Middle East.LiNeBrEaKThat is because Citigroup has been forced to scrap the purchase of a $50m executive jet now that the bank is reliant on public support.LiNeBrEaKEven in the middle of financial meltdown, Citigroup was still planning to go-ahead with the purchase, but Tim Geithner, the new US treasury secretary, made them back down.LiNeBrEaKIt speaks volumes for the sensitivity of Wall Street that they could not see why the public might disagree with executives still using private jets while the world goes bankrupt.LiNeBrEaKPost crisis worldLiNeBrEaKThe theme at Davos this year is "shaping the post-crisis world". It is ambitious to say the least.LiNeBrEaKWho knows how long it will take to experience a post-crisis world?LiNeBrEaKClimate change, food and water security are the other big issues.LiNeBrEaKBut the Forum is really paying lip-service to the environmentalists by including those topics because this conference is all about money.LiNeBrEaKNothing else really counts here.LiNeBrEaKEven the carnage in Gaza is not rating any real serious top-level discussion.LiNeBrEaKSalam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, is staying away as is Tzipi Livni, the Israeli foreign minister. They have the real world to talk about, not just academic hot air.LiNeBrEaKRussian prime minister Vladimir Putin is here. At least he is used to cold climates. But perhaps he is hoping for a warmer reception from Europeans trying to persuade him to keep the energy taps on.LiNeBrEaKInternational corporate bosses arrived through the day dressed casually because that is the style in Davos.LiNeBrEaKAll are accompanied by their pretty young "gate-keepers" whose job it is to stop anybody talking to their bosses and who must get them to their lunch appointments on time.LiNeBrEaKMany have their skiing gear too. My first guest was Lord Levene of Portsoken. He told me he had enjoyed three brilliant days on the pistes around Davos and Klosters before his first meetings. Lucky man.LiNeBrEaKChief executive officers (CEOs) from all corners of the globe are among the 2,500 participants arriving here.LiNeBrEaKOne of them, Dell CEO Michael Dell, has been laying off people -- but he has still found the money to cross the world to come to chat and network and, of course, the cost is probably tax deductible.LiNeBrEaKTell that to the man who has a family to support and no income to do so.LiNeBrEaKLast night as I was walking through the snow, still falling, as it had all day, I met an American woman who stopped to talk.LiNeBrEaK"You must come to my husband's forum tomorrow" she said, "it's all about possibility."LiNeBrEaKHe's a conductor, by the way."LiNeBrEaKWho cares?

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Online Edition	Thinking Right;  Environmental virtue, trauma care, emissions 	JIM WOOTEN; Staff  		796 words  	Thursday, January 29, 2009, 06: 50 PMLiNeBrEaKThinking Right's weekend free-for-all. Pick a topic:LiNeBrEaKWhen global warming threatens to destroy life on this planet, as Al Gore would have us believe, rush to the intersection of North Highland and Virginia Avenue in Atlanta. That's now a "carbon-neutral zone." In a carbon-neutral zone, the owners of small businesses can feel environmentally virtuous and be identified as such, for fees ranging from $10 a year for a small sweet shop to $600 for a restaurant. It's the environmental version of the good feeling you get for slipping a few coins to a panhandler.LiNeBrEaKAbsolutely, with all deliberate speed the Georgia General Assembly should pass legislation proposed by state Sen. Preston Smith (R-Rome) to make the board of the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council advisory. Quick, yes, advisory. Board members have too many competing agendas. Their primary one should be to help the director, Mack Crawford, accomplish a difficult job without unlimited access to the public treasury. LiNeBrEaKI've never understood why it's vital to know who owns my mortgage, so long as I have a competent servicing representatives and my payments are properly recorded. Every time I hear a complaint about the inability to determine the actual mortgage-holder, I'm inclined to believe some deadbeat's looking for a loophole to avoid paying an honest debt.LiNeBrEaKUGA's women gymnastics coach Suzanne Yoculan thinks she's being kept out of the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame because she's sharing a home with Don Leeburn, a powerful member of the Georgia Board of Regents who's still married to somebody else. OK. Reason enough. Next self-declared victim?LiNeBrEaKLetting California and 13 other states set their own limits on auto emissions does require automakers to build cars for each market, which is inherently inefficient. That, or as the Obama leftists hope, all cars are manufactured to California standards. If that's the regulation, auto companies should be paid from the public till. This is a future problem, incidentally, with having government get in bed with private companies. Car companies become the manufacturing arms of interest-group political agendas.LiNeBrEaKSurvey sez! Sixty-nine percent of Georgians are willing to pay $25 per year or more to fund trauma hospitals statewide. Ah, but there's a catch. They mostly want the levy on somebody else --- with 74 percent supporting higher traffic fines (as Gov. Sonny Perdue proposes) and 61. 3 percent wanting additional taxes on gun sales. The latter prompts the question: Did anybody outside downtown Decatur, Rome, Marietta and Athens get polled? The question on whether people are willing to pay more for this or that should be phrased: "How much in higher taxes are you personally willing to pay to provide...?" Another option is to phrase it this way: "How much are you willing to tax interest groups seeking more of your money for their causes?"LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama gets the first dividend check from the Axis of Evil on his new be-nice-and-hope foreign policy. Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defines "change" as abandoning Israel and apologizing to the Islamic world for past sins, while withdrawing U.S. military forces back to the homeland and presumably diverting them to police anti-Muslim hate speech. Live by the buzzword, die by the buzzword.LiNeBrEaKState Rep. Austin Scott (R-Tifton) wants to be governor. Starting out that journey with a proposal to add a $10 tax to the purchase of auto tags is an odd way to solicit notice.LiNeBrEaKIf a bank's stock price is lower than its yield on a three-month CD and together they don't add up to 5, the economy's bad.LiNeBrEaKIt's not been widely noticed, but U.S. Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) is becoming an important figure in the conservative movement nationally. He's chairman of the House Republican Study Committee, which had offered a sound alternative to the massive social spending eruption that Pelosi Democrats are passing off as "economic stimulus." The study committee includes 108 of the 178 House Republicans, same as in the last Congress --- except that Republicans lost 20 seats in November. Of 22 Republican freshmen, 20 have joined the policy group Price chairs. LiNeBrEaKTwo coaches who deserved to be fired or removed and were: The one in Texas who had no second thoughts about allowing his girls team to beat another 100-0 and the one in Clayton County who allowed the Jonesboro High School dance team to perform a provocative halftime dance in thigh-high stockings, tiny shorts and tight shirts. The dance team has been disbanded, a proper response from school officials.LiNeBrEaKAJC looking for new conservative columnist. Is it you?

The Bakersfield Californian  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: New tailpipe standards were overdue: ARRAY(0xbc6f2dc)  	The Bakersfield Californian  	COMMENTARY  	647 words  	Jan. 29--Californians should cheer President Obama's order this week that moves the state closer to setting tougher limits on pollutants spewed from the tailpipes of new vehicles sold in California.LiNeBrEaKLast year, the Bush administration blocked California's air cleanup initiative directed toward automobile emissions. The nation's automakers also filed a lawsuit to block California from requiring cleaner-burning and more fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKObama's order directs the federal Environmental Protection Agency to consider California's request to begin a state program aimed at cutting auto emissions tied to global warming by 30 percent by 2016. California has been joined by 17 other states that said they will follow California's rules if enacted. LiNeBrEaKAutomakers claim the rules will increase costs when the industry already is on such shaky financial ground that the government has been compelled to pledge $17. 4 billion in federal "bailout" loans to keep plant doors open.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and other supporters of a waiver allowing California to adopt tougher pollution rules for new vehicles sold in the state contend automakers have been stalling necessary changes.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers and environmentalists are both right. If California is allowed to adopt tougher vehicle pollution rules, likely it will lead the way for the rest of the nation. Automakers' costs will be huge.LiNeBrEaKA final decision by the EPA is several months away. If the agency grants California's request, it will require automakers to produce cleaner-burning vehicles to sell in states with tougher emission rules.LiNeBrEaKBut a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling will first require the Obama administration to determine if greenhouse-gas emissions those targeted by California's tougher tailpipe limits endanger public health or welfare, which is the legal threshold under the federal Clean Air Act for regulating greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers and the Bush administration should have been more proactive years ago. If they hadn't stonewalled demands for more fuel-efficient and pollution-reducing vehicles, automakers would be better positioned to weather today's bleak economy. Consumers' demand for American-made vehicles would have rivaled or surpassed their demand for foreign vehicles.LiNeBrEaKAll that is so much water under the bridge. Financially distressed American automakers now are dealing with a new president who campaigned to support such cleanup initiatives as California's.LiNeBrEaKThe strings tied to the $17. 4 billion in loans pledged to GM and Chrysler last month under the Bush administration's watch give President Obama the leverage to force cleanup initiatives on automakers. California's and the nation's air quality, and people's health, will benefit from reducing pollutants spewed from tailpipes.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama and Californians must not ignore today's financial realities. Tougher pollution standards and the need to change American manufacturing processes come at a high cost. They come at a time when the dollars to cover costs are not there.LiNeBrEaKRealistic deadlines and financial incentives that means federal financial help will be required to help automakers meet tougher emission standards.LiNeBrEaKWe are encouraged by automakers' muted response to Obama's action this week.LiNeBrEaK"We are ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach," Dave McCurdy of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers told The Sacramento Bee.LiNeBrEaKToo bad that promised cooperation wasn't in evidence almost a decade ago.

The Boston Globe 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Will the economy take the wind out of Patrick's plan? Progress made on green energy; but timetable is dicey  	Erin Ailworth Globe Staff  	BUSINESS; Pg. B5  	1165 words  	Shortly after taking office in January 2007, Governor Deval Patrick made Massachusetts part of a landmark regional coalition to reduce greenhouse gases from area power plants. That April, he released a 13-page directive outlining some of his environmental policies. And in the nearly two years since, the state has produced a flood of green bills, mandates, orders, fledgling programs, and other goals.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, some say Massachusetts has positioned itself as a leader in energy and environmental policy. But others question whether Patrick's lofty goals can be reached, especially given how far the economy has fallen since they were proposed.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, the state's timetable for its green initiatives appears ambitious. For example, within the next eight years, it wants to increase the state's solar power capacity from 7. 2 megawatts to 250 - almost 35 times current capacity. To reach its wind power goal of 2,000 megawatts by 2020 - up from today's modest 6. 62 megawatts - generating capacity must be multiplied more than 300 times. Other mandates, such as those related to energy efficiency and alternative fuels, are just as dramatic. LiNeBrEaK"Whether any of these goals are achievable within the time frame, in my view, is going to depend critically on three factors over which the state has no control," said Robert Stavins, an environmental economist and director of Harvard University's environmental economics program. "One is the pace and depth of the economic recession and recovery." The other factors, Stavins said, are "the rate, nature, and timing of the federal government's economic stimulus package," which contains significant funding for green projects, and federal energy policies that could trump state and local plans.LiNeBrEaKAlready, the faltering economy and related credit crunch have dampened the plans of some clean tech start-ups and young green businesses looking to grow in Massachusetts - though the sector has taken less of a hit than many others. Also, Cape Wind - an offshore wind turbine project that could account for as much as a fifth of the state's wind-power goal - has been slow in winning approval.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, following the rollout of federal subsidies for renewable energy, the state recently halved its rebate for residential solar installations from $2 to $1 per watt installed.LiNeBrEaKStill, Ian Bowles, head of the state's Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, believes the optimism of 2007 won't succumb to the widespread economic pessimism of 2009, at least when it comes to environmental and energy issues.LiNeBrEaK"We're making very strong progress on all these goals," Bowles said, calling them the "building blocks" that will allow the state to reach even loftier milestones, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent, from 1990 levels, by 2050.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a November report by the state Department of Energy Resources, Massachusetts utility companies exceeded a state requirement to obtain 3 percent of their electricity in 2007 from renewable power sources, though a portion of that green power was imported from Canada. But the requirement is set to become more stringent over the next several years, and by 2020 utilities must buy 15 percent of their power from renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKRegarding solar power, Bowles said that since a rebate program called Commonwealth Solar launched in January 2007, the number of solar installation companies in Massachusetts has tripled from 25 to 75.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, solar capacity in Massachusetts is growing modestly. According to Bowles, when Patrick took office there were enough solar installations in the state to generate about 4 megawatts of electricity; today there are enough to generate 7. 2 megawatts. An additional 3. 8 megawatts of capacity are also in the planning stages.LiNeBrEaK"It takes a curve for it to grow, and we always projected that it would go at the pace that it's going," Bowles said of solar capacity. "In fact, we're far above where we thought we'd be."LiNeBrEaKBut to reach its wind-power goal, the state must rely heavily on the success of offshore wind projects, many of which are still in planning stages.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, Massachusetts has 6. 62 megawatts of wind-power capacity and more than 900 megawatts on tap from proposed projects. Even so, Bowles believes more than half of the 2,000 megawatts the state wants installed by 2020 will have to come from offshore projects - a potential problem considering the 130-turbine Cape Wind project has faced many delays, including opposition from residents who have concerns about the project's location and safety.LiNeBrEaKBesides siting issues and economic woes, other obstacles loom, including how to increase demand for renewable technologies at a time when fuel prices are down, and upgrading and connecting the electric grid to make the best use of alternative energy sources.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say Massachusetts legislators are right to aim high with the state's green goals.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think we have a choice, frankly," said Sue Reid, a staff attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. "Solar alone isn't going to get us there. Wind isn't going to get us there; efficiency isn't, either. ... We have to get the ball rolling on all these fronts."LiNeBrEaKBut that's what worries Robert Rio, senior vice president for government affairs for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group that has long questioned what effect renewable energy will have on the electric grid and electricity prices.LiNeBrEaK"These are very aggressive goals," Rio said. "You just wonder if anybody is adding up all the bills, all the programs. Is anyone adding up the bottom line of all these goals and asking whether it makes sense economically?"LiNeBrEaKJohn Rogers, a senior energy analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, said it is obvious that the state's plan makes sense environmentally.LiNeBrEaK"It's pretty clear that we can meet every one of those goals if we have the will," Rogers said. "And it's pretty clear from what the science is telling us that we have to meet so many of these goals to get on the path that we need to be."LiNeBrEaKThe governor is scheduled to head to the West Coast next week to meet with business leaders, including those in green industries, in an attempt to persuade them to do business in Massachusetts. The presence of such companies here could help the state boost solar and wind capacity.LiNeBrEaKBut the responsibility for achieving energy and environmental goals doesn't just fall on government, said Tim Healy, chief executive of EnerNOC, a Boston-based energy management company that pays its customers to reduce electricity consumption at peak usage times.LiNeBrEaK"It's great to have the legislation behind us, but the execution is what is going to be so important," Healy said. "It hinges on the entrepreneurs, the developers to come out and say, `I'm going to take a risk, I'm going to put a project together."'LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR:LiNeBrEaKSOLAR POWER / WIND POWER / GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONSLiNeBrEaKPLEASE SEE PDF FOR CHART DATA.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	News/Community briefs  	BAY AREA NEWS GROUP  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	962 words  	Lab veteran named interim directorLiNeBrEaKA scientist renowned for developing a new generation of solar cells with nanotechnology has been named Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory's interim director. Paul Alivisatos, a 21-year lab veteran, takes the spot vacated by Steven Chu, who was appointed Secretary of Energy. While a permanent director is sought, Alivisatos pledged to carry on the vision of Chu, who focused the lab's work on energy security and global climate change after he became lab director in 2004. Under Chu's direction, the lab launched programs in biofuels, solar energy, carbon management and battery technology. Alivisatos earned renown as the first to create rod-shaped semiconductor "nanocrystals" which could be stacked to create infinitesimally-small electronic devices of varying shapes. Before that, nanocrystals could only be shaped into spheres. Alivisatos, who was acting deputy director for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is proposed to receive $406,980 in annual salary, a 14 percent increase above his current salary of $357,000. He's subject to official confirmation by the UC Board of Regents in early February, although the appointment takes effect immediately.LiNeBrEaKBerkeley residents to demonstrate LiNeBrEaKThe Berkeley East Bay Gray Panthers and the Strawberry Creek Lodge Tenants Association will demonstrate opposition to military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2-4 p.m. Feb. 20 at the corner of University and Acton streets in Berkeley. For more information, phone 510-841-4143.LiNeBrEaKFormer Black Panther to speakLiNeBrEaKFormer Black Panther chairman Bobby Seale will speak at Berkeley City College at 12: 30 p.m. Feb. 2 in the college's ground floor auditorium. The speech keynotes the first of a month-long series of Berkeley City College (BCC) lectures, literary, dance, and gospel performances in honor of Black History Month. Seale will speak on the progressive civil-human rights and sixties black power movement, and on the election of Barrack Obama as the President of the United States. Seale, one of the original "Chicago Eight."now devotes his time to Reach!, a group which supports youth education programs. The college is located at 2050 Center St., one-half block from the downtown Berkeley BART station.LiNeBrEaKCollege becomes universityLiNeBrEaKSamuel Merritt College has renamed itself as a university to celebrate its centennial and to reflect its changing mission.LiNeBrEaKThe Oakland health-sciences school announced it would become Samuel Merritt University. The school, which already offers doctoral degrees, also has campuses in Sacramento, San Francisco and San Mateo.LiNeBrEaKThe 1,200-student college started 100 years ago as a nursing school. It now offers degrees in nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistance and podiatry. Samuel Merritt is affiliated with Sutter Health and Alta Bates-Summit Medical .LiNeBrEaKClerk-Recorder taking reservationsLiNeBrEaKThe clerk-recorder's office in Oakland will be open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Feb. 14 to issue marriage licenses and perform wedding ceremonies.Couples can make reservations by calling 510-272-6362. The specially furnished Wedding Room is on the second floor of the clerk-recorder's offices at 1106 Madison Street in Oakland. Times in the Wedding Room will be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis.LiNeBrEaKThe fee for a marriage license is $84, which includes one certified copy. The fee for the wedding ceremony is $50, with cash or checks accepted.LiNeBrEaKBerkeley council approves nuclear waiverLiNeBrEaKThe Berkeley City Council Tuesday night voted 7-2 to give the city library a two-year waiver of the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act to allow it to contract with 3M Systems of St. Paul, MN. The act forbids the city from doing business with any company that has business in nuclear weapons, unless there is no other alternative. It is the fourth time since 1986 the city has granted such a waiver.LiNeBrEaKBART general manager denouncedLiNeBrEaKA BART board member has said he has lost confidence in General Manager Dorothy Dugger because of the agency's poor communication about a transit agency police officer's shooting of an unarmed Hayward man Jan. 1. "I think BART has a culture of withholding information and lack of transparency," board member Tom Radulovich, of San Francisco, said Tuesday. Radulovich said he was disturbed by media broadcasts this week of a passenger video appearing to show a BART officer punching Oscar Grant III in the face shortly before another officer, Johannes Mehserle, shot the prostrate passenger in the back. Prosecutors have charged Mehserle with murder, and BART announced this week   after the new video of the punching incident was broadcast   that it is investigating the second officer. Radulovich said Dugger, the agency's chief executive, should have done more to ensure BART did more to communicate with the board and the public about the shooting and investigation of it.LiNeBrEaKDress donations wantedLiNeBrEaKThe Bay Area non-profit organization The Princess Project will hold a formal dress drive next month, which will go to local girls and allow them to participate in school dances and proms.LiNeBrEaKDresses should be fashionable formal gowns, party dresses and cocktail dresses in excellent condition, dry-cleaned and on hangers.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	HiPiedmont Letters to the Editor  	Piedmonter  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	998 words  	State cuts funding to CaldecottLiNeBrEaKWhat reason could not stop, the budget crisis has stopped. A reprieve has been granted from the ridiculous fourth Bore Caldecott Tunnel project that is ill-conceived.LiNeBrEaKFortunately for the Contra Costa County commuters, the project will not affect commute direction traffic with or without the new bore. That is right. A new bore provides no commute improvement   ask Caltrans if you have doubts. The new tunnel will only improve the reverse commute, but it may free up some Caltrans personnel from popping up the cones.LiNeBrEaKMaybe the local citizens who voted to spend money on the Caldecott now have time to reconsider their position. We could take the time to devise a solution that actually improves commuting without increased pollution and global warming, and decreased pedestrian/bicycle safety. LiNeBrEaKTime and thought can be beneficial. If there is to be a fourth bore, then Caltrans should take the time to do it the best they can instead of jamming it through with a poor plan. Let's consider pedestrians and bicyclists, especially the children on their way to and from school. A non-motorized connection to Orinda from College Avenue could be a welcome commute and recreational benefit if done right.LiNeBrEaKRon Bishop, ArchitectLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKBus fare too high for those who need itLiNeBrEaKThe economy is in shambles around the country, and still, the Alameda-Contra Costa Transportation District has the price of a monthly bus pass for seniors and the disabled at $20. That is too much for both of these groups. They have to make the choice whether to buy a bus pass for a month or food.LiNeBrEaKBoth seniors and the disabled are loyal bus passengers. They use the bus as their only way to go somewhere. Because they are using the bus instead of cars, they are doing their part in fighting global warming in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. So I urge the Alameda-Contra Costa Transportation District to not balance the budget on the backs of these groups.LiNeBrEaKInstead, they should demand that politicians in Washington, D.C., give them more funding so that they can lower the price of the bus pass for seniors and the disabled.LiNeBrEaKBilly TriceLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKBill Ayers is not a model for studentsLiNeBrEaKI am very disappointed in St. Mary's decision to invite the notorious self-described "social activist" Bill Ayers to speak to the student body. Ayers represents the worst aspects of open dissent and social activism in a free society. When confronted with conditions in our society which he and his cohorts deemed unacceptable, they chose to create the Weather Underground, a violent, selfish domestic terrorist organization which committed many violent criminal acts, such as bombing the Pentagon and a New York City police station. Ayers was responsible for the death of many, and by all rights should have spent his entire life in prison, and would have, but for a technicality which allowed him to go free.LiNeBrEaKAyers has gained a certain currency in the world of academia, due to his association with President Barack Obama. This is an unfortunate circumstance which gives Ayers credibility when he deserves none. He has never fully confessed to his criminal past and has made it well known that if he had his way, more violent, destructive acts against innocent Americans would have been justified. The college is mistaken in its belief that this is a form of free speech and academic freedom. This is not education, but is instead indoctrination.LiNeBrEaKAyers' appearance is an insult and a very big mistake.LiNeBrEaKRoseann Slonsky-BreaultLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKBART officer should remain in jailLiNeBrEaKOfficer Mehserle, the BART officer who is awaiting trial for the killing of Oscar Grant, should not be released on bail. He was already out of town and on his way who knows where when he was apprehended; so he is certainly a flight risk.LiNeBrEaKMost importantly, for the people to feel that the wheels of justice are turning and that BART police are here to protect and serve us, it is imperative that Mehserle be given no further special treatment.LiNeBrEaKHe may be a lone bad apple, but if he is released on bail, it's going to make the whole bunch look bad.LiNeBrEaKWhat the community needs now is to see accountability on the part of the police. That's the way to rebuild trust.LiNeBrEaKRachel VenningLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKWitnessing history at inaugurationLiNeBrEaKAs a nation we have been drifting in unchartered waters on a rudderless ship for far too long. Bad policy has led us away from what our founding fathers intended for our young democracy and fear has been our leader. On Jan. 20 all this changed. Barack Hussein Obama not only became our 44th president but he became our first black president, marking the end, as many have said, of the Civil War.LiNeBrEaKOn that "wicked cold" morning, as Yo Yo Ma so aptly put it, 1. 8 million people loaded onto buses, crammed into metro stations, mounted bicycles, walked from their hotels and headed down the streets of Washington, D.C. or on the deserted highways toward the Mall to be able to stake their patch of ground and listen to the swearing in of President Barack Obama. As we waited in the bitter cold friends were made, political comments exchanged and color was of no consequence as we were all there for the same reason   to witness and turn a page in American history.LiNeBrEaKThe crowd of all ages proudly held and waved American flags in one hand and grasped cameras in the other desperately trying to immortalize the moment. The jumbo screens allowed us to see what was going on at the Capitol and the multiple loud speakers enabled us to hear the sweet music of John Williams, the incredible voice of Aretha Franklin, the poetry of the Rev. Lowry and the emotional swearing in ceremony.LiNeBrEaKWe had waited five hours for this moment and the joy, hugs and tears flowed like a river, melting the cold away as we knew we were witnesses to history. When the ceremony finished, the crowd dispersed in a calm and orderly manner understanding the historical impact of the day and tranquil in the knowledge that our ship now has a rudder.LiNeBrEaKLindsay Nivens-FrosiniLiNeBrEaKOakland	LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); SOCIAL JUSTICE (88%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (87%); MOTORCOACHES and BUSES (87%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (79%); BRIDGES and TUNNELS (78%); BUDGET (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (74%); POLICE FORCES (73%); VIOLENT CRIME (62%); TERRORISM (60%); JAIL SENTENCING (60%); TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (60%)  			SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (96%); NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (96%); NEW YORK, USA (79%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	343 words  	Jan. 29--To recognize Yolo County as a leader in energy efficient practices, PGandE presented Yolo County with the utility's "Energy Stewardship Award" this morning at a meeting of the Board of Supervisors LiNeBrEaKYolo County has implemented a myriad of energy conservation projects that have earned the County more than $850,000 in PGandE rebates and incentives and saved more than $11 million in energy costs during the past 15 years. Just a few of these projects include:LiNeBrEaKn A countywide effort to retrofit lights, HVAC systems, fans, water heaters, motors and much more. This project achieved an energy savings of $6. 9 million over 15 years and included PGandE rebates of more than $250,000.LiNeBrEaKn The county participates in PGandE's demand response programs that play an important role in the utility's efforts to ensure reliable service for customers during periods of high energy demand.LiNeBrEaKn A countywide program to save energy and earn PGandE rebates by replacing old, inefficient appliances, such as refrigerators over 20 years old, with more efficient Energy Star appliances.LiNeBrEaK"From county staff to the Board of Supervisors, Yolo County has demonstrated true leadership in addressing energy efficiency and climate change issues," said James Morante, public affairs manager for PGandE.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007 PGandE initiated a customer recognition program for businesses and governments that demonstrate exemplary commitment to enhancing energy efficiency, sustainability and environmental stewardship.LiNeBrEaKTo date this award has only been given to three other customers in the greater Sacramento area: IKEA in West Sacramento, Amcor Pet Packaging in Fairfield and Placer County.

The Denver Post 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Guest Commentary Pork-laden spending frenzy  	Mike Coffman  	Pg. B-11  	604 words  	The American people are hurting and our economy is in a recession. Congress is right to take action to stimulate the economy, but the American people deserve better than a pork-laden spending frenzy with very little money going to the people who need it most. Any such economic stimulus package must be timely, temporary and targeted.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, congressional Democratic leaders in the U.S. House put forth an economic plan based on increased deficit spending for agenda-driven earmarks. The bill will not stimulate the economy in the near term and may hurt the economy in the long run, because the deficit for the next two years is already projected to exceed $2 trillion. If deficit spending was an effective stimulus, the economy would already be on the verge of a rebound. LiNeBrEaKWe simply can't prop up the economy through spending money we don't have and can't repay in any reasonable time frame. The so-called stimulus bill will cost taxpayers $819 billion and attempts to create "over 3 million jobs." If those projections were true, this bill would require $275,000 of taxpayer money for every job created. Surely we can do better than that. The bill includes $524 billion in spending and $291. 7 billion in tax provisions.LiNeBrEaKLittle of the funding will be spent quickly. Based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis, just $26 billion (7 percent) will be spent in the current fiscal year, and less than half - 38 percent - will be spent in the first two years. Even assuming such fiscal measures could be effective, the vast majority of funds in this bill would be spent too late to stimulate the economy anyway.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic leadership promised large amounts for improving roads and bridges, but only $44 billion (about 5 percent) is for transportation infrastructure. Of that, only $30 billion is for highways. There are tens of billions spent mainly to protect or create government jobs. In addition, the National Endowment for the Arts will get $50 million, Americorps $200 million, Amtrak $800 million, grass replacement on the National Mall $200 million, repairs at the Smithsonian $150 million, NASA climate change research $400 million, and ACORN $10 million.LiNeBrEaKThere is also, ironically, $1 billion to subsidize fuel oil at the same time that Democrat leadership wants to artificially inflate oil prices through drilling bans and blocking technology development. Again, however worthy such projects might be, it is unclear how they will provide an immediate boost to the economy.LiNeBrEaKThe measure creates numerous funding situations in which programs will receive large sums of "temporary" additional cash that will quickly run out, creating pressure to maintain these inflated levels. For instance, the bill spends $15. 6 billion to increase each student's Pell Grant by $500. After two years, this extra funding vanishes, so a student attending school with the help of a Pell Grant will face a sudden decline in financial support. This means, of course, that Congress will almost certainly turn this temporary deficit spending into a permanent budget catastrophe by extending all increases.LiNeBrEaKEconomic recovery is invariably achieved by the economy itself, but Washington can accelerate that process. The best way to do that is to improve the incentives that drive economic activity. Lower marginal tax rates will stimulate the economy because they create incentives for individuals and businesses to work, invest, take risks and seize opportunities.LiNeBrEaKThe American people deserve a better proposal than the wasteful spending approach envisioned under this bill.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Rep. Mike Coffman represents Colorado's 6th Congressional District.

SPORTS  	486 words  	Jan. 29--Area high school sports sure could use a little of that global warming right about now.LiNeBrEaKCold weather and wintry conditions once again forced the postponement of all of Wednesday's sports slate. This is a scenario that has become commonplace this year and is slowly becoming a problem. LiNeBrEaKOne game -- Clay-Battelle at Mapletown boys' basketball -- has been canceled altogether.LiNeBrEaK"We're running out of dates to make these games up," C-B athletic director David Joyce said.LiNeBrEaKGames that have been postponed include the Morgantown girls' basketball team at Preston, which has been rescheduled for Feb. 16; the University High girls' basketball team at Wheeling Park, which has been rescheduled for Feb. 21; and the Preston and Elkins wrestling teams at University, which has been rescheduled for Feb. 4.LiNeBrEaKBeing rescheduled for the second time is the Morgantown boys at Buckhannon-Upshur basketball game, which will now be played on Feb. 16.LiNeBrEaK"It's getting a little harder now to find places for these games," MHS athletic director Dan Erenrich said. "Fortunately, we're not to the point yet where we have more than three games scheduled in a week, but if we get many more [postponements] that will be difficult to continue."LiNeBrEaKBack-loading schedules with postponed games could eventually be cause for concern among potential playoff contenders, as well.LiNeBrEaK"If we're not careful, we could start having four games a week," Erenrich said. "If that happens, our kids could start losing their legs and run out of gas come playoff time."LiNeBrEaKAlso postponed was the Lincoln wrestling match, with Morgantown, Clay-Battelle and South Harrison all scheduled to attend. That match has yet to be rescheduled.LiNeBrEaKAs of Wednesday evening, all of today's games were on as scheduled. Highlighting the day's events is the University at Morgantown boys basketball game. And, even if there is some adverse weather, Erenrich still expects the game to be played.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think it will be a problem," he said. "Even if there is some bad weather, which I don't think there will be, I think we'll get the game in because they are two teams playing against each other in the same town."LiNeBrEaKMiddle school boysLiNeBrEaKSouth 8s 44, Westwood 42 OT:LiNeBrEaKDean Marshall scored 18 points and Nathan Adrian added 14 for South late Tuesday.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Shorelines always shifting and it's unavoidable, expert says;  Geologist Stanley Riggs will speak about the subject tonight at UNF. 	STEVE PATTERSON  	Pg. B-1  	315 words  	When storms that can swallow beaches and roads menace Florida, the ones that miss often hit North Carolina.LiNeBrEaKAnd someone there has been taking notes.LiNeBrEaKAfter more than 40 years studying changes to the Carolina coast, an expert on beach dynamics will visit the University of North Florida tonight to talk about adapting to shifting shorelines and rising seas. LiNeBrEaK"We've got to think differently about how we approach this," said Stanley Riggs, a geologist from East Carolina University.LiNeBrEaK"We have more and more and more people moving to the coast and building on the assumption that those shorelines are fixed forever. Well, they're not," he said. "Shorelines are still moving and we are sitting in the way."LiNeBrEaKSea levels that are rising now make movement in the shoreline unavoidable, he said.LiNeBrEaKRiggs will talk with the public at UNF's University Center at 8 p.m. about the ways shorelines have moved for thousands of years, and what that tells scientists about changes happening now. He's scheduled to lecture faculty members Friday.LiNeBrEaK"He's really good at making plain folks understand why this is important to them and giving some context," said Courtney Hackney, director of UNF's coastal biology program.LiNeBrEaKHe called Riggs "one of the foremost coastal geologists in the world."LiNeBrEaKPeople don't need to abandon the shore, Riggs said.LiNeBrEaKBut he said islands and coastal areas should be analyzed better to see which ones are most vulnerable.LiNeBrEaKSome parts of the coast should probably only be public parks, he said, but there's nothing wrong with building on other parts of the shoreline.LiNeBrEaK"We can use the devil out of it, but we should use it based on what the dynamics of that site are," he said.LiNeBrEaKsteve.patterson@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4263LiNeBrEaKLECTURELiNeBrEaKBeach expert Stanley Riggs will talk about shoreline changes and rising sea levels at 8 p.m. today at the University of North Florida's University Center, 12000 Alumni Drive.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Caution urged on expanded fuel standards  	Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Texas  	COMMENTARY  	863 words  	Jan. 29--On Monday, President Barack Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to consider California's request for a federal waiver to let it set its own state standards governing greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks -- standards that would be considerably tougher than federal standards. That move by Obama has national implications and raises various questions.LiNeBrEaKJust how significant a move was this? LiNeBrEaKVery significant. EPA is expected to grant California's request. That could mean California and at least 13 other states will set tougher emissions standards, which translate to higher fuel economy standards. That could generate momentum in Washington for the raising of federal fuel-economy standards and EPA adoption of stronger environmental restrictions on industrial operations such as power plants and refineries. With Obama's election, there's also renewed interest in more broad-based legislation to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas scientists say contributes to potentially destructive climate change, also known as "global warming."LiNeBrEaKHow much could vehicle fuel-economy standards change?LiNeBrEaKIn December 2007, Congress passed a law calling for passenger vehicle fleets to boost their average fuel economy by about 40 percent, from 25 miles per gallon to at least 35 mpg by 2020. But the Bush administration never approved the final rules. Obama directed the U.S. Department of Transportation on Monday to finalize fuel-economy standards for 2011 model vehicles "and to proceed expeditiously on setting standards for later years."LiNeBrEaKAccording to news reports, the California standards could mean automakers would have to achieve the 35-mpg average by 2016, four years earlier than the 2007 law mandated.LiNeBrEaKWhat's the position of the Star-Telegram Editorial Board on this issue?LiNeBrEaKWe strongly favored adoption of the higher fuel-economy standards in the 2007 law, which were long overdue and can be achieved through existing technology. The result could be lower fuel costs, reduced dependence on foreign oil, less tailpipe pollution and an accelerated effort to produce more-advanced plug-in hybrid gasoline-electric and totally electric vehicles.LiNeBrEaKWe favor a uniform federal standard for fuel economy. Differing federal and state standards would make it more difficult and costly for automakers to comply.LiNeBrEaKWe think it would be feasible for federal standards to be raised at least moderately above the levels required by the 2007 law.LiNeBrEaKBut we would urge caution. It will take time and billions of dollars for the beleaguered auto industry -- expecting another bad year in 2009 after a horrendous 2008 -- to develop more-advanced engine technologies and modify plants to build more fuel-efficient, less-polluting vehicles.LiNeBrEaKIn terms of energy and environmental issues, what's needed on a broader scale?LiNeBrEaKThe United States and other nations must accelerate efforts to become more energy-efficient, less polluting and more mindful of the escalating environmental stresses on our planet.LiNeBrEaKThe world's population is expanding by 75 million people annually. Per capita consumption of fossil fuels -- oil, natural gas and coal -- is soaring in rapidly developing nations such as India and China where millions of people for the first time are buying cars and energy-eating household items such as computers and refrigerators.LiNeBrEaKWe therefore must greatly increase energy efficiency and conservation through measures ranging from mandating "greener" buildings to converting to compact fluorescent light bulbs. We must push hard for technological advances such as "clean coal" plants that can capture and store carbon dioxide and affordable autos that are totally electric-powered and easily rechargeable. We must push development of cost-efficient wind, solar and nuclear power electrical generation.LiNeBrEaKWe also should encourage slower population growth through measures such as expanded family planning programs worldwide and better educating the public about the perils of adding billions of additional humans consuming food, water and energy and exacerbating air and water pollution.LiNeBrEaKThe United States needs to play a lead role in developing a new international agreement to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in both long-developed nations and emerging economic giants such as China, India and Brazil.LiNeBrEaKWhat can individual Americans do?LiNeBrEaKA lot. You can reduce your "carbon footprint" by driving a more fuel-efficient car, living closer to work, making your home more energy-efficient, recycling more waste and supporting government polices encouraging energy conservation and development of less-polluting technologies.LiNeBrEaKYou can start right now by turning down your thermostat a degree or two, or turning off that light you left on in the living room.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Houston Chronicle Lisa Falkenberg column: Commentary: Kid-sized wisdom found in Obama letters  	Lisa Falkenberg, Houston Chronicle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	839 words  	Jan. 29--From Karl Rove to Bono, everybody's got advice for the new president.LiNeBrEaKBut if Barack Obama is looking for fresh suggestions, light on cynicism and free of partisan taint, I know of a group that will give it to him straight: Houston-area kids.LiNeBrEaKOver the past couple months, local schoolchildren have scrawled nearly 700 letters to Obama, some complete with illustrations and misspellings, as part of the "Mail to the Chief" campaign organized by educational publisher Handwriting Without Tears, which drew 34,000 letters nationwide. LiNeBrEaKThey weigh in on issues ranging from the first family's quest for a new puppy: "I think you should not get a puppy that yapps," West University third-grader Nicole writes. "I know what its like. I can never get any sleep at night." (Go with a mutt, she suggests.)LiNeBrEaKTo the air: "The environment is very dirty right now," writes Sugar Land fifth-grader Phillip, who pushes more recycling or carpooling.LiNeBrEaKTo Southeast Texas issues: "You might want to get better drainage for streets," offers Kailie from Spring Branch ISD's Rummel Creek Elementary. "When it rains my street gets flooded with water. So some cars get stuck in the water especially little cars."LiNeBrEaKTo religion: Sugar Land fifth-grader Inaara, who notes that the new president is "very handsome," asks him to make the Muslim festival Eid a national holiday so that "even we kids can stay at home, and go for prayers, and then celebrate." But her "number one" advice? Bring change, but "don't ever change yourself."LiNeBrEaKA few bent the president's ear with typical elementary concerns: "Can you make school 1 minit," asks one student. "You should make homework aginst the law," suggests another.LiNeBrEaKNew use for sloganLiNeBrEaKHouston third-grader Katie lobbies hard for the latter point: "Homework wastes paper, which means wasting trees." And lest Obama think this task impossible, Katie evokes in perfect cursive the president's own phrase: "Remember, yes we can."LiNeBrEaKMore than a few students, apparently wise to the commander-in-chief's nicotine vice, express their worries: "Jest for idvis triy to stop smoking," writes The Woodlands first-grader Alina. "You are great."LiNeBrEaKRowena, a fifth-grader in Fort Bend ISD, starts off soft before delving into the weightier issues: "I'm so happy you won the election because now I'm on cloud nine. I think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread."LiNeBrEaKBut anybody can use a little advice, she continues: "I love the enviroment but with Global Warming, we're going to need a lot more help.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Kid-sized bites of wisdom  	LISA FALKENBERG, Staff  	B; Pg. 1 MetFront  	763 words  	From Karl Rove to Bono, everybody's got advice for the new president.LiNeBrEaKBut if Barack Obama is looking for fresh suggestions, light on cynicism and free of partisan taint, I know of a group that will give it to him straight: Houston-area kids.LiNeBrEaKOver the past couple months, local schoolchildren have scrawled nearly 700 letters to Obama, some complete with illustrations and misspellings, as part of the "Mail to the Chief" campaign organized by educational publisher Handwriting Without Tears, which drew 34,000 letters nationwide. LiNeBrEaKThey weigh in on issues ranging from the first family's quest for a new puppy: "I think you should not get a puppy that yapps," West University third-grader Nicole writes. "I know what its like. I can never get any sleep at night." (Go with a mutt, she suggests.)LiNeBrEaKTo the air: "The environment is very dirty right now," writes Sugar Land fifth-grader Phillip, who pushes more recycling or carpooling.LiNeBrEaKTo Southeast Texas issues: "You might want to get better drainage for streets," offers Kailie from Spring Branch ISD's Rummel Creek Elementary. "When it rains my street gets flooded with water. So some cars get stuck in the water especially little cars."LiNeBrEaKTo religion: Sugar Land fifth-grader Inaara, who notes that the new president is "very handsome," asks him to make the Muslim festival Eid a national holiday so that "even we kids can stay at home, and go for prayers, and then celebrate." But her "number one" advice? Bring change, but "don't ever change yourself."LiNeBrEaKA few bent the president's ear with typical elementary concerns: "Can you make school 1 minit," asks one student. "You should make homework aginst the law," suggests another.LiNeBrEaKNew use for sloganLiNeBrEaKHouston third-grader Katie lobbies hard for the latter point: "Homework wastes paper, which means wasting trees." And lest Obama think this task impossible, Katie evokes in perfect cursive the president's own phrase: "Remember, yes we can."LiNeBrEaKMore than a few students, apparently wise to the commander-in-chief's nicotine vice, express their worries: "Jest for idvis triy to stop smoking," writes The Woodlands first-grader Alina. "You are great."LiNeBrEaKRowena, a fifth-grader in Fort Bend ISD, starts off soft before delving into the weightier issues: "I'm so happy you won the election because now I'm on cloud nine. I think it is the greatest thing since sliced bread."LiNeBrEaKBut anybody can use a little advice, she continues: "I love the enviroment but with Global Warming, we're going to need a lot more help. I believe if we all put in a little more effort planting trees and using the 3 R's, the world can change, if only we (underlined) change."LiNeBrEaKAnd another thing, the Iraq war: "(This is my favorite change you'll bring!)" she writes, "I also believe that we should take back the troups and when we do, I say we treat them as if they were our own family. We'd care and feed and send all the injured men to get great medical care.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   3 STAR EDITION	Katy, Fort Bend students attended Obama's inauguration;  Garrett Wilson called it 'a very proud moment' 	KIM MORGAN, HOUSTON CHRONICLE CORRESPONDENT  	THISWEEK; Pg. 10  	837 words  	FAST FACTS:LiNeBrEaKThousands of students from across the nation witnessed Barack Obama take the presidential oath Jan. 20, some of them from Katy and Fort Bend County.LiNeBrEaKGarrett Wilson: 15, Cinco Ranch High School (Katy ISD): "It was a very proud moment in my life."LiNeBrEaKKourtney Smart: 18, Needville High School (Needville ISD): "I think we'll be OK. It's going to be a rough ride." LiNeBrEaKKristina Jurecek: 15, Needville High School (Needville ISD): "It showed me how much one person does count."LiNeBrEaKCameron Seward: 14, Fort Settlement Middle School (Fort Bend ISD, Sugar Land): "No matter what people say about you, no matter what comes up, there can always be change."LiNeBrEaKGarrett Wilson, a 15-year-old ninth-grader at Cinco Ranch High School in Katy, was among the 9,000 students who attended President Barack Obama's inauguration in Washington, D.C., as members of the Congressional Youth Leadership Council.LiNeBrEaK"It was a very proud moment in my life. I did not get a chance to visit with the president or his wife while there, but I am looking forward to meeting him in the future."LiNeBrEaKWhile Obama made an impression on Wilson, several others did as well.LiNeBrEaK"Listening to presentations from Desmond Tutu about morals, General Colin Powell about public affairs, Al Gore about hope and global warming, and presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and journalist Lisa Ling were all valuable learning experiences," Wilson said.LiNeBrEaKThe only thing that went wrong, Wilson said, is that his camera "went missing," so he was not able to capture his favorite Kodak moments.LiNeBrEaK"My mom was very encouraging and told me that even though it would be good to have the photos, the memories will be etched in my brain forever," Wilson said.LiNeBrEaKNeedville studentsLiNeBrEaKNeedville resident Kourtney Smart said she practically had sensory overload in Washington, D.C., as she saw firsthand not only history in the making, but also visited historic sites.LiNeBrEaKSmart, 18, was one of 87 Needville High School students at the inauguration.LiNeBrEaKShe toured all the D.C. landmarks, including several museums, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Arlington National Cemetery.LiNeBrEaK"When we were going through the cemetery, there was a funeral going on," Smart said. "To see all the soldiers in uniform, and hearing the gunshots go off ... it brought tears to my eyes."LiNeBrEaKBut there was also joy, as Smart watched Obama take the oath.LiNeBrEaKSince Smart was of age to vote on Nov. 4, 2008, being there was even more meaningful.LiNeBrEaK"I think we're going to be OK," Smart said. "It's going to be a rough ride ... but I think we'll make it."LiNeBrEaKKristina Jurecek, a 15-year-old sophomore, felt the same.LiNeBrEaK"In his speech, Obama showed everybody that he's going to do what he needs to do to get everything done," Jurecek said.LiNeBrEaKThe students were at the inauguration thanks to the work and determination of Needville High School U.S. government teacher Carlton Jordan.LiNeBrEaK"I became interested in taking students to Washington in December 2007, when the primary season was getting under way," Jordan said. "I didn't know if it would be possible, but then I got a card in the mail from World Strides, and found out that for only $1,500 per student, we could go."LiNeBrEaKWorld Strides is a national provider of student educational travel.LiNeBrEaK"The card wasn't even addressed to me," Jordan said. "It was addressed to a teacher who is no longer at the school, but somehow it ended up in my mailbox."LiNeBrEaKJordan's dream soon became a reality.LiNeBrEaKThe students named themselves the Needville Young Americans, and set out to raise more than $12,000 toward the cost of the trip.LiNeBrEaKWhile Jordan was excited for his students, he was excited for himself as well.LiNeBrEaK"It was my first time to go to D.C., and I've been a history and government teacher forever, and I've always been interested in politics," Jordan said. "So I got to experience all of this with my students."LiNeBrEaKFort Bend youth leaderLiNeBrEaKFort Settlement Middle School pupil Cameron Seward, 14, received his invitation to the inauguration through his affiliation with the Congressional Youth Leadership Council, to which he's belonged since sixth grade.LiNeBrEaKEven though he's only in eighth grade and can't vote, the importance of doing so when he is of age became even clearer to Seward while he listened to Obama's speech.LiNeBrEaK"No matter what people say about you, no matter what comes up, there can always be change," Seward said. "And you should never be down on yourself. Keep on trying and always vote because your vote counts no matter who you are."LiNeBrEaKBefore he left, Seward said he was excited about the idea of being in the nation's capital.LiNeBrEaK"I knew it would be a unique opportunity to see a presidential inauguration, since we live in Texas and not in D.C.," Seward said. "So I didn't really care who it would be, I just wanted to experience what it would be like to be there for a presidential inauguration."LiNeBrEaK"I could see him (Obama) if I strained my eyes real hard," he said.LiNeBrEaK"It was better being there than sitting at home watching, even in the cold weather. Millions of people were screaming whenever he said something. The atmosphere was exciting."

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Air Force drops plan to make fuel from coal in Montana  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	538 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Air Force on Thursday dropped plans to build a coal-to-liquid plant to produce fuel for its aircraft, a plan that would've reduced dependence on oil but increased the emissions of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force has a goal to certify that all aircraft could fly on a 50-50 blend of fuel by 2011. It's been purchasing fuel made from coal from Sasol of South Africa, most recently 300,000 gallons, said Air Force spokesman Gary Strasburg. LiNeBrEaKThe B-1, B-52 and C-17 already have been certified to run on the coal-mix blend, and the F-15, F-22, C-5 and KC-135 all have also used the blend, Strasburg said.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force is looking for alternatives to oil to make sure that it can continue to operate its aircraft when supplies are tight. The coal-to-liquid conversion process, however, is expensive to set up and there are no full-scale plants in the U.S.LiNeBrEaKLiquid fuel from coal produces more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions as conventional petroleum-based fuel.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force for the past year had been considering building the plant at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, one of three U.S. Air Force bases that maintain and operate the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile.LiNeBrEaKThe service had required that the coal-to-liquid plant would be privately funded, according to an Air Force news release on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force rejected the plans for the coal-to-liquids plant because of possible conflicts with the 341 Missile Wing's nuclear mission. The release said the concerns included decreased security near the base's weapons storage area, interference with missile transportation and "explosive safety arcs and operational flight safety issues."LiNeBrEaKStrasburg said he couldn't comment on whether there were economic or environmental concerns until after all participants in the original plan were briefed. The Air Force Real Property Agency had submitted a plan for the plant in February 2008.LiNeBrEaKThe 2007 energy law requires that federal agencies not purchase fuels with greater greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe main users and producers of fuel from coal have been South Africa and Nazi Germany.LiNeBrEaKHenry Henderson of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said coal-to-liquid fuels "make no sense for a free economy" because they're expensive and would require taxpayer funds to get them off the ground.LiNeBrEaK"We have a very long history of trying to do this in the United States and it repeatedly results in subsidies from the public and inability to compete in any fair market place," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force also would've had to find a way to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions at additional expense Henderson said.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force is in the beginning stages of laboratory testing of advanced biofuels, which would have lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Space detectives delve into mystery of missing carbon  	By Robert S. Boyd, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	859 words  	WASHINGTON _ For years, scientists have been trying to solve what they call the "Mystery of the Missing Sinks."LiNeBrEaKNo, they're not talking about misplaced kitchenware. These "sinks" are the world's forests, pastures, crops and soil, which soak up the excess carbon _ in the form of carbon dioxide _ that's a major driver of global warming. Even golf courses and suburban lawns serve as carbon sinks.LiNeBrEaK"Humans dump about 9 million tons of carbon daily into the atmosphere, but only half stays there," said David Crisp, principal investigator for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory. LiNeBrEaKThe rest is returned to Earth, but where much of it ends up is uncertain. About a quarter of the recycled CO2 is drawn into the ocean, and land vegetation absorbs another quarter.LiNeBrEaK"We don't know where the other half is going," said Crisp, who's based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.LiNeBrEaKTo solve the mystery, NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency are sending up complementary scientific satellites. The Japanese Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite was boosted into orbit last Friday. NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory is scheduled for launch on Feb. 23.LiNeBrEaKThe two spaceships will circle the Earth on overlapping paths, more than 400 miles high, analyzing plumes of CO2 rising and falling through the air. (CO2 contains two atoms of oxygen for every atom of carbon.)LiNeBrEaK"Carbon dioxide 'sources' increase the local concentrations of this gas. Carbon dioxide 'sinks' reduce the concentrations," Crisp explained at a NASA briefing Thursday.LiNeBrEaKFor example, cities such as New York and Los Angeles are carbon sources year-round. Iowa is a major carbon sink in summer because its cornfields take up tons of CO2.LiNeBrEaK"We want to understand why, how and where these sinks are and what's going to happen in the future," said Anna Michalak, an Orbiting Carbon Observatory team member from the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. 'There's no consensus whether these sinks will increase or decrease."LiNeBrEaKFor example, as the world warms, Arctic tundra is thawing and releasing more CO2. At the same time, forests are expanding farther north, storing more CO2.LiNeBrEaK"We can only account for about half of the carbon that doesn't remain in the atmosphere," said Eric Ianson, Orbiting Carbon Observatory project manager. Identifying where it goes will "help policymakers make informed decisions about carbon management," he said.LiNeBrEaKEarth has only about 100 land stations that are able to measure CO2 with sufficient accuracy. "Large parts of the Earth have no stations at all," Crisp said.LiNeBrEaKScott Denning, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, pointed out that "the 'missing sinks' aren't really missing. They are just poorly understood," he said.LiNeBrEaK"It would be great if we could measure how much carbon every tree, shrub, peat bog and blade of grass takes in. But the world is too big and too diverse and is constantly changing," Denning said. "The solution isn't measuring carbon in trees. The solution is measuring carbon in the air."LiNeBrEaKThe new satellites will let scientists depend less on sometimes inaccurate computer models than they do now and more on data to understand the causes of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. satellite will continuously measure CO2 in patches a little bigger than a square mile, accumulating 8 million observations that will be repeated every 16 days. The Japanese version will monitor wider areas, about 20 square miles, and provide a series of 56,000 snapshots about 60 miles apart that will be repeated every three days.LiNeBrEaKThe images will be taken by spectrographs, instruments that can measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the air with an accuracy of one part in a million.LiNeBrEaK"This approach will provide the first regional-scale, global maps of carbon dioxide over the entire globe," Crisp saidLiNeBrEaKThe $500 million Japanese satellite is supposed to last five years. The $278 million U.S. system is designed for two years.LiNeBrEaKThe two countries intend to collaborate closely. "Fortunately, we have two different systems using very different methods to make these measurements at the same time," Crisp said. "Their orbits will cross several times a day."LiNeBrEaKMartin Heimann, a geochemist at the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany, who isn't a member of the American or Japanese team, praised the satellites but said that they wouldn't last long enough to do an adequate job.LiNeBrEaK"Some of the most fundamental questions on the mechanisms of the Earth's carbon cycle in a changing climate just cannot be tackled with less than half a decade of data," he wrote in the January issue of Nature Geoscience.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, Denning said that the satellite data would "buy us more time to develop alternative energy and other mitigation measures" against global warming.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Gore: U.S. can reduce carbon, add jobs, but must act fast  	Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	957 words  	Jan. 29--WASHINGTON -- New scientific studies -- including one released this week -- add urgency to the need to reduce carbon emissions, but the United States can do it in a way that strengthens American economic prosperity and national security, former Vice President Al Gore told a Senate committee Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKGore called on Congress to pass President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package because it contains billions of dollars for energy efficiency, renewable energy, an improved national electricity grid and cleaner transportation, which add up to large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. LiNeBrEaKGore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for helping the public understand global warming, brought the Senate Foreign Relations Committee up to speed using his trademark slides and short videos. He also urged the U.S. to take three steps: Pass the stimulus plan with its big boost for clean electricity, then pass a law to put a price on carbon emissions and limit them, and then lead all countries to agree to binding reductions under a new treaty -- all by the end of this year.LiNeBrEaK"The scientists are practically screaming from the rooftops. This is a planetary emergency. It's outside the scale we're used to dealing with," Gore told the senators.LiNeBrEaKBold action is needed because the climate that makes human civilization possible is at risk, and decisions about whether to burn more fossil fuel now will have an impact on Earth's climate far into the future, he said.LiNeBrEaKOne of the examples of new evidence Gore mentioned was a report by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Susan Solomon that concluded that changes in temperature, rainfall and sea level are largely irreversible for more than 1,000 years after carbon dioxide emissions stop completely.LiNeBrEaKHeat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, have caused the Earth's temperature to increase in recent decades, and scientists say that the average global surface temperature could rise by up to another 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if carbon emissions continue unchecked. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and about 20 percent of it remains for thousands of years.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's study with Swiss and French partners looked at the consequences of letting carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere above the current level during this century and then completely halting emissions. It found evidence that there'd be decreases in rainfall comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl in North America and many other parts of the world that would last for hundreds of years, and that a gradual rise in the sea level over 1,000 years would be locked in.LiNeBrEaKSolomon said in a statement this week that the study "convinced us that current choices regarding carbon dioxide emissions will have legacies that will irreversibly change the planet."LiNeBrEaK"It's a sobering warning that the quicker we reduce emissions the better," Gore said when he told senators about Solomon's report and other recent findings, but he added that there was no reason to fear doom or to make what he called a false choice between "our planet and our way of life."LiNeBrEaK"In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the very same solutions that will address our economic and national security crises as well," he said, arguing that renewable energy -- sun, wind and geothermal -- will create jobs and reduce dependence on oil-powered regimes.LiNeBrEaKGore got a friendly reception from Democrats and Republicans alike. None challenged his scientific assessment.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Gore: U.S. can reduce carbon, add jobs, but must act fast  	Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	957 words  	Jan. 29--WASHINGTON -- New scientific studies -- including one released this week -- add urgency to the need to reduce carbon emissions, but the United States can do it in a way that strengthens American economic prosperity and national security, former Vice President Al Gore told a Senate committee Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKGore called on Congress to pass President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package because it contains billions of dollars for energy efficiency, renewable energy, an improved national electricity grid and cleaner transportation, which add up to large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. LiNeBrEaKGore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for helping the public understand global warming, brought the Senate Foreign Relations Committee up to speed using his trademark slides and short videos. He also urged the U.S. to take three steps: Pass the stimulus plan with its big boost for clean electricity, then pass a law to put a price on carbon emissions and limit them, and then lead all countries to agree to binding reductions under a new treaty -- all by the end of this year.LiNeBrEaK"The scientists are practically screaming from the rooftops. This is a planetary emergency. It's outside the scale we're used to dealing with," Gore told the senators.LiNeBrEaKBold action is needed because the climate that makes human civilization possible is at risk, and decisions about whether to burn more fossil fuel now will have an impact on Earth's climate far into the future, he said.LiNeBrEaKOne of the examples of new evidence Gore mentioned was a report by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Susan Solomon that concluded that changes in temperature, rainfall and sea level are largely irreversible for more than 1,000 years after carbon dioxide emissions stop completely.LiNeBrEaKHeat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, have caused the Earth's temperature to increase in recent decades, and scientists say that the average global surface temperature could rise by up to another 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if carbon emissions continue unchecked. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and about 20 percent of it remains for thousands of years.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's study with Swiss and French partners looked at the consequences of letting carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere above the current level during this century and then completely halting emissions. It found evidence that there'd be decreases in rainfall comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl in North America and many other parts of the world that would last for hundreds of years, and that a gradual rise in the sea level over 1,000 years would be locked in.LiNeBrEaKSolomon said in a statement this week that the study "convinced us that current choices regarding carbon dioxide emissions will have legacies that will irreversibly change the planet."LiNeBrEaK"It's a sobering warning that the quicker we reduce emissions the better," Gore said when he told senators about Solomon's report and other recent findings, but he added that there was no reason to fear doom or to make what he called a false choice between "our planet and our way of life."LiNeBrEaK"In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the very same solutions that will address our economic and national security crises as well," he said, arguing that renewable energy -- sun, wind and geothermal -- will create jobs and reduce dependence on oil-powered regimes.LiNeBrEaKGore got a friendly reception from Democrats and Republicans alike. None challenged his scientific assessment. Gore at one point noted that he was encouraged when he spoke about warming in Antarctica by nods of agreement from Robert Corell, a climate scientist and oceanographer at The Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment, who was sitting nearby.LiNeBrEaKSen.

Lancaster New Era (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	'Bio-reactor' to treat manure at Kreider Farms  	Ad Crable, Lancaster New Era, Pa.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	374 words  	Jan. 29--Can bugs keep a large Lancaster County dairy herd from polluting streams and global-warming gases, and produce electricity to boot?LiNeBrEaKYes, says the state of Pennsylvania, which is giving a New York City-based company a $7. 8 million loan to do just that on the 2,000-cow Kreider Farms outside Manheim. LiNeBrEaK"It's really about the bugs," says Jeremy Rowland, chief operating officer of Bion Environmental Technologies. "It's like a waste-treatment plant at the farm."LiNeBrEaKHe refers to the microbe-based facility as a "bio-reactor."LiNeBrEaKThe loan was awarded by PENNVEST, a state agency that awards loans for sewer, storm water and drinking water projects around the state.LiNeBrEaKBion hopes to have the manure-treatment facility, its first in Pennsylvania, up and running by fall, Rowland said.LiNeBrEaKBion's patented process captures nitrogen and phosphorus so it won't run off fields into waterways, eventually polluting the Chesapeake Bay. Also, ammonia emissions, a greenhouse gas, are captured.LiNeBrEaKIn return for its investment, Bion expects to make money by selling nutrient credits, which can be bought by municipal sewage plants or industries to comply with tougher nutrient limits. Also, Bion expects to cash in on emerging greenhouse gas credits.LiNeBrEaKBion's waste-treatment technology has been approved by the state Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKThe project will initially handle the Kreider family's large dairy herd. But plans are to expand the facility to possibly serve as a regional intake for manure from other farms and poultry operations, including Kreider's.LiNeBrEaKBion's system is different from manure anaerobic digesters that are placed on some farms to control manure odor and produce energy.LiNeBrEaKThe process will produce enough electricity to completely power the treatment process as well as part of the farm's energy needs, Rowland said.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: World is going green, Detroit should, too: Automakers should accept tougher tailpipe emission standards  	The Miami Herald  	COMMENTARY  	520 words  	Jan. 29-- U.S. automakers have used all of their legal and lobbying muscle to fight efforts -- including by California, the nation's biggest state -- to reduce vehicles' greenhouse-gas emissions. Until Jan. 20, they seemed to be winning. Now, the tide is turning -- and that's good for U.S. automakers and the country, too. LiNeBrEaKThe difference is because of the change in the White House. Under the Bush administration, the Environmental Protection Agency refused to grant California a Clean Air Act waiver requiring higher standards for tailpipe emissions. This, despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision acknowledging the agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKChange is comingLiNeBrEaKThe Big Three automakers have spent millions in legal fees fighting emission standards in courts in California and Vermont as if oblivious to the dire financial straits that led to the $17. 4 billion bailout of General Motors and Chrysler.LiNeBrEaKThe automakers should have realized that change was coming when Congress agreed to loan them billions of dollars. Congress, in no uncertain terms, told the Detroit CEOs that it was time to make smaller, more fuel-efficient cars -- and the CEOs agreed.LiNeBrEaKYet now they are caviling about President Barack Obama's announcement this week that California's tough greenhouse-gas emission standards and higher fuel standards are the way to go and that he expects the EPA to approve the waiver soon.LiNeBrEaKOnce the waiver is approved, 13 other states -- Florida included -- are poised to adopt California's rules. In Florida, this would mean that by 2013, new cars sold in the Sunshine State must reduce heat-trapping emissions by 23 percent; by 2016 that would rise to 30 percent. Together, the 14 states make up 30 percent of domestic automakers' market. Another five states have indicated their intent to adopt similar rules, which also would improve fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKHeed court decisionLiNeBrEaKNevertheless, the Big Three still complain that this will set up a two-tiered system for vehicle-emission standards in the United States. This would happen only if the car makers insist on remaining as retro in their thinking as their argument implies. If California, Florida, New York, New England states and others are demanding cleaner, more efficient vehicles, might not the rest of the states get on board, too? Especially given the growing realization across the country that global warming must be dealt with.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Obama administration, it is clear that the EPA will have to quit dragging its feet and heed the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that it can regulate greenhouse-gas emissions. U.S. automakers have closed their eyes to the reality of a changing world long enough. They have lost a war they never should have fought.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition	Briggs, others oppose state emissions laws &lt;|&gt; Patchwork regulation might be on the way  	RICK BARRETT, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	D Business; Pg. 1  	870 words  	Wisconsin's small-engine makers hope that changes in regulations aimed at greenhouse gases won't require them to build different engines for different states.LiNeBrEaK This week, President Barack Obama directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider letting California and other states set limits on greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, emitted by automobiles and light trucks.LiNeBrEaK Environmentalists are pressing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from other sources, too, including emissions from off-road vehicles such as ATVs and snowmobiles. LiNeBrEaK It could rekindle debates that Briggs and Stratton Corp. and other Wisconsin power-equipment makers had with California and the EPA over emissions regulations.LiNeBrEaK "The devil is always in the details. It's something we have to watch very closely," said Bill Harley, president of the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, a trade group that represents Briggs and at least six other Wisconsin manufacturers, including Kohler Co. in Kohler and Ariens Co. in Brillion.LiNeBrEaK California state officials and engine-makers clashed only a few years ago.LiNeBrEaK Regulators, led by the California Air Resources Board, pressed for less pollution from the small-engine industry as emissions from cars and trucks improved.LiNeBrEaK They argued that Briggs and other engine-makers could install catalytic converters on small engines to reduce pollution. Briggs, the world's largest producer of small gasoline engines, said the equipment would pose safety hazards and would be too costly for products such as walk-behind lawn mowers.LiNeBrEaKDifficult manufacturingLiNeBrEaK Last fall, federal regulators ordered the small-engine industry to make sharp cuts in emissions for its new products. Briggs said the rules were modified to their satisfaction and avoided a patchwork system of states adopting different standards.LiNeBrEaK "We feel strongly that regulations covering all of the states are a much better outcome," Laura Timm, a Briggs spokeswoman, said Tuesday.LiNeBrEaK If the Obama administration allows California and other states to write their own greenhouse gas rules, she added, it could be very costly for engine-makers.LiNeBrEaK "It makes it incredibly difficult for manufacturing," Timm said.LiNeBrEaK California and at least a dozen other states have tried to come up with tougher engine emissions standards than those imposed by the federal government, but Obama has said Washington stood in their way.LiNeBrEaK Thus far, the initiative that would allow California to write its own greenhouse gas regulations is mainly focused on automobiles and lightweight trucks.LiNeBrEaK "But does it open the potential for them to regulate other internal combustion engines for carbon dioxide? Probably," said Kris Kiser, vice president of public affairs at the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute.LiNeBrEaK "California is on the forefront of this debate. Down the road, it absolutely could affect small engines," he added.LiNeBrEaKWorse than carsLiNeBrEaK Critics of the small-engine industry say a lawn mower produces as much pollution in one hour as a car does in 20 miles, although it's much better than years ago when a lawn mower polluted as much in an hour as a car did in 350 miles.LiNeBrEaK Small-engine makers have turned to advanced technologies, some from automakers, to clean up their products.LiNeBrEaK The industry could come under further scrutiny from California and the EPA, but it's probably not a high priority for regulators, said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group.LiNeBrEaK California, which has some of the nation's worst air pollution, has initiated a rule aimed at cleaning up emissions from off-highway diesel engines.LiNeBrEaK That's a concern for the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, a Milwaukee-based trade group that represents construction and farm equipment companies.LiNeBrEaK Under the rule, diesel engines already in use would have to meet stricter emissions standards. To comply, engines would have to be modified with new technologies or they would be taken out of service.LiNeBrEaK It could be costly for equipment owners, such as building contractors, said Mike Pankonin, senior director of technical and safety services for the Association of Equipment Manufacturers.LiNeBrEaK The California rule could stall plans to stimulate the economy through construction, said Stephen Sandherr, CEO of Associated General Contractors of America, an industry trade group.LiNeBrEaK The equipment industry has seen that regulations of greenhouse gases are coming, added Mike Osenga, publisher of Diesel Progress magazine, in Waukesha.LiNeBrEaK "I think what the industry hopes for, and has since the beginning of the Clean Air Act, is that it wouldn't end up having to make 50 engines for 50 states, or even five different engines," Osenga said.LiNeBrEaK He added, "What causes the engine world some pain is that it's just finishing up an era of billion-dollar costs to meet exhaust emissions regulations. And given the current economic situation, with Caterpillar for example having just cut 20,000 jobs, I think the industry hopes that what comes out of Washington will at least be reasonable and fair economically."

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   01 EDITION	Beware of the dangers of high-speed governing  	JAY AMBROSE, Scripps Howard News Service  	A; Pg. 07  	686 words  	Beware of the dangers of high-speed governingLiNeBrEaKBy JAY AMBROSELiNeBrEaKScripps Howard News ServiceLiNeBrEaK"The days of Washington dragging its heels are over," said President Barack Obama the other day as he hastened to destroy the auto industry, eliminate jobs, render Americans less safe when they drive and gouge more dollars out of them.LiNeBrEaKWhen you are president, such things can be easy, a virtual snap of the fingers, simply a matter of issuing a couple of executive orders, one of which says the following in so many words: The administration is going to go through some motions with EPA and then let California and other states set their own tailpipe emission standards even though they are much tougher than national standards. LiNeBrEaKObama, who apparently feels himself qualified to next run for CEO at General Motors, assured us that the dictates would be good for the auto industry, which is buncombe. Because they are such a big hunk of the market, California and a handful of like-minded states will decide what happens in the rest of the country, giving us the kind of market interference the Constitution's commerce clause was meant to prevent. The industry will take it on the chin, and there will be more unemployed in the streets.LiNeBrEaKExecutive orders cannot create new technology, and the auto industry will initially have to meet the standards at least in part through existing small hybrids that consumers have repeatedly shown they don't much want, it has been pointed out. So after the auto companies have retooled and otherwise gone to enormous expense, there the cars will sit, interesting objects to look at, but, hey, who wants to take them home?LiNeBrEaKOf course, some will be bought, which isn't necessarily the best thing for those buying them. Small cars are more dangerous in collisions than large cars, and in the past, federally enforced efficiency standards may have killed thousands people more than would otherwise have died, according to a committee of the National Academy of Sciences. Cars are safer now than then, but smaller cars do have risks that should not be forced on people. Small vehicles generally can also have drastically decreased utility for some families and many businesses.LiNeBrEaKThese hybrid compacts will also cost more than many people will want to pay, and as an automotive expert said on PBS's "NewsHour" the other night, many consumers will turn to the used car market for their needs, saving money and getting what they want. A consequence will be that such objectives as decreasing dependence on foreign oil and sending fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere could be largely defeated, at least until manufacturers develop new technologies they are seriously pursuing.LiNeBrEaKA more direct route to the ends Obama has in mind would be higher gas taxes, but the public is quick to catch on to that hit on their pocketbooks while many somehow embrace the political dodge that efficiency standards won't cost them a nickel. It's true that, right now, in the middle of economic misfortune, higher energy taxes of any kind would be more poison than antidote, but so are presidential commands piling unneeded encumbrances on an important industry already stumbling and therefore on the receiving end of billions in federal rescue dollars.LiNeBrEaKSome figure that, because of the governmental largesse, the industry will now purr more than bark about what's happening to it. A hope apparently is that Obama will arrange tax credits prompting purchases of fuel-efficient cars. Interesting concept: You take a tottering industry, agree it should be bailed out, make it totter more, bail it out again, and then call it free enterprise and tell the public you are saving the country.LiNeBrEaKWhether it's issuing executive orders or pushing for passage of an economic stimulus package, Obama seems in an awful hurry to make an impression of decisive change. More wisdom just might reside in slowing down a bit.

We cannot afford to ignore the fact that rail is the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly form of transportation.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the National Association of Railroad Passengers, Amtrak in 2006 was 18 percent more fuel efficient per passenger mile than commercial airlines and 25 percent more fuel efficient than cars. LiNeBrEaKAmtrak has taken for its motto "Amtrak Recognizes the Environment." Rail travel contributes less greenhouse gasses per passenger mile than either car or air travel. Thus, as a more energy-efficient way to travel, rail contributes less per passenger mile to global warming than other systems of public transportation.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists have stepped up their pressure to seek cleaner methods for our everyday tasks, whether at work, at home or on the road. With a little initiative, we can do our part.LiNeBrEaKBARBARA TUCKERLiNeBrEaKLucedale, Miss.LiNeBrEaKLincoln fought to preserve unionLiNeBrEaKI am responding to the Jan. 13 letter titled "Abe Lincoln was the demagogue." The writer quotes from a book he read which implies that Ol' Abe was just another sleazy politician, and suggests that there is not much difference between Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and Lincoln's political maneuvers.LiNeBrEaKHe quotes that Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was "nothing but a political gimmick."LiNeBrEaKSlavery was written into the Constitution and Lincoln had no authority as president to ban it. So he did what he could, using his war powers as commander in chief to free slaves in states in rebellion. Lincoln had to use all of his considerable political skills to hold the union together while fighting the deadliest war in American history.LiNeBrEaKThe Democrats, weakened from losing their Southern members, were still an active factor in U.S. politics and they were strongly denouncing the war. The states exercised more power in those days than today, and Lincoln needed their support to conduct the war. The Civil War was by no means a popular war.LiNeBrEaKWhat the writer has overlooked in comparing Blagojevich's political actions with those of Lincoln is the motive. Lincoln was apparently a master at political wheeling and dealing, and he used his skill for a great purpose.LiNeBrEaKHe preserved the union, won a terrible war and set the stage for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution on Dec. 18, 1865.LiNeBrEaKH.P. LOFTINLiNeBrEaKSpanish FortLiNeBrEaKChange our ways, support ObamaLiNeBrEaKIf we truly love America, we Americans should all want to see President Barack Obama and his new administration succeed, because this will mean that our country will succeed. Success or failure will depend as much on what we Americans do as what Obama and the new administration do.LiNeBrEaKMany of us may need to change our ways.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama has said he wants an America which is not Democratic or Republican. He says he wants an America which is not divided. He says he wants an America which will provide equal rights for all. He says he wants an America that is free, prosperous and safe.LiNeBrEaKSince we, too, want these same things, we must give President Obama a chance to accomplish these goals. If he fails to do what is right, then we can criticize him.LiNeBrEaKNow, here is the problem. In Alabama, and especially in the Mobile area, there are some who don't want to give our new president a chance. Leading this parade is Rush Limbaugh, who is on the radio three hours a day just to bash Obama and his Democratic administration.LiNeBrEaKWho is responsible for this hate radio? Locally, it is on 710-AM. It's also the people who listen and the people who buy from the advertisers who support this negative talk.LiNeBrEaKI don't believe that filling the airwaves with negative talk all day long is good for America.LiNeBrEaKMARION COLLOMLiNeBrEaKMobileLiNeBrEaKL'Arche support was impressiveLiNeBrEaKI want to thank the people of Mobile for supporting the eighth annual BankTrust First Light Marathon held Jan. 11. It turned out to be a great event for the runners (a record 1,480), the people of Mobile, the many volunteers and the residents of the L'Arche Community.LiNeBrEaKOver the past eight years the core committee established and met three modest goals. First, we provided a quality race on a certified course in which we have had approximately 9,300 registered runners. Second, this race has given us an opportunity to showcase the city of Mobile and its various neighborhoods by welcoming more than 6,000 people from 50 states and 15 countries since 2001.LiNeBrEaKThese guests have had an impact on the city during our annual races with the use of more than 2,000 room nights.LiNeBrEaKThe third goal of providing financial support to L'Arche Mobile was met by raising more than $200,000 over the history of this race.LiNeBrEaKThe city's support was fantastic. The Office of Special Events provided technical and logistical support. The Police Department did a wonderful job with traffic control. The Public Works Department was essential in providing tables and chairs at the water stops and the finish line.LiNeBrEaKThe race also received wonderful support from the Mobile Area Water and Sewer Service, which provided water coolers for the 20 water stops on the course, and from CandH Construction, which placed over 1,000 cones along the 26-mile route.LiNeBrEaKWe could not have had such a successful race without our many volunteers and sponsors.LiNeBrEaKMARTIN E.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Four LI students make it to prestigious Intel finals  	Karla Schuster and Stacey Altherr, Newsday, Melville, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	906 words  	Jan. 29--For parents wondering what to tell their kids about teenage drinking, high school scientist Chelsea Jurman has an answer: What you don't say may be even more important.LiNeBrEaKJurman, a Roslyn High School senior who spent a year examining how parental behavior and teens' perception of it predicts underage drinking, was one of four Long Island students to be named finalists yesterday in the national Intel science contest.LiNeBrEaKHer findings might come as a surprise to some parents, who believe being honest with their children about their own high school drinking is the best way to promote responsible attitudes toward alcohol. Turns out, teens who think their parents drank when they were underage are more likely to do it themselves. LiNeBrEaKThe project involved analyzing data from 125 student surveys distributed to upperclassmen at Roslyn High.LiNeBrEaK"I wanted to find out why are some people starting to drink while some people are still saying no," said Jurman, 17, who is also editor of the school newspaper. "What I've taken away from what I found is that parents might not want to discuss their past behaviors with their kids."LiNeBrEaKIn all, New York State had nine finalists -- the most of any state. They included four from New York City (two each from prestigious Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science) and one from Westchester County.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to Jurman, two students from Ward Melville High School in East Setauket and one from Smithtown High School West were named finalists. Last year, Long Island had nine Intel finalists.LiNeBrEaKThe finalists will receive at least $5,000 each in scholarships and a new laptop. They will compete in March in Washington, D.C., for a $100,000 scholarship from Intel.LiNeBrEaKBoth finalists from Ward Melville tackled cancer research in their projects. Senior Preya Shah, 17, of Setauket, created a new synthetic drug that targets cancer cells while leaving healthy ones unharmed.LiNeBrEaK"The novel drug has exciting potential to treat drug-resistant cancer without causing significant side effects," said Shah, who says her mother, a doctor, and her father, an engineer, stoked her interest in science.LiNeBrEaK"My parents have been encouraging," she said.LiNeBrEaKFor Shah's classmate, Christine Shrock, 17, of Setauket, science is also a family affair. Both her parents are scientists, and her project was inspired by her aunt and grandfather's battles with cancer. Her research targeted structural changes at the molecular level of a protein called MDM2, to help design better cancer drugs. She was a regional finalist last school year in the Siemens Competition in Math, Science and Technology for a project on HIV with her younger sister, Ellen.LiNeBrEaKShah was a Siemens regional finalist this year.LiNeBrEaKPatrick Abejar, 17, a senior at Smithtown West, focused his project on global warming patterns. He measured the level of boron in marine fossils, and found that those levels fluctuate with global warming and cooling. The higher levels indicate a global warming cycle, lower levels a global cooling period.LiNeBrEaK"The pattern is cyclical and we can use this model to predict what will occur next," Abejar said. Even so, the teenage scientist was unable to predict his own success in the contest.LiNeBrEaKDuring a conversation with his father Tuesday night, on the eve of the finalists' announcement, Abejar warned his family not to get their hopes up. "I was, like, 'It's really tough and they only pick 40, so don't expect that much,'" Abejar said. "Just, like, literally 30 minutes later, they called to tell me I was a finalist."LiNeBrEaKLI'S WIZ KIDSLiNeBrEaKThis year's Intel finalists and their projectsLiNeBrEaKChristine Lee SHROCK, 17LiNeBrEaKWard Melville High SchoolLiNeBrEaKPROJECT "Effects of Lid Dynamics on the Binding of MDM2 to the Tumor Suppressor Protein p53: Implications for Cancer Therapeutics"LiNeBrEaKDESCRIPTION Targets structural changes at the molecular level of a protein called MDM2, so that better drugs can be designed to treat cancer.LiNeBrEaKMENTOR Professor Carlos Simmerling, Stony Brook UniversityLiNeBrEaKPREYA SHAH, 17LiNeBrEaKWard Melville High SchoolLiNeBrEaKPROJECT "Combating Cancer: Design and Synthesis of Dual-Warhead Tumor-Targeting Drug Conjugates"LiNeBrEaKDESCRIPTION Shah created a new synthetic drug that targets cancer cells, but leaves healthy cells unharmed.LiNeBrEaKMENTOR Professor Iwao Ojima and graduate student Edison Zuniga, both from Stony Brook UniversityLiNeBrEaKPATRICK JEFFREY ABEJAR, 17LiNeBrEaKSmithtown High School WestLiNeBrEaKPROJECT "Utilizing Boron Isotopic Secular Variation as a Proxy to Assess Climate Change"LiNeBrEaKDESCRIPTION Abejar measured the level of boron in marine fossils and found those levels fluctuate with global warming and cooling, which he said offers a model to predict climate change.LiNeBrEaKMENTOR Dr. E.

The News-Sentinel (Fort Wayne, Indiana)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	The News-Sentinel, Fort Wayne, Ind., Kevin Leininger column: Legislation serves up the same old D.C. pork  	Kevin Leininger, The News-Sentinel, Fort Wayne, Ind.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	806 words  	Jan. 29--Given what Congress is trying to do to American taxpayers -- not to mention their descendants -- perhaps that $200 million for contraceptives should have been left in the House's $819 billion stimulus bill, after all.LiNeBrEaKBut fear not: This supposed economic cure-all still contains $1 billion for Amtrak, $2 billion in child care subsidies, $25 million for new trails, $7 billion to modernize federal buildings, $150 million for the Smithsonian Institution, $400 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, $650 million for digital-TV converters and $300 million for global-warming research. LiNeBrEaKOf course, if the politicians really cared about cooling the planet, they'd stop spewing hot air about "change" and admit that this is really just a bloated version of the pork-barrel, earmark-laden, lobbyist-influenced legislation voters no doubt thought became extinct when those money-grubbing Republicans were booted out of office.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of focusing on a stimulus bill that will continue to open up the credit markets and create jobs, this bill spends billions on Democrats' wish-list projects," said Rep. Mark Souder, R-3rd.LiNeBrEaKNot that House Republicans deserve any credit for their unanimous opposition to this monstrosity. If recent history is any indication, they seem to remember their smaller-government, fiscally conservative principles only when Democrats are in charge.LiNeBrEaKA lot of attention has been paid to the bill's relative lack of a genuine "stimulus" -- that is, spending that might attack the recession by quickly injecting cash into the economy. It contains only $20 billion in tax cuts for businesses, for example, and just $30 billion for the infrastructure improvements President Barack Obama so vigorously proposed during the campaign. In reality, most of the spending will produce relatively few jobs and some of it won't even be seen for several years, by which time the recession should be over.LiNeBrEaKThat is, unless the $347 billion needed to pay interest on more than $800 billion prolongs it. At least bankers and the Chinese should benefit.LiNeBrEaKBut because it sharply illustrated America's growing cultural divide, Speaker Nancy Pelosi's now-aborted plan for federally funded contraception should have received far more scrutiny than it received.LiNeBrEaKThe San Francisco Democrat justified the proposal this way: "Well, family planning services reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now, and part of what we do for children's health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs ... contraception will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government."LiNeBrEaKThe Christian Coalition blasted Pelosi's proposal as "bigoted, racist, elitist and anti-child," but it was much more than that. Pelosi's words reveal government at its paternalistic worst, motivated by the belief that children are a drain on government and a threat to the economy.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, just the opposite is true -- or should be.LiNeBrEaKThink about it: Who is supposed to pay the trillions of dollars in debt Pelosi and other politicians have blithely accrued over the years? Certainly not the people voting today -- they would revolt. America's future rests with its children -- children who deserve to be born into stable, loving families, educated and protected and sent out into a society in which they can prosper or fail according to their ability and desire.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, that view of America has increasingly come under fire, both from ordinary people who want to be shielded from all manner of pain and from politicians only too willing to oblige.LiNeBrEaKThat's why a bill advertised as a short-term fix for an economic emergency has morphed into just another platter of pork, led by a president who vowed to reduce the influence of lobbyists but has instead made them even more powerful by putting nearly $1 trillion on the table.LiNeBrEaKWant to stimulate the economy? Unleash the power of the marketplace, allowing those who succeed to keep more of the reward and those who fail to feel more of the pain.LiNeBrEaKBut then, that just wouldn't be fair.LiNeBrEaKMaybe that's why the stimulus bill still contains $335 million for education about and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. There really is no such thing as "safe politics."LiNeBrEaKThis column is the opinion of the author and does not necessarily reflect the views of The News-Sentinel.

The News-Sentinel (Fort Wayne, Indiana)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: We can't let big unemployment numbers panic us: Never mind the Great Depression; it's not even as bad as the '80s.  	The News-Sentinel, Fort Wayne, Ind.  	COMMENTARY  	445 words  	Jan. 29--The next time you hear that this country is in the worst economy since the Great Depression, just consider this: The current recession isn't even as bad as the recession of 1981-83. During that downturn, unemployment hovered around 12 percent in Allen County. In Jay County, only 50 miles from here, unemployment peaked at more than 25 percent. LiNeBrEaKThat might be taking too long a view for the newly unemployed in Indiana, and there are a lot more of them lately. Our state tied with South Carolina for the biggest jump in unemployment in the nation in December, at 1. 1 percent. Our rate now stands at 8. 2 percent, a full percent ahead of the nation's 7. 2 percent. That represents more than 260,000 Hoosiers out of work, up from 220,000 the previous month.LiNeBrEaKThe pain of those without jobs should not be minimized, and everything that can reasonably be done for them should be done. And it should be acknowledged that there is some fear this downturn will be different than previous ones, will last longer and be deeper.LiNeBrEaKBut economies have cycles. There are peaks and valleys. We have weathered them before, and we will weather this one. If we forget that, there is a danger we will panic and take actions that will actually make things worse.LiNeBrEaKYou can almost smell the panic in Washington, and there are ample signs that our elected leaders are headed for the cliffs, intent on taking us with them. Where did President Obama get the bright idea to hit Detroit with tougher emission and mileage standards at a time when automakers are fighting for their lives? Why is now the time to signal that we are going to roll over on "global warming"?LiNeBrEaKThen there is the nearly $1 trillion "stimulus" package. Who knows what is even in the bill and what parts might actually help the economy? All we can know for certain is that it will increase the federal debt tremendously, not a help to any economy.LiNeBrEaKIndiana will get its share of that big package. We might as well use the money, but we should spend it as wisely and carefully as we can.LiNeBrEaKIn the meantime, we shouldn't make any panicky moves of our own. Through thrift and planning, Indiana is much better prepared to meet this downturn than other states. And thrift and planning will see us through the crisis.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	288 words  	Jan. 29--Gov. Chris Gregoire rolled out a legislative package today to combat climate change and create green energy jobs.LiNeBrEaKHouse Bill 1819 and Senate Bill 5735 would: LiNeBrEaK* Invest $455 million in energy-reducing transportation projects, energy efficient buildings and clean energy technology designed to add some 2,900 green collar jobs to the 47,194 green jobs already in place statewide in 27 different industries.LiNeBrEaK* Develop a cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The bill leaves open for further negotiations how much pollution would be traded freely among polluters and how much would carry a price tag.LiNeBrEaK*Provide a state tax exemption to encourage state residents to buy plug-in electric vehicles.LiNeBrEaK*Amend the state Building Code to increase energy efficiency in new buildings by 30 percent above the 2006 code standards.LiNeBrEaKThe governor defended the timing of her climate action-green jobs bill in the face of a deepening economic recession and multi-billion state budget deficit.LiNeBrEaK"There's no good news anywhere in the world on the economy," she said, speaking to South Puget Sound Community College students in a new, energy-efficient campus building.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	592 words  	Jan. 29--Majority Democrats are using "distractions" such as gay-rights issues to avoid dealing with the state's major $6 billion budget problem, Republican legislative leaders said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKSenate Republican Leader Mike Hewitt and House Republican Leader Richard DeBolt also cautioned that job losses in the region could grow larger as Democrats pursue a legislative agenda on climate change that might add regulatory burdens and costs to business.LiNeBrEaK"Many of the things they are doing today, we believe, are distractions from the real problems," Hewitt said, referring to a series of news conferences called by Senate Democrats about issues including same-sex marriage, economic-stimulus proposals, minor cuts in spending and energy legislation. "These are all distractions from the real issue." LiNeBrEaKThe Senate has unanimously approved a bill cutting an estimated $105 million in spending through June, but Republicans wanted more. A similar debate is ongoing in the House.LiNeBrEaK"We need a sustainable budget. All we're doing is pushing forward the problems to the next biennium if we don't deal with these problems today," DeBolt said.LiNeBrEaKHewitt also raised a warning flag about the economy -- and the state's major employers, who he said are laboring under a difficult tax and regulatory environment.LiNeBrEaKBoeing's agendaLiNeBrEaKHe said The Boeing Co. representatives at an aerospace task force dinner Tuesday evening laid out the Chicago-based company's legislative agenda with a word of caution. The Boeing officials, whom he did not identify, were clear that, without a shift in state policy, they would look elsewhere for their next generation of aircraft construction on the 737 and 787 models, Hewitt said.LiNeBrEaK"It was not a threat," Hewitt said. "They were giving us the facts that if there are some things not changed in the state of Washington, the likelihood (is the next round of investment) for the 787 will be done in another state. ... These are not business-friendly things that are in place in this state."LiNeBrEaKBoeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Bernard Choi later confirmed that the business climate is a worry to the company, which received a multibillion-dollar tax break in 2003 to build the 787 in Washington.LiNeBrEaK"We believe there are four steps we can take right now to make Washington and its businesses more competitive: 1) develop a sustainable budget without raising taxes; 2) continue to reform state unemployment and workers' compensation; 3) finish all authorized transportation projects with approved funding; 4) recommit to education and accountability," Choi said in an e-mailed statement.LiNeBrEaKBoeing's written legislative agenda also singles out a labor-backed bill that limits a company's legal ability to require that its employees hear the company's viewpoint on unionization and other issues. Gov. Chris Gregoire has proposed a cut in the unemployment-insurance tax rates paid by businesses. But the Association of Washington Business has been leery because she also wants to spend $200 million in surplus UI funds for job retraining. That could set the UI trust fund up for a shortfall if the recession goes on longer than expected, the AWB says.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Sunrise Edition	Industry groups challenge results of climate study  	SCOTT LEARN, The Oregonian  	Local News  	897 words  	SUMMARY: Emissions   | Caps sought by the governor would help the economy, the report saysLiNeBrEaKIndustry groups challenge results of Oregon climate draft The groups wanted to wait for "better data" on capping greenhouse gas emissions, central to the governor's agenda Industry groupsLiNeBrEaKchallenge results LiNeBrEaKof climate study Groups wereLiNeBrEaKwaiting forLiNeBrEaK'better data'LiNeBrEaKSCOTT LEARNLiNeBrEaKLimiting Oregon's greenhouse gas emissions would help the economy in the long run, a preliminary report says, but the finding is under challenge by the industry groups that helped underwrite it in the first place.LiNeBrEaKAnd that's created a tussle with the governor's office.LiNeBrEaKPutting gradually tighter limits, or caps, on greenhouse gas emissions is central to the climate change agenda Gov. Ted Kulongoski wants the Legislature to endorse. It would help Oregon reach its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, he says.LiNeBrEaKBut Kulongoski's office says industry groups helped commission a report from the economic firm EcoNorthwest, agreed to the methodology then balked at releasing it once the draft analysis came back with good economic news.LiNeBrEaK"The only thing that changed is the results came back, and they didn't like it," Kulongoski spokeswoman Anna Richter Taylor said.LiNeBrEaKThe disagreement matters because the Legislature will decide this year on Oregon's commitment to reducing its greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials say they --along with Oregon economic development officials and the head of the governor's climate change group --agreed the study wasn't ready for public release, with new and better data due by March.LiNeBrEaK"Not an industry suppression"LiNeBrEaKTen industry groups, including Associated Oregon Industries and the electric utilities PGE and PacifiCorp, helped fund the analysis, as did Oregon's economic development department and The Lemelson Foundation.LiNeBrEaK"The opposition to release (of the draft analysis) was uniform; this was not an industry suppression," said John Ledger, an AOI vice president and lobbyist. "The plan was just to have it disappear and pry better data from the WCI (Western Climate Initiative) and run with that."LiNeBrEaKBut the draft gradually leaked out, first to The Oregonian and then to environmental groups, who are using it at the Legislature to bolster their argument that a gradually tightening cap would strengthen the economy by prompting widespread energy-efficiency improvements.LiNeBrEaKUnder Oregon's plan, carbon dioxide and other gases from power plants and factories would be capped beginning in 2012, with the cap ratcheted down over time. Oregon is part of a regional capping effort by Western states, known as the Western Climate Initiative, designed to address projections of future global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe initial caps would cover fewer than 10 utility companies and about 50 companies total in Oregon, including large paper plants and lumber mills. By 2015, the caps would cover vehicle and home heating fuels, including gasoline and natural gas.LiNeBrEaKOpponents say capping emissions will increase electricity and gas prices along with the prices of goods manufactured in Western states, driving industry out. They're also skeptical of the amount that energy-efficiency projects can help cut energy use.LiNeBrEaKSupporters say rising energy prices will pressure industry, business and homeowners to invest in energy-efficiency improvements and more fuel-efficient vehicles. That will lower their energy costs overall, in part by cutting the amount utilities have to invest in power plants.LiNeBrEaKNet gain of jobs predictedLiNeBrEaKThe EcoNorthwest draft generally supports the proponents, predicting a cumulative loss of more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs by 2020, with paper plants particularly hard hit, but higher economic growth and a net gain of 43,000 jobs overall.LiNeBrEaKThat's compared with roughly 185,000 manufacturing jobs today and 1. 7 million nonfarm jobs total.LiNeBrEaKBut the data, boiled down from a WCI model for the West, generated some odd results. The model predicts, for example, that residents and nonindustrial businesses would spend less on energy efficiency with emissions restrictions.LiNeBrEaKThe analysis also assumes that energy-efficiency projects chop 1 percent a year from annual growth in energy consumption, even as the population rises, which opponents see as optimistic.LiNeBrEaKThe Electric Power Research Institute figures conservation projects can realistically knock down the annual growth of electricity demand from 1. 07 percent to 0. 83 percent over the next two decades.LiNeBrEaKStephen Grover of EcoNorthwest, the primary author of the report, said he made adjustments to try to offset the odd energy-efficiency spending numbers. But the group unanimously agreed to wait for better data from the WCI, expected in March, before issuing the report.LiNeBrEaK"If I were to hazard a guess, I would say the numbers in the end will still end up positive," Grover said. "But they may still change significantly, they may be higher or they may be lower. We just don't know."LiNeBrEaKJake Weigler, campaign director for RePower Oregon, a coalition of cap supporters, said the potential loss of industrial jobs is a "major challenge" for the plan. His group supports Kulongoski's proposals for assistance, including tax credits, for industries that have to buy new equipment to reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaKTo download a copy of the draft analysis, go to www.oregonlive.com/environment.LiNeBrEaKScott Learn: 503-294-7657; scottlearn@news.oregonian.com	EMISSIONS (91%); GOVERNORS (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (88%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (78%); POWER PLANTS (77%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); LOBBYING (73%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (73%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (72%); SAW MILLS (68%); PAPER MILLS (60%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (90%)  	PACIFICORP (53%)  		OREGON, USA (94%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  		TED KULONGOSKI (71%)  														
Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	How would new emissions rules affect us?  		A SECTION; Pg. A01  	903 words  	New automobile fuel-efficiency rules -- sought by California and 13 other states, including Pennsylvania -- would require automakers to cut carbon dioxide emissions by nearly a third by 2016, four years ahead of the current federal timetable.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed rules could add $2,000 to $7,000 to the sticker price of a new car or truck if carmakers decide to produce two sets of vehicles, industry analysts said. At least one observer wonders if the proposals are regulatory overkill when carmakers and dealers can least afford it. LiNeBrEaK"It is shockingly poor timing, considering the current status of the automotive industry," said Karl Brauer, editor-in-chief of Edmunds.com, a Web-based service that offers advice to car buyers. "Do you think they're ready for increased costs in their world?"LiNeBrEaKBut Gov. Ed Rendell and environmentalists praised President Barack Obama's order this week for a federal review of California's request. President George W. Bush had prevented some states from going to stricter standards.LiNeBrEaKObama's order could allow the states to further control emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The argument is that, over the long run, the improved fuel economy of vehicles would provide huge dividends for the environment, the economy and national security.LiNeBrEaK"Ensuring that California, Pennsylvania and other states can put cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars on the road means ... fewer trips to the gas pump, fewer dollars being shipped overseas to oil-rich nations, and fewer pollutants in our air," Rendell said.LiNeBrEaKThe only way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks is to reduce fuel consumption. The California rules would require that all autos and light trucks sold by a given manufacturer average 36. 8 miles a gallon by 2016.LiNeBrEaKIf authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency, the rules would complete a two-step process launched here in 2006. That was when Rendell tied Pennsylvania's clean-air policy to the California emissions rules that exceed current federal standards.LiNeBrEaKNew cars sold in Pennsylvania have met California standards since model year 2008 for nitrogen oxides and other smog-producing compounds. That has had little impact on Pennsylvania consumers, said John Sutliff of Saturn of Carlisle Pike.LiNeBrEaKBut Sutliff and others worry that, if the greenhouse gas rules go through, there will be price and selection differences that could put Pennsylvania dealers at a disadvantage -- especially in border areas near Delaware, West Virginia and Ohio, which are not following California's lead.LiNeBrEaKFor example, to keep their "fuel efficiency fleet average" in compliance here, automakers might be forced to limit sales of heavy trucks and vans in Pennsylvania while continuing to sell them in Delaware or West Virginia.LiNeBrEaKOther cars sold here could be priced higher if automakers decided to produce two sets of vehicles, one for the California standard and one for the rest of the nation, said Rebecca Lindland, director of automotive research for IHS Global Insight, an economic research firm.LiNeBrEaKStill, an aide to state Sen. Mary Jo White, R-Venango, a leading opponent of applying the California rules here, said his boss will take a wait-and-see approach to the greenhouse gas issue.LiNeBrEaK"We need to sort of sit back and see if these cars are, in fact, going to cost considerably more to the consumer," said Patrick Henderson, executive director of the Senate Energy and Environmental Resources Committee that White chairs.LiNeBrEaKSome observers have suggested that, if the EPA grants California's waiver, as expected, the manufacturers might opt to build all cars to the higher standard, because the 14 states involved -- including New York, New Jersey and Maryland -- account for about half of the new car market.LiNeBrEaKEven if automakers only build to one set of certifications, Brauer said, the shortened transition to the higher fuel standard is likely to make vehicles cost more.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists, meanwhile, say the industry is exaggerating the costs of compliance with the proposed rules. They add that, when gas prices soar past the $3-a-gallon mark again, most consumers will be applauding the changes.LiNeBrEaK"The president is being very smart about this, looking at the economy and environment in a comprehensive way," said David Yarnold of the Environmental Defense Fund. He argues that the proposed state rules can help lead to a rebirth of the American auto industry.LiNeBrEaKCHARLES THOMPSON: 705-5724 or cthompson@patriot-news.comLiNeBrEaKINFOBOX: LiNeBrEaKTHE PROPOSED CLEAN-AIR RULESLiNeBrEaKCalifornia can seek its own rules because its clean-air legislation predated federal law. If the EPA grants a waiver, other states can adopt those rules. The recent issues: LiNeBrEaK* In 2006, the Rendell administration opted to use California auto-emissions standards as part of Pennsylvania's clean-air plan. Since then, new cars sold here have had to meet California's stricter pollution standards.LiNeBrEaK* California has wanted to reduce vehicle carbon dioxide emissions to fight global warming. But the Bush administration refused to grant a waiver to exceed federal Clean Air Act standards last year.LiNeBrEaK* On Monday, President Barack Obama ordered the EPA to reconsider the California request.LiNeBrEaK* In Pennsylvania, environmentalists say the proposed standards could reduce global-warming pollution from vehicles 25 percent by 2025. Auto industry analysts contend the rules could inflate vehicle prices by $2,000 or more and limit selection.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   SOONER EDITION	PLANT SHIPPED TAINTED PEANUTS  		NATIONAL; NATIONAL BRIEFS; Pg. A-4  	549 words  	WASHINGTON -- The salmonella outbreak yesterday spawned one of the largest ever product recalls by a Georgia peanut plant where federal inspectors reported finding roaches, mold, a leaking roof and other sanitary problems. LiNeBrEaKManagers at the Blakely, Ga. plant owned by Peanut Corp. of America continued shipping peanut products even after they were found to contain salmonella.LiNeBrEaKPeanut Corp. expanded its recall yesterday to all peanut products produced at the plant since Jan. 1, 2007. The company is relatively small, but its peanut paste is an ingredient in hundreds of other food products, from ice cream, to Asian-style sauces, to dog biscuits.LiNeBrEaKA senior lawmaker in Congress and Georgia's agriculture commissioner called for a criminal investigation of the company, but the Food and Drug Administration said such a step is premature while its own food safety investigation continues.LiNeBrEaKMore than 500 people have gotten sick in the outbreak and at least eight may have died as a result of salmonella infection. More than 400 products have already been recalled. The plant has stopped all production.LiNeBrEaKGore lobbies Senate panelLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Former vice president Al Gore urged lawmakers yesterday to adopt a binding carbon cap and push for a new international climate pact by the end of this year in order to avert catastrophic global warming.LiNeBrEaKAppearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Gore delivered a short slide show that amounted to an update of his Oscar-winning documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," lecturing some of his former colleagues that even if the world halted greenhouse gas emissions now, it could experience a temperature rise of between 2. 5 to 7. 5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.LiNeBrEaK"This would bring a screeching halt to human civilization and threaten life everywhere on Earth, and this is by the end of this century," Mr. Gore said..LiNeBrEaKSenate panel OKs HolderLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Eric Holder's nomination as the first African-American attorney general moved to the full Senate yesterday with broad bipartisan support, as Republicans who earlier criticized the nominee determined he was well qualified for the job.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted 17-2 to favorably recommend Mr. Holder's confirmation to the Senate, which could vote as early as today.LiNeBrEaKThe only senators who voted against Mr. Holder in committee were Republicans John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.LiNeBrEaKMr. Cornyn criticized Mr. Holder's role in controversial pardons and questioned whether he would protect intelligence agents who participated in harsh interrogations.LiNeBrEaKGovernor to speak at trialLiNeBrEaKSPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Gov. Rod Blagojevich has asked to make a statement at the impeachment trial he has so far avoided, but still refuses to answer questions from the lawmakers who will decide whether to remove him from office, the Illinois Senate president announced yesterday.LiNeBrEaKA buzz swept through the Senate chambers during the surprise announcement, which interrupted the third day of the unprecedented trial. The prosecution later rested its case against Mr. Blagojevich, who is accused of trying to sell President Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat to the highest bidder, among other corruption charges.LiNeBrEaKClosing arguments are expected today, and the Senate could decide Mr. Blagojevich's fate later in the day.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition; All Editions	Fund aims to help people offset carbon emissions  	Michael Scott, Plain Dealer Reporter  	METRO; Pg. B3  	482 words  	Organizers of the Cleveland Carbon Fund, which debuted Wednesday, are calling the venture the "first-ever community-based, open-access carbon reduction fund" in the country. LiNeBrEaKSimply put, that's a way for individuals and companies in Northeast Ohio to reduce their own carbon footprint by buying into a fund administered by the Cleveland Foundation.LiNeBrEaKMoney from the fund will go to nonprofit organizations for local projects such as replacement of traditional light bulbs with compact fluorescents, tree planting and solar panel installments, all also aimed at the greening of Cleveland.LiNeBrEaKRight now donations would be valued at $20 per metric ton of carbon avoided, a figure based on expected projects, although the group won't start accepting proposals until April 1.LiNeBrEaKThat means if you were to donate $100 to the fund, you could subtract five tons of carbon from your personal footprint (the group's Web site, clevelandcarbonfund.org, includes a personal calculator.)LiNeBrEaKThat per-ton value would be adjusted continually. In other words, you get more carbon offset bang for your buck the more efficient the carbon-reduction project.LiNeBrEaK"We feel like we've found a nice niche with this by giving people a real sense of the amount of carbon their donation will remove from the atmosphere - and by funding important local projects," said John Mitterholzer, senior program officer for the George Gund Foundation, one of five founding members of the fund.LiNeBrEaKThe four others are the city of Cleveland, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Foundation and Cleveland Museum of Natural History.LiNeBrEaKMitterholzer said he and Andrew Watterson, program director for Cleveland's Office of Sustainability, began talking about the idea about two years ago.LiNeBrEaK"There were already ways out there for people to donate to a fund to reduce their carbon - whether through their airline, insurance company or any number of things," Watterson said. "This is similar, but these are local dollars and local projects."LiNeBrEaKMitterholzer said the Gund Foundation has committed this year to put enough money in the fund to offset all of the carbon emissions from travel by board members and employees and electricity costs for its downtown office - estimated at $1,500, or about 75 metric tons of carbon.LiNeBrEaKThe fund is not an official carbon credit program, however, and the carbon reductions by individuals cannot be bought or sold as under so-called cap and trade programs, officials said.LiNeBrEaKBut a donation to the fund is tax-deductible, Mitterholzer said, and donors also gain the knowledge of how much carbon their donation will remove from the local atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK"If you believe in the science of climate change, then you know that it will take everyone taking action and changing our lifestyles - not just a fund like ours," Mitterholzer said. "But it's one tool we can use to reduce carbon outputs."LiNeBrEaKTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter: mscott@plaind.com, 216-999-4148	CARBON OFFSETS (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); FOUNDATIONS (89%); PERSONAL FINANCE (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (75%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); HISTORY (71%); CLIMATOLOGY (70%); SOLAR ENERGY (70%); TAX DEDUCTIONS (70%); CLIMATE CHANGE (70%); AVIATION INSURANCE (50%)  			CLEVELAND, OH, USA (95%) OHIO, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.   																
Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Strangely silent on inaugural cost  		COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	122 words  	Where are the people who screamed over the $45 million spent on the 2004 inauguration of George W. Bush? They are strangely silent over the $150 million spent for Barack Obama s. So much for an economic downturn. LiNeBrEaKIn addition to this, the Institute for Liberty has calculated the following: As a result of the influx of an estimated 600 private jets, countless commercial aircraft and herds of parade horses, the carbon-footprint tally of the Obama inauguration was 575 million pounds of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKI am curious what Al Gore thinks of this.LiNeBrEaKThe incoming administration apparently made two observations: The economy is better than we thought and global warming is a myth concocted by the lords of the left.LiNeBrEaKJIM PRIORLiNeBrEaKThe Villages, Fla.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Better late than never for mileage  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	607 words  	The following editorial appeared in the Sacramento Bee on Wednesday, Jan. 28:LiNeBrEaKAfter less than a week in office, President Barack Obama has moved aggressively to wipe away one of the most noxious anti-environmental policies of the Bush administration. On Monday, the president ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine whether California and 13 other states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia clashed repeatedly with the Bush administration over this issue. The state approved a historic greenhouse gas control measure in 2007 that required cars sold in the state to reduce the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide they emitted. The new standards would force car manufacturers to reduce emissions by 30 percent in new cars and trucks sold in California by 2016. LiNeBrEaKOther states followed California's lead. But car manufacturers, with the backing of the Bush administration, sued, arguing in court that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant that could be regulated by the Clean Air Act. The courts backed California. Nonetheless, to impose the new, tougher regulations, California still needed a waiver from the federal EPA. Ignoring the advice of its agency scientists, the Bush administration consistently refused to grant it. By ordering a review of that decision, Obama made clear he's ready to change the policy.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said, "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKObama on Monday also ordered a speedup of new auto efficiency standards approved by Congress in 2007. The new rules would require new cars to achieve 35 miles per gallon on average beginning in 2020. Obama wants the guidelines to start affecting cars as early as 2011.LiNeBrEaKBush administration officials had estimated it would cost the industry $100 billion to retool to meet the new standard. With two of the biggest car companies, General Motors and Chrysler, close to financial collapse, critics of the Obama orders say the companies cannot afford to comply.LiNeBrEaKWhen auto companies were flying high, producing behemoth gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles and trucks, they offered other excuses. The public, auto executives claimed, would not buy energy-efficient cars. Now, with the big gas guzzlers languishing unsold on showroom floors, they claim they can't afford to retool.LiNeBrEaKIn reality, they can't afford to do otherwise. If there is going to be an auto industry in this country, it must adapt to a much more energy-efficient future.LiNeBrEaKBut the issue goes beyond the economic self-interest of car companies. The nation cannot afford to continue to drive inefficient cars that require massive amounts of gasoline refined from oil that comes from countries that are hostile to us. Such wastefulness threatens our security and our economy. It produces global warming greenhouse gases that threaten out planet.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKSadly, the change is coming much later than it needed to. That will make it harder for the car companies to adapt, but adapt they must.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Sacramento Bee Web edition on the World Wide Web at www.sacbee.com	EMISSIONS (91%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); MOTOR VEHICLES (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (89%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); APPROVALS (77%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (76%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (76%); SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (75%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (75%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (61%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (57%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (57%)  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (57%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (57%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 29, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090129-BC-MILEAGE-EDITORIAL  	Newspaper  	SA  	2009 Sacramento Bee   	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%)  						GMP (PAR) (57%); GMB (BRU) (57%); GM (NYSE) (57%)  								
Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Mining protected as salmon dwindle  	The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	322 words  	Jan. 29--The California Department of Fish and Game said "no" to fish this week and "yes" to gold miners. Even though experts within DFG have said that suction dredge gold mining is having "deleterious effects on fish," including endangered coho salmon, the department declined to further restrict gold miners who use giant dredges to vacuum up rock and sand from creek and river bottoms, likely killing fish in the process. LiNeBrEaKIn a petition to the state, the Karuk Indian Tribe and several environmental organizations had asked the department to curtail dredging on sensitive stretches of waterway. The department said it could not act until it completed a court-ordered review of the issue. But DFG was supposed to complete that review last July. It hasn't even begun.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, so serious is the decline of salmon that federal regulators banned fishing off the coasts of California and Oregon last year. State officials say the mining restriction requested by the Karuks would do nothing to address ocean conditions, which are suspected to be the main cause of the decline. Suction dredge gold miners insist that global warming and dams are the culprits and that their mining operations actually improve fish habitat.LiNeBrEaKNo doubt global warming, dams, logging, pesticides and other human activities kill fish and destroy habitat, but the bulk of the science strongly suggests that suction dredge mining harms fish, too.LiNeBrEaKAs salmon populations dwindle, the state agency charged with protecting them protects gold miners instead.

San Antonio Express-News 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   STATEandMETRO Edition	Mayor unveils roadmap for new energy economy  	Anton Caputo, STAFF  	METRO AND STATE NEWS; Pg. 5B  	663 words  	Mayor Phil Hardberger rolled out his long awaited sustainability plan Wednesday with goals nothing short of making the city a national leader in the new energy economy and tops in the country for environmental development policies.LiNeBrEaKThe multi-pronged plan, called Mission Verde, seeks to capitalize on the billions of dollars likely to be made available for renewable energy and energy conservation projects in the federal economic stimulus package. But its roots go back a year to the mayor's last "State of the City" address.LiNeBrEaKHardberger said that the planning done since then to produce the flurry of documents released Wednesday puts San Antonio in a good position to vie for the federal funds and remake the city's economy. LiNeBrEaK"Our intent is to move forward while others are sitting still," Hardberger said. "This is the future. Somebody is going to do it. I sure hope it is San Antonio."LiNeBrEaKMost of the proposals focus on developing clean energy and jobs to service the new infrastructure. They include:LiNeBrEaK* A program to lend home and business owners money to conduct energy efficiency projects that offer enough savings on a power bill to offset the debt payment. The plan involves a surcharge on a monthly power bill to pay the loan. The plan also includes a free weatherization program for qualified low-income residents.LiNeBrEaK* Incentives aimed at creating a true distributed energy system in San Antonio that features solar panels on 50,000 homes and 6,000 businesses. The resulting energy production would be enough to fully power 30,000 homes in San Antonio and save the equivalent in greenhouse gases of taking 40,000 cars off the road.LiNeBrEaK* New codes that create buildings with a minimum of 15 percent more energy efficiency than required by current ones. That would increase to 30 percent in three years with the goal of adopting building codes by 2030 that produce zero-carbon buildings. These are buildings that are so energy efficient they are capable of being fully powered with a solar energy system or other renewable energy system that creates no greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK* Working with Alamo Community Colleges to create a green jobs training program.LiNeBrEaK* A $100 million venture capital fund to attract sustainable energy and clean technology businesses to San Antonio.LiNeBrEaKCombined, the proposals are capable of saving or producing enough energy to power at least 80,000 homes and save the equivalent in greenhouse gas emissions of taking at least 130,000 cars off the road.LiNeBrEaKMany of the projects already have moved forward in the past year and are likely to make their way to the City Council in the next few months for action. The schedule calls for hiring consultants for the distributed energy system and green jobs program as soon as February and adopting new building codes and starting a home and commercial building retrofit program as soon as March.LiNeBrEaKAll the council members who commented after the Mission Verde plan was presented at Wednesday's council session were supportive.LiNeBrEaKConsultant James Nixon of the Oakland, Calif.-based Sustainable Systems said the program has the potential to "break new ground," vaulting San Antonio ahead of cities like Chicago and New York that have well known green city programs. The difference, he said, is that those programs focus on fighting climate change, while San Antonio is the first to "approach this from an economic development perspective" and "to really take seriously the idea of a sustainable economy."LiNeBrEaKDespite the exuberance displayed at Wednesday's meeting, city officials acknowledged that there were many hurdles to overcome to fulfill the heady goals of the mayor's plan.LiNeBrEaKOne looming question is what priority the new mayor will place on the Mission Verde plan when he or she takes office in June. And given the nature of the plan, it can't be done piecemeal, said Richard Varn, the city's chief information officer.LiNeBrEaK"If you do one of these things without doing the others, you do not get a sustainable plan," he said. "It will not work."

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Oil and global warming  		OPINION  	1069 words  	Letter writer Michael Logan may be right that either there is no "proof" of global warming or there is no "proof" that it will do any harm.LiNeBrEaKOf course, proof that future events are certain to happen can be very difficult. Too few believed those who predicted the economic melt down we are now enduring. Those seers of gloom and doom had no "proof."LiNeBrEaKI assume Logan also denigrates the idea that mankind's burning of fossil fuel will lead to an over-abundance of green house gases which will help lead to global warming. LiNeBrEaKHowever, even if Mr. Logan is right, continuing with our fossil fuel based economies brings up the following issues that run parallel to those involved in the "alleged" global warming.LiNeBrEaKFossil fuels are finite resources and will eventually run out. With vast numbers of people in China, India and other places increasing their use of fossil fuels to advance their standards of living, the day of reckoning may come sooner than we think.LiNeBrEaKModern civilizations are based upon what has been the cheap energy of fossil fuels. As these resources become scarcer, we had better find some alternatives, or be ready to pay more, fight wars over the availability of coal, petroleum and natural gas, or lower our standard of living.LiNeBrEaKOil rich countries often use the wealth generated by oil to support the persons in power. This leads to dictatorial regimes, e.g., Venezuela, Russia, Iran, etc.LiNeBrEaKWill the holders of fossil fuels begin to tell their dependents what to do? Russia recently cut off shipments of gas to the Western leaning Ukraine. What will be the price of resuming shipments? Free Europe uses a lot of Russian natural gas. What price will they be forced to pay?LiNeBrEaKI say we work to become energy independent of fossil fuels and their foreign suppliers as soon as possible. If this means we don't have to worry about whether or not there is global warming, or whether or not it is bad, so much the better.LiNeBrEaKThanks to Thomas Friedman and his book "Hot, Flat and Crowded" for some of the content of this letter.LiNeBrEaKW. Michael JohnsonLiNeBrEaKSan MarinoLiNeBrEaKLocal initiativeLiNeBrEaKI read with interest Monrovia Councilwoman Mary Ann Lutz's piece about the efforts of the City of Monrovia to deal with the current economic situation at the local level.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama has made it perfectly clear that there is only so much that can be accomplished at the national level, or from the top down.LiNeBrEaKWe need to consider that we here at the local level need to be part of the process, making it one of an effort both from the top down and the bottom up, if we are going to succeed in getting our economic situation back to where it should be.LiNeBrEaKIt is the initiative of the individual Americans that made this country great. The time has now come to show that initiative in support of the efforts of our leaders.LiNeBrEaKTheodore K. MartinLiNeBrEaKLa VerneLiNeBrEaKChanges to BCSLiNeBrEaKAs the author of H.R. 599, the Championship Fairness Act of 2009, I am writing to respond to the column by Frank Girardot mischaracterizing this legislation. I wish to set the record straight about my efforts to restore fairness to all aspects of college athletics.LiNeBrEaKThe Championship Fairness Act is a legislative proposal to correct an injustice. Although the current Bowl Championship Series (BCS) system was created to identify a broadly accepted national champion, its implementation has proven to be a monopoly, favoring larger, more traditional schools. I oppose discrimination and quotas and believe firmly it is in the interest of Congress to restore fairness to all aspects of college athletics. It is not right that my constituents have to pay taxes that are then sent to educational systems that participate in an unfair revenue generating system.LiNeBrEaKInterestingly, my bill doesn't do anything differently than what was accomplished through Title IX, a statute that effectively barred discrimination against women in college sports. There is a long history of Congress placing restrictions on universities should they wish to receive federal funding. By allowing the NCAA to profit from the government and the BCS debacle, Congress is thereby endorsing a system that isn't fair.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans believe not only in free market principles, but also in fairness and equality for all. My bill embodies both of these beliefs and does not stipulate the terms of the playoff or mandate the number of teams to be included-the precise details are to be determined by the member universities. Rather, my bill prevents any Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) school currently receiving federal funds from participating in FBS football unless the NCAA implements a playoff system within three years time.LiNeBrEaKWhen you look at the rosters of NFL teams, you will see that the players come from college teams that were never allowed to play in the championship game, which highlights the injustice in the current system.LiNeBrEaKIn the column's conclusion, a suggestion for achieving fairness is offered - mandating that all games end in a tie. The point is off and actually demonstrates exactly what my bill is trying not to accomplish. Rather, a playoff system is about fairness, equality, and living up to the collegiate standard of competition. We should not be subjectively selecting the national champion; all qualified teams should be able to participate and the issue should be settled on the field. In the United States, there are not to be monopolies, except when it comes to newspapers, clearly.LiNeBrEaKThe article insinuates that members of Congress are not able to multi-task. However, this assumption fails to recognize that I can propose legislative fixes for other things affecting our nation and the Southern California region while focusing on injustices as well. If proper research had been conducted, Mr. Girardot would have seen that I have introduced several pieces of legislation to make Southern California communities more secure and economically viable, such as a bill to greatly increase Southern California's water supply and another to increase the availability of affordable mortgages. Last I checked, these are important issues to Southern Californians during these challenging times. However, judging from the content of the column, it must have been a slow news day.LiNeBrEaKRep.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	TRY TO GO EASIER ON YOUR MOTHER  	CHRIS SMITH COLUMNIST  	LIFE AND ARTS; Pg. B6  	453 words  	MESSING WITH MOTHER Nature won't win you any seals of approval these days. Consider the increasingly hostile takes on the genetic engineering of plants, use of pesticides and global climate change as examples of a "leave Mother alone" sentiment. Would it occur to many of us that something as innocent as keeping a vegetable garden messes with Mother, too, even when we eschew genetically engineered seed, swear off synthetic chemical pesticides, and rely on natural fertilizers and soil amendments? LiNeBrEaKWell, consider what we do. We clear and cultivate the ground. We plant crops that originated on other continents. We get rid of weeds (mostly native plants we don't want in the area). And we make war on the pests (mostly native animals just doing their things). All of these activities are impositions of human will on nature.LiNeBrEaKMore than 12,000 years ago, we were less meddlesome creatures. Our ancestors wandered the world hunting animals and gathering plant food. We took what nature provided rather than trying to outsmart her. In our defense, climate changes likely forced us to settle in places favorable to farming plants and raising food animals. But it's a colossal change from taking what's there to making what's there.LiNeBrEaKNot only have we become gardeners instead of gatherers, we've adopted crops from all over the world. Try to think of a crop that originated in the Northwest that we typically grow in a vegetable garden.LiNeBrEaKMany of our most important garden crops - beans, corn, peppers, potatoes, squash and tomatoes - originated in South and Central America. From there, they spread to North America where native people farmed them as far north as New England. Cabbage family plants, including broccoli, cauliflower and kale, came from Eurasia, as did lettuce. Thank the Mediterranean region and North Africa for beets, carrots and peas. Spinach has been traced to Persia and eggplant and cucumbers to India.LiNeBrEaKShould we feel guilty about gardening instead of gathering, manipulating the environment and adopting plants from far afield? There seems little point. Our gardening tradition is so long established and our world grown so much that returning to some simpler state is unrealistic. That said, I can't support an apology for wholesale human interference in nature.LiNeBrEaKGood arguments remain for making a lighter footprint on the Earth. Genetic engineering of plants still has disquieting drawbacks. Pesticides and synthetic chemical fertilizers have been at best mixed blessings. And too heavy a reliance on hybrid varieties threatens genetic diversity. As conscientious gardeners, we can opt for working more closely with Mother Nature instead of trying to outsmart her.LiNeBrEaKP.O.

Spokesman-Review (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Colleges make case against cuts  	Richard Roesler, The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1110 words  	Jan. 29--OLYMPIA -- Stick your head into any budget hearing in Olympia and it will quickly become clear that the near-universal argument for anyone wanting state dollars is this:LiNeBrEaK"Spend on this worthy program now. It will save you money down the road."LiNeBrEaKAt the moment, some of the bigger voices in this chorus come from the state's colleges. Late last week, the state Higher Education Coordinating Board released a report saying, in essence, that colleges should be spared severe cuts because they're so valuable. Note the title: The Benefits of Investing in Higher Education: A Return on Investment.LiNeBrEaKCollege-educated people earn more money, pay more taxes, commit less crime, volunteer more and vote more, the report says. Parents without a college degree use food stamps and welfare more. It also suggests that colleges serve as incubators for growth and innovation while churning out trained workers. LiNeBrEaKAnd then there's the payroll. The report pointedly notes that Eastern Washington University's salaries, for example, spawn $77 million in Spokane County spending.LiNeBrEaKInstead of cuts, the study suggests, state budget writers would be wise to put more money into colleges now. The federal government, through the G.I. Bill, poured money and students into schools in 1946, at a time when the nation feared a fall into recession.LiNeBrEaKThe thing is, virtually every program on the chopping block will be, or is already, making similar arguments. End small stipends and health care for people on the verge of homelessness, advocates say, and it will be far more costly to get those people back off the streets. Cut health care and more people will be turning up at hospital emergency rooms. Lay off state workers and you're cutting badly needed jobs. And so forth.LiNeBrEaKState budget writers will be weighing these things for months, with a final verdict due by late April. Stay tuned.LiNeBrEaKThe Cascade Curtain becomes the Cap-and-Trade curtainLiNeBrEaKThere was an interesting exchange recently between rural Republican lawmakers and state Department of Ecology head Jay Manning. Manning was describing Washington's participation in the Western Climate Initiative, aimed at helping cut greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKLaunched two years ago by five Western governors, including Washington's Chris Gregoire, the proposal is a cap-and-trade plan designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the West and four Canadian provinces by 15 percent by 2020.LiNeBrEaKUnder a cap-and-trade plan, regulators set limits on the pollution, but then let companies and others trade allowances that would allow some to emit more gases than they otherwise could. Some limits would start in 2012, others in 2015. The effort covers things like power generation, heating, factory emissions and gas and diesel exhaust.LiNeBrEaKRep. Joel Kretz, R-Wauconda, is one of several rural lawmakers who are extremely leery of the proposal. He said he fears that Democrat's push for green jobs will come at the cost of blue-collar workers. He and other rural lawmakers are particularly uneasy about efforts to reduce driving, saying that that means a very different thing in places like Tonasket than it does in Belltown.LiNeBrEaKManning suggested that the risk of global warming to the region's forests -- increased insect damage is widely believed to be due to warmer winters -- will hurt Kretz's constituents more than anyone.LiNeBrEaK"The fire risk we will be facing is very different and very much greater than anything we've faced before, said Manning.LiNeBrEaKHe also said carbon offsets, like planting trees to capture and hold carbon dioxide, could dramatically help rural communities.LiNeBrEaKRep. Ed Orcutt, R-Carrolls, asked what's being done about developing nations and places like China, which has a large number of carbon-belching coal-fired plants. Manning acknowledged that they are a big source of pollution, and said leaders have to keep pressure on those companies to act as well.LiNeBrEaKRep. Shelly Short, R-Addy, said that Washington accounts for only about three-tenths of 1 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions. She's trying to rally voters against the plan. Another local lawmaker, Rep. Joe Schmick, R-Colfax, blasted the effort as environmental fanaticism.LiNeBrEaKRep. Hans Dunshee, D-Snohomish, suggested that Manning give lawmakers details on global-warming problems like bark beetle damage, plus a list of businesses who get with and support the proposal.LiNeBrEaK"I think you might calm the angst," Dunshee said.LiNeBrEaKFrom the notebookLiNeBrEaK"At this very moment, we're not losing anybody, because where would you go?"LiNeBrEaK&acirc;[#x20ac]" Attorney General Rob McKenna, telling a state salary commission that he'd like to pay his lawyers more, but that the recession has curtailed turnover for now.LiNeBrEaK"I've never been flipped off more times in my life."LiNeBrEaK&acirc;[#x20ac]" New state Rep. Kevin Parker, R-Spokane, recalling what it was like to stand at an intersection waving signs during the campaign.LiNeBrEaKMcCaslin: Give justice system more time to catch scammersLiNeBrEaKSen. Bob McCaslin's Senate Bill 5380 would keep the clock ticking longer for prosecution of thieves preying on the elderly.LiNeBrEaKAs things stand now, the statute of limitations expires six years after the crime is committed. In cases where the thief tries to conceal the crime, McCaslin, R-Spokane Valley, wants to keep the clock ticking to the time that the theft is discovered.LiNeBrEaK"People might not even know they've been swindled for years," he said.LiNeBrEaKBrandland: Add teachers to the state health planLiNeBrEaKSaying it would probably save money for schools, teachers and state government, Sen. Dale Brandland, R-Bellingham, wants to put school employees onto the state health plans.LiNeBrEaKSchools would pay the same rate that state agencies do to cover their employees.LiNeBrEaKAs things stand now, Brandland says, schools spend a large chunk of their local property-tax levy dollars to buy health coverage. And he says the state plans are generally more affordable than what school districts offer. State-worker coverage in Spokane County, for example, ranges from $25 to $112 per month for the worker and $79 to $318 for a family.LiNeBrEaKAs for the state, Brandland says, it would get a larger pool of employees, giving it more bargaining leverage with insurers and hopefully boosting economies of scale.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Clean break OUR VIEW | ENVIRONMENT  		EDITORIAL; Pg. D6  	614 words  	President Barack Obama is moving swiftly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. He cleared the way this week for California to set strict new carbon-dioxide standards for cars and trucks. A dozen other states are poised to adopt the standards once they are approved.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, Mr. Obama told federal regulators to push ahead with higher fuel-economy requirements. Congress approved new mileage standards in a 2007 energy bill. It mandates average fuel-economy rates of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, but rules to achieve it never were finalized. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama undoubtedly expected some opposition from Republicans. With Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, however, he would seem assured of accomplishing his larger goal of combating global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut that's not the way things are working out. Midwestern Democrats - including Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, an early and influential Obama supporter - are starting to push back. They fear overly aggressive action on climate change could cost badly needed manufacturing jobs when state economies are reeling. On Monday, Ms. McCaskill urged the president "not to do anything that will harm the auto industry."LiNeBrEaKAuto executives oppose both California's bid to set strict carbon-dioxide standards and federal efforts to increase fuel economy. With new-car sales plunging, automakers and industry groups say they say they cannot meet the proposed standards. Imposing them could seriously harm struggling U.S. manufacturers, they say.LiNeBrEaKThat's not a threat to be taken lightly, especially now, as the cascade of bleak economic news continues. Boeing announced 5,500 more job cuts on Wednesday, and another 75,000 job cuts in several industries were announced Monday. That brings the number of jobs lost since the recession began in December 2007 to more than 2. 6 million.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers' claims probably are at least somewhat overstated. Japanese car companies make cars in a single plant for domestic, European and American markets with different emissions and safety standards. U.S. diesel engine manufacturers build power plants for on- and off-road equipment - each with its own emissions standards - in the same plants.LiNeBrEaKBut the debate about auto-emissions rules foreshadows a larger struggle. Mr. Obama and Democratic legislative leaders are promising a bill to cap greenhouse gas emissions by year's end.LiNeBrEaKThat probably will impose difficult challenges on Midwestern states, where heavy manufacturing still is a big part of the job base and where coal-fired power plants supply most of the electricity. Missouri gets more than 80 percent of its power from burning coal, which is a major source of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama favors a cap-and-trade system for reducing emissions. Such a plan would freeze the amount of permitted greenhouse gas discharges and establish a market for emissions credits. Companies that cut emissions would sell "credits" to companies whose emissions increased.LiNeBrEaKIn the short term, we hope the economic impact of new emission requirements on Missouri, Illinois and other Midwestern states can be mitigated. But long term, the nation cannot afford continued foot-dragging on climate change.LiNeBrEaKA study published this week shows that even if emissions were cut drastically, problems caused by global warming will continue - imposing a whole different set of costs and problems, from rising sea levels to Dust Bowl-like droughts.LiNeBrEaKThe trick is to balance the short-term costs of reducing emissions with the potentially disastrous long-term costs of global warming. And to understand that the less carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere now, the less our children must worry about it in decades to come.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	California dreamin' its car standards will help  	PAUL MULSHINE, STAR-LEDGER STAFF  	NEWS; Pg. 013  	805 words  	Uh-oh, he seems to be taking it seriously.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming, I mean. The other day President Obama moved to make it possible for California and 13 other states to implement the so-called "California Car Standard." If the Environmental Protection Agency follows through as expected and permits the standard, then cars in these states will be limited in the amount of carbon dioxide they emit.LiNeBrEaKThat sounds nice. However, many of the people who support the standard seem to have no idea just what carbon dioxide is or what it does. LiNeBrEaKThat's certainly the case here in New Jersey, which adopted the California car standard back in 2004. Legislators of both parties voted for the bill enthusiastically and then went down to the Statehouse garage to drive home in a collection of SUVs and other big cars.LiNeBrEaKNone seemed aware that the California standard would have the effect of banning not just SUVs, but even such midsize cars as the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Under the California standard, all vehicles sold in the state would have to average 34. 5 miles per gallon by 2015. Even the tiny Smart Car that I road-tested last year barely meets that mark.LiNeBrEaKMany lawmakers are under the impression that is a traditional pollutant that can be reduced in traditional ways. This is not the case. The traditional smog-making pollutants can be cut by making an engine run cleaner. But the cleaner an engine runs, the more efficiently it turns fuel into . Carbon dioxide is the natural end point of burning fuel. And not just gasoline. The food our bodies burn also gives off .LiNeBrEaKThe politicians don't get this, or at least not those who support the California standard. Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, for example, put out a press release the other day lauding Obama's move. "This action shows President Obama is serious about protecting our environment and assuring our children breathe clean air," the Democrat from Princeton stated.LiNeBrEaKNo, it doesn't. Those little kiddies are themselves producing every time they exhale. And that has the exact same effect on the environment as the coming from a tailpipe.LiNeBrEaKJust what that effect is remains a subject of debate, one we need not enter into here. Suffice it to say that carbon dioxide created in New Jersey has the exact same effect on global warming as carbon dioxide emitted in France, China, India or even Delaware.LiNeBrEaKI mention Delaware because that's where a lot of New Jerseyans will be going to buy their cars if our state gets the green light to enforce the California standard for greenhouse gas emissions. Within a few years, the only cars you will be able to buy here are hybrids or minicars. Meanwhile, car dealers in Delaware will still be selling fullsize sedans. The same might be true in Pennsylvania, where lawmakers have been wavering on the new standard. So what's to stop you from crossing the river?LiNeBrEaKNothing at the moment. That 2004 law called for the creation of a 15-member Low Emission Vehicle Review Commission that was supposed to study how to implement the new standard. But after signing the law, Gov. Jim McGreevey never bothered to name the commission members. He did put out a nice press release, though. It promised that "when it goes into effect in January 2009, the new emissions standards will require carmakers to produce approximately 40,000 gas electric hybrid cars and 128,000 super clean gasoline cars."LiNeBrEaKInterestingly enough, that part of the law actually did take effect. No one seems to have noticed, but as of Jan. 1, New Jersey must by law implement the current California standards for emissions of traditional smog-producing pollutants. Those regulations are incredibly complex, but once implemented they will put our car dealers at a big disadvantage compared to those on the other side of the Delaware.LiNeBrEaKAnd here's the really crucial point, one that the layman might miss: Those car dealers buy a lot of ads in this newspaper. And that helps pay my salary. So I'm sure you will agree that New Jersey should revoke that law calling for adherence to any California car standard whatsoever.LiNeBrEaKWell, maybe not. But if that argument doesn't convince you, I invite you to read up on all the intricacies of the competing state and federal standards for fuel economy. I've been doing it for the past couple of days and my head feels like the feds used me for a crash-test dummy in a car without airbags. Suffice it to say that the idea of enforcing a greenhouse-gas standard on a state-by-state basis is entirely unworkable.LiNeBrEaKIf Obama truly believes the California standard is a good idea, though, he should simply make it the national standard. And then he'd just have to do one more thing: Give up all hope of getting re-elected.LiNeBrEaKPaul Mulshine may be reached at pmulshine@starledger.com To comment on his column go to NJVoices.com.LiNeBrEaKNotes: Paul Mulshine appears regularly in The Star-Ledger.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Gore urges senators: Act to save the planet  		NEWS; Pg. 002  	343 words  	Former vice president Al Gore urged lawmakers yesterday to adopt a binding carbon cap and push for a new international climate pact by the end of this year in order to avert catastrophic global warming. LiNeBrEaKAppearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gore delivered a short slide show that amounted to an update of his Oscar-winning documentary ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' lecturing some of his former colleagues that even if the world halted greenhouse gas emissions now, it could experience a temperature rise of between 2. 5 and 7. 5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.LiNeBrEaK''This would bring a screeching halt to human civilization and threaten life everywhere on Earth, and this is by the end of this century,'' Gore said.LiNeBrEaKThe high-tech display included a graphic illustration of how the Arctic's permanent summer ice cover has melted in recent decades, a pulsating image that the Nobel Peace Prize winner described as ''30 years in less than 30 seconds,'' and a short video clip of a scientist who ignited the methane gas seeping out of the melting Arctic permafrost. After the audience watched the flames leap up and the researcher scurry away, Gore remarked, ''She's okay. The question is, are we?''LiNeBrEaKGore received a largely sympathetic hearing from the panel. ''Frankly, the science is screaming at us,'' said the committee's chairman, John Kerry (D-Mass.), who added that the United States would not make the mistake of leaving emerging economies out of any future climate agreement.LiNeBrEaK''A global problem demands a global effort, and today we are working toward a solution with a role for developed and developing countries alike, which will be vital as we work to build consensus here at home in tough economic times,'' Kerry said.LiNeBrEaKGore didn't sugarcoat his message to senators yesterday. Although politicians including President Obama have touted the importance of exploring ''clean coal technology,'' the former vice president said it would not be available for years: ''We must avoid becoming vulnerable to the illusion that this is near at hand. It is not.''

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Martha Brand: Less pollution, more jobs  	By Martha Brand  	OPINION; Columnists  	712 words  	Coming at us is the new, green, recession-fighting machine. LiNeBrEaKBarack Obama has promised repeatedly that much of his stimulus package will go to developing a green economy, one that puts people to work and stitches together an infrastructure that rewards energy-efficiency, renewable energy and cutting global warming pollution.LiNeBrEaKWe, of course, say none too soon. LiNeBrEaKIt is important to recognize that Minnesota has begun that work, providing the state with a head start on just such an economy. No ranking system exists, but Minnesota has one of the most ambitious renewable energy standards and probably makes the top 10 with our global warming reduction programs.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, the Legislature passed, and Gov. Tim Pawlenty signed, major bills that called for producing 25 percent of our electricity with renewable energy by 2025; that required gas and electric utilities to cut their sales 1. 5 percent per year through energy efficiency and committed Minnesota to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. Pawlenty also prodded the Midwest Governors Association to establish a regional cap and trade program by 2010.LiNeBrEaKThese are all ambitious goals, and implementation is where the rubber meets the road. But Minnesota has a long record of setting the pace.LiNeBrEaKWhen nearly everyone else was making fun of wind power in the early 1990s, the Legislature was ordering Northern States Power Co., now Xcel, to install or buy wind power from turbines in southwestern Minnesota. Today, Minnesota produces more than 1,300 megawatts of wind electricity, ranking us third in the nation. That's 4. 6 percent of Minnesota's energy needs being met through wind power.LiNeBrEaKFarmers reap new revenue by renting land for the turbines and counties receive additional property taxes. A Suzlon Rotor Corp. factory opened in Pipestone two years ago and now employs 500 workers to make the blades. Finland's Moventas announced it will open a factory in Faribault this year to manufacture wind turbine gears.LiNeBrEaKWe haven't moved as quickly on the energy-efficiency front. The cheapest kilowatt is the one we don't use. We should be investing in things such as insulating homes and businesses and changing inefficient furnaces, appliances and leaky windows so it takes less energy to heat, cool and operate buildings.LiNeBrEaKThousands of workers will be needed to make those improvements, which should translate into well-paying jobs for many. In fact, a 24-member Green Jobs Task Force is set to report to the Legislature about just those possibilities. Utility companies may find it more economical to invest in such energy efficiency efforts themselves rather than build new plants. However, state policymakers still must figure out ways for the utilities to make money while selling less energy.LiNeBrEaKObama is likely to seek legislation for a national cap and trade program that will limit how much global-warming pollution industries can put in the air and, over time, lower that limit dramatically.LiNeBrEaKBig questions need to be sorted out by Obama's brain trust and the policymakers in Minnesota. The major one is that cap and trade will make many of our current forms of energy, and some products, more expensive. That sends the right market signals, but there must be some relief to consumers through rebates or tax relief, so household incomes are not devastated by the changes.LiNeBrEaKStill, the emphasis must be on phasing out old, polluting ways of making products and transporting people and moving to new, efficient and clean methods. That will be a great step forward.LiNeBrEaKTo continue to be a leader in cutting global warming emissions, the Legislature needs to pass a clean cars bill this session. Through this bill, Minnesota would join 14 other states in requiring the auto manufacturers to sell new cars here that meet tough global warming pollution standards. That efficiency also would provide better fuel mileage, saving consumers money. The Legislature and the governor also must address all of the measures needed to meet our ambitious global warming reduction goals. Passing only a few good bills will not solve the problem.LiNeBrEaKIt's time to bring on the green, and bring on the jobs.LiNeBrEaKMartha Brand is executive director of the St. Paul-based Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.

The Times-Tribune (Scranton, Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	PA would have leading role in clean coal technology  	Robert Swift, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	538 words  	Jan. 29--Government would have leading roleLiNeBrEaKHARRISBURG -- State government would assume a leading role in developing clean coal technology under legislation unveiled Wednesday with support from the Rendell administration. LiNeBrEaKThe measure authorizes the building of a state-run facility to store carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electric plants, considered a key step to expanding reliance on the state's coal reserves to meet energy needs. It would require Pennsylvania utilities to produce three percent of their electricity by 2014 from sources that trap and store carbon.LiNeBrEaKThis emerging technology is known as "carbon sequestration," the capturing of environmentally harmful carbon dioxide emissions and injecting them underground into salt aquifers or geologic formations that once held oil or natural gas deposits. The aim of carbon sequestration is to prevent carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal from escaping into the air and contributing to greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.LiNeBrEaKCompanion bills by Rep. Greg Vitali, D-166, and Sen. Ted Erickson, R-26, authorize the state to "develop, own and operate" a sequestration network. The state would charge companies storage fees to cover the plant's costs. A bill provision declares the plant operator immune from liability for any harmful effects of carbon stored there. Harrisburg speculation puts southwestern Pennsylvania in the early running to host a plant location.LiNeBrEaKIn the northeast region, Reps. Mike Carroll, D-118; Phyllis Mundy, D-120; Robert Belfanti, D-107; John Siptroth, D-189, and Neal Goodman, D-123, are cosponsors.LiNeBrEaKIf enacted, this legislation would mark the first state venture of its kind since an abortive effort during the 1980s and 1990s to build a storage facility in Pennsylvania for low-level radioactive waste.LiNeBrEaKPennsylvania has many places where carbon can be safely stored, and the environmental risk is manageable, said John Hanger, acting secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection at a press conference.LiNeBrEaK"If we don't develop this technology, we are going to pour huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for the next 20 years," he added.LiNeBrEaKMr. Vitali said the legislation will help create jobs and make it possible for the state's coal industry to comply with anticipated new federal environmental mandates.LiNeBrEaKA coalition of state environmental groups opposes the bill in its current form. They cite the absence of a carbon sequestration method ready for the market, lack of a siting process for the facility and the state assuming liability for the stored carbon as problems.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are worried about stored carbon dioxide seeping into the atmosphere and causing pollution, said Jeff Schmidt, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKContact the writer: rswift@timesshamrock.com	CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (93%); EMISSIONS (91%); COAL INDUSTRY (91%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); LEGISLATION (89%); POWER PLANTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); WAREHOUSING and STORAGE (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); IMMUNITY (73%); JOB CREATION (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (71%); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (69%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (69%); CRUDE OIL and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (69%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (66%); NUCLEAR WASTE (63%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (58%); PRESS CONFERENCES (50%)  		Crime/law  	HARRISBURG, PA, USA (93%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 29, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090129-YT-PA-would-have-leading-role-in-clean-coal-technology-0129  	Newspaper  	YT  	2009    																
Times-Standard (Eureka, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Citizen action group focuses on environment  	Jessie Faulkner, Times-Standard, Eureka, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	458 words  	Jan. 29--TRINIDAD -- Education, interaction and action are key to creating a more environmentally responsible community.LiNeBrEaKThat's the focus of Greener Trinidad, a newly formed citizen action group that is hosting its kick-off meeting Wednesday at 7 p.m. in Trinidad Town Hall. National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration scientist Mike Ives will speak on "Climate Change: Global and Local Impact." LiNeBrEaKRefreshments will be served and all are invited.LiNeBrEaKFormer Trinidad Mayor Chi-Wei Lin and his wife, Donna, are among the founders of the group that states its goal as building a sustainable and environmentally responsible Trinidad community.LiNeBrEaKLin said it's been something he's been thinking about for quite some time, so he called up a few people to get the effort going. One of the motivations was global warming and climate change, Lin said.LiNeBrEaKThe group, formed about a month ago, has roughly 20 members who plan to hold monthly meetings that will feature speakers on a variety of environmentally related issues, Lin said.LiNeBrEaKThe impact of global warming has already taken hold with such developments as an increase in the presence of Humboldt squid, a fast-growing very large squid that is usually found in warmer southern waters. The beast has been detected as far north as Oregon, Lin said, and is known to be a vicarious predator.LiNeBrEaKAs to Greener Trinidad, one of the first objectives is to educate the public, Lin said.LiNeBrEaKSome of that education will come as delineations of the potential consequences of global warming to the local community, such as increased storms, high wind, flooding and rising sea levels. Those could, Lin said, result in long-lasting power outages.LiNeBrEaK"It's coming and it's not very far away," he said.LiNeBrEaKLin, who was recently appointed to the Trinidad Planning Commission, said the city's ongoing general plan update offers an opportunity for the city to incorporate green building codes designed to reduce its carbon footprint -- something that needs the public's support.LiNeBrEaKGreener Trinidad also provides a venue to pool energy on specific projects, such as setting up rainwater collection systems or community gardens. Lin said he's hopeful residents will come forward with such project ideas and form committees or project groups to bring those to town.

The Times West Virginian (Fairmont, Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Jay focuses on coal technology: As discussions on economic stimulus continue  	Jessica Legge, The Times West Virginian, Fairmont  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	639 words  	Jan. 29--FAIRMONT -- As discussions continue on President Barack Obama's economic stimulus plan, Sen. Jay Rockefeller is keeping his focus on advanced coal technologies.LiNeBrEaKJessica Tice, state press secretary for Rockefeller's office, said the senator knows the important role that carbon capture and sequestration play in addressing climate change.LiNeBrEaKRockefeller, who has been working with his fellow senators and the president's economic team, believes that the country needs to invest in ways to make coal cleaner-burning and more efficient because this resource is part of the answer to the economic crisis. LiNeBrEaK"Certainly being closer to energy independence is one of the most important ways to revitalize our nation's economy," Tice said. "West Virginia's coal and West Virginia's economy really only stand to benefit from these investments."LiNeBrEaKFunding for advanced coal technologies will help sustain the state's coal and coal jobs as a major portion of the energy sector, she said.LiNeBrEaK"It comes down to securing energy independence and creating much-needed jobs in West Virginia and across the country," Tice said.LiNeBrEaKIn the Senate Appropriations Committee stimulus package, Rockefeller was successful in pushing for $4. 6 billion for low-carbon coal and carbon sequestration projects. Tice said Rockefeller will continue fighting to make sure coal is a huge part of anything the Senate passes.LiNeBrEaKThe House of Representatives' current version of the legislation calls for $2. 6 billion in funding for coal projects.LiNeBrEaKMany parties want to include appropriations for clean-coal projects in the stimulus plan, said Richard Bajura, director of West Virginia University's National Research Center for Coal and Energy.LiNeBrEaK"There's a lot of interest in moving forward with doing things that incentivize this distribution of clean-coal technologies," he said.LiNeBrEaKBajura said the nation is going to rely on coal-based technologies for the bulk of its electricity. If the United States has to take measures to address concerns about global technology changes, it needs to be able to develop coal technologies and also remain attentive to the environment.LiNeBrEaK"In terms of the benefits, it is direct impact on West Virginia," he said. "We have a great resource in coal."LiNeBrEaKBy continuing to use coal and address environmental concerns, West Virginia will stimulate its economy through job creation, Bajura said.LiNeBrEaKJeff Herholdt, director of the West Virginia Division of Energy, said electric energy will continue to come from coal for some time.LiNeBrEaK"It's really important that coal accommodates people's environmental concerns, and that's why clean coal money -- as Sen. Rockefeller is going after -- is important," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe funding currently being discussed for the economic stimulus plan is related to decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. Significant investments are already going on in West Virginia, such as technologies that help reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions, Herholdt said.LiNeBrEaK"We've been on a path for cleaner coal for some time," he said.LiNeBrEaKHerholdt said the country wants to have stable coal markets. In order to ensure stable and cost-competitive fuel supplies, the United States needs to employ clean-coal technologies.LiNeBrEaK"Coal has a lot of detractors, but those same people don't realize how important coal is to our long-term energy picture as well," he said. "We need reliable, cost-effective energy supplies."LiNeBrEaKE-mail Jessica Legge at jlegge@timeswv.com	COAL INDUSTRY (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (90%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); APPROPRIATIONS (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); JOB CREATION (78%); COAL MINING (77%); EMISSIONS (77%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (74%); ENERGY RESEARCH (72%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (72%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (72%); LEGISLATION (71%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (63%); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (60%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (78%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  		Crime/law  	WEST VIRGINIA, USA (98%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	January 29, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090129-TF-Jay-focuses-on-coal-technology-0129  	Newspaper  	TF  	2009    		JAY ROCKEFELLER (95%); BARACK OBAMA (91%)

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	385 words  	Jan. 29--OLYMPIA Gov. Chris Gregoire announced today a package of legislation intended to create "green" jobs and reduce greenhouse gas pollution to 1990 levels by 2020. LiNeBrEaKGreen jobs are those in fields focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy, preventing and reducing pollution, and cleaning up pollution.LiNeBrEaKAt a news conference at South Puget Sound Community College in Olympia, Gregoire said her goal is to create 25,000 green jobs by 2020.LiNeBrEaKShe touted the more than 47,000 existing private sector green jobs as evidence that the green economy is the wave of the future.LiNeBrEaK"Washington is well-positioned to capitalize on the unique economic opportunities surrounding the growing green sector," Gregoire said. "These proposals will help protect our environment as well as create and support jobs, stimulate the regional economy and strengthen Washington's competitiveness in the global economy."LiNeBrEaKGregoire's package was introduced into the Senate on Wednesday. Components include:LiNeBrEaK-- Investing $455 million in the next biennium for energy-reducing transportation projects, energy efficiency projects, green buildings and clean-energy technology to support an estimated 2,900 jobs in 2010 and 2011;LiNeBrEaK-- Legislation to implement the Western Climate Initiative's cap and trade system, intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions;LiNeBrEaK-- Legislation providing tax exemptions for the new generation of plug-in electric vehicles;LiNeBrEaK-- A partnership with the state's clean technology industries to identify actions to keep Washington state on the cutting edge of new technologies;LiNeBrEaK-- Asking the State Building Council to improve building energy efficiency by 30 percent beyond 2006 standards.LiNeBrEaKFor the full story, read Friday's Herald and tricityherald.com.LiNeBrEaKStay updated with the latest news from the Tri-City Herald with an RSS feed: http://www.tri-cityherald.com/1309/story/97842.htmlLiNeBrEaKFill out my Wufoo form!

The Washington Times 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Nuclear power is true 'green' energy  	By Stuart Butler, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?; A04  	758 words  	Never mind lower gasoline prices. Worries about energy security and the environment continue to boost pressure for alternative energy sources. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's temporary halting of natural gas to Europe this winter in a payment dispute underscored once again how vulnerable the West is to energy blackmail. And even though the link between climate change and fossil fuel use is still debated, Americans want "greener" energy.LiNeBrEaKThe energy sources favored by carbon-footprint-sensitive celebrities, such as wind power and ethanol, have gained the most attention so far - and the most subsidies. But if we're serious about security and the environment, we should be embracing something else: Nuclear energy. LiNeBrEaKAnyone old enough to remember the 1979 movie "China Syndrome," about the deadly cover-up of a nuclear accident, knows Jane Fonda and other liberals would have a fit at the idea of more nuclear energy. But that is the way to go.LiNeBrEaKHere's why.LiNeBrEaKFor starters, nuclear power is the least expensive form of power available. But excessive legal and permitting delays are pushing up the capital cost of new nuclear-power plants and thwarting most new projects. Only one nuclear plant is currently being built in the United States - and that began in 1973. Meanwhile, 44 are under construction in other countries. France now generates 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear. We produce just 20 percent.LiNeBrEaKFrom an environmental perspective, nuclear energy can't be beaten. No belching smokestacks or polluting gases. It releases nothing into the atmosphere - no carbon dioxide, no sulfur, no mercury.LiNeBrEaKIt also takes up hardly any land. One double-reactor plant takes up a few hundred acres and can power 2 million homes. The same production from wind or solar can take tens of thousands of acres, often blighting scenic views.LiNeBrEaKWhat about waste?LiNeBrEaKWith modern techniques, spent nuclear fuel is safely removed and reprocessed to yield new reactor fuel, drastically reducing the amount of waste needing disposal. In fact, if you used nuclear power for your entire lifetime needs, the resulting waste would only be enough fill a Coke can. And this can be safely deposited in deep repositories. Compare that with the tons of plastic, batteries, tires and motor oil we'll throw out to be buried in landfills.LiNeBrEaKOutdated fears about safety drive public concern about nuclear power in the United States. And those fears are misplaced.LiNeBrEaKThe safety level in nuclear-energy production now easily surpasses other energy sources. For example, nobody in America has ever died owing to a commercial nuclear-power accident. But from Jan. 1, 2003 through Dec. 31, 2007, 526 workers were killed in oil and gas extraction and 162 in coal mining. And in the coal industry, thousands of former workers are disabled with black lung and other respiratory diseases.LiNeBrEaKThe fatalities and disabilities associated with coal and oil are real. The dangers of nuclear energy, meanwhile, are largely made up in Hollywood.LiNeBrEaKYet those perceived dangers are responsible for the endless legal challenges, heavy regulation and campaigns to slow down or block every effort to expand nuclear power. The resultant costs and uncertainty have discouraged investment in this safe, clean and efficient energy source.LiNeBrEaKTo overcome these obstacles to doing that, Congress and the Obama administration need to take action.LiNeBrEaKFirst, Washington should create a level playing field for energy ideas. That means no longer artificially favoring one new energy source over another and instead creating a strong, market-oriented approach to energy so that the best sources can expand. It's time to say no to lobbyist-driven subsidies and phase out existing ones.LiNeBrEaKSecond, Congress and the administration must commit to respecting the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's authority to review the permit application to construct the Yucca Mountain nuclear-waste repository in Nevada.LiNeBrEaKThird, we need to cut the red tape now slowing plant construction. The arduous, four-year nuclear-plant permitting process should be replaced with a new two-year fast-track process for experienced applicants who meet reasonable siting and investment requirements.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama agrees that nuclear power is a good idea, one that needs to be back on the table. That's welcome, but it won't just happen. He needs to tell his friends in Hollywood that he is serious about change, and push Congress to give the green light to nuclear power.LiNeBrEaK* Stuart Butler is vice president for domestic-policy issues for the Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).

The Washington Times 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 		By Greg Pierce, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; INSIDE POLITICS; A08  	1077 words  	Hidden taxLiNeBrEaK"First, do no harm. If physicians can abide by that precept, why shouldn't the president - especially in a turbulent time like now?" Rocky Mountain News columnist Vincent Carroll writes.LiNeBrEaK"If a policy is likely to damage economic growth, then don't do it, or at least not until we've emerged from the scariest downturn in the history of anyone under the age of 80," Mr. Carroll said.LiNeBrEaK"Alas, no such luck. The Obama administration is reportedly plowing ahead with plans to limit carbon emissions through a 'cap-and-trade' system that would involve the selling and trading of emissions permits. LiNeBrEaK"Such a system works to reduce carbon emissions only if it drives up the price of energy. And as Tribune Washington reporter Jim Tankersley (always a straight-shooter when he worked at the Rocky) put it in a story this week, 'Cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth ... 'LiNeBrEaK"Just what we need: another ball and chain on the economy. But of course administration officials and their Suzy Sunshine allies in the environmental movement argue that the program will stimulate growth by promoting clean-energy industries, as if the vitality of that small market segment were the alpha and omega of our economic health."LiNeBrEaKCar crashLiNeBrEaK"Why kick the auto industry when it's down?" Wall Street Journal columnist Holman W. Jenkins Jr. asks.LiNeBrEaK"Because it's down," he wrote, answering his own question.LiNeBrEaK"President Obama rolled out his first big gesture on energy and the environment this week. It consisted of a cunning, even brutal judgment - we're tempted to liken it to the besieged submarine commander in the movies who fills his torpedo tubes with his dead comrades and jettisons them overboard to fool the enemy destroyer circling overhead.LiNeBrEaK"In this case, the circling destroyer is Mr. Obama's green constituency, hungry for a gesture on climate change and energy independence. The dead crewmen are the Detroit automakers. They've already been blown to pieces by last year's runup in gas prices and then the credit meltdown. They'll hardly notice an additional blow in Mr. Obama's EPA likely granting a California request to regulate vehicular emissions of carbon dioxide, which means effectively stepped-up fuel-mileage mandates stiffer than the federal government's.LiNeBrEaK"Never mind the absurdity of the issue. California has received waivers to set its own Clean Air Act rules since the very beginning because California suffered unique air pollution problems. California does not suffer unique global warming problems. In no way is the state uniquely affected by the climate risks posed by tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide. California politicians were acting purely in a grandstanding capacity to seek such a waiver. Mr. Obama would be acting from purely a least-cost political calculation in granting it."LiNeBrEaKPaterson's giftLiNeBrEaK"One of the most hotly debated questions surrounding the elections held from 2005 to 2008 is whether they represented a rejection of conservatism, of Republicans, or merely of President George W. Bush," Sean Trende writes at www.realclearpolitics.com.LiNeBrEaK"Republicans and conservatives hoped and argued that the latter factor was the predominant one in the back-to-back GOP routs, and that Republicans would bounce back relatively quickly after President Bush exited the national stage," Mr. Trende said.LiNeBrEaK"This view gained some currency in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 elections. Republican Saxby Chambliss won a special election in Georgia by a hefty margin that looked much more like a 'normal' Republican victory margin in Georgia than did his three-point lead on Election Day. In a subsequent special election, Republicans held a seat in Northwest Louisiana that was similar to other Southern seats in which they had recently been losing. They also defeated scandal-tarred Rep. William Jefferson in his heavily Democratic district.LiNeBrEaK"While it is dangerous to read too much into special election results of any kind, these 'normal' looking results gave some hope to Republicans that their long nightmare was over, and that dissatisfaction with Republicans was dissipating.LiNeBrEaK"Now, David Paterson has given Republicans a golden opportunity to lend further credence to this interpretation. By appointing sophomore Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand to the Senate seat vacated by now-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Gov. Paterson has given three gifts to the New York GOP: He has opened up a district that is likely to flip back to them, he has made a much more competitive race for the Senate seat than there otherwise would have been, and he has appointed the most conservative Democrat to the seat."LiNeBrEaKSilly coverageLiNeBrEaK"The conflict-addicted Washington press corps must have missed the part of President Barack Obama's inaugural speech admonishing the country to put away childish things. Or so it would seem from the silly coverage of the friendly, bipartisan White House meeting on the stimulus bill last Friday. Even worse, they missed the real story: the power jockeying going on within the Democratic family," Dan Gerstein writes at www.forbes.com.LiNeBrEaK"For those who missed Friday's doings, here's a quick recap. First came a mindless mini-frenzy over Obama's playful reminder during the meeting that he won the election. Then came the breathless declarations by reporters and anchors that the new comity and bipartisanship Obama had promised were almost dead and buried just four days into his administration - simply because some Republicans expressed some disagreement with some portions of the House legislation.LiNeBrEaK"That's right. No one called the president a liar. Or accused him of promoting socialism. Or threatened to drown the bill in the bathtub. Republicans just went back to talking like fiscal conservatives and arguing against social spending they believe won't stimulate the economy or help the middle class. Which is to say, they criticized the policies, not the person advocating them. That sure sounds like change to me," Mr. Gerstein said.LiNeBrEaK"The great irony in all of this is that while the press corps was over-blowing the relatively tame partisan differences on the bill, they were overlooking the far more interesting and consequential fight that is brewing within the president's own ranks over the pork-like provisions the Republicans are protesting."

The Washington Times 		January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Gore tells Congress to OK emissions bill;  Says 'moment of decision' now 	By Tom LoBianco, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A10  	580 words  	Congress must pass funding for a new unified national electricity grid and set a price on carbon emissions, former Vice President Al Gore told lawmakers Wednesday morning, adding that the Earth is in "grave danger" unless the U.S. breaks its dependence on oil.LiNeBrEaK"We have arrived at a moment of decision," Mr. Gore said. "Our home, Earth, is in danger. What is at risk of being destroyed is not the planet itself, of course, but the conditions that have made it hospitable for human beings." LiNeBrEaKDespite the icy weather when he testified Wednesday, Mr. Gore's concerns have received a considerably warmer reception in Washington since his fellow Democrats took control of both Congress and the White House.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic and Republican lawmakers have said they expect a bill curbing carbon emissions to pass this year, and President Obama's economic stimulus plan calls for doubling the amount of renewable energy produced.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers Wednesday looked forward to the upcoming U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen, where many environmentalists and government representatives are hoping to establish more worldwide limits on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change will be increasingly central to our foreign policy and national security, and it will be a focal point of this committee's efforts as well," said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat.LiNeBrEaKMr. Kerry got a few laughs from the packed room by saying he and Mr. Gore had more in common than losing presidential elections to George W. Bush: They served together on the Foreign Relations Committee in 1988.LiNeBrEaKIn prepared remarks, Mr. Gore urged quick passage of Mr. Obama's stimulus package. He also pushed senators to support a carbon tax, while acknowledging that a cap-and-trade measure is most likely to pass Congress.LiNeBrEaKSen. Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican, suggested the U.S. learn from Europe's troubles with allowing free emissions waivers that were "distorting the markets."LiNeBrEaK"We're now firing real bullets here," Mr. Corker said, in reference to pending "cap-and-trade" legislation, which would set emission limits for businesses and then make the right to emit that carbon dioxide a tradable commodity.LiNeBrEaKSince losing the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Gore has spoken extensively about global climate change and won the Nobel Peace Prize. As he has often done, Mr. Gore turned to a slideshow to make his point that global warming is increasingly damaging the Earth. Before testifying, he asked supporters in an e-mail and online video to lobby their congressmen and senators for passage of strict environmental legislation.LiNeBrEaK"You and I know that continuing with the status quo will not revitalize the U.S. economy. Please make sure your elected officials know, too," he wrote in the e-mail sent Wednesday morning.LiNeBrEaKWhile a strong consensus in Washington has developed that global warming poses a serious threat around the globe, skeptics have opposed new limits on carbon emissions, saying global warming has been hyped. During the hearing, Republican staffers distributed highlights from a 2007 report disputing the existence of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe icy weather that greeted Mr. Gore on Wednesday brought memories and a handful of laughs from some who remembered a big snowstorm that hit Washington days before Mr. Gore testified about global warming in 2007.LiNeBrEaK"And to the naysayers and deniers still out there, let me add: A little snow in Washington does nothing to diminish the reality of this crisis," Mr. Kerry said.

The Washington Post 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	Gore Urges Cap on Carbon Emissions, Global Climate Pact;  He Tells Senators the Situation Is Dire 	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A03  	539 words  	Former vice president Al Gore urged lawmakers yesterday to adopt a binding carbon cap and push for a new international climate pact by the end of this year in order to avert catastrophic global warming. LiNeBrEaKAppearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Gore delivered a short slide show that amounted to an update of his Oscar-winning documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," lecturing some of his former colleagues that even if the world halted greenhouse gas emissions now, the world could experience a temperature rise of 2. 5 to 7. 5 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.LiNeBrEaK"This would bring a screeching halt to human civilization and threaten the fabric of life everywhere on the Earth, and this is within this century," Gore said.LiNeBrEaKThe high-tech display included a graphic illustration of how the Arctic's permanent summer ice cover has melted in recent decades, a pulsating image the Nobel Peace Prize winner described as "30 years in less than 30 seconds," and a short video clip of a scientist who ignited the methane gas seeping out of the melting Arctic permafrost.LiNeBrEaKAfter the audience watched the flames leap up and the researcher scurry away, Gore remarked: "She's okay. The question is, are we?"LiNeBrEaKGore received a largely sympathetic hearing from the panel.LiNeBrEaK"Frankly, the science is screaming at us," said the committee's chairman, John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who added that the United States would not make the mistake of leaving emerging economies out of any future climate agreement.LiNeBrEaK"A global problem demands a global effort, and today we are working toward a solution with a role for developed and developing countries alike, which will be vital as we work to build consensus here at home in tough economic times," Kerry said.LiNeBrEaKGore did not sugarcoat his message to senators. While politicians including President Obama have touted the importance of exploring "clean coal technology," the former vice president said it will not be available for years: "We must avoid becoming vulnerable to the illusion that this is near at hand. It is not."LiNeBrEaKSen. Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the committee's top Republican, asked Gore to draw on his experience as "a  practical politician" to explain how senators could muster a broad bipartisan majority for any international treaty that could come out of the Copenhagen climate conference at the end of the year.LiNeBrEaKAfter distancing himself from his political past -- "I'm a recovering politician. I'm on about Step 9" -- Gore said the chances of a treaty passing the Senate should be boosted by developing countries' willingness to embrace binding climate goals, coupled with the new scientific evidence of recent warming and Obama's leadership.LiNeBrEaKSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who supports a carbon tax rather than a cap-and-trade system, said he thinks the only way to construct a bipartisan coalition on climate change is to be honest about what it means to curb greenhouse gas emissions. "I think we can build consensus around transparency," Corker said, adding that when it comes to addressing global warming, "we're really talking about increasing the price of carbon."LiNeBrEaKCorker said that even lawmakers who have some reservations about a carbon cap's economic impact need to acknowledge it will likely become reality.

The Washington Post 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	With Al Due Respect, We're Doomed  	Dana Milbank  	A-SECTION; Pg. A03  	912 words  	The lawmakers gazed in awe at the figure before them. The Goracle had seen the future, and he had come to tell them about it.LiNeBrEaKWhat the Goracle saw in the future was not good: temperature changes that "would bring a screeching halt to human civilization and threaten the fabric of life everywhere on the Earth -- and this is within this century, if we don't change."LiNeBrEaKThe chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, John Kerry (D-Mass.), appealed to hear more of the Goracle's premonitions. "Share with us, if you would, sort of the immediate vision that you see in this transformative process as we move to this new economy," he beseeched. LiNeBrEaK"Geothermal energy," the Goracle prophesied. "This has great potential; it is not very far off."LiNeBrEaKAnother lawmaker asked about the future of nuclear power. "I have grown skeptical about the degree to which it will expand," the Goracle spoke.LiNeBrEaKA third asked the legislative future -- and here the Goracle spoke in riddle. "The road to Copenhagen has three steps to it," he said.LiNeBrEaKSen. James Risch (R-Idaho) begged the Goracle to look further into the future. "What does your modeling tell you about how long we're going to be around as a species?" he inquired.LiNeBrEaKThe Goracle chuckled. "I don't claim the expertise to answer a question like that, Senator."LiNeBrEaKIt was a jarring reminder that the Goracle is, indeed, mortal. Once Al Gore was a mere vice president, but now he is a Nobel laureate and climate-change prophet. He repeats phrases such as "unified national smart grid" the way he once did "no controlling legal authority" -- and the ridicule has been replaced by worship, even by his political foes.LiNeBrEaK"Tennessee," gushed Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Gore's home state, "has a legacy of having people here in the Senate and in public service that have been of major consequence and contributed in a major way to the public debate, and you no doubt have helped build that legacy." If that wasn't quite enough, Corker added: "Very much enjoyed your sense of humor, too."LiNeBrEaKHumor? From Al Gore? "I benefit from low expectations," he replied.LiNeBrEaKThe Goracle's powers seem to come from his ability to scare the bejesus out of people. "We must face up to this urgent and unprecedented threat to the existence of our civilization," he said. And: "This is the most serious challenge the world has ever faced." And: It "could completely end human civilization, and it is rushing at us with such speed and force."LiNeBrEaKThough some lawmakers tangled with Gore on his last visit to Capitol Hill, none did on the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday. Dick Lugar (Ind.), the ranking Republican, agreed that there will be "an almost existential impact" from the climate changes Gore described.LiNeBrEaKAs such, the Goracle, even when questioned, was shown great deference. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), challenging Gore over spent nuclear fuel, began by saying: "I stand to be corrected, and I defer to your position, you're probably right, and I'm probably wrong." He ended his question by saying: "I'm not questioning you; I'm questioning myself."LiNeBrEaKOthers sought to buy the Goracle's favor by offering him gifts. "Thank you for your incredible leadership; you make this crystalline for those who don't either understand it or want to understand it," gushed Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), who went on to ask: "Will you join me this summer at the Jersey Shore?"LiNeBrEaKThe chairman worried that the Goracle may have been offended by "naysayers" who thought it funny that Gore's testimony before the committee came on a morning after a snow-and-ice storm in the capital. "The little snow in Washington does nothing to diminish the reality of the crisis," Kerry said at the start of the hearing.LiNeBrEaKThe climate was well controlled inside the hearing room, although Gore, suffering from a case of personal climate change, perspired heavily during his testimony. The Goracle presented the latest version of his climate-change slide show to the senators: a globe with yellow and red blotches, a house falling into water, and ones with obscure titles such as "Warming Impacts Ugandan Coffee Growing Region." At one point he flashed a biblical passage on the screen, but he quickly removed it. "I'm not proselytizing," he explained. A graphic showing a disappearing rain forest was accompanied by construction noises.LiNeBrEaKThe Goracle supplied abundant metaphors to accompany his visuals. Oil demand: "This roller coaster is headed for a crash, and we're in the front car."

"I am a recovering politician. I'm on about Step 9," the Goracle replied, before providing his vision.LiNeBrEaKProspects for regulating a future carbon emissions market? "There's a high degree of confidence." The future of automobiles in China and India? "I wouldn't give up on electric vehicles." The potential of solar power in those countries? "I have no question about it at all."LiNeBrEaKOf course not. He's the Goracle.

The Washington Post 		January 29, 2009 Thursday   Every Edition	Study Calls on 'Citizen Scientists' To Tap Their Inner Thoreau  	Adrian Higgins  	HOME; Pg. H04  	1150 words  	Even with the ground frozen and the fish pond glazed this month, there are   signs of life.LiNeBrEaKThe first brave blossoms of winter jasmine are shivering in freezing temperatures. Daffodil shoots are rising through the rock-hard soil, and pearl-like snowdrops are just apparent through the golden and lifeless foliage of the hakone grass. (I must cut that back.)LiNeBrEaKGardeners notice these seasonal progressions even in the supposed dead of winter, and for that reason, a U.S. Geological Survey ecologist named Jake Weltzin wants to tap into the vast reservoir of knowledge that exists in America's back yards.LiNeBrEaK"I would like to have 40,000 plant observers," said Weltzin, who is based at the University of Arizona at Tucson and is executive director of an organization called the USA National Phenology Network. Phenology is a bloodless scientific term for the miracles that occur every day in the garden: the morning in March a flock of cedar waxwings alights on the holly bushes, the first unfurling of the dogwood flower, the day the hummingbirds return, or the hour the frog lays her eggs. These life cycle events combine to form the tapestry of the natural world, and the more plants we use in the garden and the more wildlife we attract, the richer the experience. LiNeBrEaKWeltzin and his colleagues have a more prosaic reason to call on gardeners and backyard naturalists to log these phenomena: They are starting a 30-year project to gauge how climate change is affecting the world around us.LiNeBrEaK"Citizen scientists" are vital to the success of the program "to get the density of observations we need," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe network has established a plant phenology program and Web site (http://www.usanpn.org) that is about to be revamped for the 2009 season to be more user-friendly while refining the program's reporting protocols. After the late-winter redesign of the Web site,  participants will be able to record their observations at three levels: as a novice under Project BudBurst, or at an intermediate or more skilled scientific level. Participants are asked to observe the life cycles of plants chosen from a list of 70 to 203 garden plants, shade trees, wildflowers and weeds. No garden? No problem. Trails, parks and public woodlands all offer opportunities for recording  information.LiNeBrEaKNext year, the network hopes to launch a similar site for recording wildlife and is working to nail down 120 animal species for people to observe and record, 20 each among mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, aquatic species and insects.LiNeBrEaKThe unwitting father of this endeavor died 147 years ago. Henry David Thoreau, abolitionist, philosopher and naturalist, spent six years recording the flowering dates of 500 plant species of his native Concord, Mass., with the aim of producing a calendar based on a plant's first flowering.LiNeBrEaKSuch was the scale of his task, and his legendary status as a naturalist, that his work inspired others in Concord to follow suit. Alfred Hosmer, a shopkeeper and amateur botanist, recorded the flowering times in various habitats of 700 species and varieties between 1878 and 1902. And from 1963 to 1993, Pennie Logemann, a landscape designer in Concord,  methodically logged the bloom patterns of 250 plants. "I especially loved wildflowers," the now-retired Logemann said in an interview, "and more of my work was done with wildflowers than cultivated plants."  She added,  "I just noticed from year to year that something was going on."LiNeBrEaKAll three sets of records have begun to give scientists a painfully clear picture of how global warming has affected our flora and fauna. Researchers at Harvard and Boston universities went back to Concord between 2003 and 2006 to record flowering data for 500 species (60 percent of Concord's green spaces have remained intact since Thoreau's day). They determined that temperatures have risen nearly 4 degrees in the past 150 years, that flowers now open a week earlier on average and that some plants are far better equipped to deal with this phenomenon than others. More than 60 percent of the plants Thoreau tracked either have gone extinct locally or are on the brink of disappearance.LiNeBrEaK"Orchids have declined, as have lilies and gentians; these are some of the most charismatic plants," said Abraham Miller-Rushing, one of the researchers and coordinator of the impending wildlife project.LiNeBrEaKStrikingly, the scientists found that plants that adapted to temperature changes, particularly in January and early spring, were survivors compared with those that continued to bloom at the same time as when Thoreau trudged the gardens and woods of Concord.LiNeBrEaK"Species that have not flowered earlier have declined in abundance," wrote Miller-Rushing and his colleagues in a recent issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These include asters, mints, orchids, saxifrages, lilies and violets.LiNeBrEaKInsect life cycles also have shifted, leading the researchers to wonder whether the declining plants have lost their traditional pollinators.LiNeBrEaKFor the plants that have responded to warming, first-flowering dates have advanced markedly in some cases. The high-bush blueberry now flowers three weeks ahead of its 19th-century appearance. The wood sorrel, a common yellow flowering weed, blooms a month earlier.LiNeBrEaKSimilar patterns have been seen in the Washington area, though over a shorter study span.LiNeBrEaKMore than 100 observers recorded first-flowering dates in about 100 species over 32 years, ending in 2001, and found in 90 of them an average advance of flowering of more than five days. The data were analyzed in a study by botanists at the National Museum of Natural History. The plant whose first flowering has advanced the most is a weed called false strawberry, now blooming 44 days ahead of schedule. Other, more familiar plants are the redbud (nine days earlier), flowering dogwood (eight days), Virginia bluebell (16 days), Yoshino cherry tree (nine days) and dandelion (24 days).LiNeBrEaKStanwyn Shetler, curator of botany emeritus at the museum, welcomed the National Phenology Network's continuation of the effort. "Citizen scientists is [a concept] they have made a high art of in ornithology, engaging thousands of people across the country. I don't see any reason why one couldn't or shouldn't have something like that dealing with plants and phenology."LiNeBrEaKResearchers suggest a number of widespread plants that gardeners and naturalists could use to track climate change, including the weed chicory, with its distinctive blue flower in early summer; a St. John's wort species named Hypericum perforatum; the blueberry bush; and the water iris named blue flag.LiNeBrEaK"We want people in urban areas, rural areas. We are really going to need the backyard naturalists to help out," Weltzin said.LiNeBrEaKIn short, a nation of Thoreaus. "He didn't realize it at the time," said Miller-Rushing, "but the observations he was making would be valuable to our understanding of climate change."

York Daily Record (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 29, 2009 Thursday 	Rabbittransit going green, using hybrids  	Greg Gross, York Daily Record, Pa.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	533 words  	Jan. 29--Rabbittransit became a first in the state as the transit system unveiled its new hybrid paratransit fleet during a news conference today.LiNeBrEaKAll part of Rabbittransit's green plan, the vehicles will reduce greenhouse gases by 32 percent, said Richard Farr, the company's executive director. LiNeBrEaKRabbittransit is the first transit company in the state to implement hybrids in its paratransit fleet, officials said. Pittsburgh and Philadelphia use hybrid commuter buses on their daily routes.LiNeBrEaKThe vehicles made their way to York County through state and federal grants. Though each of the 10 mini-buses cost $200,000, Farr said the environmental benefits outweigh the cost.LiNeBrEaK"You can't put a price on our environment or air quality," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe fleet will get 40 percent better fuel economy over conventional petrol vehicles, and when idling, the electric-powered bus will consume 75 percent less fuel.LiNeBrEaKApart from the environmental aspects of the fleet, the vehicles were made in the United States, which ensures jobs for American workers, said State Rep. Eugene DePasquale, D-West Manchester Township.LiNeBrEaKToby Fauver, the state's department of transportation deputy secretary for local and area transportation, envisioned that more use of hybrid vehicles will help drive down prices of hybrids in the future.LiNeBrEaK"In the end, we'll help to reduce the cost of those vehicles," he said.LiNeBrEaKThough they look just like any other paratransit bus on the outside, the guts of the machine is where the action takes place.LiNeBrEaKThe braking system uses regenerative braking, and computer software can tell the gas engine to shut down when it's coasting down a long grade, said Jay Sandler, the vice president of sale with Azure Dynamics, the manufacture of the vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThe engine also shuts down after a few minutes of idling, cutting back on emissions.LiNeBrEaK"This is an electric bus with a gas engine," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe hybrids will be in service next week, Farr said.LiNeBrEaKAlso included in Rabbittransit's green plan is the start of a commuter bus service to northern Maryland. The new commuter route will link with Maryland transit centers. It will begin service next week.LiNeBrEaKLEARN MORE For tips on how to live a "greener life," or to view Rabbittransit's green plan in full, check out www.rabbittransit.org.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE SERVICE Paratransit service provides curb-to-curb trips to seniors and people with disabilities. Rabbittransit's annual paratransit ridership is more than 185,000 people.LiNeBrEaKHybrids use a conventional engine and rechargeable batteries to make them run. Generally, an electric engine powers the vehicle to a certain speed before the fuel-powered engine takes over. As the conventional engine runs, it recharges the battery that powers the electric engine. The use of the alternative battery power source cuts down on emissions.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Obama giveth, Obama taketh: First, give a piece of bailout; then, set costly new standards  	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	591 words  	Jan. 28--Even as Washington doles out tens of billions of dollars to rescue unprofitable Detroit automakers, President Barack Obama cleared the way Monday to impose billions of dollars of additional costs on the industry. He directed the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider granting California and 13 other states waivers to set their own, more strict regulations on auto emissions. LiNeBrEaKNeedless to say, Detroit would be better off without Washington's help or hindrance, something obviously lost on lawmakers and the president. His actions likely will result in unnecessary curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and counterproductive increases in fuel economy standards.LiNeBrEaK"Federal fuel economy standards are already a huge hidden burden on the industry, and the president is now proposing to make that burden even heavier," observed Sam Kazman, Competitive Enterprise Institute general counsel, regarding government-mandated corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. "Congress is spending billions to bail out the auto industry, and here's the president coming up with new ways to sink it."LiNeBrEaKMonday's announcements, in the name of combating global warming and foreign-oil dependency, effectively could lead to automakers being forced to meet even higher fuel efficiency standards and to make even greater reductions in greenhouse gases than under existing federal law.LiNeBrEaKWe are states' rights advocates, so the idea that states desire to set their own standards is a concept with which we agree. But that doesn't mean we applaud every nonsensical scheme cooked up in state capitals, including this one. Moreover, California and 13 other states effectively would set national standards because it's probably cost-prohibitive for carmakers to meet different standards for multiple jurisdictions.LiNeBrEaKEven so, the repercussions of granting tailpipe emission waivers would have far greater effect than merely increasing mileage averages from 27- to 35-miles-per gallon by 2020 and cutting so-called greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016. The change from Bush Administration standards would add significant additional costs to an industry already reeling from red ink. And even the federal Department of Transportation concedes vehicle downsizing, a major means of meeting higher fuel economy, makes cars less safe in crashes.LiNeBrEaKWe doubt most motorists would trade safety for a few more miles per gallon if it were left to them to decide. But Washington seems intent on not letting them decide. Ironically, the higher prices to meet these higher standards are likely to result in motorists hanging on to their older, less ecologically friendly and less-fuel-efficient vehicles, exactly the opposite of what's intended.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, added costs to reduce largely innocuous greenhouse gas emissions are disproportionate to whatever benefits may be gained, particularly considering the tenuous cause-and-effect relationship between CO2 emissions, which are increasing, and global warming, which isn't. President Obama's actions threaten to worsen a slumping economy to advance arbitrary, ideological goals of dubious merit.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	Readers weighed in on community college, climate and Ike, and so did Perry  		MAIN; Pg. A09  	356 words  	What do you think Gov. Rick Perry should address in his state of the state speech? We asked that question on Statesman.com. Here are some of your answers, plus what Perry said: LiNeBrEaKReader comment: Commitment to allocating sufficient funds for the community colleges in Texas to serve the increasing number of students, recognizing the economic impact of education in a state whose median salary is steadily decreasing.LiNeBrEaKWhat Perry said: The governor called on lawmakers to "significantly increase our investment" in community colleges. Specifically, he suggested expanding the Workforce Commission's Skills Development Fund, which helps train and retrain workers. His budget proposal, also released Tuesday, recommends tripling financial aid for community college students - from $14 million in 2008-09 to $42 million in 2010-11.LiNeBrEaKReader comment: I'd like for him to not assume that all Texans support him in his quest to take away a woman's right to choose.LiNeBrEaKWhat Perry said: Perry did not call for additional restrictions on abortion, but he voiced support for legislation requiring women to view an ultrasound before they terminate their pregnancy. He also spoke of "protecting the unborn from exploitation" by encouraging adult stem cell research.LiNeBrEaKReader comment: Texas is the largest emitter of global warming gases in the largest emitting nation in the world. Perry is noticeably absent on talks for measures to address climate change.LiNeBrEaKWhat Perry said: The governor didn't mention global warming. He said Texas' "strength in petrochemical production" makes the state a target of "an increasingly activist" Environmental Protection Agency that punishes states for not meeting air quality standards. He suggested encouraging alternative energy, including a $5,000 incentive for Texans in noncompliant areas to buy plug-in hybrid electric cars.LiNeBrEaKReader comment: What is Perry really going to do about hungry Texans?LiNeBrEaKWhat Perry said: Perry did not mention hungry Texans, but he spent a lot of time talking about economic development. He wants to keep taxes and spending low and improve Texans' lives by encouraging companies to move here and create jobs.

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Coal wins big in Senate stimulus package  	Ken Ward Jr., The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	460 words  	Jan. 28--CHARLESTON, W.Va. --  Coal supporters have managed to tuck more than $4. 6 billion in money for the industry into a Senate version of the economic stimulus package. LiNeBrEaKThe Senate Appropriations Committee approved the legislation with several coal projects pushed by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate funding is nearly double the $2. 6 billion included in a current House version of the legislation, meant to help boost the sagging economy across the country.LiNeBrEaKDetails were still emerging Tuesday evening, but among the coal provisions outlined in a Byrd news release and a committee statement:LiNeBrEaK"Clean, carbon-neutral coal can be a 'green' energy," Byrd said. "As Congress strives to develop a national energy policy that will break our dependence on foreign oil, it is crucial to ensure that coal, burned in more efficient ways, is part of our nation's diverse energy mix for the future." Byrd added, "These investments will help to bolster West Virginia's economic future."LiNeBrEaKThe economic stimulus bill will now be sent to the Senate floor for debate and votes by the full Senate.LiNeBrEaKSen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., has also been working behind the scenes to get as much money as possible into the stimulus package for what supporters call "clean coal" programs.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Rockefeller managed to get $2. 8 billion for the coal industry into the massive Wall Street bailout.LiNeBrEaKMost of that money was aimed at encouraging power producers to limit greenhouse gas emissions. However, the bill also aimed to promote turning coal into liquid fuel, a move that could double greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle fuels.LiNeBrEaKDuring his campaign, President Barack Obama promised to invest $150 billion over 10 years on a variety of energy programs, and to launch public/private partnerships to build five commercial-scale coal-fired power plants that capture carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKHowever, environmental groups are concerned that Congress will not put tight enough restrictions on "clean coal" projects -- requirements that they actually limit their greenhouse gas emissions and do so now, rather than much later. Also, some citizen groups, especially those opposing mountaintop removal in Appalachia, argue there is no such thing as "clean coal," whether greenhouse emissions are captured or not.LiNeBrEaKReach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or 304-348-1702.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	302 words  	Jan. 28--Gov. Bill Ritter announced Tuesday that former state Rep. Alice Madden, D-Boulder, will serve as Colorado's new climate-change coordinator.LiNeBrEaKThe $80,000-per-year position is funded through private grants from the Hewlett, Denver and Energy foundations. LiNeBrEaK"Alice Madden has distinguished herself as one of Colorado's most accomplished and talented public servants," Ritter said in a news release. "Her thoughtfulness and problem-solving skills will be crucial as we strive to achieve the goals in Colorado's Climate Action Plan and strengthen Colorado's New Energy Economy. Expanding the use of wind, solar, geothermal and clean-burning natural gas will create jobs, clean the air and address climate change."LiNeBrEaKMadden, who was term limited last year, said in the release that climate change is, "taking its toll in every corner of Colorado."LiNeBrEaK"Farmers, ranchers and the ski industry are concerned about winter snowpack," she said in the release. "Citizens are worried about rising energy costs.

The Daily News of Newburyport (Massachusetts)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Energy Task Force to meet for first time  	Sabrina Cardin, The Daily News of Newburyport, Mass.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	570 words  	Jan. 28--AMESBURY -- Amesbury is hopping on the "Think Green" energy efficiency train, with the mayor recently choosing members for the new Energy Task Force.LiNeBrEaKThe group includes Michael Browne, Jonathan Camp, Barbara Lorenc, Erika Spanger-Siegfried, Raymond Shockey, and Councilors Stephen Dunford and Joseph McMilleon.LiNeBrEaK"This is something that is at the forefront right now. Everyone is focused on energy consumption and how to reduce it in daily lives," said Kendra Amaral, chief of staff to Mayor Thatcher Kezer. "We hope to set an example." LiNeBrEaKThe group will begin looking into reducing the town's energy costs, specifically through town-owned facilities and vehicles. Approved by the council in November and running until December 2009, the task force will meet for the first time today at 6 p.m. in the Town Hall Auditorium.LiNeBrEaKAfter a chairman is elected, the group will review the Municipal Council's ordinance establishing the task force's purpose. The ordinance outlines responsibilities including strategies to reduce town energy costs, develop a townwide program to promote smart energy-saving programs, and identify possible state and federal grants.LiNeBrEaK"This group will bring together a lot of resources that already exist and package them together for residents and the municipality to utilize," Amaral said.LiNeBrEaKShockey said he submitted an application because the task force is thinking forward. Cutting costs and helping reduce carbon emissions are something he believes should be synonymous.LiNeBrEaK"The government is a logical place to start because it affects taxpayers," he said.LiNeBrEaKShockey has a strong background in utilities management and engineering. His experience sparked his interest in the warming of the planet.LiNeBrEaK"I have been involved with several people for years, and the concern is there," Shockey said. "It's not surprising the town is trying to make a change at a local level."LiNeBrEaKParticipating at a local grass-roots level is something he believes will begin the change.LiNeBrEaK"What we are trying to do is not only save the town money, but also try and get the community involved," Shockey said. "I hope to have a continuing conversation with citizens to get more ideas. All ideas aren't just tied up in this group."LiNeBrEaKThe Green Communities Act Gov. Deval Patrick signed in early July has helped prompt change throughout the state. Shockey believes some of the act's main goals can help the new task force. Lower energy costs, promoting renewable energy, and making state and municipal power greener are all major goals of the act.LiNeBrEaKExploring energy efficiency is not something new for Amesbury. An Energy Commission was formed under the previous council to help explore the use of bio-fuels, and the town is currently using a grant to fund an energy audit throughout town buildings.LiNeBrEaK"The Energy Commission was very directed as opposed to the task force, which is broader and focused on conservation," Amaral said. "We can save on costs and consumption and start going to work on developing resources."

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Obama signals end of polluting with impunity  	The Dallas Morning News  	COMMENTARY  	406 words  	Jan. 28--In a matter of minutes, President Barack Obama did what the previous administration refused to do for eight years: proactively address climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn a 10-minute speech Monday, Obama laid out the basic tenets of his energy policy and set in motion plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen fuel efficiency standards. The president signaled a needed sea change in environmental policy when he ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its rejection of California's request to set strict rules for car emissions. LiNeBrEaKHe also ordered the Transportation Department to finalize new fuel-economy rules.LiNeBrEaKOn both issues, the Bush administration had managed to hem and haw until the clock ran out. Not only did federal officials refuse to bolster emissions standards, they stood in the way of states that sought to clean their own air.LiNeBrEaKAt least 13 states are poised to follow California's lead and impose similar tailpipe rules once California gets the go-ahead from the feds.LiNeBrEaKNow the question will be whether Texas will join the clean-air crowd or continue to dig in its heels. Obama said he has no interest in creating a patchwork quilt of emissions standards, implying that California's rules could go national.LiNeBrEaKThe Texas Legislature could begin to prepare for that new world order by adopting California's low-emission standards. In 2007, state Sen. Rodney Ellis tried and failed to convince his colleagues to adopt the tougher pollution rules for cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaKTwo years later, the Houston Democrat -- and his bill -- are ready to try again.LiNeBrEaKTailpipes spew more than half the smog-causing emissions in North Texas. So, in a state where several cities are struggling to comply with pollution rules, cleaner cars would jumpstart efforts to clear the air.LiNeBrEaKInstead of waiting for the federal government to force their hand, Texas lawmakers should take a more aggressive approach to limiting emissions. After all, Obama has left little doubt that polluting with impunity no longer will be permitted.

The Denver Post 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Where are ``cooler heads''?  	Al Knight Denver Post Columnist  	Pg. B-11  	493 words  	Barack Obama's administration has already made a half-dozen major appointments with an eye toward addressing climate change. In fact, the new president was nearly giddy this week when he directed the Environmental Protection Agency to consider a request by California to impose stiffer emissions standards on the nation's automakers. LiNeBrEaKIn signing an executive order to that effect, Obama swept aside a number of important considerations, not the least of which was the opposition of the nearly moribund U.S. auto industry.LiNeBrEaKThe automakers - including Toyota and Honda - have all said that new state-imposed regulations will add perhaps $3,000 to the cost of every new car at a time when demand is low. Obama did not address these concerns, nor answer why the federal government should impose billions in new regulations on an industry at the same time that it is giving that same industry billions in direct aid.LiNeBrEaKA good case can be made for preventing state-imposed standards. Assuming the seriousness of global warming, can it be reasonably addressed by allowing a piecemeal, state-by-state approach to regulation? Isn't it obvious that while the costs of the policy will be immediate, the benefits (if any) will be long-deferred?LiNeBrEaKFinally, the Clean Air Act assumed federal regulation and made an exception for state action only where a state could demonstrate a "compelling and extraordinary" interest. Even if California can demonstrate such an interest, can the same be said for more than a dozen other states that want to follow California's lead?LiNeBrEaKIt might be that in very good times, an experiment with fragmented air quality regulations would be a nifty thing. That judgment surely does not apply in light of current economic conditions.LiNeBrEaKThe new president may be able to ignore the lobbyists for the auto industry, but it is clear he is listening to the nation's leading environmental groups. So what are they saying?LiNeBrEaKQuite a lot, it turns out. The 27 leading organizations have written a 400-page document directing Obama on how to "Transition to Green." That document, available on the Internet, is a laundry list of projects and directives, some of which are downright frightening. For example, it declares that funding should be eliminated for fossil fuels and nuclear energy. It says that not only must all wetlands be preserved, but that an additional 5 million acres of wetlands should be created.LiNeBrEaKIt also sets a clear double standard. Traditional forms of energy are to be subjected to ever higher levels of regulation while roadblocks are to be systematically removed for nontraditional forms.LiNeBrEaKThese are heady times. It used to be that such extravagant promises were subjected to a cost-benefit analysis and that in time "cooler heads" could prevail. Now that government is operating on huge amounts of borrowed money and excitement is in the air, there's a critical shortage of "cooler heads." That can't be good.LiNeBrEaKContact Al Knight at alknight@mindspring.com	AUTOMAKERS (91%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); EMISSIONS (77%); LOBBYING (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); WETLANDS (77%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (77%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (77%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (72%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (60%); ECONOMIC NEWS (50%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  			CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	Column  													
Grand Forks Herald (North Dakota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Grand Forks Herald, N.D., Dorreen Yellow Bird column: DORREEN YELLOW BIRD: 2008 goes down as one for the books  	Dorreen Yellow Bird, Grand Forks Herald, N.D.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	734 words  	Jan. 28--We are creating something that's irreversible on the human time scale. Carbon dioxide pumped into our atmosphere from power plants and cars will affect surface temperatures and sea levels for more than 1,000 years. Coastal land and small islands could disappear as the oceans rise -- the result of melting glaciers and continental ice sheets.LiNeBrEaKThe American Southwest could become a dust bowl and ocean dead-zones could become more prominent and widespread, says a new study just released by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. LiNeBrEaKYet, it's hard to take news of global warming seriously in North Dakota's current cold spell, although I know the threat is real.LiNeBrEaKIn western North Dakota, you have to drive through a 9-foot-high tunnel where snow drifted and the snowplow piled snow to get to my aunt's old place, my sisters in White Shield, N.D., told me.LiNeBrEaKMy younger sister, Kaye, told me the snow in her frontyard was at least 3 feet high. That's enough to cover the trash cans.LiNeBrEaKKaye and her family had to be plowed out before they could leave their house. And even then, it's treacherous on the highway if there's any wind.LiNeBrEaKNo senior bingo or casino for a while.LiNeBrEaKA narrow strip of snowfall swept across the state a few weeks ago and dumped tons of snow on top of what they already had, Kaye said. White Shield is in that strip. The storm just seemed to stop and throw the snow chutes wide-open. The snow is piled high on each side of the highway, and it's been really, really cold, she said.LiNeBrEaKThis is the most snow that that drought-stricken area has had in a long time. So, I imagine the inconvenience of the snow and cold is worth it because the snow will leave lots of moisture for the crops this summer. Farmers are smiling as they shovel.LiNeBrEaKIt was only a few years ago when our family stayed at the hospital in Garrison, N.D., with my mother during her last days. One of those snowless arctic blasts came through the area. It was late December, but there was no snow on the ground. So, the fierce wind created a dust storm. We knew that with that kind of wind, any snow on the ground would have been whipped up into a blizzard for sure.LiNeBrEaKSo, with all the cold and snow this year, global warming is a hard sell in the White Shield area.LiNeBrEaKI love the springs when we've had a snow cover this deep. The rolling hills of the prairie will almost disappear in the drifts.LiNeBrEaKWhen there's a full moon, the prairie turns into a wonderland, but most amazing is the transformation that takes place when the snow begins to melt.LiNeBrEaKA coulee cuts into the hills around my grandmother's old place. I'm sure it was made from big spring runoffs such as the ones we'll be getting this year. When I lived there, I'd go outside and listen to the water cascading into the coulee from the surrounding hills. It looked and sounded like one of those gushing waterfalls in the mountains.LiNeBrEaKI had to stand on my tiptoes and look over the porch banisher to watch the icy water bounce over the rocks and then proceed down the steep hill.LiNeBrEaKWeeks later, almost on the same day as when the water sound had turned into a trickle, tiny and furry purple crocuses would dot the prairie, and a hint of green would began to show.LiNeBrEaKHow much of that beauty of our prairie and plains would be lost to global warming?LiNeBrEaKThe talk about climate change has grown louder and louder. We have been forced to pull our head out of the sand, and it's not looking so good.LiNeBrEaKThere is some good news. Something called geoengineering is being proposed and worked on to tackle human-induced climate change. For example, planetary engineering techniques might remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by using ocean iron fertilization or by using mirrors to deflect the son's rays. The hope is that this would negate the affects of climate change.LiNeBrEaKGeoengineering and other techniques, as I understand it, are still in the study stage.LiNeBrEaKThe questions are, can we still make a difference, and is our technology up to the task?LiNeBrEaKLet's hope so.

Gulf Daily News (Manama, Bahrain)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Poison in the air we all breathe...  	Rebecca Torr, Gulf Daily News, Manama, Bahrain  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	719 words  	Jan. 28--BAHRAIN'S air is amongst the most poisonous in the world -- and we all are breathing it, says a top environmentalist. High air pollution is putting people at risk of lung and heart problems and even premature death, says engineer Rehan Ahmed, senior environmental specialist at the Public Commission for the Protection of Marine Resources, Environment and Wildlife.LiNeBrEaKThe carbon dioxide emission of Bahrain in terms of quantity and percentage is only 0. 1 per cent, but it is the sixth highest emitter per capita in the world, he said. LiNeBrEaKPoor air quality could have a severe impact on health and lead to breathing difficulty, wheezing, coughing and aggravation of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions, Mr Ahmed told the GDN.LiNeBrEaKHe said these could result in increased medication use, doctor or emergency room visits, hospital admissions and premature death.LiNeBrEaKAccording to official statistics, more than 15pc of children here suffer from asthma and the number is rising.LiNeBrEaK"Children who live in highly polluted communities are five times more likely to have clinically low lung function -- less than 80pc than is normal for their age," said Mr Ahmed.LiNeBrEaK"During dusty weather, asthma and allergies are common. These increase due to dust and vehicular emissions."LiNeBrEaKNatural sources of air pollution in Bahrain include dust, smoke and carbon monoxide.LiNeBrEaKAbout 71pc of greenhouse gases in Bahrain come from energy production, followed by waste-12pc, industries-10pc, road transport-7pc, and agriculture-0. 3pc, he said.LiNeBrEaKFine particles affect more people globally than any other pollutant.LiNeBrEaKAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 350 million people worldwide suffer from asthma and more than 180,000 die from it every year.LiNeBrEaKLong-term exposure to air pollution from a nearby freeway or heavily trafficked streets was also associated with hardening of arteries, which could raise the risk of heart disease and stroke.LiNeBrEaKMr Ahmed said research shows that people living in the most polluted areas could lose two to three years of their life because of exposure to chronic air pollution.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the WHO, 2. 4m people die each year from causes directly attributable to air pollution.LiNeBrEaKFour per cent of deaths in the US can be attributed to air pollution, according to studies. In the EU, yearly 310,000 people die of it.LiNeBrEaK"Direct causes of air pollution deaths include aggravated asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, lung and heart diseases, and respiratory allergies," said Mr Ahmed.LiNeBrEaKCulprits include thermal power, cement or steel plants, refineries, petrochemicals, quarrying, vehicular emissions, smoke, manufacturing facilities, municipal waste incinerators, aircrafts, marine vessels, oil refining, industrial activity and landfill sites.LiNeBrEaK"More than 500,000 Americans die each year from diseases linked to breathing."LiNeBrEaK"The World Bank has estimated the projected premature annual death due to urban air pollution to be two million a year, with around 590,00 in China, 460,000 in India, 150,000 in East Asia and Pacific, 130,000 in Latin America and Caribbean, 120,000 in South Asia, followed by 90,000 in the Middle East."LiNeBrEaKMr Ahmed was speaking under the title, 'Sources and impacts of air pollution in Bahrain', at a seminar at the Bahrain Society of Engineers (BSE), Juffair, last night.LiNeBrEaKIt was organised by the Institution of Engineers Pakistan-Bahrain Chapter, in association with the BSE.LiNeBrEaKThe other guest speaker was Public Commission senior environmental specialist Suzan Al Ajjawi, who discussed the commission's efforts in monitoring air quality in Bahrain.LiNeBrEaKShe said there were mobile air quality monitoring stations in all governorates since July 2006.LiNeBrEaKThese monitor 12 air pollutants including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, along with meteorological parameters of wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, ambient temperature and relative humidity. becky@gdn.com.bh	ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ASTHMA (90%); AIR POLLUTION (90%); RESPIRATORY DISEASE (89%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (89%); CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (89%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (89%); CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (78%); AIR QUALITY (78%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); DEATHS and DEATH RATES (77%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (76%); EMERGENCY ROOMS (73%); CARBON MONOXIDE (72%); STATISTICS (71%); SOLID WASTE TREATMENT and DISPOSAL (69%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (69%); PETROCHEMICALS (65%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (65%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (65%); PETROLEUM REFINERIES (62%); LANDFILLS (62%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (62%)  		Science  	BAHRAIN (96%); UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090128-UA-Poison-in-the-air-we-all-breathe-0128  	Newspaper  	UA  	2009

EDITION	LETTERS  	JIM COODY, DAVID ALEXANDER, BOB GAYLE, FRANK ELVIN, LOREN CALLICOTTE, JIM GREENWOOD, TRISH BRANT  	B; Pg. 8  	1106 words  	Reactions to 'the heat' / Contrived crisisLiNeBrEaKREGARDING Monday's Chronicle editorial "The heat is on": This debate is not about whether climate change is actually happening. We agree that the climate is changing. The debate is whether carbon dioxide is the driving force in climate change, and whether or not human efforts to implement miniscule reductions of this trace gas will have any effect on the climate.LiNeBrEaKThere is no guarantee that controlling carbon dioxide emissions will mitigate or slow down the hypothetical catastrophic scenarios that characterize modern climate "science." In fact, there is far more scientific evidence that such efforts are futile, especially when water vapor, solar radiation and natural cycles are properly analyzed. LiNeBrEaKThe continuing worldwide growth in carbon dioxide emissions significantly exceeds, overwhelms and defeats the intent and purpose of the Kyoto treaty, thereby making this treaty meaningless and irrelevant.LiNeBrEaKCommon proposals for implementing minor reductions in carbon dioxide emissions cannot be proven to achieve any measurable reduction in the average global atmospheric temperature. Such proposals can safely be ignored and dismissed.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is largely a contrived crisis that diverts attention and resources from real global environmental problems such as unsafe drinking water, unsanitary living conditions, and con-taminated food. These are real environmental problems that cause enormous human suffering and are far more deserving of our compassion, intellectual energy and technical resources.LiNeBrEaK- JIM COODY,LiNeBrEaKengineer, HoustonLiNeBrEaKReactions to 'the heat' / Devise a solutionLiNeBrEaKI would like to commend the Chronicle on Monday's editorial highlighting new data that indicates the Antarctic has been warming over the last five decades rather than cooling as inferred from previous incomplete data.LiNeBrEaKThe vast majority of the scientific evidence is solidly behind the fact that global warming is a harsh reality and that human activity is a major contributor. There are strong economic concerns affecting the decision about whether to address the problem on a unilateral basis, but the United States needs to take the lead on this issue and use its proven record of entrepreneurship and innovation to devise a workable and economically viable solution.LiNeBrEaK- DAVID ALEXANDER,LiNeBrEaKAndrew Hays Buchanan Associate Professor of Astrophysics, Rice University, HoustonLiNeBrEaKReactions to 'the heat' / Missed in debateLiNeBrEaKTHE editorial, in a hurry to point out the weak arguments of the global warming skeptics, misses two points: The debate isn't about whether warming is happening, but how much is due to humans, and, the idea that hurricanes could become stronger had been debunked by the very agency that is cited in the Antarctica study.LiNeBrEaK- BOB GAYLE,LiNeBrEaKHoustonLiNeBrEaKReactions to 'the heat' / Follow EuropeLiNeBrEaKTHANK you to the Chronicle's editorial board for highlighting global warming in Monday's editorial. We must not let low oil prices once again lull us into a false sense of energy security. We must not forget the future problems that could occur from unlimited greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. is falling behind Europe in climate change awareness and regulations of greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. must not miss out on the upcoming "green" Industrial Revolution, with the predicted millions of jobs that are associated with new green technology. The European Union's policy is a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, and the United Kingdom has just passed the Climate Change Act mandating an 80 percent reduction in green house gases by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe U.K. and Europe believe that by increasing the use of renewable energy sources and providing more nuclear power, as well as improving energy conservation, global warming can be prevented.LiNeBrEaK- FRANK ELVIN,LiNeBrEaKchemical engineer, BellaireLiNeBrEaKReactions to 'the heat' / 650 who disagreeLiNeBrEaKAS its main source of proof, the Chronicle editorial quoted Dr. James Hansen of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He claims, among other things, that the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1997. Yet, at a United Nations climate change conference in Poland in December, 650 scientists scoffed at the notion of man-made global warming. Their voices will be heard in a U.S. Senate Minority Report quoting the scientists, many of whom are current and former members of the U.N.'s own Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKUnlike Hansen, who claims the planet has been heating up in the last 10 years, these scientists claim the planet has been cooling down in the last 10 years.LiNeBrEaK- LOREN CALLICOTTE, HoustonLiNeBrEaKA win-win-win for countyLiNeBrEaKIN response to Monday's Page One article "A fresh look at who belongs behind bars / Releasing low-level inmates may be one way to alleviate county's crowded jails": Three cheers for District Attorney Pat Lykos, Sheriff Adrian Garcia and for district judges of whatever party who will use the Harris County Pre-Trial Services resource to allow some "low-risk" persons awaiting trial to return to jobs and families without having to pay a bondsman for their pretrial freedom. It will not only reduce overcrowding and improve safety for both prisoners and guards in our jails, but it will also reduce the taxpayers' cost of housing, feeding and clothing persons who have not yet been proven guilty.LiNeBrEaKPre-Trial Services personnel inquire about and evaluate 14 risk categories for each offender they interview for the courts. Wise exercise of judicial discretion and common sense can allow low-risk defendants to keep their jobs and pay their grocer or landlord rather than a bondsman, allow Garcia to reduce overtime pay for jailers and return the Harris County Jail to "law-abiding" status, and allow commissioners court to put off the day for building a new multimillion dollar jail a few more years. A win-win-win solution.LiNeBrEaK- JIM GREENWOOD,LiNeBrEaKHoustonLiNeBrEaKRepublicans won't be sheepLiNeBrEaKREGARDING two letters on Monday under the headline "Respect for our president": Your readers seem to think that proper respect is not being shown to the "office of the president" now that Barack Obama is in office. Where was the respect to the "office" while George W. Bush was president?LiNeBrEaKSome seem to think that Obama should not be criticized so early in his term because he won an overwhelming popular vote. I don't believe that winning by 53 percent to 46 percent is overwhelming. Although he has been in office only a few days, Obama has quickly made some important decisions. Don't expect conservatives to reject their principles and not speak up. We may have to get over the fact that Obama is president, but don't expect us to follow along like sheep.LiNeBrEaK- TRISH BRANT,LiNeBrEaKHumble	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (77%); ASTRONOMY and SPACE (75%); ASTROPHYSICS (75%); PHYSICS (75%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (73%); WEATHER (72%); OIL and GAS PRICES (71%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (50%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)  			HOUSTON, TX, USA (91%) TEXAS, USA (91%) ANTARCTICA (91%); UNITED STATES (91%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Houston Chronicle Publishing Company All Rights Reserved  																
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Gore testifies that U.S. must act quickly to reduce carbon emissions  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	997 words  	WASHINGTON _ New scientific studies _ including one released this week _ add urgency to the need to reduce carbon emissions, but the United States can do it in a way that strengthens American economic prosperity and national security, former Vice President Al Gore told a Senate committee Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKGore called on Congress to pass President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package because it contains billions of dollars for energy efficiency, renewable energy, an improved national electricity grid and cleaner transportation, which add up to large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. LiNeBrEaKGore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for helping the public understand global warming, brought the Senate Foreign Relations Committee up to speed using his trademark slides and short videos. He also urged the U.S. to take three steps: Pass the stimulus plan with its big boost for clean electricity, then pass a law to put a price on carbon emissions and limit them, and then lead all countries to agree to binding reductions under a new treaty _ all by the end of this year.LiNeBrEaK"The scientists are practically screaming from the rooftops. This is a planetary emergency. It's outside the scale we're used to dealing with," Gore told the senators.LiNeBrEaKBold action is needed because the climate that makes human civilization possible is at risk, and decisions about whether to burn more fossil fuel now will have an impact on Earth's climate far into the future, he said.LiNeBrEaKOne of the examples of new evidence Gore mentioned was a report by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist Susan Solomon that concluded that changes in temperature, rainfall and sea level are largely irreversible for more than 1,000 years after carbon dioxide emissions stop completely.LiNeBrEaKHeat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, have caused the Earth's temperature to increase in recent decades, and scientists say that the average global surface temperature could rise by up to another 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if carbon emissions continue unchecked. Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and about 20 percent of it remains for thousands of years.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's study with Swiss and French partners looked at the consequences of letting carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere above the current level during this century and then completely halting emissions. It found evidence that there'd be decreases in rainfall comparable to the 1930s Dust Bowl in North America and many other parts of the world that would last for hundreds of years, and that a gradual rise in the sea level over 1,000 years would be locked in.LiNeBrEaKSolomon said in a statement this week that the study "convinced us that current choices regarding carbon dioxide emissions will have legacies that will irreversibly change the planet."LiNeBrEaK"It's a sobering warning that the quicker we reduce emissions the better," Gore said when he told senators about Solomon's report and other recent findings, but he added that there was no reason to fear doom or to make what he called a false choice between "our planet and our way of life."LiNeBrEaK"In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the very same solutions that will address our economic and national security crises as well," he said, arguing that renewable energy _ sun, wind and geothermal _ will create jobs and reduce dependence on oil-powered regimes.LiNeBrEaKGore got a friendly reception from Democrats and Republicans alike. None challenged his scientific assessment. Gore at one point noted that he was encouraged when he spoke about warming in Antarctica by nods of agreement from Robert Corell, a climate scientist and oceanographer at The Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment, who was sitting nearby.LiNeBrEaKSen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., thanked Gore for an informative talk and said he'd never missed one of Gore's presentations.LiNeBrEaKIsakson asked Gore several questions about nuclear energy and suggested that the federal government could help set up ways to improve the system for financing nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaKGore told Isakson that he agreed that nuclear power should be considered, but that he didn't think there was interest from private investors because of the high costs of nuclear plants.LiNeBrEaKSen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Gore's home state of Tennessee, also thanked Gore for an "excellent meeting." Corker and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., recently studied the European experience with carbon trading.LiNeBrEaKCorker said he expected that climate legislation putting a price on carbon emissions was likely this year _ "We're now firing with real bullets," he said _ and that he wanted to help craft the bill. He argued that all revenue from the sale of emissions credits should be returned to the American people to make up for higher energy costs.LiNeBrEaKGore agreed that significant funds should be returned to taxpayers, but said that some money also should go to other needs, such as expanding renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThe hearing on climate change was the first meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under the new chairmanship of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., reflecting Kerry's long-standing interest in global warming science and policy.LiNeBrEaKThe House of Representatives passed the Obama stimulus bill 244-188 Wednesday evening.

The Lima News (Ohio)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Green agenda at odds with public  	The Lima News, Ohio  	COMMENTARY  	525 words  	Jan. 28--A new poll found that people rank global warming dead last, 20th out of 20, among their top concerns. The economy was No. 1, while other economic-related issues unsurprisingly gravitated to the top. The poll seems to show that the rest of the country has caught up to those of us here in the Heartland who don't have time for the celebrity of the day, in this case global warming, as we face more vital issues like putting food on the table. LiNeBrEaKThe survey conducted Jan. 7 through 11 asked 1,503 adults on cell phones and landlines to rank 20 issues by importance, including strengthening the economy, improving the job situation, defending against terrorism, Social Security, health care, energy, environment, budget deficits, health insurance, dealing with moral breakdown and crime and reducing lobbyists' influence, among others.LiNeBrEaKThe New York Times noted that the nonpartisan Pew Research Center poll is "somewhat at odds with President (Barack) Obama, who has put a high priority on staving off global warming and vowed ... to 'roll back the specter of a warming planet.' " Regular folks seem far more concerned with rolling back bad economic conditions.LiNeBrEaKWhatever your take on global warming, what's certain is that substantive "solutions" come at a huge cost to commerce and taxpayers while diverting limited resources to fight what could be an overplayed threat. Measures meant to reduce global warming -- not that we know they'd work, but those proposing them mean well -- would be hardest on those places that still depend heavily on manufacturing. The Lima and most other parts of Ohio fit that description well enough to make anything Obama proposes to "curb" global warming a chilling prospect.LiNeBrEaKDespite the lack of concern -- and in spite of job losses and economic conditions that threaten to kill the Detroit Three automakers -- Obama moved the green agenda forward Monday. He ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to review whether California and other states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emissions on automakers. He also said his administration would impose new fuel-efficiency standards for the 2011 model year.LiNeBrEaKThe administration that proposes to save the domestic auto industry through taxpayer bailouts now proposes to add costs that would threaten the market viability those automakers have.LiNeBrEaKThe government's questionable economic stimulus efforts won't be felt for months at best, and the Congressional Budget Office admits in many cases may not show up for two years. But adverse economic effects of Draconian global warming mandates will be felt almost immediately.LiNeBrEaKObama would be prudent to heed the public's opinion about a global condition that has yet to prove itself threatening, let alone catastrophic.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	Recession threatens wind power &lt;|&gt; Industry group urges Congress to fund expansion of alternate energy source  	THOMAS CONTENT, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	D Business; Pg. 4  	521 words  	Even as it reported a record-breaking year, the American Wind Energy Association warned that the recession is slowing wind-power development and urged Congress to support renewable energy in its economic stimulus legislation. LiNeBrEaK The wind power industry invested $17 billion and added 8,358 megawatts of new generating capacity last year - enough to power more than 2 million homes - but the Washington-based trade group said that financing for new projects and orders for turbine components slowed by the end of the year.LiNeBrEaK "Our numbers are both exciting and sobering," said Denise Bode, the association's chief executive. "It is clear that the economic and financial downturn have begun to take a serious toll on new wind development. We are already seeing layoffs in the area where wind's promise is greatest for our economy: the wind power manufacturing sector."LiNeBrEaK Bode called for action in Congress on an economic stimulus package that includes initiatives designed to expand renewable energy generation.LiNeBrEaKCapacity is increasingLiNeBrEaK Wisconsin saw a sevenfold increase in wind power capacity last year, as new wind power projects opened in Fond du Lac and Dodge counties. Those projects included the Blue Sky Green Field wind power project opened by We Energies, the Forward Wind Energy Center built by Invenergy of Chicago and Cedar Ridge, developed by Wisconsin Power and Light Co.LiNeBrEaK The state ranks 15th in the nation in wind power capacity, according to figures from AWEA. Iowa ranks second to Texas, after passing California in 2008. Several Wisconsin utilities have signed up to bring in wind power from Iowa, where the winds are stronger and turbines operate more efficiently than turbines erected in Wisconsin.LiNeBrEaK The association said wind power is creating jobs across the country, as wind turbine and turbine component manufacturers announced, added or expanded 55 new facilities in 2008, creating 13,000 jobs, the association said.LiNeBrEaK Also reporting this week it had a record year: Madison-based WindConnect, a unit of RMT Inc., which provides engineering, siting and construction services for new wind power developments.LiNeBrEaK We Energies has announced plans to open another wind power project, the Glacier Hills Wind Park in Columbia County, at a cost of up to $530 million.LiNeBrEaK The announcement came as the wind industry is looking for the administration of President Barack Obama to push for renewable energy not only in the stimulus package, but in another bill Congress may take up later this year. The administration supports a national mandate for 10% of the country's electricity to come from renewable power by 2012 and 25% by 2025.LiNeBrEaK Supporters of wind power say the state needs more energy that doesn't contribute emissions linked to global warming and for which the fuel is free.LiNeBrEaK But critics note that wind power project costs have escalated in recent years, and that wind turbines aren't as efficient as conventional power plants in making electricity.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Obama's green plan must include Native Americans  	By Winona LaDuke  	FOOD NEWS  	866 words  	To accomplish the green energy goals he talked about in his inaugural address, President Obama must work with Native Americans.LiNeBrEaK"Each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet," the president said, vowing that "we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."LiNeBrEaKTo realize these goals, Obama's administration must collaborate with Native American tribes to realize their vast wind and solar power potential. For instance, using solar power alone, Native lands have the potential to generate about 4. 5 times the amount of electricity that is produced in the entire United States. Tribal wind resources could provide a double digit percentage of the country's electricity, as well. LiNeBrEaKIn addition, a green jobs initiative could transition the most wasteful economy in the world into one that has a chance at surviving, all while providing economic development where it's needed most. By working with Native American tribes, the Obama administration can catalyze the development of tremendous human and economic potential in some of the country's poorest communities.LiNeBrEaKFor too many years, Washington presented tribes with a false choice: either develop polluting energy resources or remain in dire poverty. Often, the oil and mining companies ripped the tribes off by underpaying royalties, even as they polluted the land. But economic development does not need to come at the expense of Native cultural identity or thriving ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration should not provide more incentives to extract fossil fuels and uranium from Indian country.LiNeBrEaKThese are the dirty resources of yesterday. They have assaulted the well-being of tribes and Alaska Native villages, exploiting the vulnerabilities of poor, politically isolated communities for too long. Oil drilling in sensitive Arctic regions threatens Alaska Natives' way of life and perpetuates Washington's addiction to oil. We need a federal timeout on the proposed offshore development of the Outer Continental Shelf areas in Alaska.LiNeBrEaKNor is "clean coal" the answer. Mining coal is never clean. Coal plant emissions cause global warming. Obama should not approve coal expansion on or near Native lands. Carbon "sequestration" is unproven.LiNeBrEaKThere is no sure way to sequester "forever" _ except to leave it in the earth.LiNeBrEaKAnd nuclear power is not a solution to anything. Mining uranium has caused high levels of cancer deaths among Native peoples. (There are still 1,000 abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo reservation from the last nuclear era.) What's more, nuclear waste contaminates the earth for a hundred thousand years.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration must end corporate welfare to coal, gas, oil and nuclear industries and redirect the billions in subsidies to clean energy development and efficiency in Native America.LiNeBrEaKNative American and Alaskan Native peoples have suffered the most from our senseless carbon-based energy policy. For example, the entire indigenous village of Shishmaref in Alaska will need to relocate because of rising temperatures and nastier storms, ruining the way of life there.LiNeBrEaKTo turn things around, the Obama administration should provide funding for wind and solar development on Native lands along with efficiency improvements in tribal housing.LiNeBrEaKTribally owned and operated renewable energy projects, along with green jobs that help reduce dependence on fossil fuels, are central to a sustainable and affordable low-carbon future.LiNeBrEaKA green jobs economy and a new, forward-thinking energy and climate policy will transform tribal and other rural economies and provide the basis for a robust and sustainable recovery.LiNeBrEaKNow is the time.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKWinona LaDuke is the executive director of Honor the Earth, a Native organization that stresses sustainable environmental policies.

News and Record (Greensboro, NC) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   Greensboro Edtion Variation Edition	Emissions bill to get another airing in N.C.  	MARK BINKER  	TRIAD CLASSIFIEDSDEASOMESENERAL NEWS; Pg. A1  	719 words  	RALEIGH - When President Barack Obama ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider rules that block states from adopting their own car emissions standards, environmental advocates in North Carolina began revving their engines.LiNeBrEaKThe federal rules put in place during President George W. Bush's administration were primarily aimed at California, which has long had its own emissions standards and has proposed rules tougher than existing federal standards.LiNeBrEaKSome in North Carolina would like to follow that new, tougher California standard and say the president's order began clearing a path toward that end. LiNeBrEaK"The importance of that in limiting tailpipe emission is the quickest and easiest way to achieve significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions," said Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Greensboro Democrat.LiNeBrEaKFirst as a lobbyist and then as a legislator, Harrison has pushed for a North Carolina law that would require cars sold in the state to emit less carbon, nitrous oxide and other gases believed to contribute to global warming. Her legislation would apply to new cars and trucks sold in the state, not automobiles already on the road.LiNeBrEaKAs the General Assembly convenes its 2009 session today, she said the bill is more likely to pass than at any point in the past.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, legislators returning to Raleigh will likely be keeping an eye on a range of federal actions. Those include an economic stimulus package that contains billions of dollars for state governments and reauthorization of a joint federal-state health insurance program for children.LiNeBrEaKThough Obama's emissions order does not hand down money to the states, it does clear some obstacles for environmental advocates and their legislative allies.LiNeBrEaK"Lawmakers have been hesitant not because of the cost of the program but because of the roadblocks and uncertainty involved," said Margaret Hartzell, an advocate with Environment North Carolina, a nonprofit group that favors tighter emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKShe points out that 13 other states, including Florida, have moved to piggyback on California's emissions rules.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers and dealers have lobbied against the state emissions rules, persuading North Carolina lawmakers to block their passage in previous General Assembly sessions.LiNeBrEaK"There should be one national standard, not a patchwork," said Robert Glaser, president of the N.C. Automobile Dealers Association. Allowing the states to put their own regulations in place, he said, would create confusion for consumers, regulators and the car industry alike.LiNeBrEaKThere are skeptics in the General Assembly as well, including Rep. Nelson Cole, a Reidsville Democrat who has been heavily involved in transportation issues.LiNeBrEaK"The emission standards that would be put in place under the California (standards) add to the cost of cars," Cole said. With auto manufacturers and their affiliated dealers struggling, he said, "this is not the time to be doing that."LiNeBrEaKGlaser agreed.LiNeBrEaK"It's quite possibly the worst time possible to file a bill like this," he said.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers and environmentalists argue over exactly how much cost would be added to the car, but numbers range from $1,000 to $4,000.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think anyone wants to impose any hardship on the automobile industry, but it seems to me they ought to be moving this way anyway," Harrison said.LiNeBrEaKA major way that cars achieve lower emission standards is by burning less gasoline. With gas prices hitting highs of more than $4 per gallon recently, Harrison said it makes sense for consumers and the environment to burn less fuel.LiNeBrEaKBut Cole said newer model cars are not the problem. Rather, he said, North Carolina has a high number of cars older than 10 years old on the road that lack modern emission control systems.LiNeBrEaKCole said he would file a bill to encourage people to trade in those older cars but would not say precisely what it would do.LiNeBrEaKAnd Cole pointed to recent court decisions that will force the Tennessee Valley Authority to clean up the pollution it is emitting from power plants, which have been a major source of pollution in western North Carolina.LiNeBrEaK"You need to look at the total picture," Cole said.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	Don't forget OSH patients Thank you f  		Editorial; Pg. C05  	794 words  	Don't forget OSH patientsLiNeBrEaKThank you for your article about violence at Oregon State Hospital ("A culture of fear," Jan. 24).LiNeBrEaKStaff at the hospital deserve to be kept safe. But you forgot to mention the more than 600 patients at OSH who are required to live there 24 hours a day. They cannot go home after a work shift or request a shift reassignment and cannot seclude and restrain other patients who threaten them.LiNeBrEaKThe vast majority of OSH residents do not engage in violent acts. But all are living in a culture of violence. This is one reason that the U.S. Department of Justice visited OSH in November 2006 and issued a report in January 2008 finding that conditions violated patients' civil rights. LiNeBrEaKThe state has yet to settle the matter with the Department of Justice, and staffing levels at OSH remain far below what is considered adequate to ensure staff and patient safety.LiNeBrEaKBOB JOONDEPHLiNeBrEaKExecutive Director, Disability Rights OregonLiNeBrEaKA different OppenheimerLiNeBrEaKThere has been extensive coverage of OppenheimerFunds in The Oregonian beginning in mid-December, concerning its performance as manager of the state's 529 college savings plan.LiNeBrEaKOppenheimer and Co.

I need people who have money to buy my products. Giving me a tax cut is not going to put money in my potential customers' pockets, and until they have money to create demand, all the supply in the world will not do any good.LiNeBrEaKROBBY CHAVEZLiNeBrEaKSouthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming warningLiNeBrEaKThe most current poll taken by Pew Research Center shows evidence that public concern about global warming is cooling.LiNeBrEaKThe public has placed it behind lobbyist influence and moral decay when ranking worries.

It would be good to hold his article in the context of the ways human ingenuity has worked with nature to speed the healing and restoration of our planet.LiNeBrEaKIn his book, "The Omnivore's Dilemma," Michael Pollan takes us through a high-intensity farming practice that uses crop and animal rotation to rebuild top soil at a far faster rate than simply leaving the earth "alone."LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, mycologist Paul Stamets uses mushroom compost in an intensive way to break down organic pollutants that otherwise persist in the environment for decades.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Make it warmer  		LETTERS; Pg. A12  	236 words  	Temperatures have remained below freezing for longer than I can remember. Whoever is in charge of global warming had better get on the stick. Perhaps the Global Warming Czar needs more power to raise outside air temperatures to a livable level. LiNeBrEaKCO2 is not a pollutant. CO2 is plant food. If we have a tax on energy, the money could be spent to make it warmer outside.LiNeBrEaKWith a new Department of Global Warming, at least the blame for cold temperatures can be properly assessed. Once power is given to a person and a bureaucracy, only then can progress toward a warmer climate be had.LiNeBrEaKCO2 is not a significant greenhouse gas. The main greenhouse gas, and true source of global warming or lack thereof, is water vapor. So to make it warmer or colder, we need to increase the water vapor in the air.LiNeBrEaKBut water vapor can reach saturation in the atmosphere, and precipitation in the form of a liquid or a solid, depending upon atmospheric temperature, can happen, sometimes over large areas and for lengthy periods. At 100 percent humidity, it will continue to precipitate out of the atmosphere, and then it will cancel any warming or cooling effect.LiNeBrEaKWe need a large, hot object in the sky to create water vapor over large areas. The new Global Warming Czar can be in charge of making sure we have a large, hot object in the sky. We will call him informally the Sun God. All hail Sun God. Make it warmer.LiNeBrEaKFRANK STEARNS Warrington Twp.

LiNeBrEaKLike gasoline and a gallon of milk, wins don't come cheaply in the City Series. Not this year, as rejuvenated Akron East is locked in what appears to be a season-long showdown with tested war-horses Buchtel and Kenmore.LiNeBrEaKBuchtel did its part Tuesday to keep the heat on the Orientals when it escaped Kenmore's Roy Cottle Memorial Gymnasium with a 70-67 victory, while East defeated Garfield, 73-70.LiNeBrEaKThe victories left East, ranked 15th in The Plain Dealer Top 25, and Buchtel, ranked 17th, tied at 7-1 with four games remaining. Kenmore fell to 6-2.LiNeBrEaKSomeone pass the nitro pills.LiNeBrEaKBuchtel, 10-2 overall, led most of the way and appeared to be on the verge of a runaway several times.LiNeBrEaKKenmore, 8-4 overall, overcame early tentativeness but was forced to climb uphill most of the night.LiNeBrEaKThe Cardinals eventually took the lead, 65-64, on a coast-to-coast steal and layup by freshman Antonio Hearn with 1: 52 left, but had nothing left in the tank down the stretch.LiNeBrEaKThe Griffins scored six of the game's final eight points to win, and a Kenmore desperation shot at the buzzer from about 47 feet by Charles Hearn - Antonio's older brother and his team's second-leading scorer with 17 points - hit the front of the rim and fell away.LiNeBrEaK"One more win and we're right back in it," said Kenmore coach Dan Freeman, whose team outscored the Griffins, 52-47, from the field but were done in at the free-throw line, where the Griffins made 23 of 30 shots to 15 of 22 for Kenmore.LiNeBrEaKBuchtel's trio of Steve Hargrove, Antonio Lovelace and T.J. Dent came through as Dent finished with 19 points and seven rebounds, Hargrove had 11 points and six rebounds and Lovelace came off the bench to provide strong floor play and six points, including two free throws that provided the final margin with three seconds left.LiNeBrEaKBut, it was the consistent performance of Dajon Lewis that won the game. Lewis, a 6-4 junior, had 20 points, 13 rebounds and three blocked shots.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	Ocean drilling review ordered;  Interior secretary moves to slow some late actions by Bush 		GENERAL; Pg. A-8  	379 words  	  Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said yesterday the expansion of offshore oil drilling should be worked out with Congress as part of a broad energy blueprint and not independent action by his department. LiNeBrEaK In an interview, Salazar indicated the Bush administration's drilling plan likely will be scrapped. It would open the entire Atlantic and Pacific coasts for drilling.LiNeBrEaK Salazar declined to single out any waters considered automatically off limits to oil exploration.LiNeBrEaK "There are places that are appropriate for exploration and development, and there are places that are not," Salazar said.LiNeBrEaK Salazar, who resigned a Senate seat from Colorado to join the Cabinet, said he wants to work closely with Congress on "a plan that makes sense" for offshore oil and gas development, but that any expansion of drilling should be part of a comprehensive energy plan.LiNeBrEaK Congress last year failed to renew the long-standing moratorium on oil and gas exploration across 85 percent of the nation's Outer Continental Shelf, leaving all waters potentially open to drilling. Congressional Republicans and energy lobbyists have argued against even a partial reimposition of an offshore-drilling ban.LiNeBrEaK Four days before leaving office, officials in the Bush administration issued a draft of a five-year drilling plan that calls for energy leases to be made available in both the Atlantic and Pacific waters.LiNeBrEaK Salazar indicated that plan is all but dead.LiNeBrEaK On other subjects, Salazar:LiNeBrEaK * Made clear that investigations into the gift and conflict-of-interest scandals at the Minerals Management Service is not yet resolved.LiNeBrEaK * Cautioned against pushing too fast on oil-shale development in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.LiNeBrEaK Oil-shale extraction requires a lot of water that could strain the resources of the Colorado River and huge amounts of electric power that could impact climate change, he said.LiNeBrEaK * Promised to review at least 10 last-minute actions by the Bush administration, citing as examples regulations to limit the reach of the Endangered Species Act, oil-shale permitting, and oil and gas permits issued near two national parks in Utah.LiNeBrEaK "I'm troubled by many of the midnight actions by the administration. We'll take a look at them one at a time and make the right decision going forward," Salazar said.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	SANDAG plans to spend $20,000 on 2-day retreat  	Steve Schmidt, STAFF WRITER  	LOCAL; Pg. B-1  	452 words  	Several dozen local government officials will check into a high-rise resort tomorrow for a two-day conference on the region's economic and development dilemmas.LiNeBrEaKThe annual San Diego Association of Governments' retreat will be at Harrah's Rincon Casino and Resort near Valley Center, at a cost of about $20,000. LiNeBrEaKSANDAG executives defended the expense, saying the overnight meetings serve as a springboard for long-range planning initiatives that help the entire county.LiNeBrEaK"We have a very intense, focused discussion that sets the agenda for the region," said Escondido Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler, chairwoman of the SANDAG board of directors.LiNeBrEaKBut Lani Lutar, president of the San Diego County Taxpayers Association, said staging a retreat during tough economic times "sends a wrong message to taxpayers. ... "LiNeBrEaKShe noted that many of the local cities that make up SANDAG are looking for ways to raise revenue and avoid deep cuts in services.LiNeBrEaKHeadquartered in downtown San Diego, SANDAG is charged with crafting long-range regional policies on transportation, growth, the environment and other issues.LiNeBrEaKAmong the topics the board plans to discuss at the public retreat: the state of the economy, transportation improvements and the need to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKSANDAG spokeswoman Colleen Windsor said the agency recently cut back the retreat from three days to two, reducing the overall price tag to an estimated $20,000.LiNeBrEaKShe said last year's agency retreat, held at a resort in Borrego Springs, cost $40,000.LiNeBrEaKAs part of this week's event, SANDAG expects to cover one night of lodgings for 54 people, including board members, board alternates and speakers. Harrah's is charging $96. 12 per hotel room.LiNeBrEaKHolt Pfeiler said she plans to stay overnight at the resort, even though she lives in nearby Escondido.LiNeBrEaKShe said the brainstorming that comes out of the marathon meeting is invaluable, noting that previous retreats have led, for example, to improved regional transportation plans.LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of the region's 18 cities and the county serve on the SANDAG board.LiNeBrEaKWindsor said SANDAG signed a contract in June for the event at the Harrah's resort, before the economy took a nose dive. She said if the agency canceled the event, it would lose a $10,000 deposit paid to Harrah's.LiNeBrEaKShe stressed that board members work on substantive issues at the retreat. "We're not in a Jacuzzi," Windsor said. "We're not getting in spa time."LiNeBrEaKLutar said she agrees there can be value in holding a retreat but believes SANDAG should scale the event back even more.LiNeBrEaKShe said her taxpayers group had planned to hold a overnight retreat last weekend but cut it back to one day because of money concerns.LiNeBrEaK"If we can do it, why can't government?" Lutar asked.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	The truth on AB 32;  GOP right to cite flaws that governor ignored 		OPINION; Pg. B-6  	289 words  	We strongly oppose some Republican lawmakers' apparent intention to go along with tax hikes in return for a weakening of rules adopted by the state Air Resources Board to force every last resident, business, church, charitable organization and nonprofit group to pay far higher energy bills in the name of fighting climate change. LiNeBrEaKWe don't like the rules. But given that California is in the middle of a deep recession, raising taxes is a rotten idea -- one sure to delay recovery. Even in good times, the case for tax hikes is nonexistent. The state has the highest sales, income and gas taxes and the highest corporate taxes in the West. We should be able to make ends meet.LiNeBrEaKThat said, we applaud Republicans for spotlighting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's and the air board's absurd insistence that implementing AB 32 -- the state's main anti-global warming law -- will actually help the economy.LiNeBrEaKDon't believe us. Believe the academic experts hired to review the air board's economic analysis of the law's effects. One, the director of Harvard's Environmental Economics Program, said the ARB analysis was so shoddy it threatened to undercut others' efforts to fight global warming. Two others said the analysis was more akin to cheerleading than science. Another said the study made no serious attempt to evaluate AB 32's impact on 1. 5 million California manufacturing jobs.LiNeBrEaKInexplicably, their critiques were all but ignored by the Sacramento press corps. Instead, pundits lined up to hail Schwarzenegger and the air board for making the state's pioneering efforts against climate change a shining example for the world.LiNeBrEaK"Shining" is not the word that comes to mind. "Dishonest" is more like it. Thanks to Republicans for pointing this out.

San Antonio Express-News 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   METRO Edition	Big changes with mass transit eyed  	Patrick Driscoll, STAFF  	METRO AND STATE NEWS; Pg. 1B  	366 words  	To compete in a world where oil price shocks and global warming could change the ground rules, San Antonio needs to become a place where people can get around easier without cars, says a report released Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKThough most people will continue to drive, acknowledges the report by a city-county task force formed last summer, the city should shift more funds to mass transit and build neighborhoods where people can walk to various destinations.LiNeBrEaKThe job laid out is daunting, notes the report, still in draft form. An overhaul of how the city plans public transit, roads and growth will be needed.LiNeBrEaK"In fact, it will require a transformational and cultural shift in our community values," the 17-page report states.LiNeBrEaKThe 12-member task force, appointed by Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff and Mayor Phil Hardberger, issued initial recommendations so local officials can engage federal and state lawmaking cycles under way and get in line for any transportation funds handed out.LiNeBrEaKAmong key actions advised:LiNeBrEaK* Build a better transit system, to include light rail and commuter rail.LiNeBrEaK* Ask voters to increase the sales tax for transportation. (***SEE CORRECTION***) San Antonio collects 3/4 cent for buses and roads, and just another 1/8 cent is up for grabs.LiNeBrEaK* Get a state bill passed to let San Antonio voters approve new taxes or fees, such as higher vehicle registration fees or a sales tax on fuel, to pay for transportation projects.LiNeBrEaK* Merge the city's transit and toll road agencies, which will require a change in state law.LiNeBrEaK"This is a bold move," task force Chairman Bill Thornton said of the recommendations as he presented them to Bexar County commissioners.LiNeBrEaK"Yeah, it is a bold move," Wolff replied.LiNeBrEaKStill missing is community buy-in. The task force plans to hold a public meeting next month to get input.LiNeBrEaKAfter that will come the gritty work of changing policies, plans and bureaucratic structures, and involving residents even more in the process.LiNeBrEaK"We've got to get in place a good, solid overall transportation plan that will include public transportation," Wolff said. "We are way, way behind in public transportation. That's going to become a really sore issue for this community 10, 20 years from now."

Santa Cruz Sentinel (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Energy efficiency worth the cost  	Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	519 words  	Jan. 28--As California goes, so goes the nation?LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama's order Monday to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for a reconsideration of the state's request to regulate auto emissions marks a sea change in how California's efforts to fight global warming are received. LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration had rejected efforts by California and 13 other states to control greenhouse gases coming out of car tailpipes -- a decision that angered Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has made combatting global warming a priority.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, the state approved a sweeping measure that required cars and light trucks sold in this state to emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaKOther states followed with similar measures, but automakers sued, arguing that CO2 emissions did not fall under the federal Clear Air Act. Courts ruled in favor of California's measure, but the state still needed to get permission from the EPA. The Bush administration refused to grant the state a waiver, however -- a decision Obama opposed and now has moved swiftly to reverse.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed restrictions would force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes 30 percent by 2016. Doing this could force them to boost the fuel efficiency in new vehicles to an average of 36. 8 miles per gallon.LiNeBrEaKCritics say Obama's move will only lead to a lengthy battle with industry over how to fight global warming. Some Republican leaders in CongressLiNeBrEaKsaid it would allow California to set fuel-efficiency standards for the rest of the country. California is the only state allowed under the federal Clean Air Act to set its own rules on auto emissions and fuel efficiency; other states, however, can adopt these standards.LiNeBrEaKCritics also say that adopting new standards comes at a bad time for domestic automakers, who have needed federal bailout money to stay solvent. The new standards, they say, will cause prices to go up and hit already recession-challenged consumers with even more pocketbook pain. Industry analysts say the added production costs would cost about $1,800 per vehicle. But, since the technology is already there, the new standards could mean more energy-efficient cars would be on sale as early as this year, say environmental leaders.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has been in the lead in seeking cleaner-burning, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The governor correctly sees California leading the way toward lowering the country's dependence on foreign oil while reducing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKWe also agree with the president, who said Monday he is not trying to crush an already reeling domestic auto industry, but helping it prepare for the future.LiNeBrEaKThat's a tradeoff worth the cost.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Senators receptive as Gore pushes for climate change legislation this year  	By Frank Davies Mercury News Washington Bureau  	BREAKING; Politics; News; National; Business  	689 words  	WASHINGTON   For Al Gore and Congress, two years and a presidential election make a big difference when it comes to tackling global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe bottom line: less theatrics, more substance and, well, a warmer reception. Even Republican senators seemed prepared to accept the aggressive course of action Gore proposed.LiNeBrEaKIn early 2007, Gore played the role of a fired-up prophet, determined to spur Congress to curb greenhouse gas emissions. GOP reaction ranged from respect to disparagement, with Trent Lott calling his notions "garbage," Larry Craig mocking Gore's Academy Award-winning "performance" and James Inhofe belittling the reality of climate change. LiNeBrEaKNot so on Wednesday. The former vice president and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee traded ideas and compliments and actually listened carefully to each other.LiNeBrEaKAnd Gore's essential message was well received, that despite economic woes, this is the year to enact mandatory limits on carbon emissions and reach a global climate agreement to reduce heat-trapping gases and slow down deforestation.LiNeBrEaK"I don't want to be chest-beating about it, but our country is the only country that can lead the world community" on climate change, Gore told the committee.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama this week reversed eight years of inaction on climate change by the Bush administration, ordering an increase in the fuel efficiency of vehicles and signaling that California and other states will be able to enforce tough emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKIn the Senate, Lott and Craig are gone, Inhofe is one of the few members who deny the consensus of climate science, and Democrats increased their majority to 58, or 59 if Al Franken of Minnesota is seated.LiNeBrEaKEven the weather jokes seemed lame this time. Two years ago, Gore testified during a snowstorm, and Inhofe wondered, "Where's global warming when you need it?" Washington experienced its first snow of the winter Tuesday, and the online Drudge Report was ready with a headline: "THE SNOW MUST GO ON: GORE BRAVES WINTER STORM TO TESTIFY ON GLOBAL WARMING."LiNeBrEaKBut this time, the accumulation of climate change data weighed on senators who want to see a renewed global effort to address the problem.LiNeBrEaKObama said he wants to revive U.S. leadership on climate change, heading into an international conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December designed to produce a successor treaty to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol that the United States turned against.LiNeBrEaKGore urged Congress to adopt the huge stimulus package as drawn up in the House, saying it will give renewable and alternative fuels a major boost and build a better electric "smart" grid. That would make it easier for Congress to pass a cap-and-trade bill, with a system for utilities and other companies that pollute less than the limit to trade or sell permits to those over the limit.LiNeBrEaKIf Congress does that, Gore said, "the United States will regain its credibility and enter the treaty talks with a renewed authority to lead the world."LiNeBrEaKOne Republican, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, said he expected a cap-and-trade bill to pass this year, although he favored a tax on carbon, as long as taxpayers are reimbursed through the payroll tax.LiNeBrEaKSen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said he wanted a strong climate treaty and praised Obama's inaugural speech for "restoring science to its rightful place in the operation of our government."LiNeBrEaKWhile Corker and other Republicans stressed the need for more nuclear energy to reduce reliance on oil and coal, Gore said nuclear energy could play a role, but the size and cost of new nuclear plants made him "skeptical" that enough private investment would be available.LiNeBrEaKThe former vice president highlighted his testimony with new slides and video clips   sort of a sequel to his Oscar-winning "An Inconvenient Truth"   showing the latest data and images on melting polar ice and other climate change indicators. He said the latest data showed the planet was "in grave danger."LiNeBrEaK"This is the one challenge that could completely end human civilization, and it's rushing at us with such speed and force," Gore warned.LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.

Spokesman-Review (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Avista rates face appeal: Attorney general targets increases that started Jan. 1  	John Stucke, The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	687 words  	Jan. 28--Washington's attorney general has appealed a sharp increase in Avista power bills and aims to unravel the company's plan to collect an extra $112&acirc;[#x20ac][#x201a]million from businesses and residential customers in Eastern Washington.LiNeBrEaK"We think it's important, especially during this economy, that there's not one extra penny taken from people's budgets," said Simon ffitch, chief of the Office of the Attorney General's Public Counsel Section, which represents Avista ratepayers. LiNeBrEaKThe appeal, ffitch said, focuses on the electricity and natural gas rates that went into effect Jan. 1. Over the course of this year Avista anticipates the rate increases will add $37. 3 million to its bottom line. In court records, ffitch argued that this year's rate increase should instead be about $28. 2 million.LiNeBrEaKFiled Tuesday, the appeal does not address a second and more costly rate request the company submitted Friday seeking an extra $74. 7 million next year. It is an initiative that, when coupled with current rate increases, would raise rates 18 percent over two years and help Avista achieve an 11 percent profit margin from its regulated utility operations. And it comes at a time, ffitch said, when businesses are pinched and shedding workers.LiNeBrEaKAvista has acknowledged that its years of rate increases are difficult for customers. The company says it has been upgrading turbines and other equipment at its dams that continue to deliver relatively cheap electricity without emitting greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.LiNeBrEaKYet ffitch said the rate increases have been battering customers. His appeal in Thurston County Superior Court alleges that the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission erred last month when it green-lighted the higher Avista rates.LiNeBrEaKHe said the commission wrongly allows Avista to charge its ratepayers for company expenses such as advertising and charitable donations.LiNeBrEaKThe most serious issue, however, centers on approval of Avista's plan to have ratepayers shoulder the past costs of using Lake Coeur d'Alene as a storage vessel for its run of dams on the Spokane River.LiNeBrEaKIn the appeal, ffitch argues that Avista cannot charge what in essence amounts to decades of retroactive trespassing charges. Those fees &acirc;[#x20ac]"about $39 million -- are reflected in Avista's new rate request.LiNeBrEaKAvista late last year agreed to pay as much as $168 million over the next half-century to compensate the Coeur d'Alene Tribe for storing water for hydropower generation on the tribe's submerged land in Lake Coeur d'Alene.The storage allows Avista to regulate the flow of water through the utility's six Spokane River dams.LiNeBrEaKThe appeal does not take issue with Avista attempting to recover the future costs of using Lake Coeur d'Alene water.LiNeBrEaK"There's legal doctrine that says the company can't go back and assess those past charges on current and future ratepayers," he said.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, ffitch wrote in the appeal that the rate increases were agreed to before expert testimony was filed with the commission.LiNeBrEaKAvista disagrees.LiNeBrEaK"We believe the WUTC approval of our settlement agreement was well-founded in evidence, was based on sound reasoning and is in accordance with the law," Avista spokeswoman Debbie Simock said.LiNeBrEaKNormally Avista, the WUTC staff, the Attorney General's Office and other interested parties reach a settlement that satisfies the company's need for more money but also provides protections for ratepayers. Appeals are rare, and ffitch said this is the first regarding Avista he can recall.LiNeBrEaKIf a judge grants the appeal, the rate case could be remanded to the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission for further consideration, or Avista could be ordered to issue refunds.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   SECOND EDITION	The first 100 days: Repower, refuel and rebuild America  	By Gary Steps  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B9  	750 words  	Many people say that President Barack Obama has one of the toughest jobs any incoming president has had in recent history. Americans are facing a drawn-out economic recession. We rely too much on oil for our energy needs. And we know that we have to do something about global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut these problems are not insurmountable. We can repower, refuel and rebuild America, and in doing so cut our oil dependence, make our electric supply 100 percent clean and create millions of new jobs, especially in construction and manufacturing. There are many signs that Americans would support a clean-energy agenda. According to a recent Zogby International post-election poll, a majority of U.S. voters agree that clean-energy initiatives are important to helping the economy. LiNeBrEaKHow can we do all this? Within the first 100 days of the administration, the president should work with Congress to release a plan that would get America's economy moving again, building a clean-energy future that will free us from dependence on oil, create new industries and jobs, lower energy prices and cut the pollution that contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThis package should move America toward generating 100 percent clean electricity through the expansion of renewable energy and by reducing electricity demand through energy-efficient buildings and appliances. It should cut our dependence on oil by significantly improving vehicle efficiency and using alternative power sources (electric, fuel cell, methane, etc.) to power our cars and by investing in smart public transportation.LiNeBrEaKThis plan also should reduce global warming pollution by at least 80 percent by setting a firm national limit on pollution with an accompanying market that rewards smart companies for real reductions. This "cap and trade" system could generate trillions of dollars in funds to invest in clean-energy technology, energy efficiency, efficient vehicles and cleaner burning fuels and create jobs at home, allowing Mr. Obama to follow through on his promise to create 5 million new green jobs.LiNeBrEaKBy making a national $100 billion investment in clean-energy technologies - an amount comparable to the size of the April 2008 federal stimulus package dedicated to consumer rebates - we could create 43,000 jobs in Missouri alone, according to a recent study by the University of Massachusetts Political and Economic Research Institute.LiNeBrEaKMissouri has enormous clean-energy resources that could be harnessed for energy production, including geothermal, solar and biomass. Not only could Missouri benefit from using clean energy such as geothermal and solar, but because such a large portion of Missouri's labor force is employed in manufacturing, we also could benefit greatly from manufacturing jobs for clean technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal equipment and insulation for energy-efficient retrofits that could be marketed around the country and around the world.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, a series of multinational companies, energy utilities, non-profit groups and energy-intensive companies came out publicly last year in support of cap-and-trade legislation under a coalition called the United States Climate Action Partnership. For these members, including GE, John Deere, DuPont and Dow Chemical, climate legislation represents an opportunity to expand an emerging market for the clean-energy economy.LiNeBrEaKOrganizations such as the Apollo Alliance are calling for investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, technology and the American people to reinvent our society in a sustainable way. The Apollo Alliance has strong support from environmental groups, renewable-energy companies, political organizations, labor unions and green building groups. LiNeBrEaKIt is time to turn challenges into an opportunity to repower, refuel and rebuild America. But we can't put responsibility for fixing all our problems on Barack Obama. He encouraged voters to believe that as a nation, we can rise together to meet the challenges we face. We can prove that he was - and we were - right in this. We can show that we have the mettle to solve our most demanding problems. We can do all this by talking to friends, neighbors and, most of all, our congressional representatives about how we can beat our economic, energy and global warming problems as a whole and come out the better for it.LiNeBrEaKWe need to move to a sustainable economy. The time to begin is now.LiNeBrEaKGary Steps is founder and president of Butterfly Energy Works, an energy consulting firm in Webster Groves.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Clashing over California cars JERSEY BLOGS  	KELLY HEYBOER, STAR-LEDGER STAFF  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 015  	893 words  	When New Jersey and at least a dozen other states went to the federal government and proposed setting tougher auto emissions standards within their borders, then-President Bush rejected the idea without much discussion.LiNeBrEaKBut a new president means once-dead ideas are getting a new life.LiNeBrEaKIn one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine the issue earlier this week. LiNeBrEaKUnder the plan, several states-- including California, New Jersey and New York-- would impose tough new car emission standards to cut down on greenhouse gases within their borders. The new rules would pressure automakers to make more fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups praised Obama's decision as long overdue.LiNeBrEaKBut critics, including many bloggers, worried what the rule changes might mean. Will allowing each state to set its own rules result in chaos? Will gas-guzzling cars be banned in some states, but legal in others? Can the floundering Detroit automakers afford to make big changes?LiNeBrEaKFrom Robert Farago, blogging at The Truth About Cars (thetruthaboutcars.com):LiNeBrEaKThere's no way automakers selling cars in America can meet the California mob's higher, fleet-wide fuel economy standards within the deadline without chopping low-mileage models from their lineup within the relevant states . . .LiNeBrEaKHas anyone looked at the U.S. new car market recently? Who's got money for that? . . . And who's going to pay cash money to buy these newfangled fuel misers? What if these wonderful machines don't sell?LiNeBrEaKAll of which highlights the small matter of what "we" (i.e. taxpayers) are going to do about GM and Chrysler, currently (and for the foreseeable future) sucking on Uncle Sam's teat.LiNeBrEaKWhile the Department of Energy is preparing to dole out dole worth $25 billion for retooling "loans" to build these more left-coast compliant vehicles, this turn of events suggests that Uncle Sam will be on the hook for even more money for GM and ChryCo. Hey, you want us to build way cool fuel efficient vehicles? You gotta pay. I mean, loan.LiNeBrEaKI understand the rationale behind California's zeal and President Obama's support. But there's no doubt that they've just invoked the law of unintended consequences. Though politically toxic, a gas tax hike would have been a far more effective solution. As we shall soon see.LiNeBrEaKFrom Pompey Road, commenting at Grist:LiNeBrEaKI think if you look at what Mr. Obama is doing as opposed to what he is saying you will learn a lot about his methodology handling most all issues. He said he is kicking the California request back to the EPA for review and will decide according to their recommendation. In other words he will let the science and EPA make the decision instead of just making an executive order out of hand . . .LiNeBrEaKThis would still be a refreshing decision making process compared to the brain freeze we had to endure the last eight years.LiNeBrEaKFrom PatriotsVoice, commenting at Politico:LiNeBrEaKThis is the most stupid idea yet from Obama. He wants the states to set their own emissions standards, so that means that the Big Three auto makers will have to run separate assembly lines for every emission standard. Is this the way Obama will govern, throw money at the problem as a solution and then put more obstacles in the way that will cost more money thus increasing the price of a car?LiNeBrEaKIn his first week, he has shown that he is not a centrist but a Marxist, pure and simple! Do you Democrats really want him to make cars more expensive? Do some research, and not just the liberal Democrat sites. Global warming is not here, it is a hoax, it is meant to get into your pocketbook! Do you really have the money to afford this lunacy?LiNeBrEaKFrom Orrin Judd, blogging at Brothers Judd Blog:LiNeBrEaKThe genius of this is that the California market is so big that companies have to conform to its standards. And California will pass tougher environmental laws than you could ever get through Congress.LiNeBrEaKFrom Edward T. Hightower, blogging at Auto Sensei:LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush rejected the 12 states' proposal citing that the resulting "patchwork" of requirements would require additional costs for both the manufactures and the government. President Bush was right.LiNeBrEaKA uniform set of standards for all states is a more efficient form of regulation. Meeting these emissions regulations requires specific vehicle design/ engineering solutions affecting the vehicle's engine, fuel system and exhaust system hardware and electronic control systems hardware and software . . .LiNeBrEaKHave we moved so far from being a nation that "makes things" that we cannot understand the simple logic behind this? Part of the reason that the European Union was formed was to eliminate some of the inefficiencies that were caused by varying regulations across the borders of neighboring countries.LiNeBrEaKFrom Dave, commenting at Oliver Willis:LiNeBrEaKI completely agree that states should have the right to set their own emission standards. And that American car makers should be expected to start increasing fuel standards.LiNeBrEaKI just think this is pretty poor timing on the Obama administration's part. Two of the Big Three car companies are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy (and the third isn't all that stable either) and instead of a life preserver, Obama just threw them an anchor.LiNeBrEaKRead other Jersey Blogs columns.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday 	Rub&eacute;n Rosario: Gambling seems to be on the rise as the economy continues to falter  	By Rub&eacute;n Rosario  	RUBEN ROSARIO; Local; Columnists  	679 words  	This comes straight from the weekly gambling police blotter -- a cautionary tip sheet:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAn unemployed St. Paul man with power of attorney is charged with blowing his severely mentally ill sister's life savings to sustain an apparent gambling addiction. The woman, who lives in an assisted-living facility, had assets of $293,561 in 2006. That nest egg was sucked down to $5 this past August, when the law discovered the alleged crime. The man, according to authorities, also went through his own six-figure inheritance. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKA 48-year-old man pleaded guilty to stealing more than $43,000 from the Burnsville Athletic Club, reportedly to support a compulsive gambling problem. To his credit, the man has paid back the money in restitution. But the public trust is not so easily compensated. LiNeBrEaKDo a Google search and you will find similar cases that broke nationally this week. Same old, same old. Folks have been committing crimes and nurturing self-destructive be-havior to support gambling ills since history began. If only the problem were individual. No more. The more civilized a society, the more we pay for the sins of others, directly or indirectly.LiNeBrEaKWhich brings me to a question: Is the recession fueling a significant uptick in not only gambling-related crimes but also problem gambling in general?LiNeBrEaKLike global warming, it's subject to debate. My gut feeling, like ET's finger, is glowing red hot with the troubling premonition that we will be seeing more of these cases popping up on criminal court dockets and in calls to gambling hotlines.LiNeBrEaKFactor this: Calls to the National Council on Problem Gambling have gone up by 12,000 in each of the past four years.LiNeBrEaK"So far, we are seeing the same pattern in 2009,'' said Keith Whyte, the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit's executive director. He cautioned, though, "There are lots of factors that go into national calls."LiNeBrEaKSo true. We Americans really don't want to rush to judgment unless we have proof. Much of it right now is anecdotal. Many feel it's a mixed bagLiNeBrEaKIn terms of a recession-related spike in such crimes, I offer the take of Mike Freeman, Hennepin County's chief crime prosecutor:LiNeBrEaK"No noticeable uptick yet,'' Freeman informed me. "But our cases usually are 3 to 6 months behind most trends. We usually only see what the cops bring in."LiNeBrEaKAdded James Backstrom, Freeman's counterpart in Dakota County: "While I anticipate we may be seeing an upturn in theft crimes due to the recession we are currently in, this has not been occurring yet. Obviously, we hope it won't, but stressful times often lead to more crime, both domestic-related and financial-related."LiNeBrEaKCrime alone doesn't adequately reflect what is often called the "hidden addiction." It's mostly a moral flaw that rarely sees a courtroom.LiNeBrEaKSo I also value the insights folks like Lynn Rambeck. The Edina-based clinical psychologist is a consultant on problem gambling.LiNeBrEaK"It's happening already,'' Rambeck said of the increase he has seen in recession-affected clients. LiNeBrEaK"There are many things in society where the more you work at it or practice it, the more successful you will be," he added. "Gambling is the exception. No matter how much you study or practice it, you will still lose most often. It's still a sucker's bet all around.''LiNeBrEaKOrrin Tiez, administrative director for Club Recovery, a Twin Cities-based gambling addiction treatment center, said it's too early to link the economic downturn to the club's caseload.LiNeBrEaK"We believe we have more people coming in for help this year, and we can speculate that has to do with the economy, but we don't know,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKBut he points to a troubling new wrinkle in his field -- folks gambling their unemployment checks.LiNeBrEaK"These are heartbreaking stories about people losing what little they had,'' Tiez said this week.LiNeBrEaKGambling -- state sponsored or otherwise -- is a fool's quest, in good times and bad.LiNeBrEaKFOR HELPLiNeBrEaKIf you have a gambling-related problem, call the Minnesota hot line, 800-333-HOPE, for help or referrals. If you contact Rub&eacute;n Rosario at rrosario@pioneerpress.com or 651-228-5454, he will do his best to get you help.

USA TODAY 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Chrysler-Fiat deal a slap in the face  		NEWS; Pg. 10A  	492 words  	Chrysler has slapped the face of every American taxpayer by agreeing to give Italian automaker Fiat a 35% share of the company, and possibly up to a 55% share ("Chrysler turns to Fiat for strength," Money, Jan. 21). LiNeBrEaKAfter U.S. taxpayers kicked in $5. 5 billion to bail out Chrysler, Fiat now walks in and gets a 35% share, and possibly even a majority share, for no cash.LiNeBrEaKAs a hardworking American taxpayer, I am appalled that Chrysler would have the audacity to ask for a tax-financed bailout and then form an alliance with a foreign automaker that could result in foreign control.LiNeBrEaKThis is one of the reasons that this country is in an economic mess. Rather than remaining an industrial, manufacturing and technology giant, the United States is selling itself to foreign shareholders.LiNeBrEaKWell, the time has come for taxpayer relief to end. Either the automakers survive on their own, or they go the way of the prehistoric mastodon.LiNeBrEaKRandall W. KlotzLiNeBrEaKGermantown, OhioLiNeBrEaKProbe pupil's deathLiNeBrEaKI  would like to comment on the sad (and senseless) death of the football player at Pleasure Ridge Park High School ("Coach indicted in teen's death at practice," Sports, Friday).LiNeBrEaKI served as a Marine Corps drill instructor 30 years ago training American youth for war.LiNeBrEaKParris Island, S.C., is known for its harsh tropical climate. After losing recruits to the summer heat and humidity, Marine Corps brass called in sports physicians and other experts to see what could be done to reduce heat casualties. They found that you cannot train the human body to go with less water.LiNeBrEaKPhysical training was moved to the early morning hours, and medical corpsmen were in place with the authority to modify activities to fit the weather conditions. Most important, abundant water was provided before and during training.LiNeBrEaKThe NFL and NCAA have rules and policies in place, based on the same scientific information available for decades.LiNeBrEaKThe investigation should go beyond the coach.

Bush's actions on science policy ("The scientific climate is changing," Cover story, Life, Jan. 19).LiNeBrEaKThis misrepresentation is an example of an article discussing difficult issues in simplistic, partisan terms. The important question is not about whether a president is pro- or anti-science. It is about the impossibility of separating science from politics when issues are both complex and controversial.LiNeBrEaKThe illusion that such a separation is possible allows politicians and scientists of both parties to hide behind scientific statements when advancing political agendas. The result is bad for science and democracy.LiNeBrEaKThis was the substance of my comments that were excluded from the article.LiNeBrEaKDaniel SarewitzLiNeBrEaKProfessor of science and societyLiNeBrEaKArizona State University 	AUTOMOBILE MFG (91%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); BAILOUTS (90%); POLITICS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); SPORTS (87%); AMERICAN FOOTBALL (87%); SCIENCE NEWS (85%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (85%); TAX RELIEF (78%); SCIENCE POLICY (74%); SHAREHOLDERS (73%); EXERCISE and FITNESS (72%); SPORTS and RECREATION (71%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY SPORTS (71%); SPORTS MEDICINE (71%); FOREIGN INVESTMENT (70%); CLIMATOLOGY (69%); CLIMATE CHANGE (69%); PHYSICIANS and SURGEONS (67%); INDICTMENTS (66%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (50%); HIGH SCHOOLS (72%) LETTERS; OPINION  	FIAT SPA (94%); CHRYSLER LLC (93%)  	NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (94%); SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES and PASSENGER CAR BODIES (94%); SIC3523 FARM MACHINERY and EQUIPMENT (94%)  	OHIO, USA (92%); SOUTH CAROLINA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		NEWSPAPER  		2009 Gannett Company, Inc.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	283 words  	Jan. 28--RICHMOND -- Robert Howlett had no idea how inefficient his century-old home was before a he had it weatherized.LiNeBrEaKThings were so bad -- broken windows, leaking air conditioners, exposed door frames, a leaking gas line -- that Howlett said he paid more than $800 a month last winter for heating fuel. LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, Howlett spoke before a Senate Commerce and Labor subcommitee in favor of wide-ranging legislation to improve energy efficiency throughout the state. The bill, SB1447, sponsored by Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Richmond, pushes recommendations from the Governor's Commission on Climate Change, such as requiring electric utilities to reduce energy consumption 19 percent by 2025.LiNeBrEaKThe legislation would ask utilities to establish energy efficiency programs to help residents weatherize their homes, said Sarah Rispin, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. Surcharges would help pay for the initiative, but the cost would be less than those for a new coal power plant, she said.LiNeBrEaKHowlett had his home weatherized by ElderHomes, a nonprofit that helps elderly, low-income and disabled residents. This winter his oil supply still has yet to run low, he said.LiNeBrEaK"It was just a blessing," he said. "Some of the things that they did I couldn't believe."

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition			LOCAL; Pg. B9  	479 words  	PTSD sufferersLiNeBrEaKThe Pentagon's decision not to award the Purple Heart to troops who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was a tough call -- but the right one. Now the federal government should follow up that good call with another one: making sure that troops who suffer with PTSD get the support and help they need. LiNeBrEaKThis won't be easy because many with PTSD, an anxiety disorder caused by experiencing traumatic events, are reluctant to seek treatment. It is this stigma, in fact, that led the Pentagon to consider awarding the Purple Heart to PTSD sufferers in the first place.LiNeBrEaK-- Miami HeraldLiNeBrEaKRPV resignationLiNeBrEaKNorm at Tertium Quids reports "Trouble at RPV" ... the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that Harrisonburg businessman Walter Curt had resigned as the Republican Party of Virginia's top fundraiser:LiNeBrEaK"Curt says in a letter to Chairman Jeffrey M. Frederick that he is leaving his voluntary post as finance chairman because the party is in bad shape and has defied efforts to fix it."LiNeBrEaK-- swacgirl.blogspot.comLiNeBrEaKClimate changeLiNeBrEaKIn one dramatic stroke, President Obama has removed any doubts that he intends to break sharply from President George W. Bush's policies on yet another vital issue -- this time repudiating Bush's passive approach to climate change. At a news conference Monday, Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to consider immediately California's application to set its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks. Bush had rejected that application.LiNeBrEaKOnce California receives permission to move ahead -- as it surely will -- 13 states, and possibly more, are expected to impose similar rules. The result will be to force automakers here and overseas to begin producing cars and trucks that are considerably more fuel efficient than today's models and on a faster timetable.LiNeBrEaK-- The New York TimesLiNeBrEaKInterrogationsLiNeBrEaKIronically, President Obama's executive order ... protecting terrorist suspects from water&shy;boarding -- the practice of making someone fearful he is about to drown in an effort to induce him to cooperate with interrogators -- will spare foreign cutthroats from the very practice that the U.S. military has used on its own men thousands of times as a way of training for deployments in war zones when they might be captured and subjected to such things as water&shy;boarding.LiNeBrEaKThe practice, still in use by trainers, dates back at least as far as ... the Vietnam War, when Navy pilots, SEALs, and certain others whose missions in Vietnam made them susceptible to capture were waterboarded during harsh training in the California desert, according to one retired Navy commander we talked with.LiNeBrEaK-- The Washington TimesLiNeBrEaKPlague hits terroristsLiNeBrEaKBlack Death -- the plague -- swept through a terrorist training camp in Algeria, killing at least 40 members of an al-Qaida-linked terrorist group, the -- St. Louis Post-Dispatch	MENTAL ILLNESS (91%); POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (91%); ANXIETY DISORDERS (90%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (89%); ARMED FORCES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (87%); TERRORISM (85%); WAR and CONFLICT (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); NAVIES (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (77%); FUNDRAISING (76%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (71%); US PRESIDENTS (71%); MOTOR VEHICLES (69%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (69%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (69%); AUTOMAKERS (69%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (66%); TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (66%); EMISSIONS (64%); VIETNAM WAR (64%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (64%)  			CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); VIRGINIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (93%); VIETNAM (90%); ALGERIA (79%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Landmark Communications, Inc.

The Washington Times 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday 		By John McCaslin, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; INSIDE THE BELTWAY; A09  	557 words  	BAILING SODLiNeBrEaKRepublican lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been complaining all week - including in person to President Obama on Tuesday - about the Democratic leadership's proposed trillion-dollar economic bailout package, including one notion of funding contraceptives, regardless of a taxpayers' position on birth control.LiNeBrEaKThat said, House Republicans have sent Inside the Beltway a grievance list of questionable funding projects contained in the proposed legislation, including the following eye-openers: $650 million for digital-TV coupons, $600 million for a new car fleet for Uncle Sam, $44 million to renovate the Agriculture Department's headquarters, and $21 million to replace sod on the Mall, which was heavily damaged during Mr. Obama's inauguration. LiNeBrEaK(At least with these earmarks, unlike the rest of the proposed package, Congress would know for certain where the money was going).LiNeBrEaKCODE FOR DUMMIESLiNeBrEaKThe Libertarian Party says it takes him at his word and now Capitol Hill lawmakers should follow suit by giving every taxpayer a "Tim Geithner tax break" by simplifying the Internal Revenue Code.LiNeBrEaK"Congress should make sure what happened to Mr. Geithner, a finance professional, won't continue to happen to millions of average folks," says Libertarian National Committee chairman Bill Redpath. "If the man running the IRS can't understand the tax code with a computer helping him, how can the average taxpayer hope to do his taxes without breaking the law?"LiNeBrEaKMr. Geithner, anointed Treasury secretary this week by a forgiving Congress, claimed an honest error had caused him not to pay certain required taxes.LiNeBrEaKDOUBLE MIRACLELiNeBrEaK"A California man - mom! Not a man!"LiNeBrEaK- CNN Headline News anchor Chuck Roberts, who couldn't help but chuckle at his slip-of-the-tongue when announcing Tuesday that a woman on the West Coast had given birth to an astonishing eight babies, only the world's second live-born set of octuplets.LiNeBrEaKGORE HANDBOOKLiNeBrEaKFormer NASA scientist Roy W. Spencer has just posted on his Web site a list of Al Gore's "Ten Propaganda Techniques" he says are used by the former vice president's network of "global-warming alarmists" who insult and attack "anyone who might disagree with them."LiNeBrEaKAmong the techniques: "Appeal to Fear: Appeals to fear seek to build support by instilling anxieties and panic in the general population: 'I want to testify today about what I believe is a planetary emergency - a crisis that threatens the survival of our civilization and the habitability of the Earth.' (Mr. Gore's testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, March 21, 2007)."LiNeBrEaKMr. Gore is set to testify today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - "if the cold and snowy weather doesn't cause them to reschedule," Mr. Spencer, a climatologist, noted Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKWAKE-UP CALLLiNeBrEaKMSNBC "Hardball" host Chris Matthews will be keynote speaker at the 2009 Diabetes Forum March 3-4 at Washington's Mandarin Oriental Hotel.LiNeBrEaKA Type 2 diabetic, Mr. Matthews just over a year ago told the American Diabetes Association (ADA) magazine Diabetes Forecast that he was "basically ignoring" his condition until "big" meals and lack of exercise caught up with the popular TV host and landed him in the hospital.LiNeBrEaKHe quickly took control of his health and lost 30 pounds.

B06  	385 words  	 Leslie Curry Geographer LiNeBrEaKLeslie Curry, 86, a theoretical geographer who won a prestigious international medal for his life's work, died of lymphoma Jan. 12 at his home in Annapolis.LiNeBrEaKDr. Curry received the International Geographical Union's Laureat d'Honneur in 2000, which is given once every four years. LiNeBrEaKThe award said his "theoretical studies in economic geography, especially studies that draw upon the mathematics of probability theory and the concepts of physical systems analysis, have been unmatched in their originality and rigor and have established his international reputation as one of the leading theoreticians in the discipline."LiNeBrEaKHis work early on showed that natural climatic change could occur as the result of random exchanges of heat in the oceans. Another paper treated "central places" -- the number, size and location of human settlements in an urban system -- in terms of inventory management and randomness.LiNeBrEaKHe was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, and at the age of 18, he volunteered for the Royal Navy during World War II. He served as a radar mechanic in a destroyer flotilla in the Mediterranean and later  took part in the Normandy invasion.LiNeBrEaKDr. Curry graduated from Kings College at the University of Durham in 1949.

The Washington Post 		January 28, 2009 Wednesday   Regional Edition	Agent of (Climate) Change;  President Obama ends White House inaction -- but there's a better way to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A14  	430 words  	PRESIDENT OBAMA this week made an initial break from the frustrating inaction of President Bush on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. This reflected a welcome change in attitude at the White House. Unfortunately, the regulatory action that Mr. Obama set in motion is not the best, or even the second-best, approach to curbing climate change. It risks creating conflicting standards across the country and further stressing the domestic auto industry while accomplishing less than could be achieved with a simple tax increase on gasoline. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama took two steps. He ordered the Transportation Department to issue interim fuel-efficiency targets for automakers to meet by the 2012 model year. This is a step toward achieving a national fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, as mandated by the 2007 energy law.LiNeBrEaKHe also told the Environmental Protection Agency to review a request from California to grant it a waiver to implement its stringent tailpipe emissions law. The District of Columbia, Maryland and 12 other states have adopted the California standard. Six others are considering adopting it. Together they account for more than 45 percent of the sales of new vehicles in the United States. The goal is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks in participating states by 30 percent by 2016. The Bush EPA rejected the waiver request, despite support for it from EPA scientists and lawyers, in part because a "patchwork" of standards among states would be unwieldy and costly to industry.LiNeBrEaKIt is a relief that talk of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is giving way to action. But there is a more effective way to reduce such emissions than to order Detroit to start making cars that people may not want to buy, or to let states issue such orders. The answer is to change the incentives so that people  want to buy fuel-efficient vehicles; then companies will make such cars, even without commands from Washington. We saw this principle in action last summer when gas prices rose; rail ridership and small-car purchases also increased, while SUVs went begging on dealers' lots.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama and Congress could impose a gradual rise in fuel prices that would not shock the system. To avoid an anti-stimulatory effect, they could rebate the proceeds to taxpayers. Yet the action would send a crucial signal to automakers, auto buyers and investors in alternative energy. And that would establish what the nation and its auto industry ultimately need: a robust market for cars and trucks that reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and protect the environment.

Akron Beacon Journal (Ohio)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Friend of science  	The Akron Beacon Journal, Ohio  	COMMENTARY  	432 words  	Jan. 27--President Obama spent a significant share of his inaugural address breaking with the past, and rightly so. Few of those departures were more welcome than his declaration: "We will restore science to its rightful place." Too often George W. Bush and his aides seemed to view scientists as just another political interest group, merely angling for public dollars, looking to advance a narrow agenda. LiNeBrEaKThat isn't a rightful place for science. The country would be fortunate if all federal programs faced as rigorous oversight as provided by the scientific method. Put another way, science is the realm of observation and verification, the constant testing of ideas against actual facts. In that way, sound science isn't about beliefs and opinion. The independence and concreteness of research should translate into clout with politicians and policymakers.LiNeBrEaKNo less than 20 Nobel laureates joined 40 other prominent scientists in 2004 arguing that the Bush team distorted scientific findings to push its partisan objectives in such areas as the environment and biomedical research. Recently, the inspector general at the Interior Department found that Bush officials interfered with research regarding endangered species. In another instance, officials showed undue skepticism about work involving climate change.LiNeBrEaKNo wonder the scientific community applauded those eight words of Obama. The research is hard enough without having to battle misdirected presidential headwinds. Many scientists applauded the change in tone and, more, the recognition that science has much to contribute toward improving the economy and the quality of life.LiNeBrEaKThe expectation is that Obama soon will lift his predecessor's restrictions on the federal role in embryonic stem-cell research, looking to explore fully the potential for life-changing therapies. When scientists report, as they did recently, progress in understanding the overall warming of the Antarctic, the thinking is that Obama won't use the moment to highlight scientific uncertainties. Rather, the work will be appropriately framed, as solid and valuable information to help the country make the right choices about its future.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Val Kilmer Watch (Oh, No, Not Again!): The New Mexico rancher/actor who may want to be your governor is everywhere these days.  	Bruce Daniels, Albuquerque Journal, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	535 words  	Jan. 27--We vowed never to write another word about Val Kilmer ... at least until the northern New Mexico landed gentleman who happens to be a movie actor formally filed for his rumored run for governor in 2010.LiNeBrEaKBut an item in this morning's New Mexico Politics with Joe Monahan saying supporters of presumed 2010 front-runner Lt. Gov. Diane Denish are no longer amused by the Kilmer rumors made us break our self-imposed news blackout. LiNeBrEaKMonahan links to a Boston Globe gossip item on Kilmer's appearance at Arianna Huffington's pre-inauguration party last week, in which the one-time screen Batman -- looking uncomfortable in his tux -- allows as how he just might run for New Mexico's top spot.LiNeBrEaK"There are a lot of actors who become politicians," said Kilmer, who cited Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger as examples. "And they always win, so I guess we'll see."LiNeBrEaKThat, according to Monahan, was too much for former Gallup Mayor and Denish supporter Bob Rosebrough, who unloaded on Kilmer:LiNeBrEaKWe are in tough times that call for real leadership. Kilmer is the antithesis of what we need...Kilmer appears to be a privileged, pampered celebrity. We can't relate to him and we don't sense that he has any idea how to get us through hard times. His flirtations with elected office don't seem real or genuine. They simply appear to be self indulgent. I'm not sure if there ever will be a right time for Kilmer to run for Governor, but this sure isn't the time. We don't need celebrity right now. We need some homegrown backbone and resolve.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, according to a stack of electronic clippings we've been filing away for a rainy day, the man who just won't go away appears to be popping up everywhere.LiNeBrEaKA Web site called Galatta Cinema: The Complete South Indian Movie Magazine reported this week on Val's gubernatorial ambitions, saying he "is running for office as New Mexico's next governor" -- apparently no doubt about it in Bollywood South. (Incidentally, it's a Web site you can read in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Hindi, Bhojpuri, as well as English.)LiNeBrEaKAnd you can see Kilmer in an upcoming global warming horror thriller set in the Canadian Arctic called "The Thaw," in which our Val plays a world-renowned expert in climate change who with his students discover the frozen carcass of a woolly mammoth, the temperature starts to rise and ... oops! ... you can guess the rest. (Especially if you've seen "The Thing" in its various incarnations or any of George Romero's creepy-crawlies.) Here's the trailer from Filmstalker.LiNeBrEaK"The Thaw," which is still listed as being in production and doesn't have a release date, was filmed in British Columbia -- but not New Mexico! Lack of Arctic landscapes in the Land of Enchantment aside, how's he going to explain that to the voters?

Al-Assaf said the forum is being held at a time when the world's economy is in crisis, adding that the banking system is a core element of competitiveness. LiNeBrEaKThe forum began on Sunday and was inaugurated by Municipal and Rural Affairs Minister Prince Miteb on behalf of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah on Sunday.LiNeBrEaKThe conference's technical session yesterday was addressed by Jean Pascal Tricoire, chief executive officer of Scheneider Electric Company, an energy management company with branches across the world including Saudi Arabia.LiNeBrEaKTricoire said the world is facing several challenges such as global warming, and that there is a dire need for clean energy. "The best way to provide clean energy is to save energy which would eventually help achieve the purpose," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe added that 40 percent of emissions come from buildings such as offices, homes and factories, and that switching over to electric cars is not going to solve the problem of saving energy. "What we need at the moment is environment friendly energy," he said.LiNeBrEaKMark Fuller, chairman of the board of directors of Monitor Company, said that with the change of times, the stress has been shifted from money to human capital and technology. He also noted that there should be a package of incentives from governments to overcome financial crises. "Infrastructure development should include both large and medium size enterprises," he said.LiNeBrEaKWillhelm Bender, chairman of Fraport, a company specializing in developing airports, said, "We have contributed a great deal to develop the Frankfurt Airport and we are interested in taking part in the development of the Kingdom's airports too."

Bangor Daily News (Maine)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Emissions rules get champion  	Kevin Miller, Bangor Daily News, Maine  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	792 words  	Jan. 27--President Obama ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Monday to re-examine a controversial decision that blocked California and other states, including Maine, from enacting the nation's stiffest regulations on car emissions.LiNeBrEaKCritics had accused EPA's senior leadership of ignoring staff scientists and instead bowing to political pressure from the Bush administration by preventing California from requiring car manufacturers to go beyond federal emissions standards. LiNeBrEaKMore than a dozen other states, including Maine, have moved to adopt identical standards in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKIn a rebuke of the Bush administration, Obama said Washington would no longer stand in the way of states.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said. He added: "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKMaine officials on both sides of the political aisle welcomed Obama's directive, even if it does not guarantee that the EPA will grant California a waiver.LiNeBrEaKDavid Littell, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, said requiring that manufacturers sell cleaner, less-polluting cars is good for both consumers and the environment. Littell dismissed statements that the requirements would be onerous or excessively costly to carmakers.LiNeBrEaK"If [EPA] had approved the California standard, we would have these cars in Maine now, because it started with the 2009 model year," Littell said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said Obama's decision may represent a "watershed moment" where the U.S. begins a fundamental overhaul of its national energy policy. And U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, released a statement hailing the decision as "an important step toward energy independence."LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Act gives California special authority to regulate vehicle pollution because the state began regulating such pollution before the federal government got into the act. But a federal waiver is still required. Other states can choose to adopt California's standards or the federal ones if a waiver is issued.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has issued several waivers to California in the past to control emissions related to smog. California's latest proposal was intended to take effect in the 2009 model year, but was never implemented because of EPA delays on the waiver request.LiNeBrEaKIf the current waiver request is approved, automakers would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers have pushed for a single national standard, arguing California's waiver request would require production of two types of vehicles and could require dealerships in some states to limit sales of large trucks.LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said.LiNeBrEaK"It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs," he said.LiNeBrEaKGov. John Baldacci said in a statement that Maine now has "a partner in Washington, D.C., who understands the need to promote clean, renewable energy" and who has outlined what he called a "clear vision for our national energy future."LiNeBrEaKMaine has also followed California's lead in other areas when it comes to vehicle emissions.LiNeBrEaKMaine adopted California's Zero Emissions Vehicle Program, which requires that a certain percentage of the cars sold by a manufacturer in the state be low- or zero-emissions vehicles.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, 26 percent of the passenger vehicles sold in Maine met the strict "partial zero-emissions vehicle," or PZEV, standard, according to Lynne Cayting, who handles mobile air pollution sources for the Maine DEP.LiNeBrEaKPZEV vehicles include hybrids as well as some conventional cars that have ultralow emissions. A "zero emission vehicle," or ZEV, would be an electric car or one powered by hydrogen fuel cells.LiNeBrEaK"I really believe we would not have the advanced-technology vehicles that we do without this," Cayting said of California's program.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Rethinking clean cars: A willingness to let California, Maryland and others regulate tailpipe emissions demonstrates President Obama's new approach to energy ? and to scientific evidence  	The Baltimore Sun  	COMMENTARY  	526 words  	Jan. 27--The winds of change brought to Washington by the nation's new chief executive may be clearing the air in more ways than one. President Barack Obama yesterday asked federal regulators to re-examine past decisions regarding vehicle tailpipe emissions and fuel efficiency standards that could lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gases and less dependence on foreign oil. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama had promised a greener -- and smarter -- energy future during his presidential campaign, and reversing course on these policy missteps of the past represents a major move in that direction. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's failure to permit California and 13 other states, including Maryland, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars was among the more egregious examples of the science-averse Bush administration putting corporate profits ahead of public interest.LiNeBrEaKSome in the U.S. auto industry will no doubt whine that the last thing a struggling industry needs is the possibility of a patchwork quilt of state regulations. But that's not really what the U.S. faces. If the EPA chooses to reverse course, California standards will quickly become the nation's de facto rules regarding tailpipe emissions -- as they've been in the past.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, the alternative possibility that $17. 4 billion in taxpayer bailout money would be used to underwrite a business-as-usual approach to climate change by Detroit was unacceptable. Had the beleaguered industry not been so resistant to government-mandated higher emissions and fuel efficiency standards years ago, automakers would today be far better positioned to make cars consumers want to buy.LiNeBrEaKDespite current sub-$2-a-gallon gasoline prices, Americans should not lose sight of the need to reduce the nation's dependence on oil -- not just because of the national security and economic implications (although they are considerable), but because the burning of fossil fuels, whether by cars or power plants, is putting the planet deeper in peril on a daily basis.LiNeBrEaKWe can no longer bury our collective heads in the sand and ignore what science has made plain. The last administration's rejection of scientific evidence had become such a common occurrence that new EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson felt compelled to write to her employees last week informing them that henceforth "science must be the backbone for EPA programs" and also that "the EPA must follow the rule of law."LiNeBrEaKHow remarkable that either notion needed to be expressed, but clearly they did. President Obama's willingness to allow states to regulate air quality or for the U.S. Department of Transportation to formalize fuel efficiency guidelines is nothing extraordinary -- it only seems so after the Bush know-nothingness era.

The Boston Globe 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Moving back from the coastline  	H.D.S. Greenway  	OP-ED; Pg. A11  	670 words  	EVER SINCE Captain Cook, mutiny on the Bounty, and Paul Gauguin, the South Pacific has held a special place in the Western imagination. The islands and atolls, swaying palms, and care-free people seemed to symbolize the great escape, a place where cares might be left behind, the closest thing this mortal world had to paradise. "Bali Ha'i your special island, come to me, come to me," as the Oscar Hammerstein lyrics go.LiNeBrEaKFuture generations may never know those special islands, and today, as sea levels rise with global warming, the population of many a Bali Ha'i is preparing to come to us. LiNeBrEaKLast fall Anote Tong, the president of the Republic of Kiribati, stopped by Harvard University to give a lecture. Kiribati used to be the Gilbert Islands, formerly British, then Japanese, which the Americans took at great cost in World War II. Kiribati has 33 islands strung out over the Pacific where the International Date Line meets the equator. Its principal island is Tarawa. But the most important statistic is that it lies less than 6 feet above sea level. "Something is happening that didn't happen in the last century," Tong said.LiNeBrEaKIt's too late to reverse this, he said. There is already enough greenhouse gases to ensure the continuing rise of the oceans. Kiribati is trying to adapt, he said. But unlike other lands there is only so far you can move back from the coast before "we are in danger of falling off the other side."LiNeBrEaKKiribati's answer: train its people in skills that are needed in other lands and start emigrating. There is a shortage of nurses in Australia, so the women of Kirbati are training to be nurses. New Zealand is willing to take in islanders, and it assigns the numbers by rotation. There is no money for elaborate sea walls, and there is no country willing to give the 100,000 Micronesians of Kiribati a new homeland.LiNeBrEaKIt is ironic, said President Tong, that the people with the smallest carbon foot print should be taking the brunt of global warming's damage.LiNeBrEaKIn the Indian Ocean, the Maldives, with three times Kiribati's population and a great deal more money from tourism, is starting a fund to buy a new homeland. At about 9 feet above sea level, with the sea expected to rise about 3 feet this century, the nation of 1,200 islands has a bit more time than Kiribati.LiNeBrEaKWith this in mind, I visited the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where Bob Evans is a resident expert on rising oceans. I learned that oceans don't rise slowly and steadily like water in a bath tub. You have to imagine an energetic 5-year-old splashing as much water as possible to understand how it works. It's the storm surges that do the damage, reaching far above the mean high water mark. If the sea rise is slow, nature can adapt. But if it's too fast, nature hasn't time. And none of the present sea-level projections take into account the melting Greenland ice cap, which, if it disappears in future centuries, would cause the sea to rise 20 feet.LiNeBrEaKSand dunes don't just sit there and drown, Evans said, they pick up and move back on shore, invading coastal marshes and eventually burying houses and roads inland. You can see that happening now. He and his colleagues wrote a paper that said there was a lack of will among policy makers to address these problems.LiNeBrEaKThis is changing. Holland, with two thirds of its country below sea level, is making plans to extend its coastline. Concrete dikes have been found less effective than creating dunes and earthworks more reminiscent of the 17th century.LiNeBrEaKMassachusetts has just started a pilot program to protect 78 coastal towns against rising sea levels and accompanying storm surges. The theory is that it's better to adapt now than to wait decades until rising sea levels start to cause major damage.LiNeBrEaKIt is estimated that by the end of the century, parts of Boston and Cambridge could be flooded during storms. It's unfair, but you can bet that flooding Harvard would focus attention even more than losing Bali Ha'i.LiNeBrEaKH.D.S. Greenway's column appears regularly in the Globe.

The Boston Globe 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Obama counters Bush on auto standards Says sound science supports changes  	Lisa Wangsness Globe Staff  	NATIONAL; Pg. A1  	1253 words  	THE FIRST 100 DAYSLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - President Obama yesterday swept aside his predecessor's skepticism about global warming and reluctance to goad US automakers into producing more fuel-efficient vehicles, issuing orders that he said would lay the groundwork for breaking the nation's dependence on oil from unfriendly regimes and help stave off the effects of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We must have the courage and commitment to change," he declared. "Year after year, decade after decade, we've chosen delay over decisive action. Rigid ideology has overruled sound science. Special interests have overshadowed common sense."LiNeBrEaKThe impending new regulations come at a time when US car manufacturers are barely surviving, and after the federal government loaned more than $17 billion to help them avoid bankruptcy and confront the combined pressures of increased competition from abroad, a deepening recession at home, and an evaporation of consumer credit worldwide. But Obama said that while industry's problems must be fully considered, its future depends on building greener cars. LiNeBrEaK"Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry. It is to help America's automakers prepare for the future," he said at a White House news conference.LiNeBrEaKObama ordered federal regulators to reconsider a petition by California, Massachusetts, 12 other states, and the District of Columbia to set stricter auto emissions rules than the federal government, a request blocked by the Bush administration. He also ordered the Transportation Department to move quickly to implement new federal fuel efficiency standards adopted by Congress a year ago, a task Bush left unfinished.LiNeBrEaKPractically speaking, the announcements are likely to mean that within a few years American cars on average will get better gas mileage than they do now, potentially saving millions of barrels of oil. Starting with 2011 models, annual increases will require the fleetwide average fuel economy to go from about 25 miles a gallon to at least 35 miles a gallon by 2020, the goal Congress approved in December 2007. If the Environmental Protection Agency grants the states' petition, cars sold in Massachusetts and the other states will pollute less than the national average, forcing the overall fleet of new cars in those states to adhere to emissions limits roughly equivalent to a fuel efficiency standard of 36. 8 miles per gallon by 2016.LiNeBrEaKIf the EPA lets the states regulate auto emissions, environmentalists say fuel economy standards could rise far faster in the years to come because California, an environmentally conscious state politically removed from Detroit, could drive the pace of change instead of Congress. California and the states following its lead make up more than half of the US auto market, so their standards strongly influence the overall fleet.LiNeBrEaK"He's telling the states that they can lead, the feds that they're going to have to follow, and really telling the whole world that the knuckle-dragging US is lifting its knuckles off the ground and we are going to take the global warming issue very seriously," said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign.LiNeBrEaKFuel economy standards improved quickly during the energy crisis in the 1970s, but the auto industry successfully fought efforts to raise requirements significantly through much of the last 20 years. The overall fuel economy of the US fleet has stayed relatively flat since 1990, partly because of a loophole that lets sport utility vehicles lag far behind cars.LiNeBrEaKUS automakers, which have been slashing jobs and scrambling to reorganize amid the worst auto sales numbers since the early 1980s, said higher fuel efficiency standards could cost thousands per vehicle, burdening both the industry and consumers.LiNeBrEaKGloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said adopting the California standards would result in a confusing array of state and federal regulations, and expressed confidence the Obama administration would find a middle way with a single standard. David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., told the Associated Press yesterday he does not believe the EPA will approve all the waivers requested.LiNeBrEaK"If the industry is in total shambles, you can have any regulation you want - it's not doable," he said.LiNeBrEaKRepresentative Edward Markey of Massachusetts, who authored the standards Congress adopted in 2007, replied: "I'm afraid the industry will collapse unless they quickly implement a strategy to construct much more fuel-efficient vehicles. This is a way of helping the industry move toward that goal."LiNeBrEaKIan Bowles, secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said yesterday's announcement means that if the states get the authority to adopt California rules, within two years Massachusetts residents will be able to choose from "a whole new stock of cleaner car options."LiNeBrEaK"We've been in office two years, and we've spent two years fighting stiff headwinds from the federal government," he said. "Today represents a turning point."LiNeBrEaKAlso yesterday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named a new envoy for climate change - Todd Stern, a former White House assistant who was chief US negotiator at the Kyoto talks in her husband's administration.LiNeBrEaKFor many environmentalists, Obama's urgent tone on global warming was as important as the message. Seth Kaplan of the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation, which has helped New England states defend the tougher emission standards in court, compared the feeling of working to slow global warming during the Bush years to being in a 1950s monster movie, "running through the streets yelling, `There are pod people in people's basements!' - and nobody believed you."LiNeBrEaKEconomists have long disagreed about the costs and benefits to society of higher fuel efficiency standards; Ian Parry, an economist and senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a Washington-based research group, recently coauthored an analysis that came to a nuanced conclusion. Some benefits - such as reducing the need to buy oil from rogue states - are difficult to quantify, Parry said. And it is difficult to determine some of the costs, such as how much consumers will value vehicles that get farther on less fuel.LiNeBrEaKHe noted, though, that higher fuel efficiency standards, without more stringent emissions rules, can lead to more pollution because when people can get farther on a tank of gas, they will often drive more. For that reason, he argues, raising the gas tax is a better way to reduce gasoline use. But since increasing taxes is politically unpopular, raising fuel economy standards is the next best option, he said.LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR 1:LiNeBrEaKSAVING GASLiNeBrEaKSEE PDF FOR CHART DATALiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR 2:LiNeBrEaKGOING GREENLiNeBrEaKHighlights of the presidential memoranda signed yesterday:LiNeBrEaK- Directs Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider California's proposed restrictions to force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Changing our energy future  	Chattanooga Times Free Press, Tenn.  	COMMENTARY  	651 words  	Jan. 27--President Barack Obama promised in his campaign that he would act to conserve energy, reduce air pollution and global warming, and move the auto industry toward building -- in America -- the cleaner fuel-efficient cars of the future. He took two vital steps in that direction Monday. He directed the EPA to reconsider its Bush-era rejection of California's proposed tightening of vehicle tailpipe emissions. And he asked the Transportation Department to develop the regulations needed to implement the law Congress passed in 2007 to tighten auto mileage standards by a third by 2020.LiNeBrEaKPredictably, Detroit's car-makers immediately began complaining the Obama initiatives would be too onerous and would damage their business. LiNeBrEaKNothing could be farther from the truth. The Obama directives are perfectly sensible. It is Detroit's own foot-dragging on energy efficiency that has put American auto companies behind foreign competitors, and that threatens to keep there. The Obama proposals might help save them.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has sought authority since 2003 to implement tailpipe emission standards that are tighter than federal standards, both to curb air pollution and global warming and to improve fuel efficiency. Detroit and the Bush administration wrongly resisted.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed rules are not pie-in-the-sky standards that car markers can't meet. In fact, some foreign car makers already meet California's desired standard -- and more will before Detroit gets there if it's not forced along the innovation curve.LiNeBrEaKVolkswagen's 2009 "clean diesel" Jetta, which gets around 50 mpg, already meets the cleaner tailpipe emission standards that California and 13 other supporting states want to establish. Toyota's improved Prius hybrid, another 50 mpg car, also meets that standard.LiNeBrEaKVolkswagen, BMW and Mercedes, in fact, are making high-mileage, clean-diesel cars that perform well on Germany's speed-zone-free Autobahns at well over 100 mph. If Detroit's auto-makers can't build comparable cars by the 2016 deadline that California seeks, they'll be dead in the water sooner than we think.LiNeBrEaKAllowing states to impose tighter standards than the EPA has sought in the past does not mean, as Detroit contends, that states will end up setting a patchwork of differing tailpipe emission standards. Most state regulators are smart enough to see how unfeasible that would be.LiNeBrEaKThe 13 states that signed onto California standards simply did so because they realized, as California had, that the Bush administration was far more interested in stroking Big Oil and Detroit's focus on high-profit gas-guzzlers. Oil companies and Detroit liked the high profits of the situation as it was, and President Bush and his EPA chiefs went along -- never mind the soaring trade deficit for imported oil, and the indenturing of America to the oil-rich Middle East.LiNeBrEaKThat dynamic should change as soon as possible. Even with oil prices down at the moment due to the recession and the fall-off in global demand, the U.S. still imports more than 60 percent of our oil. That jeopardizes our security, depresses the value of the dollar, and sends excessive wealth out of the country when it could be better used at home.LiNeBrEaKAmericans should be glad for the Obama shift from the tired old Bush practice of denying progress on fuel-efficiency just to please Big Oil and Detroit. That practice has helped drag the nation into trouble too long. A quick, forceful reversal would be immensely helpful.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	New interior secretary may reverse some Bush rulings  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	937 words  	WASHINGTON _ Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on Tuesday he is reconsidering a series of controversial energy and environmental decisions handed down in the waning days of the Bush administration, including a move to open federal land near national parks for oil and natural gas drilling.LiNeBrEaKOpening parts of the Mountain West for oil shale development _ a sensitive issue because of the huge quantities of water required to extract oil from the rock _ will also be reviewed, he said in his first formal news interview since winning Senate confirmation last week. LiNeBrEaK"I'm very concerned about a number of the midnight actions that were taken by the Bush administration," Salazar said. "We barely have moved in, but we already know enough to know there are many issues we need to revisit."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to oil and gas leases near national parks and the oil shale issue, Salazar said the list of the late-innings decisions to be reviewed included starting the process for resumption of oil exploration in coastal areas and several rulings on the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKHe suggested he would like to reinstate a rule that federal agencies had to consult with scientists before approving projects that could affect threatened plants and animals _ and leaving open the possibility that the department would consider the effects of global warming on species habitat, which Bush aides explicitly ruled out.LiNeBrEaKAlmost all the decisions by President George W. Bush were strongly opposed by environmental groups, many of which supported Barack Obama in last year's election.LiNeBrEaKBut reversing some of these decisions will be easier than others, both legally and politically.LiNeBrEaKSalazar, for example, could overrule Bush and maintain endangered species protection for the gray wolf essentially on his own authority, without going through any legal process or consulting Congress. By contrast, rewriting the oil shale regulations approved by the previous administration could take months or even years under the department's formal rulemaking procedures.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists warned that reversing some of the Bush decisions would slow domestic energy development and put Salazar at odds with his _ and Obama's _ energy independence goals.LiNeBrEaK"It would really throw a wrench into the way things are going toward getting the country off our so-called addiction to foreign oil," said Michael Olsen, a former Interior Department official under Bush who now lobbies for energy interests at Bracewell and Giuliani in Washington.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists urged swift action. "Salazar has a free hand" to kill the Utah leases, said Trip Van Noppen, president of Earthjustice, which has sued to block the leases and several of Bush's other decisions. "The secretary has an opportunity here to set a new direction."LiNeBrEaKSalazar joined eight other administration officials, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and special climate-change adviser Carol Browner, for a lunch meeting Tuesday to discuss Obama's initiatives on energy independence and global warming. In the interview, Salazar said the Interior Department would play "an integral part" in that effort.LiNeBrEaKA centrist former senator from Colorado, Salazar takes over a department weakened by scandals involving sex, drugs and improper political influence stretching back several years.LiNeBrEaKGovernment auditors have detailed how a department staff member manipulated endangered species decisions to advance political agendas. They painted a sordid picture of cocaine, sex and oil royalty graft in the department's Minerals Management Agency.LiNeBrEaKIn his Senate confirmation hearing, Salazar pledged to "clean up" the department. On Monday, he outlined new ethics standards in a memo to Interior Department staff.LiNeBrEaKHe said Tuesday that he will travel to Denver this week to address the Minerals Management staff, and he said he would set "the highest expectations for integrity and ethics, from secretary down to each of the agencies."LiNeBrEaKHe repeatedly stressed the importance of science in agency decision-making, particularly in regard to endangered species. Late last year, the Bush administration declared that federal agencies would not be compelled to consult expert biologists about whether government projects _ such as new roads or dams _ would harm imperiled wildlife or plants.LiNeBrEaKSalazar said he would reconsider that rule and would work to enhance Endangered Species Act protections for streams and habitat. "At the end of the day, it should be the scientific foundation that drives the decisions," he said.LiNeBrEaKCalling climate change "one of the signature issues of our time," he also said he was revisiting a Bush administration decision to exclude global warming considerations when acting to protect endangered species such as the polar bear, which is declining in part due to shrinking polar ice caps.LiNeBrEaKHe expressed some support, as he did in the Senate, for coastal oil drilling but said he was still reviewing a last-minute Bush proposal to set the stage for new drilling leases.LiNeBrEaKHe said he hoped, "in the next few weeks" to gather information and decide whether to reverse those and other Bush decisions, including several that face court challenges, such as the oil-shale rules _ which Salazar criticized when enacted _ and the drilling leases near national parks in Utah.

The Columbian (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Gregoire welcomes Obama emissions plan: President could let states set standards  	Kathie Durbin, The Columbian, Vancouver, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	560 words  	Jan. 27--Gov. Chris Gregoire and the state's environmental community Monday hailed President Obama's announcement that he will review the Bush administration's refusal to permit states to set auto tailpipe emission standards stricter than the national rules.LiNeBrEaK"I applaud this move by President Obama to address emission standards, a change I've been advocating since 2007," the governor said in a statement. "This decision will help protect the planet as we work with the federal government to tackle one of our most pressing environmental problems. Motor vehicles produce more than half the greenhouse gas emissions in Washington. Making investments now to protect our health and environment will cost us far less in the long run." LiNeBrEaKWashington and 12 other states joined the lawsuit filed by California challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's denial of its request for a federal waiver allowing it to adopt its own tailpipe emission standards to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKK.C. Golden, policy director for the Seattle-based group Climate Solutions, said opposition from the auto industry and the Bush administration cost the states two years in their efforts to reduce vehicle emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Had the federal government not obstructed this effort by the states, we would be starting to implement the rule this year," Golden said. "Assuming everything moves forward apace, we would begin implementing the rule in 2011. The standards phase in over a five- or six-year period. And then we still have the old cars. They don't go away."LiNeBrEaKBut adopting California's tougher emission standards, which would require the American car and light truck fleet to increase its average fuel efficiency to 35 miles per hour from the current average of 27, are just the beginning of the work that needs to be done, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There is much more that we can do to speed up development of cleaner vehicles and to move forward with the federal government's own fuel efficiency order. We haven't begun to scratch the surface of the auto revolution that we need and that the auto industry needs to survive."LiNeBrEaKHe said he was encouraged that Obama's new energy secretary, Steven Chu, is committed to accelerated research and development of clean fuels that don't compete with food crops.LiNeBrEaKAt the top of the climate change agenda for the 2009 Legislature, Golden said, is approval of a "cap-and-invest" system endorsed by the Western Climate Initiative, a coalition of seven Western states, including Washington, and four Canadian provinces.LiNeBrEaKThe initiative, unveiled in October, would cap carbon and other greenhouse gases from the region's electrical, industrial and transportation sectors with the goal of reducing the heat-trapping emissions that cause global warming by 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"That provides the infrastructure," Golden said. "That says that at the end of the day, all the pieces are going to add up. It provides a solid, no-nonsense commitment."

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Home Final Edition	Ohio doesn't plan to set stricter pollution limits  	Spencer Hunt, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	NEWS; Pg. 04A  	522 words  	Ohio officials say they have no plans to join California and 13 other states that want to set strict automobile-emissions and fuel-efficiency standards.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama directed federal regulators yesterday to approve applications by the states to reduce vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas tied to climate change. LiNeBrEaKThe plan would make automakers accelerate plans to cut pollution by increasing cars' fuel economy. The Bush administration opposed the idea, as does the auto industry, which says the changes would raise the cost of cars and trucks at a time when many manufacturers face bankruptcy.LiNeBrEaKOhio Gov. Ted Strickland agrees.LiNeBrEaK"It could have a profound impact on Ohio's economy," said Amanda Wurst, Strickland's spokeswoman. "The best way to approach this is through a national standard."LiNeBrEaKAdvocates say it's no surprise that Ohio isn't interested.LiNeBrEaK"The auto industry dominates in Ohio," said Jack Shaner, a lobbyist with the Ohio Environmental Council.LiNeBrEaKAbout 30 percent of carbon emissions nationwide are made by cars and trucks, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates.LiNeBrEaKThe California plan would cut carbon emissions from cars and light trucks byLiNeBrEaK30 percent during the next seven years. It would make automakers increase the average fuel efficiency of their cars to roughly 35 miles per gallon by 2016.LiNeBrEaKA federal law enacted in 2007 calls for 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The current standard for cars is 25. 7 miles per gallon and 22. 5 miles per gallon for light trucks.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush EPA denied California's plan in March, saying the federal standard was sufficient. The rejection followed auto-industry arguments that the price of new cars would increase an average of $3,000 per vehicle.LiNeBrEaKWade Newton, spokesman for the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, said the states' plans would create a "patchwork of regulations."LiNeBrEaK"A national plan is the most effective way to do this," Newton said.LiNeBrEaKThe Ohio EPA has repeatedly refused advocates' requests to limit carbon emissions from a proposed coal-fired power plant and a proposed plant that would convert coal into jet and diesel fuel.LiNeBrEaKIn a Nov. 26 letter to the U.S. EPA, Ohio EPA director Chris Korleski said a national law is needed before the state will act.LiNeBrEaKRebecca Stanfield, senior energy advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said automakers should embrace California's standards because consumers want more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaK"There is a big market out there for cars that use less gas," Stanfield said.LiNeBrEaKshunt@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKBox Story: Cars, carbon and climate changeLiNeBrEaKCars and light trucks emitted 77. 8 million tons of carbon dioxide in Ohio in 2005, about a quarter of the 297. 6 million tons emitted from all sources, including power plants.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Home Final Edition	Holy petaflop*;  New supercomputer's blazing speed attracts line of researchers eager to put its power to use 	Kevin Mayhood, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	NEWS - SCIENCE; Pg. 04B  	896 words  	At its peak, the new Cray XT5 Jaguar supercomputer at the Battelle-managed Oak Ridge National Laboratory can perform 1. 64 quadrillion calculations per second.LiNeBrEaKWhen running sustained programs, it weighs in at 1. 059 quadrillion calculations, or 1. 059 "petaflops."LiNeBrEaKQuadrillions? Petaflops? Confused? Trust us, this computer is fast. Very fast. LiNeBrEaKBut believe it or not, 1. 059 quadrillion calculations is only good enough to rank as the second-fastest computer on the planet.LiNeBrEaKThe IBM Roadrunner, built for the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, hums along during sustained runs at 1. 105 quadrillion calculations per second, according to the TOP500 Supercomputers list.LiNeBrEaK"That's a lot of power," said Kevin Wohlever, director of supercomputing operations at the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where an IBM cluster of computers can make 21. 9 trillion calculations per second.LiNeBrEaK"But it's the combination of power and the amount of memory and storage that enables it to do what others can't."LiNeBrEaKThe Jaguar and Roadrunner are more than twice as fast as their next competitors.LiNeBrEaKThe National Center for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge is managed by UT-Battelle, a private nonprofit organization created by the University of Tennessee and Battelle.LiNeBrEaKAnd the Jaguar is really not a computer. It is actually 181,000 computer cores contained in eight rows of racks on a floor the size of a college basketball court.LiNeBrEaKIt cost about $100 million, according to Arthur S. "Buddy" Bland, director of the Leadership Computing Facility project, which installed the machine.LiNeBrEaKWho uses this thing? Researchers from Oak Ridge and other national labs, NASA, universities and corporations such as Boeing and General Motors are scheduled to use the Jaguar this year.LiNeBrEaKSome of the work includes:LiNeBrEaK* Creating the most-detailed climate-change models.LiNeBrEaK* Testing nanomaterials and the interactions of subatomic particles.LiNeBrEaK* Creating ways to make alternative fuels even cleaner.LiNeBrEaK* Increasing the efficiency of jet engines.LiNeBrEaK* Making better bubbles in detergents and fire extinguishers.LiNeBrEaKMichael Heroux, a member of the technical staff at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, plans to use the Jaguar to model how antimicrobial peptides, a class of antibiotics, interact with and pass through the layers of cell walls.LiNeBrEaKThe work, his team hopes, will help lead to medicines that can treat a number of diseases and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.LiNeBrEaKA team led by Alexei Kritsuk, a research scientist at the University of California at San Diego, plans to model the supersonic turbulence in molecular clouds around the spiral arms of the Milky Way.LiNeBrEaKThe turbulence, researchers think, triggers star formation.LiNeBrEaK"We need a really big supercomputer to run this," Kritsuk said.LiNeBrEaKBig supercomputers need big power.LiNeBrEaK"That's one reason the computer center was built here," said Bill Cabage, an Oak Ridge spokesman.LiNeBrEaKThe Tennessee Valley Authority built a substation at Oak Ridge so that the Jaguar can eat its 7 megawatts of electricity at peak performance, Bland said.LiNeBrEaK"Seven megawatts is enough electricity to handle the peak needs of about 2,200 AEP customers," said Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman for American Electric Power Co., based in Columbus.LiNeBrEaKAnd big supercomputers need big cooling systems.LiNeBrEaKIf the Jaguar used conventional air cooling, "It would require the airflow provided by a jet engine," Wohlever said. LiNeBrEaKInstead, a refrigerant is pumped through pipes in the computer cabinets. The refrigerant is vaporized, pulling the heat from the processors.LiNeBrEaKAt the end of the eight rows of cabinets, heat exchangers pump 6,000 gallons of icy-cold water per minute to condense the refrigerant, which then returns to the system. LiNeBrEaKResearchers say the effort is worth it.LiNeBrEaK"Such a machine enables us to do a lot of things previously not possible," said Kevin Trenberth, head of the climate-analysis section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.LiNeBrEaKThe center is studying how the carbon cycle together with changing ocean and land ecosystems are affecting climate.LiNeBrEaKCurrent climate models break up Earth into 100- to 150-kilometer grids. Researchers would like to go smaller, but they don't have the computer memory and power to process more detailed information.LiNeBrEaKThe Jaguar computer can handle models for 60-kilometer grids.LiNeBrEaKThe increase in power and memory would allow the inclusion of factors that can't fit into current models, or the analysis of more layers of the atmosphere at one time, Trenberth said.LiNeBrEaKIn the computing world, records are short-lived, and the hunger for more speed is insatiable.LiNeBrEaKOak Ridge plans to install a computer capable of 25 petaflops by 2012, 100 to 250 petaflops by 2015, and an exoflop, or 1,000-petaflop, machine by 2018. \LiNeBrEaKkmayhood@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKBox Story: * Petaflop: one thousand trillion calculations per second \LiNeBrEaKBY THE NUMBERS \LiNeBrEaK1. 64 quadrillion - Calculations per second at top speed \LiNeBrEaK362 terabytes - Amount of memory, about 180,000 times more than a home computer \LiNeBrEaK181,504 - Processors, equal to 181,504 home computers \LiNeBrEaK284; 5,700 - Number of cabinets and amount of square footage to house the system \LiNeBrEaK6,000 gallons - Volume of water used every minute to cool the system \LiNeBrEaK4,385 - Miles of wiring needed to connect all components \LiNeBrEaK85 - Decibels of noise the system generates during operations \LiNeBrEaK7 - Megawatts of power used to run the computer, equal to the peak power use of 2,200 homes. \LiNeBrEaKSource: Battelle	SUPERCOMPUTERS (94%); COMPUTATIONAL RESEARCH (90%); RESEARCH (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); ANTIBIOTICS (84%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); PHYSICS (78%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (78%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (71%); ASTRONOMY and SPACE (71%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY SPORTS (71%); ANTI-INFECTIVES (67%); BACTERIA (65%); CLIMATE CHANGE (64%); BASKETBALL (64%); NANOTECHNOLOGY (62%); ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE (60%); AMINO ACIDS  PEPTIDES and PROTEINS (50%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (50%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (66%)  	OHIO SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER (56%); BOEING CO (53%); GENERAL MOTORS CORP (53%); SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES (52%); MILKY WAY (51%); TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY (50%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (53%)  	NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE and SPACE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (53%); NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE and ENGINE PARTS MANUFACTURING (53%); NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING (53%); SIC3761 GUIDED MISSILES and SPACE VEHICLES (53%); NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (53%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (53%)  	SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (79%); COLUMBUS, OH, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (91%); TENNESSEE, USA (91%); NEW MEXICO, USA (90%); OHIO, USA (79%); MILKY WAY GALAXY (79%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	January 27, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  	UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE (55%); LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY (57%)  		Series  	Photo, map, (1) BEN MARGOT / ASSOCIATED PRESS, This supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was the fastest computer when it was installed in 2001. , (2) JEFF HINCKLEY / DISPATCH PHOTOS, An older Oak Ridge supercomputer bears famous visitors' autographs. , (3) Pipe fitter Bryon Phillips helps to install the new supercomputer's cooling system, which uses a refrigerant and thousands of gallons of water a minute.

Daily News (New York) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	GET THE LEAD OUT, GUYS! Obama to lawmakers: 'Can't afford delays' on economic rescue plan  	BY MICHAEL McAULIFF DAILY NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. 6  	467 words  	WASHINGTON - President Obama's economic message yesterday to Congress: Step on the gas!LiNeBrEaKObama detoured from a long-planned White House announcement on auto emissions to sound fresh alarms about "the deepening economic crisis." LiNeBrEaKHe implored lawmakers to hustle approval of his $825 billion economic rescue plan, while taking pains to point out he had "inherited" the financial mess.LiNeBrEaKAnd he bemoaned the news of thousands of layoffs at companies like Microsoft, Intel and Caterpillar.LiNeBrEaK"As with the millions of jobs lost in 2008, these are workingmen and women whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been put on hold," Obama said.LiNeBrEaK"We owe it to each of them and to every single American to act with a sense of urgency," he added. "We can't afford distractions and we cannot afford delays."LiNeBrEaKCitigroup managed to offer a distraction yesterday, with the revelation it was buying a $50 million jet in spite of taking $45 billion from the government's Wall Street bailout approved last year.LiNeBrEaKObama is trying to figure out how to spend the remaining $350 billion of the bailout - and whether more is needed for the ailing financial industry.LiNeBrEaKWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs refused to say what Obama might do, but Democratic sources told the Daily News that the most extreme option under consideration is using the $350 billion as "seed money" for a much larger program.LiNeBrEaK"This is probably going to be bigger than $350 billion," a senior Democrat said. "The problem is, nobody knows how big the problem is. They do know that it is not fixed - consumers aren't getting credit."LiNeBrEaKAnother approach some officials are talking about consists of buying up all the banks' bad debt and creating one huge "bad bank," with the hope that "someday some of that debt might actually be paid back," another Democrat said.LiNeBrEaK"We have to think about all these options because the consequences of failure are just too large," said another.LiNeBrEaKIn spite of the grim financial picture, Obama rolled out two executive orders yesterday that would require carmakers to raise gas mileage standards to at least 35 miles a gallon by 2020, up from 27. 5 now.LiNeBrEaKHe also ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a Bush administration ruling that blocked even-tougher California clean-air rules mandating about 42 miles a gallon.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers have fought the changes. But Gibbs said they've had plenty of time to get ready and noted developing cleaner cars could boost the companies' bottom lines.LiNeBrEaKThe administration capped the orders with an announcement from Secretary of State Clinton that she was appointing a climate change envoy to seek global consensus to address the issue.LiNeBrEaKTeam Obama also announced that former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell was embarking on a peace mission to the Middle East.LiNeBrEaKmmcauliff@nydailynews.com	EMISSIONS (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); BAILOUTS (90%); DELAYS and POSTPONEMENTS (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (78%); CREDIT CRISIS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); AIR QUALITY (77%); APPROVALS (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (77%); AIR POLLUTION (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); BANKING and FINANCE (76%); LAYOFFS (71%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (65%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (65%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (65%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (60%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (78%) ECONOMY; USA; CONGRESS; RESCUE; AUTOMOBILE; AIR POLLUTION; BARACK OBAMA  	INTEL CORP (57%); MICROSOFT CORP (57%); CITIGROUP INC (57%)  	NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR and RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (57%); NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS (57%); SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE (57%); NAICS523120 SECURITIES BROKERAGE (57%); NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING (57%); NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING (57%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 27, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Daily News, L.P.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	402 words  	Jan. 27--To recognize Yolo County as a leader in energy efficient practices, PGandE will present the county with the utility's "Energy Stewardship Award" today, Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKYolo County has implemented a myriad of energy conservation projects that have earned the County over $850,000 in PGandE rebates and incentives and saved more than $11 million in energy costs during the past 15 years. Just a few of these projects include:LiNeBrEaKn A countywide effort to retrofit lights, HVAC systems, fans, water heaters, motors and much more. This project achieved an energy savings of $6. 9 million over 15 years and included PGandE rebates of more than $250,000.LiNeBrEaKn The County participates in PGandE's demand response programs that play an important role in the utility's efforts to ensure reliable service for customers during periods of high energy demand. Participants in these programs earn a financial incentive for agreeing to reduce energy usage during critical peak demand times.LiNeBrEaKn A countywide program to save energy and earn PGandE rebates by replacing old, inefficient appliances, such as refrigerators over 20 years old, with more efficient Energy Star appliances.LiNeBrEaK"From county staff to the Board of Supervisors, Yolo County has demonstrated true leadership in addressing energy efficiency and climate change issues," said James Morante, public affairs manager for PGandE. "Not only have they significantly reduced their energy usage, but they have also saved millions of dollars in the process. We're proud to have helped Yolo County meet their energy saving objectives, and we are genuinely excited about building on these successes."LiNeBrEaKIn 2007 PGandE initiated a customer recognition program for businesses and governments that demonstrate exemplary commitment to enhancing energy efficiency, sustainability and environmental stewardship.

LiNeBrEaKAttacking a Bush administration policy, Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to reexamine whether California and other states should be allowed to have tougher auto emission standards to combat a build up of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said in his first formal event in the ornate East Room of the White House.LiNeBrEaK"It will be the policy of my administration," he said, "to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia and at least a dozen other states have tried to come up with tougher emission standards than those imposed by the federal government, but Obama said that "Washington stood in their way." The president wants the EPA to take a second look at a decision denying California - and the other states that want to follow its model - permission to set tougher tailpipe emission standards.LiNeBrEaKMore broadly, Obama sought to show he was not waiting to put his stamp on energy policy, which has both near-term implications on the sagging economy and long-range effects on pollution, climate change and national security.LiNeBrEaK"Year after year, decade after decade, we've chosen delay over decisive action," Obama said.

The Denver Post 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	EDITORIAL Wise moves on fuel standards The president's actions Monday, addressing energy usage and air quality, provide a clear roadmap for the U.S. auto industry.  		Pg. B-11  	498 words  	While it was a huge relief to see $4 a gallon gasoline go by the wayside, some analysts say it's just a brief reprieve.LiNeBrEaKAnd with the return of $4 a gallon gas comes the stranglehold that some of this country's greatest enemies will have on the United States. LiNeBrEaKThat is but one of the reasons we applaud President Barack Obama's decision to reconsider allowing California and other states to set stricter auto mileage standards than what the federal government now requires.LiNeBrEaKIt was among several moves the president made Monday, signaling his commitment to reduce our enormous carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaK"We have made our choice: America will not be held hostage to dwindling resources, hostile regimes and a warming planet," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKThe decisions are a breath of fresh air for a country that has for too long carried on as if there was no end to the oil that supported our habits and no impact on the environment.LiNeBrEaKThe administration's other moves included issuing guidelines to ensure automakers reach a previously approved average fuel efficiency of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, and the naming of a new U.S. envoy on climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut the main decision was the reconsideration of the California request.LiNeBrEaKGiving states the ability to adopt a strict tailpipe emissions standard would result in automakers having to build more efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKIf California and 13 other states were to adopt the standard, it would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by more than 450 million metric tons by 2020, according to Environment America, an environmental group. And it would save 50 billion gallons of gasoline by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThose are significant numbers.LiNeBrEaKColorado could be among the states that choose to go the "clean car" route.LiNeBrEaKMore than a year ago, Gov. Bill Ritter unveiled a climate action plan that included adopting the standard being pursued by California and other states. As it stands, the state's Air Quality Commission is contemplating such rules.LiNeBrEaKThe clean car standard is worth exploring in Colorado. Questions need to be asked, such as: Can we still buy the type of vehicles to get us up and down steep grades safely, and how much would such a standard add to the vehicle's price tag?LiNeBrEaKAuto dealers and manufacturers have resisted the move, saying it would force an already struggling industry to abide by a "patchwork" of standards. We don't buy that.LiNeBrEaKThe industry has long had to make cars to meet the emissions standards for California, which has been wrestling with pollution for decades.LiNeBrEaKIf half the country adopted the same standard, it would be a rather large market. Plus, automakers could just sell those higher-mileage vehicles nationwide.LiNeBrEaKThe president's actions should constitute a clear roadmap for an auto industry struggling to redefine itself.LiNeBrEaKThe path to its future will be traveled by cleaner cars that make us less beholden to foreign oil producers.LiNeBrEaKIt's an important step, not just for the auto industry, but also for the entire country as we rethink the ramifications of our energy consumption.

The Eagle-Tribune (North Andover, Massachusetts)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	NH issues air quality alert  	Emily Moffett, The Eagle-Tribune, North Andover, Mass.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	526 words  	Jan. 27--Lower wind speeds have finally made the severe cold a bit more bearable, but now the lack of wind is raising health concerns.LiNeBrEaKThe New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services issued an air quality action alert in Southern New Hampshire for yesterday and today as a result of the stagnant air and temperature inversions limiting air movement. LiNeBrEaKAlthough the lack of wind has been nice, DES air quality specialist Kathy Brockett said it allows pollutants from fuel-burning heat sources to settle low to the ground.LiNeBrEaKAir quality action alerts are rarely given at this time of year, Brockett said, with the first one ever issued in January coming only last year.LiNeBrEaKNational Weather Service meteorologist Mike Sempa said he also finds the alerts rare in the winter, happening once or twice a year at the most.LiNeBrEaKBut the frigid winter has caused people to crank up their heat, which creates more pollution. Since the sun is lower in the sky in the winter, Brockett said, it doesn't heat the Earth as much as it normally does.LiNeBrEaKThe warm air higher in the atmosphere has been acting as a lid, holding pollution closer to the ground. She said the recent extreme cold makes the pollution a greater health concern than in years past.LiNeBrEaKDr. Thomas Johnson of New England Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in Derry agreed the health concerns raised by fine particle pollution are elevated in extremely cold temperatures. And New England has had plenty of cold days this winter.LiNeBrEaK"Cold aggravates asthma," he said. "There's no question about it. The particles add to the load the lungs have to carry. Exposure to these small particles may predispose people to symptoms. It causes irritation and aggravates inflammation. It's just not good for us."LiNeBrEaKBrockett said it isn't just the cold causing health problems. It also is the sources of heat being used -- and the way they are maintained.LiNeBrEaK"When temperatures go down, people crank it up," she said. "People need to make sure they keep their furnace well tuned, clean out their chimneys, and use only dry, seasoned wood in their wood stoves."LiNeBrEaKAlthough Brockett said wood stoves account for a large amount of the fine particle pollution because they produce smoke, she said she still considers them a good choice.LiNeBrEaK"They're a renewable resource," she said. "If wood is harvested in a sustainable manner, it will grow back. For that reason, from an environmental standpoint, I still think wood stoves are smart. The EPA certifies wood stoves, so you can make smart choices about stoves that minimize pollution and smoke."LiNeBrEaKSempa said wind speeds are expected to pick up tomorrow morning, when air circulation should move the stagnant air and calm the conditions. But more snow is in the forecast for tomorrow.

El Paso Times (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Texas legislators urge tougher emission laws  	Brandi Grissom, El Paso Times, Texas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	425 words  	Jan. 27--AUSTIN -- Two Democratic Texas lawmakers urged tightening of vehicle emission standards in the Lone Star State on Monday on the heels of President Barack Obama's move toward allowing states to require cleaner cars. LiNeBrEaK"The time for action has long passed," said state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston.LiNeBrEaKObama ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine whether California and other states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards on carmakers to fight greenhouse gas emissions. The Bush administration had blocked the efforts by the states.LiNeBrEaKObama also said his administration would issue new fuel-efficiency requirements to cover 2011 model year vehicles.LiNeBrEaKEllis and state Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, have filed legislation that would implement emissions restrictions similar to the ones California has pushed for.LiNeBrEaKCarmakers and dealers said reducing greenhouse emissions was a great idea, but they were concerned about costly regulations and conflicting state and federal rules at a time when car sales are already struggling. U.S. auto sales fell 18 percent in 2008.LiNeBrEaKBut Jim Marston, regional director of the Texas office of Environmental Defense, said that argument doesn't hold water anymore because the future of American automakers depends on their ability to produce more efficient cars in the face of rising gas prices.LiNeBrEaKNew regulations, he said, could force them in the direction they need to go.LiNeBrEaKCleaner cars may cost more up front, Marston said, but in the long run, drivers would save with more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaK"Analysis shows that at an average price of $1. 74 per gallon, the standards will actually save consumers money," Marston said.LiNeBrEaKWen-Whai Li, chair of the University of Texas at El Paso civil engineering department, said tighter emissions restrictions would certainly improve air quality in the region.LiNeBrEaKBut, he said, the improvements would likely be limited by pollution from Juarez, where cars are likely older and less well maintained.LiNeBrEaK"Air quality doesn't have boundaries," Li said, "and air pollution does not recognize political boundaries."LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this story.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Legislature wary of emissions caps;  Republicans are especially hesitant to pass tougher standards. 	BRANDON LARRABEE  	Pg. A-7  	280 words  	TALLAHASSEE - Gov. Charlie Crist said Monday that President Barack Obama's embrace of tougher auto emissions standards paves the way for Florida to apply similar rules if the Legislature approves. LiNeBrEaK"Florida stands ready to assist the federal government in addressing this important issue," he said, "and we will continue our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy security and protect the state's environment."LiNeBrEaKBut Crist's fellow Republicans in the Legislature have already expressed reservations about adopting California-like emissions standards. Several lawmakers questioned the need for the proposal during a meeting of the House Energy and Utilities Policy Committee during the special session this month, both because they doubt most scientists' claims that climate change is taking place and because of the costs of the new technology.LiNeBrEaKRep. Jennifer Carroll, R-Fleming Island, repeated some of those concerns Monday after Obama's announcement, saying car companies would be forced to increase prices to pay for lower-emissions cars.LiNeBrEaK"The costs will trickle down to the citizens," she said.LiNeBrEaKCarroll said she didn't think Crist's proposal was likely to pass in the upcoming regular session, which begins in March.LiNeBrEaKRep. Lake Ray, R-Jacksonville, also said the measure would meet some resistance.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not sure that the Legislature will be in opposition, but I think there's going to be a lot of questions before there's going to be any legislation to come out," he said. " ... Why are we as a state moving forward with regulations that penalize the citizens of the state and, in some of the cases, seem to be unproven?"LiNeBrEaKbrandon.larrabee@jacksonville.com, (678) 977-3709	EMISSIONS (92%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (90%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (78%); AUTOMAKERS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); LEGISLATION (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (76%); PRICE INCREASES (53%)  			TALLAHASSEE, FL, USA (92%); JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA (90%) FLORIDA, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Florida Times-Union   		CHARLIE CRIST (92%); BARACK OBAMA (92%)  														
The Garden City Telegram (Kansas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Energetic moves  	The Garden City Telegram, Kan.  	COMMENTARY  	454 words  	Jan. 27--When it comes to climate change, President Obama has wasted no time in addressing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKObama targeted automakers Monday in asking the Environmental Protection Agency to review whether California and 13 other states should be allowed to impose auto emission standards that are tougher than federal guidelines in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. The Bush administration had blocked such efforts. LiNeBrEaKAllowing California a federal waiver to enact tougher emission standards would mean the other states could sign on. Together, they account for about half of the nation's auto sales.LiNeBrEaKObama also is poised to issue new fuel-efficiency requirements to cover 2011 vehicles.LiNeBrEaKIt's all part of his plan to be environmentally conscious while moving with conviction toward energy independence, something prior administrations (Republican and Democratic) failed to accomplish.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers reacting to Obama's plan at least expressed interest in reducing greenhouse gases, but remained wary of costly regulations and conflicting state and federal rules at a time car sales are slumping. Still, that reaction was better than a flat-out refusal from automakers who in the past filed lawsuits over emissions regulations.LiNeBrEaKIt would be easy to pass off Obama's interest in energy independence as more of the same from the White House. But with a new spirit of cooperation in Congress, perhaps there is a window of opportunity in pursuing real change.LiNeBrEaKThat leaves us to ask where the president is headed regarding coal-fired power plants singled out for their carbon dioxide emissions. An expansion plan proposed for the Sunflower Electric Power Corp. facility at Holcomb has been stymied by the state due to concern over CO2 emissions.LiNeBrEaKWhile campaigning, Obama said he supported finding cleaner ways to burn coal in generating energy. He's from Illinois, which is ninth among coal-producing states.LiNeBrEaKObama said the nation needs to invest in clean coal technologies for use here and throughout the world. That sounds like someone who, while he may want to reduce greenhouse gases, still understands the need for coal in any future energy policy.LiNeBrEaKFor those who support the Sunflower expansion and the positive impact it would bring, that should at least add up to cautious optimism -- with an emphasis on cautious.

LiNeBrEaKDuring a ceremony in the White House East Room, Obama signed a directive requiring the agency immediately to review that December 2007 decision denying California permission to limit carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who pushed unsuccessfully for tougher car emissions standards in the 2007 legislative session, says his measure may have a better chance this session now that one key obstacle -- federal opposition -- is likely to disappear.LiNeBrEaK"It's an uphill battle to get the votes in the House and in the Senate," Ellis acknowledged. "But on my side in the Senate, members who in the past were very reluctant to consider environmental legislation have gotten much more educated, as I've seen in private conversations."LiNeBrEaKEllis' legislation would adopt all of California's proposed emissions standards, as the 13 other states already have and several more are considering.LiNeBrEaKRep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, has filed an identical bill in the House.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia got early startLiNeBrEaKCalifornia has been allowed to impose tougher auto emissions standards for many years because the state started regulating emissions before federal standards were set.LiNeBrEaKUpdates to the standards required waivers from the EPA, which granted them regularly until 2007.LiNeBrEaKThat year the agency blocked an update, as the Bush administration took the position that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would best be controlled at the federal level.LiNeBrEaKThe new EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, will have to go through a formal review process before making any decision, but Obama made clear Monday he expects the state's regulations will be approved.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's rules would require automakers to reduce greenhouse gases from vehicles 18 percent by 2020 and 27 percent by 2030.LiNeBrEaKTo do that they would have to raise fuel economy to a fleetwide average of 36 miles per gallon even earlier, by 2016.LiNeBrEaKCongress passed vehicle emissions standards in 2007 that would affect all cars sold in the U.S., but California would raise the standards sooner.LiNeBrEaKIndustry groups opposeLiNeBrEaKAdopting the California standard in Texas would cost new-car buyers about $7 more per month if they financed a car over five years, Ellis said, but they would save up to $18 per month in fuel costs based on $1. 74 per gallon of gas.LiNeBrEaKMany industry groups expressed opposition to the administration's move.LiNeBrEaKThe American Petroleum Institute said it "supports President Obama's desire to fortify the nation's energy security with a comprehensive energy policy" and said that since 2000 the oil and gas industry has invested $42 billion in "zero- and low-carbon" research and development. But the action contemplated in Monday's announcement isn't the best approach, the group said.LiNeBrEaK"Creating a patchwork regulatory structure across multiple states would most likely impose higher costs on consumers, slow economic growth and kill U.S. jobs," the trading group said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKAnd carmakers have complained that developing vehicles that comply would cost billions of dollars.LiNeBrEaKBut if the EPA agrees to California's standards, Texas likely will be affected regardless of whether the Legislature approves Ellis' measure. The 14 states that have adopted the tougher emissions standards represent more than half the nation's population, so the practical effect of EPA approval of California's rules would be to force automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards across their fleet.LiNeBrEaKA boon to refineries?LiNeBrEaKThat means carmakers likely would spread out the overall higher costs throughout all their vehicles, even those sold in states that didn't sign on.LiNeBrEaK"We'll be paying the bills without getting the benefits," said Tom "Smitty" Smith, director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, Texas.LiNeBrEaK"Why should we be stuck with the oldest, dirtiest technology in our vehicles?"LiNeBrEaKAdopting the auto emission rules actually might be a boon to the Houston area's many refineries and chemical plants as the region works to meet current and future federal air quality standards.LiNeBrEaK"Anything we can do to reduce the emissions from mobile sources in Texas would take a big burden off the reductions stationary sources would have to make," Strama said during a news conference in Austin on Monday.LiNeBrEaKZachary Coile of the Washington Bureau contributed to this story.LiNeBrEaKtom.fowler@chron.com	VEHICLE EMISSIONS (95%); EMISSIONS (92%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (92%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (92%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (91%); LEGISLATION (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (78%); APPROVALS (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); AUTOMAKERS (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (74%); MOTOR VEHICLES (73%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (73%)  		Government  	AUSTIN, TX, USA (79%); HOUSTON, TX, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); TEXAS, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 27, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090127-HO-Car-emissions-order-could-affect-Texas-motorists-0127  	Newspaper  	HO  	2009 The Houston Chronicle   	HOUSTON TEXANS (84%); US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (58%); A BETTER CHANCE (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); LISA P JACKSON (52%)  														
The Houston Chronicle 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Green states' rights;  Policy reversal will free states to tighten vehicle mileage and emissions standards. 	STAFF  	B; Pg. 8  	498 words  	Responding to an appeal by California's Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, President Barack Obama indicated he will remove Bush administration barriers that prevented states from imposing tougher auto fuel-efficiency and emission standards than the federal government. LiNeBrEaKIt is a welcome decision that will put the United States back on the road toward an environmentally sound energy policy and spur the American auto industry to produce the vehicles that customers are demanding.LiNeBrEaKThe new president directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review its previous decision to deny a waiver to California that would allow the state to enforce tougher standards on new cars sold there. Because the state imposed regulations before Congress enacted the 1967 Clean Air Act, it had been allowed to enforce its own rules. Other states had the option of enforcing either the California or federal requirements.LiNeBrEaKIn 2002, California enacted a law requiring automakers to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle tailpipes in new cars and light trucks beginning this year. The legislation aims for a one-third reduction in emissions and minimum mileage of 35 miles per gallon by 2016.LiNeBrEaKAs with the earlier California law, the 2002 law required a federal waiver. But after years of routinely granting them, the Bush White House refused, at the urging of the auto industry, even though EPA staff had recommended it be granted. California then sued in federal court challenging that decision. The president's new policy direction will likely render that litigation moot.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Obama, the move is part of a comprehensive effort to create thousands of new jobs while ensuring that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built in the United States.LiNeBrEaK"California has shown bold and bipartisan leadership through its efforts to forge 21st century standards, and over a dozen states have followed its lead," stated the president. "But instead of serving as a partner, Washington stood in their way."LiNeBrEaKIn a pointed reference to his predecessor's undercutting of efforts to address climate change, Obama said, "My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger applauded Obama's decision, saying both the environment and consumers will be the winners and his state now has a strong ally in the White House.LiNeBrEaKComing from George W. Bush, a president whose party traditionally defends the regulatory rights of individual states, the opposition to the California standards made neither philosophical nor environmental sense. With that barrier being removed, Texas lawmakers should consider allowing the Lone Star State to embrace the stronger auto standards.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, unsuccessfully proposed legislation in the previous session to do just that. With the bipartisan example of Obama and Schwarzenegger as inspiration, this session legislators should vote to give Texans the same right to cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Comic-book writer hopes for big break  	Rebecca Kimitch, Staff Writer  	NEWS  	278 words  	Like writers across the Southland, San Dimas resident Shannon Cronin, 30, has had screenplays languishing in his computer for years.LiNeBrEaKBut instead of letting those dreams die inside the circuitry on his desk, the computer programmer recently decided to try a new media, one that he has loved for years: comic books. LiNeBrEaKAnd already those ideas are coming to life.LiNeBrEaKCronin's comic Lifespan is competing in an online contest by DC Comic's Zuda.com for the chance to be published. If it gets the most votes, it will be put to print.LiNeBrEaKThe story is unique. Lifespan creates a alternate reality in which global leaders have responded to overpopulation, a collapsing economy and global warming by setting everyone's lifespan at 77. 5 years. At that age, you must surrender your life, or be hunted down and executed.LiNeBrEaKIn this reality, money is no longer used to buy what you want or need. Instead, you pay for new cars, beautiful homes, or even children with days, months, or years off your life expectancy.LiNeBrEaKLifespan is currently in fourth place. Cronin doesn't expect it will rise any higher on the list before the contest ends on Friday.LiNeBrEaKBut the Covina native and Charter Oak High School graduate is confident it has a future. Getting into the big comic names like DC and Marvel may be tough, but he might find a home with an independent publisher, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There are a lot of people who say they want to do it, but don't actually follow their dream and get out there and do it ... so I am hoping my chances are pretty good," he said.LiNeBrEaKSo how many years of his life would Cronin be willing to pay for comic book success?LiNeBrEaK"That's a really tough question," he said. "This is definitely my dream."

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Obama sides with states: EPA ordered to re-examine tougher auto emission standards that were nixed by Bush.  	Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	601 words  	Jan. 27--After less than a week in office, President Barack Obama has moved aggressively to wipe away one of the most noxious anti-environmental policies of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, the president ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine whether California and 13 other states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia clashed repeatedly with the Bush administration over this issue. LiNeBrEaKThe state approved a historic greenhouse gas control measure in 2007 that required cars sold in this state to reduce the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide they emitted.LiNeBrEaKThe new standards would force car manufacturers to reduce emissions by 30 percent in new cars and trucks sold in California by 2016.LiNeBrEaKOther states followed California's lead.LiNeBrEaKBut car manufacturers, with the backing of the Bush administration, sued, arguing in court that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant that could be regulated by the Clean Air Act. The courts backed California.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, to impose the new, tougher regulations, California still needed a waiver from the federal EPA.LiNeBrEaKIgnoring the advice of its agency scientists, the Bush administration consistently refused to grant it.LiNeBrEaKBy ordering a review of that decision, Obama made clear he's ready to change the policy.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said, "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKObama Monday also ordered a speedup of new auto efficiency standards approved by Congress in 2007. The new rules would require new cars to achieve 35 miles per gallon on average beginning in 2020. Obama wants the guidelines to start affecting cars as early as 2011.LiNeBrEaKBush administration officials had estimated it would cost the industry $100 billion to retool to meet the new standard. With two of the biggest car companies, General Motors and Chrysler, close to financial collapse, critics of the Obama orders say the companies cannot afford to comply.LiNeBrEaKWhen auto companies were flying high, producing behemoth gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and trucks, they offered other excuses. The public, auto executives claimed, would not buy energy-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKNow, with the big gas guzzlers languishing unsold on showroom floors, they claim they can't afford to retool.LiNeBrEaKIn reality, they can't afford to do otherwise. If there is going to be an auto industry in this country, it must adapt to a much more energy-efficient future.LiNeBrEaKBut the issue goes beyond the economic self-interest of car companies.LiNeBrEaKThe nation cannot afford to continue to drive inefficient cars that require massive amounts of gasoline refined from oil that comes from countries that are hostile to us.LiNeBrEaKSuch wastefulness threatens our security and our economy. It produces global warming greenhouse gases that threaten out planet.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKSadly, the change is coming much later than it needed to. That will make it harder for the car companies to adapt, but adapt they must.

Messenger-Inquirer (Owensboro, Kentucky)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Columnist speaks on economy, globalization at OCTC lecture  	Keith Lawrence, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	358 words  	Jan. 27--President Barack Obama's green technology strategy "sounds better than it is," columnist Robert Samuelson told more than 100 people Monday night at Owensboro Community and Technical College. LiNeBrEaKThe self-described "global-warming skeptic" said that "with the technologies we have today, there's very little chance that we can reduce emissions enough to make a real difference."LiNeBrEaKThe population continues to grow, meaning more automobiles, more homes, more offices and more factories, he said.LiNeBrEaKAnd China, India and Africa, which are starting to see more prosperity, aren't likely to reduce their industrial output, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe columnist for The Washington Post and Newsweek discussed globalization in the college's Blandford Hall.LiNeBrEaK"We are clearly the most powerful country on the face of the earth right now," he said. "We're a very rich, prosperous society, but we're in what may be the deepest recession since World War II."LiNeBrEaKGlobalization, also known as free trade, has "probably diminished our power," he said.LiNeBrEaKBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, free trade had many American industries feeling threatened -- shoes, textiles, steel and consumer electronics among them, Samuelson said.LiNeBrEaKToday, he said, "newspaper reporters have become the steelworkers of the 1970s," with their jobs threatened by changes in technology.LiNeBrEaKSamuelson said trillions of dollars flow between countries these days in trade.LiNeBrEaK"Overwhelmingly, there have been more winners than losers in globalization," he said.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   01 EDITION	Obama orders push towards greener, more efficient cars  		A; Pg. 08  	395 words  	Obama orders push towards greener, more efficient carsLiNeBrEaKAssociated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama opened an ambitious, double-barreled assault on global warming and U.S. energy woes Monday, moving quickly toward rules requiring cleaner-running cars that guzzle less gas - a must, he said, for "our security, our economy and our planet." LiNeBrEaKHe also vowed to succeed where a long line of predecessors had failed in slowing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKStarting his second week in office, Obama took a major step toward allowing California and other states to target greenhouse gases through more stringent auto emission standards, and he ordered new federal rules directing automakers to start making more fuel-efficient cars as required by law.LiNeBrEaKThe auto industry responded warily. Reducing planet-warming emissions is a great idea, carmakers and dealers said, but they expressed deep concern about costly regulations and conflicting state and federal rules at a time when people already are not buying cars. U.S. auto sales plunged 18 percent in 2008.LiNeBrEaKAnd industry analysts said the changes could cost consumers thousands of dollars - for smaller, "greener" cars.LiNeBrEaKObama on Monday directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review whether California and more than a dozen states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards on carmakers to fight greenhouse gas emissions. The Bush administration had blocked the efforts by the states, which account for about half of the nation's auto sales.LiNeBrEaKThe new president also said his administration would issue new fuel-efficiency requirements to cover 2011 model year vehicles.LiNeBrEaKObama's order for an EPA review of California's case could shake up the auto industry - 13 other states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's standards, and others are considering them. If California gets a federal waiver to enact tougher emissions standards, the other states could then sign on.LiNeBrEaKAlso, Obama directed federal transportation officials to get going on new fuel efficiency rules, which will affect cars produced and sold for the 2011 model year. That step was needed to enforce a 2007 energy law, which calls for cars and trucks to be more efficient every year, to at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.LiNeBrEaKAP GRAPHICLiNeBrEaKStates adopt tough fuel standardsLiNeBrEaKSources: Department of Energy; Department of Transportation	EMISSIONS (92%); AUTOMAKERS (91%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (90%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (89%); MOTOR VEHICLES (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (77%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  			CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); ALABAMA, USA (79%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%); EARTH (73%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	February 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  	mbr  	2009 The Mobile Press Register Inc.

The Montana Standard (Butte)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Montana Tech profs receive grant to study carbon sequestration  	Nick Gevock, The Montana Standard, Butte  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	554 words  	Jan. 27--BUTTE (LEE)_Carbon sequestration may be the wave of the future in energy development and professors at Montana Tech will be part of researching how best to do it.LiNeBrEaKWith concerns about global warming rising, the concept of injecting carbon dioxide -- a byproduct of cars and industry -- back into the ground to keep it out of the atmosphere is getting a lot of attention these days.LiNeBrEaK"It's not too far in the future," Martha Apple, associate professor of biology at Montana Tech, said of carbon re-injection. "That's been used by the petroleum industry for a while." LiNeBrEaKBut gaining a better understanding of how the technique will affect the environment is needed before the technology can improve.LiNeBrEaKTo that end, Apple and two others at Montana Tech are part of collaboration with Montana State University-Bozeman and the University of Montana-Missoula to conduct research on carbon sequestration.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Energy recently awarded $1. 4 million for the research to MSU, which is leading the project. The main site for the research is MSU in Bozeman.LiNeBrEaKBut Montana Tech professors will have their hand in the research.LiNeBrEaKFor Mary North-Abbott, professor of petroleum engineering, the focus will be on determining how injecting carbon dioxide into the ground affects the rocks there. She'll be taking core samples of rock and injecting it with liquefied carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK"We're actually going to build an apparatus where we can actually test cores," she said. "We're looking at them to see what the physical attributes are, the pore space, and the grain size."LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide is already used by the petroleum industry to aid in the recovery of oil. It gets injected in the ground to help make it easier to recover oil, North-Abbott said.LiNeBrEaK"It makes it flow better and easier to recover," she said.LiNeBrEaKIn Wyoming, for example, a pipeline was recently constructed to get carbon dioxide to some of the oilfields.LiNeBrEaKBut carbon dioxide is also thought to be one of the leading contributors to global climate change. Gov. Brian Schweitzer has spoken often about the need to develop carbon sequestration technology.LiNeBrEaKMost of the current research on sequestration focuses on the methods to inject it into the ground, said Xiaobing Zhou, Tech assistant professor of geophysics. But he and Apple are looking at how leaks in areas where carbon dioxide is injected affects plants.LiNeBrEaKApple last year collected sample of grasses, alfalfa and other plants at the site. They put tubes coming up from the ground to simulate a natural leak.LiNeBrEaKShe said although it's early in the study, the tests have shown that there could be some effect.LiNeBrEaK"Grasses around here have a seasonal dieback that they go through in late summer and it may make that happen earlier," she said.LiNeBrEaKNorth-Abbott received $219,500 for her research that will go on for three years. Apple and Zhou received $146,000.LiNeBrEaK- Reporter Nick Gevock may be reached at nick.gevock@mtstandard.com	RESEARCH (90%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (89%); PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (78%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (78%); ENGINEERING (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (77%); PETROLEUM and COAL PRODUCTS MFG (74%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (73%); GRANTS and GIFTS (72%); PHYSICS (67%)  		General  	MONTANA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 27, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090127-BU-Montana-Tech-profs-receive-grant-to-study-carbon-sequestration-0127  	Newspaper  	BU  	2009 The Montana Standard   	MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY (56%); UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA (56%)  	BRIAN SCHWEITZER (52%)

Paterson said yesterday.  LiNeBrEaKObama ordered his environmental officials to review a decision by the Bush administration that barred New York and California from adopting tougher standards against tailpipe pollution than does the federal government - the first step in overturning the ruling. LiNeBrEaKBloomberg, who has pushed a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the city, called the move a "great victory" to curb global warming and cut the consumption of foreign oil. LiNeBrEaKThe mayor said the new standards would reduce the city's greenhouse gases by up to 6 percent by 2030. LiNeBrEaKSaid Paterson, "The race to cut greenhouse gas emissions begins anew today." LiNeBrEaKObama also ordered new federal anti-pollution guidelines so all cars get at least 35 mpg nationally by 2020.

The New York Times 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday  Correction Appended  	Geography Is Dividing Democrats Over Energy  	By JOHN M. BRODER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1  	1372 words  	Late Edition - FinalLiNeBrEaKPresident Obama is moving quickly to act on the environmental promises that were a centerpiece of his campaign. But tackling global warming will be far more difficult -- and more costly -- than the new emissions standards for automobiles he ordered with the stroke of a pen on Monday. LiNeBrEaK  Already, the Congressional Democrats Mr. Obama will need to carry out his mandate are feuding with one another.LiNeBrEaK  By coincidence or design, most of the policy makers on Capitol Hill and in the administration charged with shaping legislation to address global warming come from California or the East Coast,  regions that lead the country in environmental regulation and the push for renewable energy sources. LiNeBrEaK  That is a problem, says a group of Democratic lawmakers from the Midwest and Plains States, which are heavily dependent on coal and manufacturing. The lawmakers have banded together to fight legislation they think might further damage their  economies.LiNeBrEaK  ''There's a bias in our Congress and government against manufacturing, or at least indifference to us, especially on the coasts,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. ''It's up to those of us in the Midwest to show how important manufacturing is. If we pass a climate bill the wrong way, it will hurt American jobs and the American economy, as more and more production jobs go to places like China, where it's cheaper.''LiNeBrEaK  This brown state-green state clash is likely to encumber any effort to set a mandatory ceiling on the carbon dioxide emissions blamed as the biggest contributor to global warming,  something Mr. Obama has declared to be one of his highest priorities. Mr. Obama has said he intends to press ahead on such an initiative, despite opposition within his own party in Congress and divisions among some of his advisers over the timing, scope and cost of legislation to curb carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK  The centrist Democrats who urge a slower-paced approach represent states that are crucial electoral battlegrounds and that stand to lose the most from such regulation. They say they believe that global warming is a serious threat and they will support legislation to address the problem -- but not at the expense of their already-strained workers and industries.LiNeBrEaK  These Democrats  are concerned, they say, that climate bills will be written by committees in the House and Senate led by two liberal California Democrats, Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Henry A. Waxman, and shaped by Mr. Obama's team of environmental and energy advisers, virtually all of whom are from California or the East Coast.LiNeBrEaK  For decades, California has led the nation in environmental regulation, including the  most sweeping effort to address global warming by imposing mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2012. LiNeBrEaK  Following California's lead, a group of Northeastern States have created a partnership known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to control carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK  But California and many East Coast States also differ sharply in the extent to which they depend on coal -- a fossil fuel that is a major culprit in producing carbon emissions. California, for example, derived only 20. 7 percent of its electricity from coal and 40 percent from hydroelectric power and renewable sources in 2005, while Ohio drew 86 percent of its electricity from coal that year, according to the Department of Energy. Other states of the Great Lakes and Plains are much more like Ohio than California in energy usage.LiNeBrEaK  In the space of a single afternoon this month, Ms. Boxer, Mr. Waxman and the House speaker Nancy Pelosi, another California Democrat, issued statements declaring their intent to work with Mr. Obama to act quickly on comprehensive climate and energy legislation, with a goal of passage this year. Mr. Waxman said he expected to move a climate bill out of his Energy and Commerce Committee by Memorial Day. Ms. Boxer said ''the writing is on the wall that legislation to combat global warming is coming soon.''LiNeBrEaK  Rahm Emanuel, the new White House chief of staff, endorsed the lawmakers' timetable and said he believed the goal of passage of a broad climate change bill this year was ''realistic,'' given the substantial Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama and leaders in Congress have endorsed a so-called cap-and-trade system in which power plant owners and other polluters could meet limits on heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from more efficient producers.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama's energy and environmental advisers include Lisa P. Jackson, the former head of the New Jersey environmental agency who will head the Environmental Protection Agency; Steven Chu, former director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, who is the new secretary of energy; and Nancy Sutley, former deputy mayor of Los Angeles for environmental affairs, the new chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK  Carol M. Browner, who will occupy the new post of White House coordinator for climate and energy policy, is a former head of the E.P.A., a former director of Florida's environmental agency and was a senior adviser to former Vice President Al Gore.LiNeBrEaK  The appointees come to office with a mandate from the president to transform the nation's energy economy and to lead the world in addressing climate change.LiNeBrEaK  But their ambitions confront a brutal reality of a weak economy, fading public concern about climate change and serious qualms within their own party about the costs of taking on global warming and who will pay them.LiNeBrEaK  They will also have to deal with bruised feelings among many Democrats over the coup Mr. Waxman mounted last November to wrest the gavel of the Energy and Commerce Committee from its longtime leader, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and a longtime champion of the auto industry and other Midwest manufacturers.LiNeBrEaK  ''For us, it's still a big disappointment,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, referring to the unseating of Mr. Dingell, who was pursuing a more moderate climate proposal than those advocated by Ms. Boxer and Mr. Waxman.LiNeBrEaK  ''My message over all is that for us to support what needs to be done in addressing global warming we need to demonstrate that, in fact, jobs are created,'' Ms. Stabenow said. ''It's not a theoretical argument. We have to come up with a policy that makes sense, that is manageable on the cost end, that creates new technology -- and that treats states equitably and addresses regional differences.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Stabenow is a leader of the so-called Gang of 10, representing the coal-dependent states in the middle of the country; the group was formed after the failure of a Senate global warming bill pushed by Ms. Boxer last June. The members' goal is to assure that their concerns are met in any future legislation.LiNeBrEaK  The other original members are Senators Brown of Ohio, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, Carl Levin of Michigan, Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Jim Webb of Virginia, Evan Bayh of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and Ben Nelson of Nebraska.LiNeBrEaK  In the fall, six more Democratic senators joined the group:  Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Ken Salazar of Colorado.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Salazar has since left the Senate to become secretary of the interior.LiNeBrEaK  ''We will play an important role in the final bill,'' Ms. Stabenow said.LiNeBrEaK  Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been a leader in Congress on environmental matters for three decades, has been assigned by Mr. Waxman to write the House's version of global warming legislation. Mr. Markey said he was very aware of the concerns of coal-state Democrats.LiNeBrEaK  He noted that Mr. Obama, who comes from Illinois, a coal-dependent state, had traveled to Ohio last week to speak at a factory that produces parts for wind turbines.LiNeBrEaK  ''Every single wind turbine takes 26 tons of steel to construct,'' Mr. Markey said. ''A lot of new jobs will be created if we craft a piece of global warming legislation correctly, and that is our intention.''

The New York Times 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Detroit Calls Emissions Proposals Too Strict  	By NICK BUNKLEY  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3  	823 words  	Automakers said Monday that they were working toward President Obama's goal of reducing fuel consumption, but rapid imposition of stricter emissions standards could force them to drastically cut production of larger, more profitable vehicles, adding to their financial duress.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama ordered the government on Monday to reconsider whether California and other states could regulate vehicle emissions to help control greenhouse gas emissions, a reversal of a position taken by the Bush administration. LiNeBrEaK  The announcement came as General Motors and Chrysler are borrowing billions of dollars from the government to avoid bankruptcy, and as Toyotaprepares to report its first operating loss in 70 years. Shortly after the president spoke, General Motors said it would cut 2,000 jobs at plants in Michigan and Ohio because of slow sales.LiNeBrEaK  The California regulations, if enacted today, ''would basically kill the industry,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, an independent research organization in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''It would have a devastating effect on everybody, and not just the domestics.''LiNeBrEaK  But Mr. Cole said he thought major modifications to the proposed standards were likely and that action was still ''a long ways off,'' giving the carmakers more time to overcome their financial problems and develop the technologies needed to sell a full lineup of compliant vehicles. LiNeBrEaK  Right now, carmakers say they would be able to sell only their smallest, most fuel-efficient cars  -- models like the Toyota Prius, a hybrid whose sales have fallen sharply since gas prices began dropping last fall  -- because once-popular  vehicles like pickup trucks made by Ford and G.M. are not efficient enough.LiNeBrEaK  ''I want clean air and clean water just like the next guy,'' said Erich Merkle, an independent automotive analyst in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''But in the real world, there would be consumer outrage with the fact that they're limited to maybe two vehicles and there's nothing there that would meet their family's needs.''LiNeBrEaK  Environmental advocates who have long challenged the automakers' opposition to the proposed California standards say such regulations  will help the companies produce vehicles that consumers want. LiNeBrEaK  Failing to invest in reducing emissions and increasing efficiency will only prolong Detroit's problems, said David Doniger, climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaK  ''I think this is the pathway to their survival,'' Mr. Doniger said. ''If carmakers are going to survive in a world of volatile oil prices and global warming, they have to be making more efficient vehicles. When the economy comes back and people start buying cars again, they're going to expect that gas prices are going to go up, and they're not going to want the gas hogs that they used to want. Consumers' tastes have changed in terms of what's cool.''LiNeBrEaK  One concern automakers have with states regulating tailpipe emissions is that keeping up with a hodgepodge of standards  would be difficult. They expressed support Monday for the ideal of cutting emissions but want their engineers to be concerned with meeting just one set of requirements nationally.LiNeBrEaK  The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 11 carmakers, said it favored ''a nationwide program that bridges state and federal concerns and moves all stakeholders forward, and we are ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach,'' in a statement from the group's chief executive, Dave McCurdy.LiNeBrEaK  G.M., the only Detroit automaker to issue its own response Monday, said it was ''working aggressively on the products and the advance technologies that match the nation's and consumers' priorities to save energy and reduce emissions.'' But the company also emphasized the need for ''a comprehensive policy discussion that takes into account the development pace of new technologies, alternative fuels and market and economic factors.''LiNeBrEaK  Automakers are operating in the worst market since the early 1980s. New vehicle sales fell nearly 19 percent in 2008 and are universally expected to be even lower in 2009.LiNeBrEaK  Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, who has long been one of the Detroit automakers' strongest allies in Washington, praised the president's attitude  toward global warmingand expressed hope that the administration would act only after  studying the effect that ''setting a patchwork of different emission standards'' would have.LiNeBrEaK  ''President Obama and I both share the goal of energy independence and a cleaner environment for our children and grandchildren,'' Mr. Dingell said in a statement. ''We have a unique opportunity in history to address the issue of global climate change and we must take bold and balanced action.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Cole, the Center for Automotive research chairman, said he believed Congress would ensure Detroit would be able to live with any new standards.

The New York Times 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	New Day on Climate Change  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; Pg. 30  	475 words  	In one dramatic stroke, President Obama has removed any doubts that he intends to break sharply from President George W. Bush's policies on yet another vital issue -- this time repudiating Mr. Bush's passive approach to climate change. At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to consider immediately California's application to set its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks. Mr. Bush had rejected that application. LiNeBrEaK  Once California receives permission to move ahead -- as it surely will -- 13 states, and possibly more, are expected to impose similar rules. The result will be to force automakers here and overseas to begin producing cars and trucks that are considerably more fuel efficient than today's models and on a faster timetable. LiNeBrEaK  The California decision is of great significance not only for that reason but for what it says about Mr. Obama's commitment to the cause of reversing the rise in greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush began his tenure by breaking a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide and by withdrawing the United States from the Kyoto agreement on climate change. Mr. Obama begins his with a clear signal that he will not hesitate to use the regulatory levers provided by the Clean Air Act and other federal statutes to fight global warming. LiNeBrEaK  California has long had the right to set stronger air pollution standards than the rest of the nation, provided it has federal permission. Its earlier requests to set stronger air pollution standards were routinely approved, but in this case the Bush administration said no, dredging up all manner of arguments to support its case. One was that California had not demonstrated ''extraordinary and compelling'' reasons to limit greenhouse gases; another was that a national regulatory system was preferable to state-by-state laws -- even though the administration itself had shown no interest whatsoever in a national system. LiNeBrEaK  In a companion move, Mr. Obama directed the Transportation Department to finalize the interim nationwide fuel-efficiency standards called for in the 2007 energy bill. These standards would eventually require fuel-efficiency increases in the American car and light-truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon by 2020 from the current average of 27 m.p.g. The California standards would require automakers to reach the same 35 m.p.g. target four years ahead of the federal timetable. LiNeBrEaK  The California rules cannot by themselves stop the rise in greenhouse gases. In addition to regulatory controls, Mr. Obama must eventually embrace a broader strategy involving major federal investments in clean-energy technologies and, down the road, some effort to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in order to unlock private investment. But after eight years of inaction, this is a wonderful start.

The New York Times 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Emissions Cut Won't Bring Quick Relief, Scientists Say  	By CORNELIA DEAN  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 21  	658 words  	Many people who worry about global warming hope that once emissions of heat-trapping gases decline, the problems they cause will quickly begin to abate. LiNeBrEaK  Now researchers are saying that such hope is ill-founded, at least with regard to carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK  Because of the way carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere and in the oceans, and the way the atmosphere and the oceans interact, patterns that are established at peak levels will produce problems like ''inexorable sea level rise'' and Dust-Bowl-like droughts for at least a thousand years, the researchers are reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. LiNeBrEaK  ''That peak would be the minimum you would be locking yourself into,'' said Susan Solomon, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who led the work.LiNeBrEaK  The researchers describe what will happen if the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide -- the principal heat-trapping gas emission -- reaches 450 to 600 parts per million, up from about 385 p.p.m.  today. Most climate researchers consider 450 p.p.m. virtually inevitable and 600 p.p.m. difficult to avoid by midcentury if the use of fossil fuels continues at anything like its present rate. LiNeBrEaK  At 450 p.p.m., the researchers say, rising seas will threaten many coastal areas, and Southern Europe, North Africa, the Southwestern United States and Western Australia could expect 10 percent less rainfall. LiNeBrEaK  ''Ten percent may not seem like a high number,'' Dr. Solomon said Monday in a telephone news conference, ''but it is the kind of number that has been seen in major droughts in the past, like the Dust Bowl.'' LiNeBrEaK  At 600 p.p.m., there might be perhaps 15 percent less rain, she said. LiNeBrEaK  In 1850, atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 280 p.p.m., a level scientists say had not been exceeded in at least the previous 800,000 years.LiNeBrEaK  In their paper, Dr. Solomon and her colleagues say they confined their estimates to known data and effects. For example, they based their sea level estimates largely on the expansion of seawater as it warms, a relatively straightforward calculation, rather than including the contributions of glacial runoff or melting inland ice sheets -- more difficult to predict but potentially far greater contributors to sea level rise.LiNeBrEaK  The new work dealt only with the effects of carbon dioxide, which is responsible for about half of greenhouse warming. Gases like chlorofluorocarbons and methane, along with soot and other pollutants, contribute to the rest. These substances are far less persistent in the atmosphere; if these emissions drop, their effects will decline relatively fast.LiNeBrEaK  Michael Oppenheimer, a geoscientist at Princeton, praised the report in an e-mail message as a ''remarkably clear and direct'' discussion of whether it would be possible to temporarily exceed a level like 450 p.p.m. and then reduce emissions in time to avoid catastrophic events like the collapse of a major inland ice sheet.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Oppenheimer said the new analysis showed that ''some dangerous consequences could be triggered and persist for a long, long time, even if emissions were cut radically.''LiNeBrEaK  ''Policy makers need to understand,'' he continued, ''that in some ways once we are over the cliff, there's nothing to stop the fall.''LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Solomon said it would be wrong to view the report as evidence that it was already too late to do much good by reducing carbon emissions. ''You have to think of this stuff as being more like nuclear waste than acid rain,'' she said. LiNeBrEaK  Acid rain began to abate when pollution contributing to it was limited. But just as nuclear waste remains radioactive for a long time, the effects of carbon dioxide persist. LiNeBrEaK  ''So if we slow it down,'' she said, ''we have more time to find solutions.''LiNeBrEaK  For example, engineers may one day discover ways to remove the gas from the atmosphere. But ''those solutions are not now in hand,'' Dr. Solomon said. ''They are quite speculative.''

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: A return to reason on clean air rules  	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	COMMENTARY  	492 words  	Jan. 27--President Barack Obama can't help but look good against his predecessor's do-nothing record on climate change, but give him credit for the speed at which he is moving to break with the Bush administration's disastrous policies. LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Obama effectively unraveled one of President Bush's more overt concessions to the auto industry -- the rejection of 14 states' request for the authority to impose stricter car emission standards.LiNeBrEaKObama ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its denial, making a reversal all but certain.LiNeBrEaKThe tougher standards -- sought by California and Washington, among others -- would drive improvements in fuel efficiency and greenhouse emissions to roughly half the nation's automobile market. Allowing states to tailor pollution standards to their needs and objectives isn't some new bold policy of the Obama administration. Rather, it's a return to the status quo that governed administration of the Clean Air Act for decades.LiNeBrEaKThe 2007 decision by Bush's EPA director, Stephen L. Johnson, to deny the states the power to go above and beyond federal emission curbs was a triumph of politics over legality and precedent.LiNeBrEaKJohnson's own attorneys and scientists were telling him to grant the waiver. So was history. Federal law allows states to seek waivers if they can demonstrate that more restrictive regulations are needed to address air pollution problems. The federal government has routinely granted California's requests -- more than 50 over the past 40 years.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration defended its decision by pointing to federal standards set to take effect in 2020. It argued that separate state emission standards would only create "a confusing patchwork."LiNeBrEaKBut in reality the only confusion was among EPA officials trying to justify the denial. That "patchwork" was more two-tone than rainbow-colored. States would either pick the California standards or the federal standards. Carmakers have long been manufacturing cars for both markets.LiNeBrEaKJohnson's decision may have succeeded only in buying the automobile industry a few years. California's standards were originally meant to take effect for 2009 car models. On Monday, Obama ordered temporary regulations written by March so that automakers can have cars that meet the stricter emissions standards ready by 2011.LiNeBrEaKStates that have chosen to step into the void created by eight years of federal inaction on climate change should have their efforts encouraged, not stifled. Obama apparently gets that. What a welcome change.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Sunrise Edition	The wrong road to reducing emissions A CAP-AND-TRADE SYSTEM  	Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, represents Oregon's 4th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.  	Editorial; Pg. B05  	588 words  	PETER DEFAZIO  IN MY OPINION  The wrong road toLiNeBrEaKreducing emissionsLiNeBrEaKA CAP-AND-TRADE SYSTEMLiNeBrEaKD eregulation brought a meltdown in our electricity markets with market manipulation, profiteering and higher costs to consumers without benefits. Remember Enron? Deregulation was also a major contributor to the recent Wall Street-led financial crisis. Now powerful forces in Washington, D.C., and Salem are pushing a market-based (read unregulated) cap-and-trade system to address the problem of climate change.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade system works by setting a cap on greenhouse gas emissions and then giving participants credits to pollute up to the established cap. Participants may buy, trade and sell credits in an unregulated market to meet their emission targets. In theory, emissions will drop as the number of credits available each year is reduced. It's a good idea on paper. LiNeBrEaKBut like deregulated U.S. energy and financial markets, a cap-and-trade system is prone to market manipulation. Alarmingly, cap-and-trade proposals being considered in Washington, D.C., and Salem would allow unregulated entities --such as investment banks and hedge funds --to participate in the market. These entities --really, speculators --don't have emissions to cut. Their goal is to make profits.LiNeBrEaKSpeculation has been ruinous in Europe where a cap-and-trade system was implemented in 2005. Unregulated entities are profiting at the expense of regulated businesses by buying up credits to pollute, hoarding them until the price increases, and then selling them for inflated returns. The result? Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise despite $60 billion worth of credits being traded in the lucrative European market each year. The cost of business is rising and consumers are paying the premium.LiNeBrEaKApply this to a U.S. market, expected to be three times the size of Europe's. The opportunities for economic competitors with large reserves of dollars (think China and Saudi Arabia) to manipulate and abuse the market would be enormous. Similarly, the possibilities are ripe for a few powerful speculators to bring Oregon's small market to its knees.LiNeBrEaKTo add insult to injury, proposals in Washington, D.C., and Oregon would give a large portion of the pollution credits to the energy industry based on historical emission levels free of charge. The idea is to cushion the fall in profits for regulated entities when they start to cut emissions. This works out to a potential $100 billion giveaway to the oil, gas and coal industries in the first year alone of a nationwide system. Total giveaways to industry through the life of the market would be mind-numbing, making the Wall Street bailout seem like pocket change.LiNeBrEaKDespite these obvious problems, federal and state lawmakers are poised to move forward with a cap-and-trade system. I'm working in Washington to oppose this proposal and to find an alternative. One option that needs further exploration is to establish a emissions cap and to direct polluters to either reduce emissions or to purchase certified offsets (reductions from other entities) to meet emission targets.LiNeBrEaKBut given the devastating impact of past deregulation on U.S. energy and financial markets, I have serious concerns about using a "market-based approach" to solve serious problems. My colleagues in Congress, and Oregon legislators, would be wise to do their homework on a cap-and-trade system before moving forward with more deregulation.LiNeBrEaKPeter DeFazio, a Democrat, represents Oregon's 4th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Sunrise Edition	Driving in a new direction  		Editorial; Pg. B04  	526 words  	SUMMARY: After only a week, the president shows he's determined to address climate changeLiNeBrEaKDriving in a new directionLiNeBrEaKW ell, that was quick. Anyone wondering if the darkening economy would prompt President Barack Obama to scale back his ambitious promises to address global warming got his answer Monday: Nope, Obama is moving full speed ahead. LiNeBrEaKOn the first day of his second week in office, the president pushed for new rules that would authorize more than a dozen states, including Oregon, to regulate greenhouse gases. He also directed the Transportation Department to draw up temporary rules to speed fuel-efficient cars to market. The rules would put model year 2011 cars on the road to getting 35 miles per gallon.LiNeBrEaKThat's a dramatic, but shrewd, acceleration. It may put the auto manufacturers in more of a crunch, but it pushes them toward a much stronger economic position in the long run. They will have to lead our nation toward energy independence. Given the sluggishness they have shown in the past, pushing for a revolution may be the best way to ensure an evolution.LiNeBrEaKUnder the law already approved by Congress, car manufacturers have until 2020 to meet new fuel efficiency standards. But that deadline would delay the true transformation of the fleet on the nation's roads, effectively, for much longer. As Michael Armstrong, a city of Portland expert on global warming, pointed out Monday, it takes 12 years for the fleet to turn over.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, the president also began clearing the way for some of his key allies on global warming --California, Oregon and at least a dozen other states --to clamp down aggressively on greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005, California requested a waiver under the Clean Air Act to require car manufacturers to reduce such emissions by 30 percent in 2016.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's Air Resources Board, remember, has been down this road before. Plagued by smog, the state mandated a tailpipe cleanup that raised national expectations, altered the national market, triggered a revolution in vehicle design and helped boost air quality.LiNeBrEaKLast March, however, the EPA denied California's request for a waiver. On Obama's first full day in office last week, the Air Resources Board renewed the request. And on Monday, Obama directed the EPA to begin work on the waiver.LiNeBrEaKLet's stop right here and acknowledge that a single federal standard in both realms, of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas regulation, would be ideal. Obama should be pushing for just such uniformity. But giving the states that are ready to lead a license to go forward could be the quickest route to a federal standard on greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThose states, together, represent roughly one half of the cars sold in the United States. They can exert tremendous pressure on the market for automobiles, and that's exactly the idea here.LiNeBrEaKThe federal bureaucracy is a big old clunker that can take forever to turn in any new direction --and the Bush administration wasted years in a stubborn refusal to make the turn.LiNeBrEaKObama may not be able to turn things around as quickly as he hopes. But it's reassuring to see him grabbing the steering wheel on only his seventh day as president.

Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Orlando Utilities Commission goes after double-digit rate increase  	Kevin Spear, The Orlando Sentinel, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	778 words  	Jan. 27--The economic meltdown and environmental concerns are behind a proposed double-digit hike in electric rates by the Orlando Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKBoard members of the city-owned utility meet today to consider a recommended increase of 13. 7 percent for all electric customers that would be effective March 1.LiNeBrEaKFor residential customers, the increase could be as high as 15 percent. That would boost a bill from about $104 to $120 for a typical monthly consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours. LiNeBrEaKWhile that's on top of the utility's 7 percent jump approved late last year, it's still much less than it might have been. OUC officials said that without hiring freezes, reductions in contract labor and postponed projects, the rate hike up for consideration could have been 24 percent.LiNeBrEaKOUC wants to raise its rate, in part, to make up for a drop in electric revenues.LiNeBrEaKFor years, the utility has seen a steady climb in the number of electricity customers, reaching the current count of about 200,000.LiNeBrEaKNow, along with Florida's virtually stagnant population growth, OUC is seeing zero growth in new accounts. On top of that, owners of homes and businesses are learning to use less electricity each month.LiNeBrEaK"Things are tighter, and people are just using a little bit less," said John Hearn, OUC's chief financial officer. "We're not sure we're really at the bottom at this point. We still see some difficult times ahead."LiNeBrEaKFor similar reasons, OUC proposes also to raise its residential water charges by $1 each month and by 15 percent for commercial customers.LiNeBrEaKAnother factor behind the proposed electric-rate hike is OUC's plan to put away money for investment in a nuclear-power plant.LiNeBrEaKMany utilities in the nation are eager to start up new nuclear plants as an alternative to burning coal and natural gas to generate electricity.LiNeBrEaKIn particular, coal burned by electric utilities is a huge source of carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas linked to global warming. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders have pledged to bring dramatic cutbacks in greenhouse-gas pollution.LiNeBrEaKFor utilities such as OUC, which gets 75 percent of its electricity from a pair of coal-powered generators, the future looks to be potentially expensive.LiNeBrEaKLast month, OUC board members gave top utility officials authority to start nailing down a deal to buy a significant amount of nuclear power from Progress Energy Florida, a far larger and privately owned utility.LiNeBrEaKProgress wants to build a pair of nuclear reactors on a newly purchased tract of 3,000 acres in Levy County and not far from its existing nuclear plant in Citrus County.LiNeBrEaKThe cost, which includes construction of transmission lines, is expected to top $17 billion. As now projected, the plant would start up between 2016 and 2018.LiNeBrEaKOUC board members authorized executives to sign a preliminary agreement -- and to make a nonrefundable deposit of $3. 7 million -- to buy nearly 6 percent of the new power plant. That would bring OUC as much as 125 megawatts of electricity, or enough to supply about 100,000 homes.LiNeBrEaKOUC said no such preliminary agreement has been signed yet.LiNeBrEaK"We're still doing our evaluation and still talking to Progress," Hearn said.LiNeBrEaKOther components of OUC's proposed rate hike are increased coal costs, expected expenses in complying with additional power-plant pollution controls and growing operating costs.LiNeBrEaKAll Florida utilities have wrestled with similar issues of rising environmental costs and declining customer revenues.LiNeBrEaKProgress customers recently got a 25 percent increase and are bracing for the possibility of an additional hike, including a $10 bump next year and $17 in 2011 to help pay for the nuclear-power plants.LiNeBrEaKBucking the trend, Florida Power and Light Co. customer bills fell from $111. 12 to $109. 55 this year. That's in part because the utility, the state's largest, relies heavily on natural gas. That fuel has been dropping in cost, although it is vulnerable to sudden jumps in price.LiNeBrEaKTed Kury, energy-studies director at the University of Florida Public Utility Research Center, said utilities are facing pressures from many directions.LiNeBrEaKSome of the worst off are struggling just to pay their fuel bills from last year.

That would boost a bill from about $104 to $120 for a typical monthly consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours. LiNeBrEaKWhile that's on top of the utility's 7 percent jump approved late last year, it's still much less than it might have been. OUC officials said that without hiring freezes, reductions in contract labor and postponed projects, the rate hike up for consideration could have been 24 percent.LiNeBrEaKOUC wants to raise its rate, in part, to make up for a drop in electric revenues.LiNeBrEaKFor years, the utility has seen a steady climb in the number of electricity customers, reaching the current count of about 200,000.LiNeBrEaKNow, along with Florida's virtually stagnant population growth, OUC is seeing zero growth in new accounts. On top of that, owners of homes and businesses are learning to use less electricity each month.LiNeBrEaK"Things are tighter, and people are just using a little bit less," said John Hearn, OUC's chief financial officer. "We're not sure we're really at the bottom at this point. We still see some difficult times ahead."LiNeBrEaKFor similar reasons, OUC proposes also to raise its residential water charges by $1 each month and by 15 percent for commercial customers.LiNeBrEaKAnother factor behind the proposed electric-rate hike is OUC's plan to put away money for investment in a nuclear-power plant.LiNeBrEaKMany utilities in the nation are eager to start up new nuclear plants as an alternative to burning coal and natural gas to generate electricity.LiNeBrEaKIn particular, coal burned by electric utilities is a huge source of carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas linked to global warming. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders have pledged to bring dramatic cutbacks in greenhouse-gas pollution.LiNeBrEaKFor utilities such as OUC, which gets 75 percent of its electricity from a pair of coal-powered generators, the future looks to be potentially expensive.LiNeBrEaKLast month, OUC board members gave top utility officials authority to start nailing down a deal to buy a significant amount of nuclear power from Progress Energy Florida, a far larger and privately owned utility.LiNeBrEaKProgress wants to build a pair of nuclear reactors on a newly purchased tract of 3,000 acres in Levy County and not far from its existing nuclear plant in Citrus County.LiNeBrEaKThe cost, which includes construction of transmission lines, is expected to top $17 billion. As now projected, the plant would start up between 2016 and 2018.LiNeBrEaKOUC board members authorized executives to sign a preliminary agreement -- and to make a nonrefundable deposit of $3. 7 million -- to buy nearly 6 percent of the new power plant. That would bring OUC as much as 125 megawatts of electricity, or enough to supply about 100,000 homes.LiNeBrEaKOUC said no such preliminary agreement has been signed yet.LiNeBrEaK"We're still doing our evaluation and still talking to Progress," Hearn said.LiNeBrEaKOther components of OUC's proposed rate hike are increased coal costs, expected expenses in complying with additional power-plant pollution controls and growing operating costs.LiNeBrEaKAll Florida utilities have wrestled with similar issues of rising environmental costs and declining customer revenues.LiNeBrEaKProgress customers recently got a 25 percent increase and are bracing for the possibility of an additional hike, including a $10 bump next year and $17 in 2011 to help pay for the nuclear-power plants.LiNeBrEaKBucking the trend, Florida Power and Light Co. customer bills fell from $111. 12 to $109. 55 this year. That's in part because the utility, the state's largest, relies heavily on natural gas. That fuel has been dropping in cost, although it is vulnerable to sudden jumps in price.LiNeBrEaKTed Kury, energy-studies director at the University of Florida Public Utility Research Center, said utilities are facing pressures from many directions.LiNeBrEaKSome of the worst off are struggling just to pay their fuel bills from last year.

Pioneer Press (St. Paul, Minnesota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Pollution agency veteran Eger to become chief  	Dennis Lien, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	324 words  	Jan. 27--Gov. Tim Pawlenty on Monday appointed Paul Eger as commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.LiNeBrEaKEger, 35, replaces Brad Moore, who left the agency last fall to take a job in the private sector. LiNeBrEaKSince 2002, Eger has held several positions at the MPCA, including assistant commissioner for water policy and clean water policy manager. Most recently, he managed the agency's internal operations as deputy commissioner.LiNeBrEaKBefore joining the MPCA in 2002 as its legislative liaison, Eger was a committee administrator for the late state Sen. Sam Solon, of Duluth. He also served as the legislative assistant to state Sen. Jim Metzen, DFL-South St. Paul.LiNeBrEaKAn Eagan resident, Eger is a graduate of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., and has a master's degree in public administration from Hamline University.LiNeBrEaKIn a recent note to staff, Eger signaled changes at the MPCA because of the state's budget problems.LiNeBrEaK"We need to examine the work we do and how we do it, and plan for a sustainable, smaller agency that attends to our highest priorities," Eger said.LiNeBrEaKPaul Aasen, advocacy director for the St. Paul-based Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said Eger faces two key challenges: trying to integrate climate change implications into all the MPCA does and making sure money it will receive through a recently passed constitutional amendment is spent appropriately.LiNeBrEaKThe MPCA monitors environmental quality and enforces environmental regulations inLiNeBrEaKthe state.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   SOONER EDITION	COLLISION AHEAD ON EMISSIONS REGULATIONS  	Don Hopey, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  	HEALTH, SCIENCE, MEDICINE and TECHNOLOGY; Pg. A-1  	927 words  	The Obama administration's decision yesterday to consider California's request to further reduce tailpipe emissions could mean cars that pollute less and get better mileage, and eventually bring cleaner air to Pennsylvania.LiNeBrEaKIt also sets up a fight with financially troubled automakers over they types of vehicles they produce.LiNeBrEaKIf the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grants the waiver of federal Clean Air Act vehicle standards, it would lead to a 6. 6 million-ton -- or 30 percent -- reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from Pennsylvania vehicles by 2020. LiNeBrEaK"Granting the waiver will mean a lot to the state because it will make our cars much cleaner," said Teresa Candori, state Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman, who noted that vehicles sold in the state since January 2008 have met existing California emissions standards for soot- and ozone-producing gases that are tighter than federal standards.LiNeBrEaKBut auto manufacturers said imposition of stricter emissions standards could cause them further financial problems at a time when they are already borrowing billions of dollars from the federal government to avoid bankruptcy.LiNeBrEaKPennsylvania is one of 13 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have adopted California tailpipe standards limiting emissions that contribute to global warming and are more restrictive than federal standards. But in March 2008, the EPA rejected the recommendations of its own scientists and denied the California request that it be allowed to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions -- emissions the federal regulations don't control.LiNeBrEaKThe presidential order to reconsider the California waiver was part of a package of administration energy initiatives aimed at ending U.S. dependence on foreign oil, increasing fuel efficiency and vehicle mileage, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions that most scientists agree contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn a separate action, the State Department will name Todd Stern as the new U.S. envoy on climate change. Mr. Stern, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress think tank, coordinated the Clinton administration's Initiative on Global Climate Change from 1997 to 1999 and served as the top negotiator on the Kyoto global warming talks from 1999 to 2001.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama also instructed the federal Department of Transportation to start implementing new fuel efficiency standards for the 2011 model year that will ensure that the nation's vehicles reach an average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 at the latest.LiNeBrEaKThe gear-grinding change of direction is a sharp reversal of Bush administration policy that the new president said blocked the initiatives of California and other states to limit the emissions from vehicles. Environmental groups welcomed the announcements.LiNeBrEaK"With this announcement, President Obama is beginning to make good on his campaign pledge to restore science to its rightful place in federal policymaking," said Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was present at the White House when the president issued his orders yesterday. "I'm confident the administration will heed the advice of EPA staff scientists, grant the waiver and take necessary steps to implement nationwide greenhouse gas standards for vehicles."LiNeBrEaKReid Detchon, executive director of the Energy Future Coalition, said the president's actions have "huge implications" for the nation's energy and climate policy. LiNeBrEaK"This step would set a new standard for automakers throughout the country," Mr. Detchon said, "and spur introduction of new technology like plug-in electric hybrids."LiNeBrEaKThe California controls could improve air quality in southwestern Pennsylvania, where smog and soot levels remain too high to meet federal health standards, said Guillermo Cole, an Allegheny County Health Department spokesman.LiNeBrEaK"We would expect that granting the waiver would help improve the air quality, although it might not have an immediate impact since it takes a while for the vehicle fleet to turn over," Mr. Cole said.LiNeBrEaKState DEP estimates done in 2006, when the state decided to adopt California emissions standards, show vehicle owners would realize savings from owning the higher-mileage, lower-emission vehicles of between $42 and $84 a year in 2016.LiNeBrEaKBut the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 11 automakers, is opposed to having different fuel efficiency and pollution standards in different states, even though vehicle sales in California and other states that have adopted its standards account for about one-half of all new vehicle sales.LiNeBrEaKThe automakers said the accelerated imposition of stricter emissions standards could force them to cut production of larger, more profitable vehicles when they are experiencing the worst auto sales market since the early 1980s. New vehicle sales fell about 19 percent in 2008 and are expected to fall further this year.LiNeBrEaK"The administration's announcements on fuel efficiency were no surprise, but legally and politically it will be interesting to see if the waiver will be granted," said Jeffrey Holmstead, a former EPA assistant administrator and an attorney in the environmental strategy division of Bracewell Guilani, a Washington, D.C., law firm.LiNeBrEaK"The U.S. auto manufacturers have been fighting this hard because of the increased costs," Mr. Holmstead said. "So on the one hand we're bailing out the automakers but this would make that much more expensive. They can stop selling the bigger cars and trucks and sell the smaller cars, but it puts them in worse shape financially."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   SOONER EDITION	STUDY: CO2 EFFECTS TO LAST 1,000 YEARS  	Cornelia Dean, The New York Times  	HEALTH, SCIENCE, MEDICINE and TECHNOLOGY; Pg. A-1  	694 words  	Many people who worry about global warming hope that once emissions of heat-trapping gases decline, the problems they cause will quickly begin to abate.LiNeBrEaKNow, researchers are saying such hope is ill-founded, at least with regard to carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the way carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere and in the oceans, and the way the atmosphere and the oceans interact, patterns that are established at peak levels will produce problems like "inexorable sea level rise" and Dust-Bowl-like droughts for at least 1,000 years, the researchers are reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. LiNeBrEaK"That peak would be the minimum you would be locking yourself into," said Susan Solomon, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who led the work.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers describe what will happen if the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the principal heat-trapping gas emission, reaches 450 to 600 parts per million -- up from about 385 ppm today.LiNeBrEaKMany climate scientists and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have set a goal of stabilizing atmospheric carbon at 450 ppm, but current projections put the world on track to hit 550 ppm by 2035, rising after that point by 4. 5 percent a year.LiNeBrEaKMost climate researchers consider 450 ppm virtually inevitable, and 600 ppm difficult to avoid by midcentury, if the use of fossil fuels continues at anything like its present rate.LiNeBrEaKAt 450 ppm, the researchers say, rising seas will threaten many coastal areas, and southern Europe, North Africa, the southwestern United States and western Australia could expect 10 percent less rainfall.LiNeBrEaK"Ten percent may not seem like a high number," Dr. Solomon said yesterday in a telephone news conference, "but it is the kind of number that has been seen in major droughts in the past, like the Dust Bowl."LiNeBrEaKAt 600 ppm, there might be perhaps 15 percent less rain, she said.LiNeBrEaKIn 1850, as industrialization was under way, atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 280 ppm, a level that scientists say had not been exceeded in at least the previous 800,000 years.LiNeBrEaKIn their paper, Dr. Solomon and her colleagues say they confined their estimates to known data and effects. For example, they based their sea level estimates largely on the expansion of seawater as it warms, a relatively straightforward calculation, rather than including the contributions of glacial runoff or melting inland ice sheets -- more difficult to predict but potentially far greater contributors to sea level rise.LiNeBrEaKThe new work dealt only with the effects of carbon dioxide, which is responsible for about half of greenhouse warming. Gases like chlorofluorocarbons and methane, along with soot and other pollutants, contribute to the rest. These substances are far less persistent in the atmosphere; if these emissions drop, their effects will decline relatively fast.LiNeBrEaKPrinceton University geoscientist Michael Oppenheimer praised the report in an e-mail message as a "remarkably clear and direct" discussion of whether it would be possible to exceed a level like 450 ppm temporarily, and then reduce emissions in time to avoid catastrophic events like the collapse of a major inland ice sheet.LiNeBrEaKDr. Oppenheimer said the new analysis showed that "some dangerous consequences could be triggered and persist for a long, long time, even if emissions were cut radically."LiNeBrEaK"Policymakers need to understand," he continued, "that in some ways, once we are over the cliff, there's nothing to stop the fall."LiNeBrEaKDr. Solomon said it would be wrong to view the report as evidence that it was already too late to do much good by reducing carbon emissions. "You have to think of this stuff as being more like nuclear waste than acid rain," she said.LiNeBrEaKAcid rain began to abate when pollution contributing to it was limited. But just as nuclear waste remains radioactive for a long time, the effects of carbon dioxide persist.LiNeBrEaK"So if we slow it down," she said, "we have more time to find solutions."LiNeBrEaKFor example, engineers may one day discover ways to remove the gas from the atmosphere. But "those solutions are not now in hand," Solomon said. "They are quite speculative."

The Porterville Recorder (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Cooling crisis?  	The Porterville Recorder, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	348 words  	Jan. 27--A new poll found that people rank global warming dead last, 20th out of 20, among their top concerns. The economy was No. 1, while other economic-related issues unsurprisingly gravitated to the top. LiNeBrEaKThe survey conducted Jan. 7-11 asked 1,503 adults on cell phones and landlines to rank 20 issues by importance, including strengthening the economy, improving the job situation, defending against terrorism, Social Security, health care, energy, environment, budget deficits, health insurance, dealing with moral breakdown and crime and reducing lobbyists' influence, among others.LiNeBrEaKThe New York Times noted that the nonpartisan Pew Research Center poll is "somewhat at odds with President Obama, who has put a high priority on staving off global warming and vowed ... to 'roll back the specter of a warming planet'." Regular folks seem far more concerned with rolling back bad economic conditions.LiNeBrEaKAs the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang blog asks, "are scientists overselling climate models" that predict global warming catastrophe, what's certain is that substantive global warming "solutions" come at a huge cost to commerce and taxpayers while diverting limited resources to fight what could be an overplayed threat.LiNeBrEaKThe government's questionable economic stimulus efforts won't be felt for months at best, and the Congressional Budget Office admits in many cases may not show up for two years. But adverse economic effects of Draconian global warming mandates will be felt almost immediately.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama would be prudent to heed the public's opinion about a global condition that has yet to prove itself threatening, let alone catastrophic.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	410 words  	Jan. 27--LONG BEACH -- Following President Barack Obama's directive to allow states to regulate harmful emissions, state Sen. Jenny Oropeza said Tuesday that she has introduced legislation that would reduce the use of a greenhouse gas commonly used in manufacturing. LiNeBrEaKSenate Bill 104 would allow the California Air Resources Board to regulate nitrogen trifluoride, or NF3. The bill is in the state Senate's Rules Committee awaiting policy committee assignment.LiNeBrEaK"There is no question climate change is having a devastating effect on the earth's environment," Oropeza said. "Even if by some miracle we could stop the release of harmful emissions, it would take years before we could halt the damage that has been done."LiNeBrEaKNF3 previously was thought to be harmless until studies at UC Irvine and UC San Diego suggested otherwise.LiNeBrEaKUCI scientists concluded NF3 has a global-warming potential 17,000 times greater than carbon dioxide and can remain in the atmosphere for centuries.LiNeBrEaKUCSD found that a larger amount of NF3 has been released into the air than previously believed and concluded that the quantity of the gas in the atmosphere is growing.LiNeBrEaK"The harmful effects of NF3 are only now being fully understood, as it was not widely used before the 1990 s," Oropeza said. "California must get ahead of this threat and once again lead the way to protect our environment."LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, the state Legislature passed Assembly Bill 32, which reduced harmful emissions, butLiNeBrEaKdid not address NF3, which at the time was thought to be a clean alternative to more harmful gases used in manufacturing televisions, solar panels and microprocessors.LiNeBrEaKOropeza, Bowen to speakLiNeBrEaKOropeza and California Secretary of State Debra Bowen will speak on the state budget crisis, voting and 28 th District issues from 6 p.m. to 7: 30 p.m. Thursday 1/29.LiNeBrEaKThe town hall-style meeting will take place at the Westchester-Loyola Village Branch, Los Angeles Public Library, Mary Lou Crockett Room, 7114 W.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	States may get more clout to pressure automakers  	BY JOHN E. MULLIGAN, Journal Washington Bureau  	NEWS; Pg. 3  	643 words  	WASHINGTON   President Obama won bipartisan praise yesterday from Rhode Island officials for opening the door to state-level rules on automobile pollution that go further than federal standards. Democrats took the opportunity to renew their criticism of the Bush administration s environmental policies.LiNeBrEaKRhode Island Attorney General Patrick J. Lynch said in a news release,  The swift and decisive action taken [yesterday] by President Obama is a breath of fresh air   literally   for all who have been harmed by the Bush administration s disdain for and indifference to regulating greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to pollution, threaten public health, and increase the impacts of global warming.  LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review a Bush administration ruling that effectively barred California and allied states from stiffening the limits on auto emissions   including carbon dioxide   believed to contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKRhode Island was among the states that joined California more than three years ago in seeking a waiver from regular procedures that would have permitted them to press for tougher limits on so-called  greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKAt least in the short term, Mr. Obama s decision will have no concrete effect on citizens in Rhode Island or the other states involved in seeking what has come to be known as the California waiver. Car manufacturers do not make cars   or their emissions control systems   to specifications that vary from state to state.LiNeBrEaKBut Rhode Island may now be able to join California and the others in applying collective pressure on the auto industry to cut back on certain emissions, according to Lynch s spokesman, Michael J. Healy, and the chief of the state Department of Environmental Management, W. Michael Sullivan.LiNeBrEaK I m very pleased by this advance,  said Sullivan,  If we re going to affect the quality of our air,  the level of harmful emissions from cars has to be reduced because cars are the biggest source of certain pollutants, Sullivan said. He said, for example, that cars are the source of more than 60 percent of artificially-produced carbon dioxide, one of the key greenhouse gases. That is substantially larger than what power plants emit, he said.LiNeBrEaKSullivan said the General Assembly would not be required to consider any particular legislation in the event that the EPA grants a waiver to let states toughen their emission rules. Nor would California-style regulations entail the imposition of any related fees or surcharges on Rhode Islanders who buy cars, according to Healey.LiNeBrEaKGovernor Carcieri, a Republican, signed an executive order more than three years ago in which he proposed to have the state join in imposing the California strictures on car emissions. All the New England states except New Hampshire are also among the states that have signed onto the effort with California.LiNeBrEaKDemocrat Lynch has joined in legal actions to advance the prerogative of states to impose restrictions tougher than the federal government s.LiNeBrEaK It s clear that today s order to the EPA by President Obama signals that the agency will once again become the Environmental Protection Agency, rather than the IPA   the Industry Protection Agency,  Lynch said in his statement.LiNeBrEaK For years, the Bush administration took care of its friends in the oil and gas business instead of pushing for stricter pollution standards that will lead to new cars and trucks that get better fuel economy,  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said in a news release. Rhode Island   and America   is ready for tougher limits on greenhouse gas emissions. It s exciting to finally have a president who gets it, and will take strong measures to help all Americans breathe cleaner air, spend less at the pump, and use less foreign oil,  said Whitehouse, a Democrat who sits on the Senate s principal environmental committee.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   All Editions	N.J. air gets boost from Obama;  Tighter tailpipe emissions seen 	By JAMES M. O'NEILL, STAFF WRITER, North Jersey Media Group  	NEWS; Pg. A04  	682 words  	President Obama opened the way Monday for New Jersey, California and other states to impose aggressive limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaKObama asked federal environmental regulators to revisit a request by 14 states to be allowed to set their own tailpipe emissions standards. Earlier their request had been rejected by the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKIn New Jersey, such limits are considered a crucial part of the state's plan to combat global warming and pollution that is so bad the state continually fails clean air standards. LiNeBrEaK"This is critical step forward because, without this waiver, New Jersey wouldn't be able to implement its own clean air law," said Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKObama did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to grant the states a waiver so they can enact tailpipe limits that are more stringent than the federal government's.LiNeBrEaKBut given that his new EPA administrator is Lisa Jackson, who had asked for just such a waiver while serving as New Jersey's environmental commissioner, a dramatic change of course is likely, environmentalists said.LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKWhile the moves drew praise from Democrats and environmentalists, Republicans warned that the tighter regulations on the auto industry could put American jobs at risk.LiNeBrEaK"The effect of this policy will be to destroy American jobs at the very time government leaders should be working together to protect and create them," House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKObama's directives came the same day a federal study concluded that climate changes spurred by increased carbon dioxide emissions are largely irreversible even if those emissions are completely stopped.LiNeBrEaKThe report said that if carbon dioxide were allowed to peak at 450 to 600 parts per million, compared with present-day concentrations of 385 parts per million, some irreversible climate impacts would include changes in rainfall and a rise in sea levels around the globe. Increases in carbon dioxide in this century "lock in" a sea level rise that would slowly follow in the next 1,000 years, the scientists said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists said the dire report only makes it more imperative to act now to reduce carbon emissions. Instead of having the sea level rise 2 feet over the next 50 years and cover 9 percent of New Jersey, perhaps it could be limited to a 1-foot rise with 4 percent of New Jersey affected, Tittel said.LiNeBrEaK"The difference is Long Beach Island and Sandy Hook being covered by a 1-foot rise, compared with Long Beach Island, Sandy Hook, the Meadowlands and Newark Airport being covered by a 2-foot rise," Tittel said.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey passed its auto emissions law in 2003 and currently regulates some tailpipe emissions, including particulates, nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide. But to start regulating carbon dioxide emissions from tailpipes, the state needs a waiver from the federal government.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration rejected California's request for such a waiver, saying the state did not have the "compelling and extraordinary conditions" required for a waiver.LiNeBrEaKThe waiver would enable New Jersey to reduce emissions by a fifth over the next decade ? the equivalent of taking more than 7. 4 million cars off the road for a year, according to Doug O'Malley, field director for Environment New Jersey.LiNeBrEaK"Global warming is the most serious environmental threat we face, and, finally, we are giving our states ? including New Jersey and California ? the tools to confront it," said U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D.-N.J., a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "For much of the past eight years, the Bush administration ignored clear science and blocked bold action to address global warming on the state and local level.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   All Editions	Out of denial;  Jersey may soon set strict emission standard 		OPINION; Pg. A07  	547 words  	Emission testing in Bergenfield.LiNeBrEaKTHE fight against global warm&not;ing took a major step forward this week, as President Obama directed the Environmental Protec&not;tion Agency to act on a request by more than a dozen states, including New Jersey, to set their own auto emission standards. LiNeBrEaKClearly, Obama and his new EPA head, Lisa Jackson, want to move quickly and make up for the time lost under the Bush adminis&not;tration. Or, as Sen. Frank Lauten&not;berg, D-N.J., said of the new presi&not;dent's directive: "The days of denial are over."LiNeBrEaKWhen the Bush adminis&not;tration, Con&not;gress and the auto industry dragged their feet on address&not;ing climate change, New Jersey and oth&not;ers joined Cali&not;fornia in asking the federal gov&not;ernment for a waiver so that states could set their own strict limits on car and truck greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKUnder Governor Corzine, this state passed a law that mandated a reduction in emissions by 20 per&not;cent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKAs head of the state Department of Environmental Protection, Jack&not;son decried federal inaction on reg&not;ulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. "The federal government's lack of action to date on this important issue defies all log&not;ic," she said last year.LiNeBrEaKBut when states tried to act on their own, the federal government blocked the effort.LiNeBrEaKObama has now signaled that ob&not;stacle will be overcome. "The feder&not;al government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," the president said. "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guid&not;ed by them."LiNeBrEaKIf the EPA approves the states' re&not;quest, they can begin to make signif&not;icant progress, but much more needs to be done. Congress should do its part and approve measures that would make the emissions standards set by New Jersey, California and other forward-looking states - in&not;cluding New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and Penn&not;sylvania - the national model.LiNeBrEaKThis week, Obama also directed the federal Transportation Depart&not;ment to draw up rules to implement a 2007 law requiring a 40 percent improvement in gas mileage for cars and light trucks by 2020. The Bush administration failed to write any regulations to enforce that law.LiNeBrEaKGiven this im&not;petus, the U.S. auto industry will have little choice but to start manufacturing cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars, something that it should have done long ago. Now it is paying the price because it didn't. The industry refused to see the writ&not;ing on the wall, wasting time and money fighting clean-car regulations in Congress and in court.LiNeBrEaK"The automakers are in trouble because of failing business models centered around gas guzzlers," Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said in response to Obama's action. "Allow&not;ing states, including New Jersey, to require more fuel-efficient cars cuts down on energy costs for fami&not;lies, spurs technological innovation to create green jobs, reduces green&not;house gas emissions and helps the American auto industry survive."LiNeBrEaKAll New Jerseyans should applaud these actions, since they will have a direct bearing on the quality of our air and our health as well as on the environment and global warming. In a state as densely populated and heavily trafficked as this one, that is particularly good news.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Better late than never for mileage  	The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	602 words  	Jan. 27--After less than a week in office, President Barack Obama has moved aggressively to wipe away one of the most noxious anti-environmental policies of the Bush administration. On Monday, the president ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine whether California and 13 other states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia clashed repeatedly with the Bush administration over this issue. The state approved a historic greenhouse gas control measure in 2007 that required cars sold in this state to reduce the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide they emitted. The new standards would force car manufacturers to reduce emissions by 30 percent in new cars and trucks sold in California by 2016. LiNeBrEaKOther states followed California's lead. But car manufacturers, with the backing of the Bush administration, sued, arguing in court that carbon dioxide was not a pollutant that could be regulated by the Clean Air Act. The courts backed California. Nonetheless, to impose the new, tougher regulations, California still needed a waiver from the federal EPA. Ignoring the advice of its agency scientists, the Bush administration consistently refused to grant it. By ordering a review of that decision, Obama made clear he's ready to change the policy.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said, "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKObama on Monday also ordered a speedup of new auto efficiency standards approved by Congress in 2007. The new rules would require new cars to achieve 35 miles per gallon on average beginning in 2020. Obama wants the guidelines to start affecting cars as early as 2011.LiNeBrEaKBush administration officials had estimated it would cost the industry $100 billion to retool to meet the new standard. With two of the biggest car companies, General Motors and Chrysler, close to financial collapse, critics of the Obama orders say the companies cannot afford to comply.LiNeBrEaKWhen auto companies were flying high, producing behemoth gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles and trucks, they offered other excuses. The public, auto executives claimed, would not buy energy-efficient cars. Now, with the big gas guzzlers languishing unsold on showroom floors, they claim they can't afford to retool.LiNeBrEaKIn reality, they can't afford to do otherwise. If there is going to be an auto industry in this country, it must adapt to a much more energy-efficient future.LiNeBrEaKBut the issue goes beyond the economic self-interest of car companies. The nation cannot afford to continue to drive inefficient cars that require massive amounts of gasoline refined from oil that comes from countries that are hostile to us. Such wastefulness threatens our security and our economy. It produces global warming greenhouse gases that threaten out planet.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKSadly, the change is coming much later than it needed to. That will make it harder for the car companies to adapt, but adapt they must.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Tough California air rules to force new era for cars?  	Chris Bowman, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	897 words  	Jan. 27--President Barack Obama's directive to reconsider California's attempt to regulate global warming gases from automobiles could bring many more highly fuel-efficient cars to sales lots as early as this year.LiNeBrEaKAuto manufacturers can achieve the bulk of required emission reductions using technology available today, without sacrificing the design or size of the vehicle, state air pollution regulators and environmental advocates say. LiNeBrEaKSome of the fuel-saving features are in models already on the road, such as more efficient valve-timing, sleeker aerodynamics and smoother-rolling tires. The added production cost would be about $1,800 per vehicle, they say.LiNeBrEaK"Everyone who has tracked the development of automobile technologies knows that the entire industry can do much more to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency," said Tim Carmichael, senior policy adviser with the environmentalist Coalition for Clean Air.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and environmental leaders said they are confident the Obama administration soon will grant California the authority it needs to shift its landmark regulation of global warming vehicle emissions out of neutral.LiNeBrEaKThe optimism springs from Obama's announcement Monday directing the federal Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a request by California and 13 other states to enforce tailpipe limits on climate-warming exhausts.LiNeBrEaKIf newly appointed EPA administrator Lisa Jackson gives the go-ahead, automakers for the first time would be required to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases, starting this year.LiNeBrEaKThe only practical way automakers can do that is to make cars run more efficiently and burn less fuel.LiNeBrEaKGranting the states' request would mean that about half the country's new-car market would come under tough new emissions requirements. California is joined in its federal plea by some populous states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is the only state permitted under the federal Clean Air Act to set its own, tougher rules on auto emissions and fuels. Other states, however, can adopt the California standards.LiNeBrEaKIn the absence of federal regulation, California in 2002 mandated that automakers limit global-warming emissions from new cars and passenger trucks. But it needed the EPA's permission to enforce it.LiNeBrEaKAfter several years' delay and a lawsuit by the petitioning states, the Bush administration's EPA rejected the California standard, saying in late 2007 that recently adopted federal mileage rules made the action unnecessary.LiNeBrEaK"For too long Washington has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the environment," Schwarzenegger said Monday, sharing a Capitol news conference stage with gleeful representatives of environmental groups. "Now California finally has a partner and an ally in Washington, at the White House."LiNeBrEaKThe emissions law, Assembly Bill 1493 authored by then-Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, is expected to result in 22 percent fewer emissions of carbon dioxide by 2012 and a 30 percent reduction by 2016, compared with 2002 model cars, according to the state Air Resources Board, which regulates the law.LiNeBrEaKCutting motor vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide would account for nearly 20 percent of the greenhouse gas reductions required by California's other global warming law, AB 32, which Schwarzenegger signed in 2006.LiNeBrEaKWhile the technology to meet the stricter limits already exists in many late-model cars on the road today, the California regulation could spur the introduction of new technology such as plug-in electric hybrids, which would allow consumers to recharge the vehicles' batteries at home.LiNeBrEaKThe automobile industry at every step has blocked the California standard from becoming effective, saying the waiver would require it to produce two sets of vehicles, one that would meet the California standard and another that could be sold elsewhere.LiNeBrEaKThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers muted its opposition Monday. Its president, Dave McCurdy, said: "We are ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger said California actually did a favor for the financially crippled automakers by winning President Obama's ear on stricter greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"This has absolutely nothing to do (with) punishing the automakers," Schwarzenegger said. "What we wanted to do is just give them a little push to be innovative and to develop new techniques that will ultimately make better cars that will be more competitive around the world."LiNeBrEaKThe governor and environmentalists said federal approval of the California regulation would lead the EPA to adopt the measure nationwide.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has been setting the nation's pace for vehicle emissions controls for more than 40 years. Each time the state set or tightened its standards for tailpipe pollutants, the federal government followed course.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Chris Bowman, (916) 321-1069.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	GOP pushing to weaken emissions standards;  Budget concessions sought by Sacramento lawmakers 	Michael Gardner, U-T SACRAMENTO BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1091 words  	SACRAMENTO -- While praising President Barack Obama's moves to allow California to impose tighter controls on tailpipe emissions, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger now finds himself under pressure from fellow Republicans demanding that he weaken the state's broader greenhouse-gas laws as part of any deal to solve the budget crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe possibility of compromising the state's landmark standards to curb global warming has environmentalists fuming. They also worry that Democrats will be forced to trade environmental safeguards for GOP concessions on raising revenue. LiNeBrEaK"This is fiscal blackmail," said Bill Magavern, state director of the Sierra Club. "They know they could never achieve these weakenings of environmental protections through the normal process."LiNeBrEaKRepublicans, however, say providing industry relief from potentially new costs to limit emissions will stimulate growth, provide jobs and help refill empty state coffers.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger yesterday declined to commit to defending the state's emission laws, suggesting that publicly drawing lines outside secret budget talks could be counterproductive.LiNeBrEaK"I don't want to get into any of the details of our budget discussions, because it could blow up everything," he said.LiNeBrEaKA key lawyer in state Attorney General Jerry Brown's office has circulated a memo warning that legislation drafted by Republicans as part of budget talks could "radically weaken" the state's ability to enforce emission reductions and "violate the Clean Air Act."LiNeBrEaK"These proposals would neither help the state's fiscal crisis, nor provide any stimulative effect on the economy," wrote Marc Le Forestier, supervising deputy attorney general who tracks legislation for Brown, a Democrat.LiNeBrEaKThe memo surfaced just as Schwarzenegger and other environmental leaders were celebrating Obama's directive to reopen California's application for permission to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The Bush administration refused to grant the waiver in December 2007.LiNeBrEaK"California has shown bold and bipartisan leadership ... But instead of serving as a partner, Washington stood in their way," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKObama also ordered his transportation agency to begin crafting regulations to increase fuel economy -- another break from the previous administration. The president's new mileage standards would start with the 2011 model year vehicles, gradually rising to a fleetwide average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers and car dealers warned that overzealous regulations could accelerate the industry's tailspin.LiNeBrEaKThe solution, critics contend, is a national standard for greenhouse-gas emissions instead of rules that vary from state to state. California and about a dozen other states would implement the new standards if the federal EPA grants the waiver after a review this spring. Cars sold in other states not adopting California's regulations would still have to meet less-stringent federal rules.LiNeBrEaK"What manufacturers need now more than anything else is certainty and consistency, not complexity and chaos," said Charles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents most major companies.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger signaled he agrees with one standard but hinted he wants it to be the tougher one adopted by California.LiNeBrEaK"It would be great to do this nationally so that car manufacturers don't have two standards ... I think it's a wise policy," he said.LiNeBrEaKCar dealers are as wary as manufacturers, said Bailey Wood, legislative affairs director for the National Automobile Dealers Association. Allowing California to impose tougher restrictions "is going to affect the price and availability," he said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's regulations create a loophole by affecting only the largest makers that sell 60,000 or more cars in the state annually, Wood said. Also, car buyers scared away by potentially higher sticker prices in California could just purchase a new vehicle in another state and then license it here.LiNeBrEaK"What we need now is to encourage people to go to the showroom -- not discourage them," Wood said.LiNeBrEaKObama's announcement siding with California's waiver request came as no surprise because he had signaled his support during the campaign.LiNeBrEaK"Today, President Obama has taken America from zero to 60 in six days," said Bernadette Del Chiaro of Environment California, a leading advocate of restrictions on greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThen-Gov. Gray Davis signed the law in 2001, but litigation filed by automakers and resistance from top Bush administration officials stalled implementation. Under the law, automakers will have to gradually roll back greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia regulators are counting on tailpipe standards to help meet an overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases statewide to 1990 levels by 2020, a 25 percent savings.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans want to weaken the regulations. Among their draft proposals to accompany the final budget deal:LiNeBrEaK* Provide the governor's secretary of business, transportation and housing with new authority to review and potentially block regulations by citing cost.LiNeBrEaK* Eliminate the ability of the state and local governments to require mitigation for greenhouse-gas emissions, including power plants and oil refineries.LiNeBrEaK"By creating incentives for companies to invest in California and eliminating the roadblocks that have made it too expensive to stay in business here, we will create jobs and bring in more tax revenue for the state," GOP budget negotiators said in a recent statement.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger, who has parlayed his campaign to reduce greenhouse gases into a leading international role, was asked whether he was negotiating a deal that could weaken one of the centerpieces of his legacy.LiNeBrEaK"I can give you an overall statement about that and that is we do not want to harm the environment, we want to always protect the environment," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut the governor would not confirm whether the Republican proposal is part of the negotiations, citing a confidentiality pledge among the parties known as the "Big Five."LiNeBrEaK"So therefore I will be sensitive about that," Schwarzenegger said, "because we promised each other always, which is something that we do when we start our Big Five meetings, let's keep this, all the ideas, no matter how radical they are -- because sometimes very radical things are being thrown around -- so it should stay in our Cabinet room. So that's the idea. But we are discussing all of those things."

Gray Davis made the most of the photo opportunities this week in signing a bill to put California in the lead against global warming. Davis held signing ceremonies in each of the state's two major media markets. Environmental leaders were gracious in their praise for the governor, showing their willingness to forgive or forget that Davis was officially neutral on the bill when it was taking an intense battering from the industry and its outcome was in serious doubt ... however ... the battle may not be over. The auto industry is considering a referendum to wipe out the bill's call for a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by model year 2009. The governor's signature was an important milestone, but not the first or last one.  LiNeBrEaK- Editorial, July 24, 2002LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWhat happened: The auto industry persuaded the Bush administration to prevent California and other states from adopting tougher emissions standards.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	Obama plunges in on warming;  Change in climate: President backs state's rules, begins reversing course set by Bush 	Zachary Coile, Chronicle Washington Bureau  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1196 words  	 President Obama began the step-by-step dismantling of President Bush's climate change policies Monday by endorsing California's aggressive vehicle emissions standards and by naming a high-profile envoy to lead U.S. efforts to re-engage in international climate talks. LiNeBrEaKObama has spent his first six days in office rolling back Bush's policies on issues such as abortion and Guantanamo Bay. On Monday, he signaled he will use his executive powers to force automakers to raise fuel efficiency and abide by California's landmark law limiting greenhouse gases from cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaK"The days of Washington dragging its heels are over," he said in a speech in the East Room in which he took repeated shots at Bush's response to global warming. "My administration will not deny facts, we will be guided by them. We cannot afford to pass the buck or push the burden onto the states."LiNeBrEaK'An unequivocal message'LiNeBrEaKObama made the remarks the same day Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced the appointment of the administration's top climate envoy, Todd Stern, during the Clinton years a chief U.S. negotiator of the Kyoto Protocol, a binding agreement by 183 nations to slash emissions that the United States has refused to ratify. LiNeBrEaK"We are sending an unequivocal message that the United States will be energetic, focused, strategic and serious about addressing global climate change and the corollary issue of clean energy," Clinton said.LiNeBrEaKObama is quickly fulfilling his pledge to make energy and global warming two of his top priorities. His economic stimulus plan is jammed with $54 billion in incentives for renewable energy and efficiency measures. He promised last year that he would back California's vehicle emissions rules, but state officials never expected he would hold a televised ceremony at the White House his first week to announce it.LiNeBrEaK"What a difference one week makes in Washington, D.C.," said state Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills Los Angeles County, who as a member of the Assembly wrote the 2002 state law curbing vehicle emissions. "We were hoping this day would come."LiNeBrEaKThe high stakes were underscored in a new report by an international team of climate researchers, being published today by the National Academy of Sciences, that found that many climate changes already might be irreversible - even if nations cut their emissions. The scientists warned that if carbon dioxide levels rise from the current 385 parts per million to 450-600 parts per million, areas from the southwestern United States to southern Europe to northern Africa could see dry-season rainfall plunge to levels similar to the Dust Bowl in the 1930s United States.LiNeBrEaK'Courage and commitment'LiNeBrEaKObama, in his speech, blamed a generation of policymakers, both Democrat and Republican, for failing to make hard choices on energy and environmental challenges. LiNeBrEaK"Our leaders raise their voices each time there is a spike in gas prices, only to grow quiet when the price falls at the pump," he said. But he said the risks of not acting are now too severe. "For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change."LiNeBrEaKObama said his first step would be the $825 billion stimulus package, which he said would double America's production of renewable energy, put 460,000 people to work in clean energy jobs and build a new electric new grid to deliver wind and solar power to populated areas. The House is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKHis second step was to signal his administration's intention to sign California's request for a waiver from the Clean Air Act to implement its rules. Bush's EPA chief, Stephen Johnson, provoked outrage when he overruled his legal and technical staff and rejected California's request in December 2007. While Obama's order requires only that his new EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, review the decision, the president's remarks left little doubt that California would prevail. LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions," he said. "California has shown bold and bipartisan leadership through its effort to forge 21st century standards, and over a dozen states have followed its lead. But instead of serving as a partner, Washington stood in their way."LiNeBrEaKObama also ordered the Transportation Department to speed the development of new federal rules, passed by Congress and signed by Bush in 2007, to raise fuel economy requirements to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. LiNeBrEaKApproving the California waiver could be Obama's fastest route to affecting climate change policy in the country. Because 13 states have adopted California's rules and five more are considering them, the regulations could apply to more than half the country, effectively forcing automakers to raise the efficiency of their fleets.LiNeBrEaKOne kind of carLiNeBrEaK"It doesn't make sense for automakers to make one kind of car for Wyoming and one kind of car for California," said Phyllis Cuttino, who directs the Pew Environment Group's Global Warming Campaign.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers have been fighting to block California's rules in court for years, but their reaction was muted on Monday - a reflection of the fact that struggling U.S. auto companies need Obama's backing to receive billions in federal aid to keep them afloat. General Motors said in a statement it was "ready to engage the Obama administration and the Congress on policies that support meaningful and workable solutions." LiNeBrEaKBut GOP lawmakers blasted Obama's decision, saying it could saddle the auto industry with billions in new costs to comply with California's rules.LiNeBrEaK"The effect of this policy will be to destroy American jobs at the very time government leaders should be working together to protect and create them," said House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama's policy changes after a week in office LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKBush administration policies reversed or modified by President Obama: LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Jan. 21: Ordered plans to withdraw combat forces from Iraq.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	California: Emissions law to be enforced when waiver is granted, likely this spring  	Matthew Yi and Wyatt Buchanan, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1013 words  	 California officials say they plan to enforce the state's regulation requiring the nation's most fuel-efficient vehicles as soon as the federal government grants the state a waiver from less-stringent national standards.LiNeBrEaKThe move is expected this spring.LiNeBrEaKThe regulation would have the single largest impact on the state's ambitious goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 under the landmark legislation AB32. LiNeBrEaKDelayed by the Bush administration since 2005, the rule would require automakers to produce vehicles that cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016, resulting in an average vehicle fuel-efficiency of 35. 7 miles per gallon - far higher than the current federal standard of 27. 5 mpg for cars and 22. 3 mpg for SUVs and light trucks.LiNeBrEaKThe rule would have wide-ranging impact on the types of cars, minivans, SUVs and trucks that consumers will see in California dealerships.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama ordered his environmental officials on Monday to immediately review California's regulation, strongly hinting that he would like to allow the state and 13 others to move forward with stricter emissions standards. The federal government, under former President Bush, refused to grant the waiver in 2007 after two years of deliberation.LiNeBrEaK"The president's action is a great victory for California and for cleaning the air around the nation for generations to come," Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said at a state Capitol news conference. "Soon millions of Americans will be able to breathe easier and drive more fuel-efficient cars."LiNeBrEaKAutomobile manufacturers, who have been lobbying heavily against the federal waiver, declined to criticize Obama's decision but argued that a nationwide standard is a better approach than allowing individual states to have separate vehicle-emissions standards.LiNeBrEaK"We are ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach," said Dave McCurdy, president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The organization represents 11 manufacturers, including Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Mazda and Toyota.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups applauded the president's decision.LiNeBrEaK"What a difference an election makes," said Bernadette De Chiaro, a lobbyist for Environment California, a lobby group. "For the past eight years, America's engine for ingenuity and progress on the environment was stuck in reverse under the Bush administration. And today, President Obama has taken America from zero to 60 in six days."LiNeBrEaKLinda Adams, secretary of California's state Environmental Protection Agency, said she expects federal EPA officials to grant the waiver in the spring and the state to implement the new regulation immediately. The new rule would cover current 2009 model automobiles, some of which began appearing in dealerships in the fall.LiNeBrEaKAdams and state air board officials said they believe automakers should be able to meet the requirements of the new rule for this year's vehicles because automakers were alerted that the 2009-model engines would come under the new regulation within 45 days if a federal waiver were granted.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, state officials believe most automakers have begun using many of the technologies that would make vehicles more fuel efficient, placing them on track to meet the requirements of the new rule.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers would be required to annually report emissions figures on their vehicles to be sold in California, but the final determination of whether each company has met the requirements won't occur until 2016, said Tom Cackette, deputy director of the California Air Resources Board.LiNeBrEaKEdward B. Cohen, vice president of governmental and industry relations for Honda, said that if the new standards are adopted, "every single component of the vehicle is going to have to be examined to make sure the vehicle is more fuel-efficient." That will mean continued technological improvements on car engines as well as using lighter-weight steel, he said.LiNeBrEaKBut state officials said automakers already have begun to use proven technologies to improve fuel efficiency. For example, the Honda Odyssey minivan's engine shuts down certain cylinders when cruising at high speeds on freeways, and Volkswagen's smaller, gas-sipping engines compensate for lower power by adding a turbo-charge, said Stanley Young, a spokesman for the state air board.LiNeBrEaKAnd while adding more hybrids and electric vehicles to the fleet would certainly help, automakers should be able to meet the requirements of the new regulation mostly by adopting smaller design changes in traditional, gas-powered automobiles, Young said.LiNeBrEaKBut consumers are likely to have to pay higher prices on new vehicles, and dealers might not carry some automobiles in California, said Peter Welch, President and CEO of the California New Car Dealers Association. Welch added that higher prices could drive car-shoppers to purchase older vehicles that pollute more.LiNeBrEaK"You can mandate the manufacturer to make them, but you can't mandate that consumers buy them," he said.LiNeBrEaKWelch said California consumers also might be compelled to leave the state to buy cars.LiNeBrEaK"There's nothing stopping someone from San Francisco or Sacramento to drive to Reno to buy one," he said. That would end up hurting state and local governments, which collect sales taxes. New car sales have declined significantly, by 23 percent between 2007 and 2008, Welch said.LiNeBrEaKBut state officials said the state's emissions rule would simply encourage automakers to innovate.LiNeBrEaK"This will result in better-engineered cars that use off-the-shelf technologies that are already available to get the reductions in emissions," Young said.LiNeBrEaKCutting state's vehicle emissions LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKHow California would regulate automakers if federal officials allow it to enforce the nation's strictest emissions rules: LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKNew vehicles sold in California would have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016, resulting in an average vehicle fuel-efficiency of 35. 7 miles per gallon.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Utah outlook: Drier summer, wetter winters  	By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune  	BREAKING; News; State  	437 words  	A fresh look at the latest data on climate change strongly suggests that Utah will be hotter, with drier summers and wetter winters.LiNeBrEaKThe trends are being watched closely by people concerned with the state's water supply. They wonder whether the Wasatch and Uinta mountains will continue to store water reliably in the century ahead. LiNeBrEaKClimate scientist Thomas Reichler presented the findings of his University of Utah research group on Monday, the day before the publication of a separate, sobering study that says many damaging effects of climate change are already irreversible.LiNeBrEaK"People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide, the climate would go back to normal in 100 years, 200 years; that's not true," climate researcher Susan Solomon said in a teleconference.LiNeBrEaKRather, her group said that even if carbon emissions can somehow be halted, temperatures around the globe will remain high until at least the year 3000.LiNeBrEaKSolomon, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., is the lead author of an international team's paper reporting irreversible damage from climate change, being published in today's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .LiNeBrEaKShe defines "irreversible" as change that would remain for a thousand years even if humans stopped adding carbon to the atmosphere immediately.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is slow," said Solomon, "but it is unstoppable" -- all the more reason to act quickly, so the long-term situation doesn't get even worse.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the Utah team is offering the clearest picture to date of how climate change can be expected to affect the mountainous north and the desert south regions of the state.LiNeBrEaKReichler noted that computer analyses have improved dramatically and that their projections are tracking closer and closer to observed changes in climate.LiNeBrEaKIn short, he said, Utah can expect to see about 5 to 10 percent less water in the summer over the next century and a 5 to 10 percent increase in water during the winter.LiNeBrEaKSummer temperatures will rise around 7 degrees, while winter temperatures will be about 3 degrees warmer. Less precipitation will fall as snow, he said.LiNeBrEaKHow much of that water will evaporate? Will Utah's reservoirs hold enough water? Will snow melt too fast and too early in the spring?LiNeBrEaKNational Weather Service hydrologist Brian McInerney said Reichler raises important considerations for managing Utah's water supply.LiNeBrEaK"We need to understand what is going on in our backyards," said Jim Steenburgh, chairman of the U.'s meteorology department.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Report: Some climate damage already irreversible  	By Randolph E. Schmid The Associated Press  	RECREATIONAL SPORTS; Features  	870 words  	WASHINGTON &raquo; Many damaging effects of climate change are already basically irreversible, researchers declared Monday, warning that even if carbon emissions can somehow be halted temperatures around the globe will remain high until at least the year 3000.LiNeBrEaK"People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide the climate would go back to normal in 100 years, 200 years; that's not true," climate researcher Susan Solomon said in a teleconference.LiNeBrEaKSolomon, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., is lead author of an international team's paper reporting irreversible damage from climate change, being published in Tuesday's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. LiNeBrEaKShe defines "irreversible" as change that would remain for 1,000 years even if humans stopped adding carbon to the atmosphere immediately.LiNeBrEaKThe findings were announced as President Barack Obama ordered reviews that could lead to greater fuel efficiency and cleaner air, saying the Earth's future depends on cutting air pollution.LiNeBrEaKSaid Solomon, "Climate change is slow, but it is unstoppable" -- all the more reason to act quickly, so the long-term situation doesn't get even worse.LiNeBrEaKAlan Robock, of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers University, agreed with the report's assessment.LiNeBrEaK"It's not like air pollution where if we turn off a smokestack, in a few days the air is clear," said Robock, who was not part of Solomon's research team. "It means we have to try even harder to reduce emissions," he said in a telephone interview.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's report "is quite important, not alarmist, and very important for the current debates on climate policy," added Jonathan Overpeck, a climate researcher at the University of Arizona.LiNeBrEaKIn her paper Solomon, a leader of the International Panel on Climate Change and one of the world's best known researchers on the subject, noted that temperatures around the globe have risen and changes in rainfall patterns have been observed in areas around the Mediterranean, southern Africa and southwestern North America. LiNeBrEaKWarmer climate also is causing expansion of the ocean, and that is expected to increase with the melting of ice on Greenland and Antarctica, the researchers said.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think that the very long time scale of the persistence of these effects has been understood," Solomon said.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming has been slowed by the ocean, Solomon said, because water absorbs a lot of energy to warm up. But that good effect will not only wane over time, the ocean will help keep the planet warmer by giving off its accumulated heat to the air.LiNeBrEaKClimate change has been driven by gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from solar radiation and raise the planet's temperature -- the "greenhouse effect." Carbon dioxide has been the most important of those gases because it remains in the air for hundreds of years. While other gases are responsible for nearly half of the warming, they degrade more rapidly, Solomon said.LiNeBrEaKBefore the industrial revolution the air contained about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide. That has risen to 385 ppm today, and politicians and scientists have debated at what level it could be stabilized.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's paper concludes that if CO2 is allowed to peak at 450-600 parts per million, the results would include persistent decreases in dry-season rainfall that are comparable to the 1930s North American Dust Bowl in zones including southern Europe, northern Africa, southwestern North America, southern Africa and western Australia.LiNeBrEaKGerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said, "The real concern is that the longer we wait to do something, the higher the level of irreversible climate change to which we'll have to adapt." Meehl was not part of Solomon's research team.LiNeBrEaKWhile scientists have been aware of the long-term aspects of climate change, the new report highlights and provides more specifics on them, said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the center.LiNeBrEaK"This aspect is one that is poorly appreciated by policymakers and the general public and it is real," said Trenberth, who was not part of the research group.LiNeBrEaK"The temperature changes and the sea level changes are, if anything underestimated and quite conservative, especially for sea level," he said.LiNeBrEaKWhile he agreed that the rainfall changes mentioned in the paper are under way, Trenberth disagreed with some details of that part of the report.LiNeBrEaK"Even so, there would be changes in snow (to rain), snow pack and water resources, and irreversible consequences even if not quite the way the authors describe," he said. "The policy relevance is clear: We need to act sooner ... because by the time the public and policymakers really realize the changes are here it is far too late to do anything about it. In fact, as the authors point out, it is already too late for some effects."LiNeBrEaKCo-authors of the paper were Gian-Kaspar Plattner and Reto Knutti of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and Pierre Friedlingstein of the National Institute for Scientific Research, Gif sur Yvette, France.LiNeBrEaKThe research was supported by the Office of Science at the Department of Energy.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Frontiers of Science tackles renewable energy  	By Brian Maffly The Salt Lake Tribune  	NEWS; State  	263 words  	Nobel-winning physicist Alan Heeger will discuss low-cost, highly efficient plastic solar cells at the University of Utah's Frontiers of Science lecture on Jan. 29. The cells, made from organic materials, have the highest energy-conversion rating for devices that harvest abundant solar energy and could provide an important energy source in the future, according to research by Heeger, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. LiNeBrEaK"The challenge is clear: we must create the scientific foundation and develop the technology to enable the low-cost fabrication of large areas of high-efficiency solar cells," Heeger said in a U. news release.LiNeBrEaKDevelopment of renewable energy sources is one of the greatest challenges facing society as the supply of fossil fuels dwindles at a time when the global demand is growing and greenhouse emissions warm the planet.LiNeBrEaK"I am excited to have led a research team that created a new low-cost 'tandem' organic solar cell with 6. 5 percent efficiency, the highest record for solar cells made with organic materials," Heeger said.LiNeBrEaKHeeger, who shared the 2000 Nobel prize in chemistry for discovering and developing conductive polymers, holds four patents with nine more pending. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.LiNeBrEaKA joint enterprise of the colleges of Science and Mines and Earth Sciences, the quarterly Frontiers of Science lecture is in its 41st year. Thursday's lecture starts at 7: 30 p.m. in the Skaggs biology building auditorium.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Jan. 29 Additional Readers' letters  	From Mercury News readers  	LETTERS; News; Opinion  	616 words  	"Letters to the Editor"LiNeBrEaKFrom the readers of the Mercury NewsLiNeBrEaKNOTE: The following letters are unedited and reflect only the views of the authorLiNeBrEaKOur present economic situation demonstrates that unrestricted extreme capitalism can be at least as detrimental to society's well being as extreme socialism. The profit motive usually improves our living standard, but left unconstrained, it can result in severe inequities. Health care is a serious case in point. Health insurance, driven by profit motive, is too expensive for the less fortunate. The uninsured must rely on hospital emergency room facilities, increasing overall costs, making insurance even less affordable-a vicious cycle. Justice demands universal health care. But as noted in Jamie Court's oped, (Opinion, Jan. 28), Medicare overhead is about 2 %, compared to about 25% for private insurance. The only effective solution is to remove the profit motive with single-payer health care insurance, like Medicare.LiNeBrEaKCaesar Grolemund LiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKI have a prediction about economic conditions two years hence, and a question at the end of the prediction.LiNeBrEaKOn the one hand, President Obama's campaign rhetoric and voting record indicates a far-left agenda, including a strong dose of environmental extremism, coupled with a certain assumption about the flexibility of the American economy to withstand extraordinary unnecessary challenges from over-regulation, micro management and "redistribution". On the other hand, we have seen our new president to be a highly pragmatic politician, entirely prepared to "throw under the bus" those associations and beliefs that might prove difficult to a successful presidency.LiNeBrEaKSo here's the prediction, write it down and let's review in the fall of 2010. I believe that the smoke-and-mirrors "stimulus" of the American economy does nothing to stimulate investment, hard work or saving, and will thus simply run up a big tab without producing much in the way of economic growth for the American economy. In addition, I believe that the implementation of the draconian, extremist environmentalist agenda will further put a lead weight on American companies and the American economy as a whole, much of it to "fight" the fraud of "global warming". We will restrict new power plants and drilling, insist on higher CAFE standards and cap-and-trade (taxes) and the impact on the average American's lifestyle will be significant........and negative. I predict that we will see economic growth no higher than 2%, and possibly negative for most of the quarters between now and then.LiNeBrEaKAnd so what will Obama do in in the fall of 2010 (assuming I'm right) when all the hocus-pocus and "green jobs" have not kept up American living standards? Will he urge us to "stay the course" as prior presidents have done? Or will he, out of a concern for his legacy as a transformative president, shift gears to a more capitalist-friendly approach?LiNeBrEaKIt's going to be interesting to watch.LiNeBrEaKRon BertiLiNeBrEaKCupertinoLiNeBrEaKMaybe California not being able to pay its bills is a good thing. If we were to continue business as usual, maybe the people who live here would not really get what they have done, which is to vote fiscally irresponsible people into our state government, and wonder where they money goes. Maybe if California can't pay the tax refunds people are owed, the people will stop voting to sell billions of dollars in bonds for things we don't really need.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	TRANSIT-ORIENTED COMMUNITIES A POSITIVE MOVE FOR ENVIRONMENT  	DAN CANTRELL AND RACHAEL MYERS GUEST COLUMNISTS  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A11  	688 words  	Our state may face no challenge greater than the threat of global warming and the lack of sufficient affordable housing - and we can't solve either unless we solve both. Unrelated issues, you say? Think again.LiNeBrEaKThe lack of affordable housing pushes people to live farther from jobs and community services, creating longer commutes. More time spent in cars increases vehicle miles traveled, which leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions. Development at the urban fringe converts working farms and forests to urban uses, resulting in less carbon-sequestering open space and tree canopy.LiNeBrEaKIf that isn't enough for you, the loss of rural and resource land threatens local food security, eliminates wildlife habitat and has been linked to the degradation of Puget Sound. Lack of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income earners exacerbates poverty issues, adding pricey transportation costs to household expenses. LiNeBrEaKTo top it off, the increased infrastructure costs to expand roads and build sewer lines to urban fringe development is an enormous economic burden on all taxpayers. So, what to do?LiNeBrEaKCountless recent planning processes and reports, including efforts by the state's Climate Action Team and Land Use and Climate Change committees, Puget Sound Regional Council, Puget Sound Partnership, Seattle Planning Commission and the Urban Land Institute, have come to the same conclusion: Walkable, mixed-use communities offering good transit and biking opportunities, as well as housing affordable to a range of incomes, is key to keeping our state environmentally, socially and economically sustainable.LiNeBrEaKFortunately, these "transit-oriented communities" are exactly what more people are seeking. "Walkability" has become a top real estate amenity as people look for vibrant neighborhoods where they can live, work, shop and play without relying on a car.LiNeBrEaKHow do we get more neighborhoods like that? And how do we make them affordable to a full range of incomes?LiNeBrEaKState House Bill 1490 strives to do just that. The Creating Transit-Oriented Communities legislation, sponsored by Rep. Sharon Nelson, has been selected as a priority for the Washington environmental community. Central components of the bill include:LiNeBrEaK-Requiring jurisdictions to consider climate impacts of land use and transportation. Meeting state greenhouse gas and vehicle miles traveled reduction requirements will necessitate more compact and walkable development in our cities, and more preservation of our rural and resource lands. Local jurisdictions will decide, through their comprehensive plans, how to best meet those goals.LiNeBrEaK-Maximizing land-use potential near high-capacity transit stations. What better way to leverage the multibillion-dollar transit investments made by the region's taxpayers than to provide more opportunities for people to live and work near transit? Local neighborhoods will decide the shape and character of compact and walkable communities.LiNeBrEaK-Strengthening affordability requirements in cities. New guidelines will require cities to protect existing affordable housing stock and direct more affordability programs to new development in transit station areas. Local jurisdictions can decide what best mix of programs and incentives will meet the requirements.LiNeBrEaKThe bill will support and strengthen the good work already being done by many cities. To name a few, Tacoma, Spokane and Lynnwood are leaders on looking at climate impacts of land use and transportation. Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond already have "transit-oriented community"-supportive zoning in most of their transit station areas. Kirkland and Seattle are making progress on providing housing to low- and moderate-income earners.LiNeBrEaKFor those and other jurisdictions, the bill will provide the framework to address climate change and housing affordability in their local policymaking.LiNeBrEaKThis legislation will be a win for communities and a win for the environment. And with the challenges of global warming and housing affordability growing larger by the day, we need to act now if we want to leave future generations with a state that is environmentally, socially and economically sound.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	GREGOIRE APPLAUDS OBAMA'S MOVE ON CAR EMISSIONS\ STATE COULD SET STRICTER STANDARDS  	JUDY VUE P-I reporter  	NEWS; Pg. A9  	645 words  	Washington state is on board with what's going on in the other Washington when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama on Monday directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review a 2007 decision that prevented California and other states - including Washington - from setting their own vehicle emission standards that would have been tougher than federal standards. That review may lead to a reversal of that decision.LiNeBrEaKIn 2002, California adopted the first state law that called for reduced emissions. Numerous times, they were granted permission from the EPA to override the federal government's emission standards and adopt their own tougher restrictions. However in 2005, California applied for a waiver that would have forced automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars that would have cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. Their application was denied in 2007. LiNeBrEaKObama's call for a review process has climate change advocates cheering and automakers questioning the move. Besides California, 13 other states want to set their own pollution controls.LiNeBrEaKGov. Chris Gregoire applauded Obama's actions.LiNeBrEaK"I urge the EPA to act quickly to address the president's request to give Washington and other states the ability to set their own vehicle emission standards. It is past time to clean up auto emissions and do our part to reduce global warming and improve the health of our citizens," she said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKHer views were shared by another leading Democrat on environmental policy.LiNeBrEaKSen. Phil Rockefeller, D-Bainbridge Island, is chairman of the Environment, Water and Energy Committee.LiNeBrEaK"It's a breath of fresh air that our president is taking steps to move toward a day when California and Washington and other states can implement something that will benefit public health," he said.LiNeBrEaKThat sentiment was not shared by the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Jim Honeyford, R-Sunnyside.LiNeBrEaK"I don't support (states) setting their own (vehicle emissions) standards," he said.LiNeBrEaKInstead, Honeyford said the standards should be set to a federal level.LiNeBrEaKThe National Automobile Dealers' Association also says there should only be a federal standard.LiNeBrEaKDavid Regan, the association's vice president for legislative affairs, said "numerous unintended consequences" would arise from letting states choose their own standards, such as job loss and cross-border sales of vehicles that would economically hurt dealers.LiNeBrEaK"With almost 1,000 auto dealerships closing last year at a cost of over 50,000 jobs, we are hopeful the president and the EPA administrator will realize that a single national fuel-economy standard set by his administration is smarter than a patchwork of state regulations that further endanger the struggling auto industry," Regan said.LiNeBrEaKState Rep. Shelly Short, R-Addy, the ranking GOP member of the Ecology and Parks Committee, also questioned whether state standards would help.LiNeBrEaK"The auto industry is already struggling and they need some certainty of direction," she said. "It sends a mixed message to have two distinct separate standards. I'd like to see more discussion of a federal standard."LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Short said she was concerned that vehicles would end up costing more if automakers were forced to manufacture their cars to meet different emission standards around the country.LiNeBrEaKHowever, K.C. Golden, director of environmental nonprofit group Climate Solutions, said the increase in car prices would be offset by fuel savings.LiNeBrEaK"Part of the strategy is to reduce fossil fuel dependence," he said. "(This) saves consumers an enormous amount of money at the gas pump."LiNeBrEaKIn spite of the critiques by groups such as NADA, Golden said "this is the easy, uncontroversial stuff that we ought to be doing."LiNeBrEaKThis report includes information from The Associated Press.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   SECOND EDITION	Some climate damage is irreversible, report states Time to act is now, before situation gets worse, researcher says.  	By Randolph E. Schmid The Associated Press  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	524 words  	WASHINGTON - Many damaging effects of climate change are already basically irreversible, researchers declared Monday, warning that even if carbon emissions can somehow be halted, temperatures around the globe will remain high until at least the year 3000. LiNeBrEaK"People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide the climate would go back to normal in 100 years, 200 years; that's not true," researcher Susan Solomon said in a teleconference.LiNeBrEaKSolomon, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., is lead author of an international team's paper reporting irreversible damage from climate change, being published in today's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.LiNeBrEaKShe defines "irreversible" as change that would remain for 1,000 years even if humans stopped adding carbon to the atmosphere immediately.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is slow, but it is unstoppable," Solomon said, while arguing that it was all the more reason to act quickly, so the long-term situation doesn't get even worse.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's report "is quite important, not alarmist, and very important for the current debates on climate policy," said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate researcher at the University of Arizona.LiNeBrEaKClimate change has been driven by gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from the sun and raise the planet's temperature - the "greenhouse effect."LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide has been the most important of those gases because it remains in the air for hundreds of years. While other gases are responsible for nearly half of the warming, they degrade more rapidly, Solomon said.LiNeBrEaKBefore the industrial revolution, the air contained about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide. That has risen to 385 ppm today, and politicians and scientists have debated at what level it could be stabilized.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's paper concludes that if carbon dioxide is allowed to peak at 450-600 parts per million, the results would include persistent decreases in dry-season rainfall that are comparable to the 1930s North American Dust Bowl in zones including southern Europe, northern Africa, southwestern North America, southern Africa and western Australia.LiNeBrEaKWhile scientists have been aware of the long-term aspects of climate change, the new report highlights and provides more specifics on them, said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.LiNeBrEaK"This aspect is one that is poorly appreciated by policymakers and the general public, and it is real," said Trenberth, who was not part of the research group.LiNeBrEaKWhile he agreed that the rainfall changes mentioned in the paper are under way, Trenberth disagreed with some details of that part of the report.LiNeBrEaK"Even so, there would be changes in snow (to rain), snow pack and water resources, and irreversible consequences even if not quite the way the authors describe," he said. "The policy relevance is clear: We need to act sooner ... because by the time the public and policymakers really realize the changes are here it is far too late to do anything about it. In fact, as the authors point out, it is already too late for some effects."

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Obama reopens tailpipe debate EPA told to reconsider states' car-emission initiatives  	BEN FELLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. 003  	760 words  	President Obama took aim yesterday at the lofty goals of making the nation more energy-independent and the planet less prone to warming, ordering reviews that could lead to tougher auto emission standards in some states and greater pressure on automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKAttacking a Bush administration policy, Obama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine whether California and other states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards than the federal government has set to combat a build-up of greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to affect 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said in his first formal event in the ornate East Room of the White House.LiNeBrEaK"It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia, New Jersey and at least 12 other states have tried to come up with tougher emission standards than those imposed by the federal government, but, Obama said, "Washington stood in their way." The president wants the EPA to take a second look at a decision prohibiting California - and the other states that want to follow its model - from setting tougher tailpipe emission standards.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state are ready to adopt California's standards, and they have been under consideration elsewhere, too.LiNeBrEaKMore broadly, Obama sought to show he was not waiting to put his stamp on energy policy, which has both near-term implications on the sagging economy and long-range effects on pollution, climate change and national security.LiNeBrEaK"Year after year, decade after decade, we've chosen delay over decisive action," Obama said. "Rigid ideology has overruled sound science. Special interests have overshadowed common sense. Rhetoric has not led to the hard work needed to achieve results - and our leaders raise their voices each time there's a spike on gas prices, only to grow quiet when the price falls at the pump."LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Act gives California special authority to regulate vehicle pollution, because the state began regulating such pollution before the federal government became involved. But a federal waiver is still required; wherever the waiver is granted, other states can choose to adopt California's standards or the federal ones.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007 the Bush administration's EPA denied California's waiver request, gaining praise from the auto industry but touching off a storm of investigations and lawsuits from Democrats and environmental groups who contended the denial was based on political instead of scientific reasons.LiNeBrEaKObama yesterday directed the EPA to re-examine the decision. That does not yet overturn anything, but the involved states considered it a victory.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said. He added: "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed restrictions would force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKCarmakers would need to boost fuel efficiency in new vehicles to about 36. 8 miles per gallon in the states that chose to adopt the California standards. Requiring automakers to build cars that get more miles to the gallon would reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the tailpipes of vehicles.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers argue that state-by-state regulations could require dealerships in some states to limit sales of large trucks in order to meet the standards. Industry officials also have said they would face billions of dollars in new costs to meet the rules at a time when General Motors and Chrysler needed billions in federal loans to stay afloat.LiNeBrEaK"Let me be clear: Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry," Obama said. "It is to help America's automakers prepare for the future."LiNeBrEaKA law passed by Congress in 2007 requires that by 2020, new cars and trucks meet a standard of 35 miles per gallon, a 40 percent increase over the status quo. But the Bush administration did not set regulations in support of that law.LiNeBrEaKYesterday Obama ordered new guidelines to start affecting cars sold in 2011.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Auto rules put in play  	Brian Nearing, Times Union, Albany, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	773 words  	Jan. 27--ALBANY -- Americans could find less-polluting cars on future showroom floors after President Barack Obama opened the door for 14 states, including New York, to follow California's proposed stricter vehicle emissions standards as a way to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe President ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday to revisit a December 2007 decision by the Bush administration that blocked California from setting emissions standards tougher than those mandated by the federal Clean Air Act, and stymied other states from following suit. LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said in his first formal event in the ornate East Room of the White House.LiNeBrEaK"It will be the policy of my administration," he said, "to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposal calls for greenhouse gas cuts to start in 2009 and be fully in place by 2016 -- four years earlier than increased vehicle mileage standards adopted last year by the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKNationally, environmentalists estimated that stricter California rules would prevent annual emissions equivalent to 100 million tons of carbon dioxide, a known greenhouse gas that is driving global warming, according to international scientific consensus.LiNeBrEaKThat's equivalent to closing more than 30 coal-fired power plants or removing 20 million cars from the road, according to Environmental Defense, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement drew praise from New York Gov. David Paterson.LiNeBrEaK"Today's green light from President Obama sends a strong signal to the public that global warming must be comprehensively addressed by every segment of our economy," Paterson said in a statement. "Motor vehicles are the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in New York and throughout the Northeast, and only by limiting tailpipe emissions and increasing gas mileage will it be possible to address the negative impact of motor vehicles on our environment."LiNeBrEaKIn New York, the tougher rules could reduce CO2 by almost 15 millions tons annually by 2020, or about 20 percent below current emissions, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation.LiNeBrEaKUnder California's approach, car makers would need to boost fuel efficiency in new vehicles to about 36. 8 miles per gallon.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers, which sued to block the state regulations and supported the Bush administration when it blocked California's effort, argued the step could limit sales of large trucks.LiNeBrEaKThe states that want to follow California -- New York as well as Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington -- account for nearly half of the U.S. population, and about 45 percent of new automobile sales.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups were quick to praise the Obama administration. "This directive is a much welcome move toward an energy-efficient economy, with cleaner air and reduced greenhouse gas emissions," said Trip Van Noppen, president of the nonprofit law firm Earthjustice.LiNeBrEaKCriticism came from Congressional Republicans and a conservative think tank that has long touted what it calls the uncertainty behind global warming.LiNeBrEaKFederal fuel economy standards are a "huge hidden burden" on the auto industry, said Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Washington, D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute. The group, which has been funded by Exxon Mobil and Ford Motor Co., claims increased fuel standards will cause "thousands" of additional motor vehicle deaths in smaller vehicles.LiNeBrEaKU.S. House Republican Leader John Boehner -- who last month voted against the government bailout of the financially troubled auto industry -- said stricter emissions standards would destroy jobs.LiNeBrEaK"Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry," Obama said. "It is to help America's automakers prepare for the future."LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Final Edition	Inhofe blasts Obama decision  	JIM MYERS World Washington Bureau  	News; Pg. A1  	579 words  	WASHINGTON U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe said Monday that President Obama's move toward allowing California and other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions is the latest example of "environmental thuggery.'' "It is an arrogant abuse of power,'' the Oklahoma Republican said, warning that the president's actions will cost jobs in an already weakened economy. "This is a crippling mandate for the ailing auto industry,'' he said. Obama ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to review a Bush administration decision to deny California a waiver that would allow it to develop its own standards for auto emissions.  LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,'' he said, describing California's efforts on that front as bold. Obama also directed the U.S. Department of Transportation to move ahead with new fuel-efficiency standards and be ready to implement them for model year 2011. Not only will such actions be a boost to the economy, the president said, but they will prove to the world that the United States is ready to take the lead. Obama's actions thrilled environmentalists, who viewed them as his first step toward combating global warming which Inhofe has dismissed as a hoax. As the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Inhofe routinely takes a leading role on such issues, and clearly nothing the new president said changed the senator's approach. "This is the latest example of what I referred to in a speech recently as 'environmental thuggery,' " he said. "The last thing our economy needs is a patchwork of regulatory compliance regimes in addition to the federal standard that would be even more costly for automobile manufacturers. Put simply, this will mean job losses." Sen. Barbara Boxer, who succeeded Inhofe as chairman of the Senate committee, is a Democrat from California, and she welcomed Obama's order to the EPA to review the decision by the Bush administration against granting the waiver to her state. "I have long said that granting California the waiver so that California and 18 other states can address tailpipe emissions from cars is the best first step the president can take to combat global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign oil,'' she said. "It is so refreshing to see that the president understands that science must lead the way.'' Scientists and professionals at the EPA have made it clear that science and the law demand that the waiver be granted, said Boxer, vowing to work with that agency to ensure that the waiver moves forward quickly. "The president's comments about the importance of American leadership on clean energy and global warming were also music to my ears,'' she said. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, also applauded Obama's quick action. "With this announcement from President Obama less than a week into his administration, it is clear that California and the environment now have a strong ally in the White House,'' Schwarzenegger said. Obama's actions, he said, also eventually could result in saving money at the gas pump. According to Inhofe's office, other states that are following California's lead include Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and New Jersey.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Final Edition	Study says climate changes irreversible  	RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press  	News; Pg. A3  	584 words  	WASHINGTON Many damaging effects of climate change are already basically irreversible, researchers declared Monday, warning that even if carbon emissions can somehow be halted, temperatures around the globe will remain high until at least the year 3000.

LiNeBrEaKThe findings were announced as President Barack Obama ordered reviews that could lead to greater fuel efficiency and cleaner air, saying the Earth's future depends on cutting air pollution. Said Solomon, "Climate change is slow, but it is unstoppable" all the more reason to act quickly, so the long-term situation doesn't get even worse. Solomon's report "is quite important, not alarmist, and very important for the current debates on climate policy," added Jonathan Overpeck, a climate researcher at the University of Arizona. In her paper Solomon, a leader of the International Panel on Climate Change and one of the world's best known researchers on the subject, noted that temperatures around the globe have risen and changes in rainfall patterns have been observed in areas around the Mediterranean, southern Africa and southwestern North America. Warmer climate also is causing expansion of the ocean, and that is expected to increase with the melting of ice on Greenland and Antarctica, the researchers said. "I don't think that the very long time scale of the persistence of these effects has been understood," Solomon said. Global warming has been slowed by the ocean, Solomon said, because water absorbs a lot of energy to warm up. But that good effect will not only wane over time, the ocean will help keep the planet warmer by giving off its accumulated heat to the air. Climate change has been driven by gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from solar radiation and raise the planet's temperature the "greenhouse effect." Carbon dioxide has been the most important of those gases because it remains in the air for hundreds of years. While other gases are responsible for nearly half of the warming, they degrade more rapidly, Solomon said. Before the industrial revolution the air contained about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide. That has risen to 385 ppm today, and politicians and scientists have debated at what level it could be stabilized. Solomon's paper concludes that if CO2 is allowed to peak at 450-600 parts per million, the results would include persistent decreases in dry-season rainfall that are comparable to the 1930s North American Dust Bowl in zones including southern Europe, northern Africa, southwestern North America, southern Africa and western Australia.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Inhofe blasts Obama decision: He says allowing states to set emissions standards is 'thuggery.'  	Jim Myers, Tulsa World, Okla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	631 words  	Jan. 27--WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe said Monday that President Obama's move toward allowing California and other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions is the latest example of "environmental thuggery."LiNeBrEaK"It is an arrogant abuse of power," the Oklahoma Republican said, warning that the president's actions will cost jobs in an already weakened economy. LiNeBrEaK"This is a crippling mandate for the ailing auto industry," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to review a Bush administration decision to deny California a waiver that would allow it to develop its own standards for auto emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," he said, describing California's efforts on that front as bold.LiNeBrEaKObama also directed the U.S. Department of Transportation to move ahead with new fuel-efficiency standards and be ready to implement them for model year 2011.LiNeBrEaKNot only will such actions be a boost to the economy, the president said, but they will prove to the world that the United States is ready to take the lead.LiNeBrEaKObama's actions thrilled environmentalists, who viewed them as his first step toward combating global warming -- which Inhofe has dismissed as a hoax.LiNeBrEaKAs the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Inhofe routinely takes a leading role on such issues, and clearly nothing the new president said changed the senator's approach.LiNeBrEaK"ThisLiNeBrEaKis the latest example of what I referred to in a speech recently as 'environmental thuggery,' " he said.LiNeBrEaK"The last thing our economy needs is a patchwork of regulatory compliance regimes in addition to the federal standard that would be even more costly for automobile manufacturers. Put simply, this will mean job losses."LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, who succeeded Inhofe as chairman of the Senate committee, is a Democrat from California, and she welcomed Obama's order to the EPA to review the decision by the Bush administration against granting the waiver to her state.LiNeBrEaK"I have long said that granting California the waiver so that California and 18 other states can address tailpipe emissions from cars is the best first step the president can take to combat global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign oil," she said.LiNeBrEaK"It is so refreshing to see that the president understands that science must lead the way."LiNeBrEaKScientists and professionals at the EPA have made it clear that science and the law demand that the waiver be granted, said Boxer, vowing to work with that agency to ensure that the waiver moves forward quickly.LiNeBrEaK"The president's comments about the importance of American leadership on clean energy and global warming were also music to my ears," she said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, also applauded Obama's quick action.LiNeBrEaK"With this announcement from President Obama less than a week into his administration, it is clear that California and the environment now have a strong ally in the White House," Schwarzenegger said.LiNeBrEaKObama's actions, he said, also eventually could result in saving money at the gas pump.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Inhofe's office, other states that are following California's lead include Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKJim Myers (202) 484-1424 jim.myers@tulsaworld.com	EMISSIONS (93%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (93%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (77%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (77%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (76%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (74%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (72%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (72%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (62%); INFRASTRUCTURE (52%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  		Entertainment  	OKLAHOMA, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 27, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090127-TU-Inhofe-blasts-Obama-decision-0127  	Newspaper  	TU  	2009 Tulsa World   	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%); US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); JIM INHOFE (94%); BARBARA BOXER (53%); ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (50%)  														
USA TODAY 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Emperor penguins at risk as ice melts  	Doyle Rice  	LIFE; Pg. 7D  	292 words  	Emperor penguins, the waddling stars of the 2005 movie March of the Penguins, could face extinction by 2100 as Antarctic sea ice melts because of global warming, a study reported Monday. LiNeBrEaKThe study, the first to link climate change with this penguin species, is published  in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.LiNeBrEaKAntarctic sea ice is projected to melt as greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels  warms the  atmosphere. "Sea ice is essential to the emperor penguin life cycle, as the animals use it to breed, feed, and molt," the authors write in the study.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, led by Stephanie Jenouvrier  and Hal Caswell  of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, based their sea-ice projections on 10 computer models used by the 2007 United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKIf sea ice shrinks in Antarctica as the models predict, authors say an emperor penguin colony in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, would decline from its peak of 6,000 breeding pairs in the 1960s to about 400 by 2100. Study co-author Caswell, a Woods Hole biologist, says researchers believe that would qualify as a "quasi-extinction," based on  the 95% or more population decline.LiNeBrEaKBut last month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declined to list the emperor penguin as an endangered species. In an online report, the service wrote that "review of the best available scientific information found no significant threats to the current survival of the emperor penguin."LiNeBrEaKCaswell and his co-authors say that "to avoid extinction, emperor penguins will have to adapt, migrate or change the timing of their growth stages." But unlike other Antarctic bird species,  emperor penguins have historically seemed slow to change, they note.

USA TODAY 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Eager for Obama to change policies governing science  		NEWS; Pg. 8A  	594 words  	President Obama has quickly established that he is a president for positive change, especially in science. Allowing embryonic stem-cell research will have an effect on spinal cord injuries and other chronic conditions such as Parkinson's disease and diabetes. Permitting the funding of clinics that allow education on birth control and women's rights concerning choice would also be a welcome step forward. Isn't it time we protect the rights of the living, make that our priority and stop obsessing over the sanctity of microscopic cells ("The scientific climate is changing," Cover story, Life, Jan. 19)?LiNeBrEaKThe Bush era was a disaster concerning human rights and science and technology. It is time now to be guided by reason and compassion and leave behind faith-based dogma. LiNeBrEaKMarc TanenbaumLiNeBrEaKLongmont, Colo.LiNeBrEaKFocus on issues at homeLiNeBrEaKIt is no surprise that President Obama got to work signing executive orders, but the fact that he reversed a ban on giving federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information on it was a bombshell ("Obama reverses U.S. abortion-funding policy," USATODAY.com, Friday).LiNeBrEaKThis is not an argument for or against abortion. Roe v. Wade is a complicated matter. But the nation is sinking deeper into debt every month, people are losing their jobs and homes, and some cannot afford medical insurance (never mind food for the family). How do we still have money for family planning programs and abortions in other countries?LiNeBrEaKI thought we were supposed to cut spending and look out for our economy. I expected change at home, not for programs and services abroad. Our economy demands it.LiNeBrEaKRose MurphyLiNeBrEaKFairhope, Ala.LiNeBrEaKHope for the futureLiNeBrEaKReading about President Obama's first full day in office, I was reminded of the moment in The Wizard of Oz when the world changes from black and white to glorious color ("Starting with diplomacy, Obama sets new course," Cover story, News, Jan. 22).LiNeBrEaKWhereas the prospects for the country once looked dark and dim, suddenly all seems bright and possible.LiNeBrEaKRobert J. InlowLiNeBrEaKCharlottesville, Va.LiNeBrEaKPromise brokenLiNeBrEaKObama stated in his inaugural address that "we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises." He made numerous promises during the presidential campaign. One promise that he reiterated was to end the war in Iraq.LiNeBrEaKObama stated throughout the presidential campaign that on his first day in office he would summon the joint chiefs of staff and "give them a new mission and that is to end this war, responsibly and deliberately, but decisively."LiNeBrEaKHowever, this promise, like the one about accepting public campaign financing, was broken. He met with his military advisers on Day 1 of his presidency but gave no order to immediately put an end to the war. Day 1. First broken promise.LiNeBrEaKActions speak louder than words. As Bill Clinton once said, "No wonder Americans hate politics when, year in and year out, they hear politicians make promises that won't come true because they don't even mean them -- campaign fantasies that win elections but don't get nations moving again."LiNeBrEaKMark G. KilykLiNeBrEaKPhiladelphiaLiNeBrEaKCut more costsLiNeBrEaKFresh from an inauguration estimated at costing  up to $170 million  (including at least $40 million in donations to Obama's inaugural committee),  President Obama expressed concern about the many Americans having to tighten their belts and accordingly signed an order imposing a pay freeze on his staff.LiNeBrEaKWouldn't it have been better to put a freeze on the cost of the inauguration?

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	California finds friend in Obama  	By SAMANTHA YOUNG/and ERICA WERNER Associated Press  	NATIONAL  	1023 words  	SACRAMENTO -- President Barack Obama handed California a big environmental victory Monday by endorsing a key part of the state's greenhouse gas reduction plans.LiNeBrEaKHe also gave a public shout-out to the Golden State, offering a clear sign that liberal-leaning California can expect a friendly relationship with his administration after eight years of clashes with former President George W. Bush.LiNeBrEaK"California has shown bold and bipartisan leadership through its effort to forge 21st century standards, and over a dozen states have followed its lead," Obama said at a news conference where he announced that his administration would revisit the Bush administration's controversial decision to deny California permission to control tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. LiNeBrEaK"Instead of serving as a partner, Washington stood in their way," Obama said. "The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."LiNeBrEaKObama's announcement on his seventh day in office delighted California officials who have criticized his predecessor for ignoring the state's long tradition of setting its own air standards.LiNeBrEaK"For too long, Washington has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the environment," Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said a news conference at the state capitol. "Now California finally has a partner and an ally in Washington, in the White House."LiNeBrEaKBecause California began regulating vehicle pollution before the federal government did, the state has special status under the Clean Air Act to implement tougher emission standards than those promulgated by the federal government.LiNeBrEaKBut the state must first get a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. California was granted about 50 such waivers -- and never denied -- before seeking a waiver in 2005 to implement a landmark state law that would force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKThe auto regulations were to have been a major part of California's first-in-the-nation global warming law that aims to reduce greenhouse gases economy-wide by 25 percent -- to 1990 levels -- by 2020. Air regulators are counting on the auto emission reductions to meet about 18 percent of the state's proposed reductions.LiNeBrEaKIf California is granted an emissions waiver, other states can then choose to adopt California's standards or go with the federal ones. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia were ready to implement the California standards when, after months of delay and controversy, then-EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson announced in December 2007 that he was denying the waiver.LiNeBrEaKThat sparked outrage, investigations and lawsuits from California officials. Congressional investigations led byLiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, found that Johnson had overruled the unanimous recommendations of career scientists at the agency.LiNeBrEaKBoxer said Obama's order was "a vindication for common sense."LiNeBrEaK"We need to mobilize for energy independence. We need to mobilize to fight global warming," Boxer said at a news conference in Washington. "It's as plain as the nose on your face. That's what we need to do. We're proving it in our state."LiNeBrEaKAlthough Obama's directive to his new EPA administrator Lisa Jackson -- who began her first week on the job Monday -- doesn't amount to giving the state the waiver, California officials were confident that would be the eventual outcome.LiNeBrEaK"It was a controversial decision by Steven Johnson. California has never been denied an application. This was the first. In my opinion it was transparently political," said state Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, who authored the 2002 law that was the basis for California's waiver request to the federal government.LiNeBrEaK"What a difference a week makes," Pavley said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed standards call for automakers to make cars and trucks that emit fewer greenhouses by improving the efficiency of the air conditioning, using different paint and materials to build the cars or improving fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKThe improvements must equate to a fleetwide 35. 7 miles per gallon in 2016 (cars are higher but larger trucks pull the figure down) and 42. 5 miles per gallon in 2020. Those numbers are more aggressive than national fuel economy standards adopted by the federal government and relied upon by Johnson when he denied the California waiver and said a nationwide approach would be better.LiNeBrEaKCarmakers also opposed granting the waiver, contending they would face billions of dollars in new costs to meet the rules. In a statement released Monday, the National Association of Manufacturers said allowing California to implement its rules "would lead to a patchwork of greenhouse gas reduction laws when climate change is a global issue and should be addressed on a national level."LiNeBrEaKMary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, said car manufacturers are already meeting the 2010 standards.LiNeBrEaK"They just have to sell us cars that they are already making," Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger, who in a letter last week had asked Obama to revisit the matter, said he suggested the federal government adopt California's standards nationwide. He made that pitch in a phone call Monday to Carol Browner, who is assuming a new White House post to coordinate energy and climate-related issues.LiNeBrEaK"It would be great to actually do this nationwide so car that manufacturers don't just have two standards but that they only have one," Schwarzenegger said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia, other states and environmental groups had sued over the Bush's administration's waiver denial.LiNeBrEaKScott Gerber, spokesman for California Attorney General Jerry Brown, said Monday that once EPA takes action to reconsider the waiver denial, the state would ask the court to set the lawsuit aside.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the California Air Resources Board, California does not need to resubmit the waiver request, but instead will seek reconsideration based on the record already before EPA. Although the timeline is uncertain, Nichols said the state likely would have to wait until May or June before for a final decision.LiNeBrEaKErica Werner reported from Washington.

Ventura County Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	California rules on emissions to get EPA review  	Michael Collins, Ventura County Star, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1061 words  	Jan. 27--WASHINGTON -- In a dramatic break with the Bush administration, President Barack Obama ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday to re-examine whether California and other states should be allowed to set their own tough auto emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKThe decision, coming less than a week after Obama assumed office, fulfills one of the new president's campaign promises and could set the stage for the state to receive a waiver that is necessary for the new standards to become law. LiNeBrEaK"It's a brand new day," said state Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, who wrote the state's landmark tailpipe emissions law. "What a difference a week makes."LiNeBrEaKThe California Legislature passed tough new emissions rules for cars and trucks in 2002, but they have been on hold since late 2007, when the Bush administration refused to grant the necessary waiver.LiNeBrEaKThe new rules, which have been opposed by the auto industry, would force automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKThe federal Clean Air Act gives California the authority to impose air-quality rules that are tougher than the national standard but requires a waiver from the EPA before the state can proceed.LiNeBrEaK'Rigid ideology' Stephen Johnson, who headed the EPA under the Bush administration, refused to grant the waiver, saying California did not have "compelling and extraordinary" conditions to set its own standards.LiNeBrEaKThirteen other states already have adopted California's standards, and five others are in the process of adopting them. A waiver would clear the way for them to impose the tougher standards as well and would force auto manufacturers to produce more fuel-efficient cars nationwide.LiNeBrEaKIn announcing his decision on Monday, Obama said too often "rigid ideology" has overruled "sound science" when it comes to combating climate change.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with not against states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said. He added: "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said in his first formal event in the East Room of the White House.LiNeBrEaKDecision seen as victory Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has made the state's pioneering efforts to combat global warming his signature political issue, lavishly praised Obama.LiNeBrEaK"For too long, Washington has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the environment," Schwarzenegger said. "Now we have an ally and partner in the White House. There was a promise made to the people by President Obama; the promise has been kept."LiNeBrEaKAt a Sacramento news conference Monday, Schwarzenegger also praised Pavley's sustained advocacy on an issue she initiated eight years ago this month. "Talk about someone with staying power!" he said.LiNeBrEaKObama's decision doesn't grant the waiver to California; it merely orders the EPA to re-examine the issue. Still, environmentalists and lawmakers who have been pushing for the new standards consider Obama's decision a victory and said they feel confident the waiver will eventually be granted.LiNeBrEaK"I would say there is almost no doubt" the waiver will be approved, said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the environmental group Clean Air Watch. "I think the reason he didn't grant it is he doesn't want to create the appearance the White House is ordering the EPA to take a certain action. I think he has sent them a signal to take another look at it and make a decision based on science rather than political interference."LiNeBrEaKRep. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara, called Obama's announcement "another dramatic and welcomed break from the misguided environmental and energy policies of his predecessor."LiNeBrEaK"We cannot afford to delay in giving states the right to combat global warming, save on fuel costs and pursue energy independence through more efficient and cleaner vehicles," Capps said.LiNeBrEaKWarning of job losses California EPA Secretary Linda Adams said obtaining the waiver is "hugely important" to meeting the broader greenhouse gas-reduction targets established by the state. She noted the improvements in automobile efficiency required by the Pavley law would account for 20 percent of the overall emission goals spelled out in the California plan.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said granting the waiver so California and the other states can move ahead with the new standards is "the best first step the president can take to combat global warming and reduce our dependence on foreign oil."LiNeBrEaKBoxer, chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, battled the Bush administration for months over its refusal to grant the waiver. Her committee obtained documents indicating Johnson had ignored the advice of the EPA staff, which argued that California had met the necessary legal standards.LiNeBrEaK"It is so refreshing to see that the president understands that science must lead the way," Boxer said of Obama's decision.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, many Republican lawmakers warned Obama's decision would cost millions of American jobs if automakers are forced to spend billions to comply with different emissions standards in dozens of different states.LiNeBrEaK"The effect of this policy will be to destroy American jobs at the very time government leaders should be working together to protect and create them," House Republican Leader John Boehner said.LiNeBrEaKThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers reiterated its support for a national standards program that "bridges state and federal concerns and moves all stakeholders forward" and stressed it is ready to work with the new administration on developing a nationwide approach.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Timm Herdt and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Ventura County Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Clear road for tailpipe rules: California closer to waiver  	Ventura County Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	502 words  	Jan. 27--President Barack Obama is not shy about breaking with the policies of his predecessor. Monday, he ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider whether California and 13 other states can mandate tough, new auto-emissions standards, tougher than the federal standards. LiNeBrEaKHe didn't directly order the EPA to do so, but a savvy and seasoned regulator can sense which way the wind is blowing on this one.LiNeBrEaKTo underscore his stand on the environment and greenhouse gases, Mr. Obama made the announcement in the formal surroundings of the White House East Room.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse-gas emission," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air law allows California to seek special permission to impose its own auto-pollution and fuel-efficiency standards because it began regulating them before the federal government.LiNeBrEaKThese waivers were almost routinely granted until 2007, when the Bush administration EPA rejected a California plan, authored by former Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, ordering automakers to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKThe automakers sued to block the regulations when they were first passed and will surely sue again when the waiver is granted.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush-era EPA argued that the waiver became unneeded because the president had just signed a law requiring new cars and trucks to average 35 miles per gallon, up from the current 27. 5, by 2020, but the Bush administration never took steps to implement the law.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama has now ordered the EPA to set new fuel-efficiency standards beginning in 2011.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration muddied the regulatory waters by its propensity to listen to its political appointees rather than to career scientists and regulators. And the auto industry tends to cry wolf and moan about costs on all wavier requests by California.LiNeBrEaKFor expamle, automakers made the same doomsday forecasts in opposing the state's waiver requests to require cars to be equipped with catalytic converters and fueled with unleaded gas. In each case, the industry's predictions of burdensome costs and reduced performance were proven incorrect, and the California regulations went on to become the national standard.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is one of the nation's largest emitters of greenhouse gases. It should have been applauded for its efforts to reduce such emissions, not stonewalled by the EPA and the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKNow that Mr. Obama has signaled that the federal goverment will no longer stand in the way of California's request, the EPA should grant the waiver quickly.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Climate has suffered damage that won't heal, research says  	RANDOLPH E. SCHMID  	FRONT; Pg. A5  	541 words  	By Randolph E. SchmidLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKMany damaging effects of climate change already are basically irreversible, researchers declared Monday and warned that even if carbon emissions somehow can be halted, temperatures around the globe will remain high until at least the year 3000. LiNeBrEaK"People have imagined that if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide, the climate would go back to normal in 100 years, 200 years; that's not true," climate researcher Susan Solomon said in a teleconference.LiNeBrEaKSolomon, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., is lead author of an international team's paper reporting irreversible damage from climate change, being published in today's edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.LiNeBrEaKSolomon defines "irreversible" as change that would remain for 1,000 years even if humans stopped adding carbon to the atmosphere immediately. Alan Robock, of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers University, agreed with the report's assessment.LiNeBrEaK"It's not like air pollution where if we turn off a smokestack, in a few days the air is clear," said Robock, who was not part of Solomon's research team. "It means we have to try even harder to reduce emissions," he said in a telephone interview.LiNeBrEaKIn her paper Solomon, a leader of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and one of the world's best known researchers on the subject, noted that temperatures around the globe have risen and changes in rainfall patterns have been observed in areas around the Mediterranean, southern Africa and southwestern North America. Warmer climate also is causing expansion of the ocean, and that is expected to increase with the melting of ice on Greenland and Antarctica, the researchers said.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think that the very long time scale of the persistence of these effects has been understood," Solomon said.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming has been slowed by the ocean, Solomon said, because water absorbs a lot of energy to warm up. But that good effect will not only wane over time, the ocean will help keep the planet warmer by giving off its accumulated heat to the air.LiNeBrEaKClimate change, most scientists agree, has been driven by gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from solar radiation and raise the planet's temperature - the "greenhouse effect." Carbon dioxide has been the most important of those gases because it remains in the air for hundreds of years.LiNeBrEaKBefore the industrial revolution, the air contained about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide. That has risen to 385 ppm today, and politicians and scientists have debated at what level it could be stabilized.LiNeBrEaKSolomon's paper concludes that if CO2 is allowed to peak at 450-600 parts per million, the results would include persistent decreases in dry-season rainfall that are comparable to the 1930s North American Dust Bowl in zones including southern Europe, northern Africa, southwestern North America, southern Africa and western Australia. The research was supported by the Office of Science at the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKlong-term outlookLiNeBrEaKA new study concludes that some climate damage created by carbon emissions would remain for 1,000 years even if humans stopped the activity immediately.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	obama: u.s. will become energy independent  	BEN FELLER  	FRONT; Pg. A5  	239 words  	By Ben FellerLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama is all about change, but on Monday, he went where lots of presidents have gone before: promising that the United States will become energy independent. LiNeBrEaK"It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil," he said at the White House. This time, the effort is for real, Obama said. "For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change."LiNeBrEaKAnd so Obama opened an ambitious assault on global warming and U.S. energy woes, moving quickly toward rules requiring cleaner-running cars that guzzle less gas.LiNeBrEaKThe auto industry responded warily. Reducing planet-warming emissions is a great idea, carmakers and dealers said, but they expressed deep concern about costly regulations and conflicting state and federal rules at a time when people already are not buying cars. U.S. auto sales plunged 18 percent in 2008.LiNeBrEaKIndustry analysts said the changes could cost consumers thousands of dollars - for smaller, "greener" cars.LiNeBrEaKObama directed the Environmental Protection Agency to review whether California and more than a dozen states should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards on carmakers to fight greenhouse gas emissions. Virginia is not among the states.LiNeBrEaKThe new president also said his administration would issue new fuel-efficiency requirements to cover 2011 model year vehicles.

The Washington Times 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Obama tackles Mideast, climate policies;  Fuel rules present affront to Bush 	By Stephen Dinan, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PAGE ONE; A01  	926 words  	Making his first forays on his pledge to boost U.S. leadership in the world, President Obama on Monday deployed a special envoy to the Middle East to work on the peace process and sought to claim to leadership on global warming by erasing Bush-era rules and pushing auto manufacturers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama announced the fuel-efficiency standards in a ceremony at the White House, signing a directive to his transportation secretary to require an average of 35 miles per gallon for cars for the 2011 model year and another directive telling the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a Bush administration decision that banned California from pursuing its own tough fuel standards. LiNeBrEaK"We will make it clear to the world that America is ready to lead," the president said, calling for a "truly global coalition" to address climate change. "I've made it clear that we will act, but so too must the world."LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama's administration also named Todd Stern, a fellow at the Center for American Progress, to lead international climate negotiations for the Obama administration, reprising the role he held in the Clinton White House.LiNeBrEaK"With the appointment today of a special envoy, we are sending an unequivocal message that the United States will be energetic, focused, strategic and serious about addressing global climate change and the corollary issue of clean energy," said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.LiNeBrEaKWhile casting his eye to global leadership, though, Mr. Obama also will have to worry about the effects at home of his fuel-efficiency moves, which will put more stress on the auto industry even as two of the Big Three auto manufacturers are seeking government loans.LiNeBrEaK"I am fearful that today's action will begin the process of setting the American auto industry back even further," said Sen. George V. Voinovich, Ohio Republican. "The federal government should not be piling on an industry already hurting in a time like this."LiNeBrEaKThough he didn't mention his predecessor by name, Mr. Obama was brutal in his assessment of the Bush administration, which many critics said ignored science in favor of ideology, particularly on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts. We will be guided by them," Mr. Obama said.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama is also deploying former Sen. George J. Mitchell, Maine Democrat, on a seven-city tour in the Middle East and Europe to work on reviving the Middle East peace process.LiNeBrEaK"When I say progress, not just photo-ops, but progress that is concretely felt by people on the ground, so that people feel more secure in their lives, so that they feel that the hopes and dreams and aspirations of their children can be met," Mr. Obama said in a send-off meeting with Mr. Mitchell, attended by Mrs. Clinton, in the White House Cabinet Room.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview with the Al Arabiya satellite-television network Monday, Mr. Obama told the Muslim world that "Americans are not your enemy" and renewed his pledge to travel to make an address in the capital of a major Muslim nation. He said his travels through Muslim nations had convinced him that regardless of faith, people had certain common hopes and dreams, Agence France-Presse reported.LiNeBrEaK"My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect," Mr. Obama said. "But if you look at the track record ... America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 orLiNeBrEaK30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that"LiNeBrEaKAlso on Monday, Mr. Obama asked his administration to write rules that would require auto manufacturers' fleets to meet stricter standards by 2011 and put cars on track to meet a 2007 law that sets a target of 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020 - about 10 miles per gallon higher than the current standard.LiNeBrEaKThe president said he does not want to sink the auto industry, but that he wanted to push it to adapt to a greener economy and build cars consumers want.LiNeBrEaK"Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry. It is to help America's automakers prepare for the future," he said.LiNeBrEaKBy backing California's rules, Mr. Obama also has put pressure on Congress to act on a national standard or face the prospect of a patchwork across jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, that have followed California's lead.LiNeBrEaKMichigan lawmakers on Monday pleaded for a national standard.LiNeBrEaK"As the administration begins its work to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, I urge the president and his Environmental Protection Agency to develop a strong, national standard for vehicle emissions, rather than a patchwork of state standards," said Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat.LiNeBrEaKThe Natural Resources Defense Council said documents that Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. submitted to Congress last year show they can meet the fuel-efficiency standards.LiNeBrEaK"Detroit consistently underestimates their capacities," said David Doniger, policy director of NRDC's climate center. "They consistently demonstrate they can do more than they previously said."LiNeBrEaKMr. Doniger said Mr. Obama is creating good competition by asking states to lead, but also by pushing his own administration to impose strict standards.LiNeBrEaK"This is a great start in making real the president's campaign vision of really changing America's energy and global-warming policies," he said.LiNeBrEaK* Christina Bellantoni and Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.

The Washington Times 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 		By Tom LoBianco, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PLUGGED IN - POLITICS; ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT; B02  	635 words  	Senate calls for more GoreLiNeBrEaKFormer Vice President Al Gore returns to Capitol Hill Wednesday to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.LiNeBrEaKSen. John Kerry, who chairs the committee, had kind words for his fellow former Democratic presidential nominee: "Al Gore has been sounding the alarm on climate change for over three decades, and he understands the urgent need for American engagement and leadership on this issue."LiNeBrEaKMr. Gore, who has opted to stay in private life rather than return with the Democratic administration, still has easy access with President Obama's team. LiNeBrEaKShortly before taking office, Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. held a closed-door meeting with Mr. Gore to discuss climate change and national energy priorities.LiNeBrEaKAmong the books not likely to be discussed at the hearing: "Climate of Extremes: Global Warming Science They Don't Want You to Know," written by the recently ousted Virginia state climatologist and longtime global-warming skeptic Patrick J. Michaels and published by the Libertarian think tank the Cato InstituteLiNeBrEaKNo congressman left behindLiNeBrEaKArizona Republican Rep. John Shadegg, long an informal educator on the benefits - and physics - of hydroelectric power, said Thursday he often has resorted to third-grade textbooks to enlighten his colleagues.LiNeBrEaKRep. Lee Terry questioned whether Mr. Shadegg was setting the bar too high.LiNeBrEaK"Next time, don't use such advanced texts," the Nebraska Republican advised.LiNeBrEaKThe quip sparked a roomful of laughter from members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and provided a brief respite from the committee's grueling markup session on the energy and health care provisions in the stimulus bill.LiNeBrEaKThe gas is always greenerLiNeBrEaKWho was that among the many enviros and alternate-fuel types supporting Mr. Gore's Green Inaugural Ball? The American Gas Association?LiNeBrEaKThough natural gas is a cleaner-burning fuel, environmentalists like to point out that pockets of natural gas are often found with reservoirs of oil, which they say profit-hungry prospectors are unlikely to leave in the ground.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, oil-turned-wind magnate T. Boone Pickens has said domestic supplies of natural gas are a good transition fuel for a nation looking to wean itself from foreign oil and transition to renewable fuel sources. Ball organizers repeated that tack:LiNeBrEaK"As we rapidly reduce the carbon dioxide emitted by our economies, because natural gas is a transition fuel, is a cleaner and more efficient burning fuel than coal, and along with renewable energy sources is already available to us for both electricity in our homes and fuel in our cars, we welcomed the sponsorship of the American Gas Association," said Aimee Christensen, a member of the organizing committee for the Green Ball.LiNeBrEaKMaybe their ball was greener, after all.LiNeBrEaKJust across town, organizers of the International Conservation Caucus Ball, which featured organic beer selections and music from the Boys Choir of Kenya, was sponsored by oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron. To be fair, oil and natural gas companies have fronted up to 65 percent of money spent on developing alternative and renewable fuels, according to industry lobbyists.LiNeBrEaKIns and outsLiNeBrEaKCarl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said last week he will move to chairman of the environmental group once a successor is found to fill the job he has held for 16 years.LiNeBrEaKMr. Pope's pending move continues shakeups in the environmental community following Mr. Obama's election. John Passacantando ended his eight-year run as executive director of Greenpeace USA last month.LiNeBrEaKExpect more movement as team Obama starts filling out some of its second-tier appointments at Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency, D.C. observers say.

The Washington Post 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Suburban Edition	Obama Issues Orders Toward More Fuel-Efficient Cars  	Steven Mufson and Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writers  	A-SECTION; Pg. A04  	732 words  	President Obama issued two orders yesterday that could ultimately toughen fuel efficiency requirements for new cars and light trucks in what could prove stiff medicine for a U.S. auto industry already hobbled by financial troubles.LiNeBrEaKWith General Motors and Chrysler leaning heavily on billions of dollars of federal loans, Obama is in a strong position to remake the industry with an eye toward cutting U.S. petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry," Obama said, but to help American automakers "prepare for the future" and "thrive by building the cars of tomorrow." LiNeBrEaKThe president raised hopes on all sides for a resolution of years of divisive debate over fuel efficiency requirements. Environmentalists and many state officials said they hope that Obama would endorse tough tailpipe emissions standards proposed by California. Automakers, meanwhile, want the administration to establish uniform nationwide mileage standards while moving to ease the cost by providing assistance and incentives for car buyers.LiNeBrEaK"If you're a stakeholder, you hope the stake goes in ground and not in your back or chest," said David McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, who watched Obama sign the orders yesterday at the White House.LiNeBrEaKFlanked by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa P. Jackson, Obama directed the EPA to reconsider granting California and other states waivers to set their own strict regulations over tailpipe emissions. California would require a 30 percent cut in those emissions, a mandate more stringent than the federal mileage standards. The new review process could take several months.LiNeBrEaKObama also instructed the Transportation Department to draw up new interim targets for mileage standards starting in 2012 that ensure new vehicles reach the 35 mile-a-gallon level set by Congress for 2020. He left intact Bush administration guidelines for 2011 models already being designed.LiNeBrEaK"The days of Washington dragging its heels are over," Obama said. Saying the nation has arrived at a crossroads, he said:  "It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs."LiNeBrEaKSeparately, the State Department   named Todd Stern  the new U.S. envoy on climate change. Stern, a partner in the Washington law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress think tank, served as the top White House negotiator on the Kyoto talks on global warming from 1999 to 2001.LiNeBrEaKObama's announcement on fuel efficiency standards encouraged  state officials who want to institute their own greenhouse gas curbs but  faced opposition from the Bush administration. Ian Bowles, Massachusetts secretary of energy and environmental affairs, said his state had encountered "a strong headwind from the federal government" over the past two years. But  "to my mind, today's announcement represents a shift in direction that will lead to a significant federal tailwind."LiNeBrEaKMaryland Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) also applauded Obama's announcement. In 2007, the Maryland General Assembly passed a so-called clean cars law that would set stricter emissions standards for vehicle models hitting the road in 2010. The law would eventually raise average fuel efficiency of cars told in Maryland to 43 miles  per  gallon.LiNeBrEaK"In the long run, it's best for American automakers as well," O'Malley said.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers in the past have not seen it that way and have filed at least three lawsuits in different jurisdictions to stop states from setting their own emission standards. "The suits are still there," said Gloria Bergquist, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. But, she added, "We're the first to say we would like to find a better way forward."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups argue that controlling tailpipe emissions from vehicles will do much to address climate change. According to the advocacy group Environment America, applying the California standards to the 14 states that have already adopted them will reduce global warming pollution by more than 450 million metric tons by 2020, an amount equal to eliminating all of the pollution from 84. 7 million of today's cars for a year.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Lisa Rein contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Met 2 Edition	U.N. Envoy Vows More Collaboration;  Rice Meets With Ban, Reporters 	Colum Lynch; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	490 words  	Susan E. Rice, the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and top U.N. ambassadors Monday that she had not come with orders and that the Obama administration would collaborate more intensively with its international partners. LiNeBrEaKThe tone of Rice's comments on her first day on the job signaled a tenure that will be markedly different from some of her recent predecessors, notably Bush administration appointee John R. Bolton, who derided U.N. headquarters as a bubble and quipped before he was ambassador that "it wouldn't make a bit of difference" if the United Nations lost the top 10 floors of its 39-story building.LiNeBrEaK"I will listen. I will engage. And I will work to advance the United States interest, recognizing that in many, many instances, our national interests are best advanced when we are working hand in hand with that of others," Rice told reporters after her 45-minute meeting with Ban.LiNeBrEaKRice said the United States would engage in "direct diplomacy" with Iran, work to contain global warming and step up U.S. efforts to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.LiNeBrEaKShe said the United States would continue to work with the five other major powers -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- that have coordinated international efforts to restrain Tehran's nuclear ambitions using a combination of U.N. sanctions and promises of economic and political incentives.LiNeBrEaK"We look forward to engaging in vigorous diplomacy, that includes direct diplomacy with Iran as well as continued collaboration and partnership with the P-5 plus one," she said, as the six-nation group is called. "And we will look at what is necessary and appropriate with respect to maintaining pressure towards that goal of ending Iran's nuclear program."LiNeBrEaKWhite House press secretary Robert Gibbs downplayed the significance of Rice's remarks, saying that "there are no specific initiatives" at the moment to talk to Iran.LiNeBrEaK"What Ambassador Rice outlined today was simply to restate the position that I think many of you heard the president outline throughout the campaign for the past two years: that this administration is going to use all elements of our national power to address the concerns that we have with Iran," Gibbs said.LiNeBrEaKSome European diplomats have expressed concerns that the Obama administration might abandon that diplomatic effort in favor of direct negotiations with the Iranian leadership. One European official said that Rice's commitment to working with the international group had reassured them.LiNeBrEaKRegarding the "ongoing genocide" in Darfur, Sudan, Rice said the U.S. priority for the moment is reinforcing a U.N.-backed peacekeeping mission to protect civilians. She expressed concern that Sudan's government may retaliate against international peacekeepers and aid workers if the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant on genocide charges for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.

The Washington Post 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday   Suburban Edition	Long Droughts, Rising Seas Predicted Despite Future CO2 Curbs  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A04  	906 words  	Greenhouse gas levels currently expected by mid-century will produce devastating long-term droughts and a sea-level rise that will persist for 1,000 years regardless of how well the world curbs future emissions of carbon dioxide, an international team of scientists reported yesterday.LiNeBrEaKTop climate researchers from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Switzerland and France said their analysis shows that carbon dioxide will remain near peak levels in the atmosphere far longer than other greenhouse gases, which dissipate relatively quickly. LiNeBrEaK"I think you have to think about this stuff as more like nuclear waste than acid rain: The more we add, the worse off we'll be," NOAA senior scientist Susan Solomon told reporters in a conference call. "The more time that we take to make decisions about carbon dioxide, the more irreversible climate change we'll be locked into."LiNeBrEaKAt the moment, carbon concentrations in the atmosphere stand at 385 parts per million. Many climate scientists and the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have set a goal of stabilizing atmospheric carbon at 450 ppm, but current projections put the world on track to hit 550 ppm by 2035, rising after that point by 4. 5 percent a year.LiNeBrEaKThe new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, projects that if carbon dioxide concentrations peak at 600 ppm, several regions of the world -- including southwestern North America, the Mediterranean and southern Africa -- will face major droughts as bad or worse than the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Global sea levels will rise by about three feet by the year 3000, a projection that does not factor in melting glaciers and polar ice sheets that would probably result in significant additional sea level rises.LiNeBrEaKEven if the world managed to halt the carbon dioxide buildup at 450 ppm, the researchers concluded, the subtropics would experience a 10 percent decrease in precipitation, compared with the 15 percent decrease they would see at 600 ppm. That level is still akin to mega-droughts such as the Dust Bowl. The already parched U.S. Southwest would probably see a 5 percent drop in precipitation during its dry season.LiNeBrEaKMary-Elena Carr, associate director of the Columbia Climate Center, called the new projections "very sobering." She noted that while societies can try to adapt to reduced precipitation with better farming techniques and other measures, there is a limit to the ability to cope with severe drought.LiNeBrEaK"When it's drought, that is hard, because we have a finite amount of water and a growing population we need to feed," Carr said, adding that the severe storm surges associated with higher sea levels also pose a dangerous challenge to large populations.LiNeBrEaKThe rising sea levels anticipated under a conservative projection, the authors wrote, would cause "irreversible commitments to future changes in the geography of the Earth, since many coastal and island features would ultimately become submerged."LiNeBrEaKThe scientists noted that the world's oceans are already absorbing an enormous amount of carbon, but over time this will reach a limit and they will no longer absorb as much. As this happens, the atmospheric temperature will remain nearly constant.LiNeBrEaKMost previous scientific analyses, including the U.N. panel's summary report for policymakers, have assessed climate change impacts on a 100-year time scale. A few researchers, such as Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology, have argued that it makes more sense to look at a time scale of at least 500 years.LiNeBrEaKIn an e-mail yesterday, Caldeira wrote that he had debated this point with other contributors to the U.N. reports in 2001, adding, "If you took our long term climate commitment seriously, you would not use 100-year [global warming projections] to compare effects of different gases."LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide emissions account only for about half of human-induced global warming, but the several other gases that play a role, including methane, dissipate more quickly. Solomon said policymakers could take this into account when deciding how best to reduce greenhouse gases overall.LiNeBrEaK"We ought to be extra careful about how much carbon dioxide we put out in the future," she said, adding that politicians often focus on the less certain but potentially disastrous impacts of climate change but would do well to focus on the more predictable consequences. "The parts that we don't know, that are possible but very uncertain, shouldn't get in the way of what we do know."LiNeBrEaKA separate study in the same journal yesterday suggests that the iconic emperor penguins of the Antarctic could be headed to extinction by 2100 if the sea ice shrinks by the predicted amounts. That paper -- written by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, National Center for Atmospheric Research, the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., and France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique -- projects that the number of breeding pairs in a colony in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, will decline from about 6,000 to 400 by the end of the century because the animals depend on sea ice for breeding, foraging and molting habitat.LiNeBrEaKEmperor penguins would have to migrate or change the timing of their growth stages to avoid extinction, the authors write, but "evolution or migration seem unlikely for such long-lived species at the remote southern end of the Earth."

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	Environmentalists upbeat on assembly session  	Pamela Wood, The Capital, Annapolis, Md.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	608 words  	Jan. 27--Despite all the doom and gloom with the state budget, many environmentalists are convinced they can pull off some big victories in the General Assembly session.LiNeBrEaKSeveral hundred activists from around the state gathered in Annapolis last night for a round of cheerleading and prepping on key issues facing state lawmakers.LiNeBrEaKThe occasion was the 15th annual installment of the Maryland Environmental Legislative Summit, put on by a coalition of nonprofit groups that are organized as the Citizens' Campaign for the Environment. LiNeBrEaKAt the top of the environmental agenda this year is a bill that will require the state to cut back its greenhouse-gas emissions such as carbon dioxide. With the governor's full-fledged support and some business-friendly language in the bill, activists said they think they've got a shot at winning passage of the measure after two straight years of defeat.LiNeBrEaK"We can do it this session with your help," Brad Heavner, director of the advocacy group Environment Maryland, told the standing-room-only crowd.LiNeBrEaKThe bill, called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, will require the state to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020, using 2006 as a baseline. The Maryland Department of the Environment will have to draw up a plan on how to achieve those reductions, likely using strategies such as energy efficiency, increasing clean energy like solar power, reducing vehicle miles driven, increasing use of mass transit and planting trees.LiNeBrEaKThe plan won't look first to manufacturers, which generate about 8 percent of the state's greenhouse gases and worry about losing jobs. In fact, one measure of the bill requires the reduction plan not lead to any job losses.LiNeBrEaKMr. Heavner said studies show reducing greenhouse gases, which cause global warming, will actually lead to a financial boost as people save money by using less energy.LiNeBrEaK"Not only does it not break the bank, this gives a boost to the economy," he said.LiNeBrEaKHouse Speaker Michael E. Busch, D-Annapolis, praised the crowd for persistence on the global-warming issue.LiNeBrEaK"The global warming bill has risen to the top," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe environmentalists also are prepared to wage battles on the financial front. Another top priority is to make sure environmental programs aren't raided to help balance the state's budget, which is facing a $2 billion deficit.LiNeBrEaKKim Coble of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation said that in budget debates, environmentalists may have an advantage.LiNeBrEaK"You have a right and a need to clean air, clean water and open space -- every one of us, regardless," she said. "I don't know if anyone else has that going for them."LiNeBrEaKOther top issues for the environmentalists include stopping the Inter-County Connector, improving the government plans that guide growth and development and making sure citizens have the right to challenge zoning and environmental decisions in court.LiNeBrEaKAt the end of two hours of briefings, environmentalists ventured out into the cold to greet lawmakers on their way into their Monday-night sessions in the State House.LiNeBrEaKIn the past, the Environmental Legislative Summit also featured scores of meetings with lawmakers in their offices. This year, the meetings with lawmakers will be spread out over the next several weeks.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 		January 27, 2009 Tuesday 	OPINION: The cars they want us to want  	Tracy Warner, The Wenatchee World, Wash.  	COMMENTARY  	711 words  	Jan. 27--Here's the strategy: We will reduce our impact on the environment, import less energy and cleanse our collective conscience by ordering the bankrupt, partially nationalized car companies to sell only expensive cars that nobody wants, and forbid them to offer the vehicles that are popular and profitable.LiNeBrEaKWhat a plan. If only it would work, and human nature could be molded to match the current political and environmental consensus. We would think the way we are supposed to think and want what they want us to want, and everyone would thrive. That's what they say. LiNeBrEaKThe process was kicked off Monday when President Obama signed the expected order, telling the Environmental Protection Agency to consider California's request that it be allowed to set its own standards for automobile emissions, in particular for carbon dioxide. The EPA is expected to grant California that power quickly, which would open the way for several other states to do the same, Washington included.LiNeBrEaKThey talk about "cleaner air" but it's not about old-fashioned soot and smog. It's about reducing the automotive carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. California will mandate that automakers reduce their vehicles' greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2016.LiNeBrEaKThe trick of this is that carbon dioxide is a natural and unavoidable byproduct of combustion, which makes cars go. The only way to make less of it is to burn less fuel per mile. The rules are a backhanded way of demanding that all cars sold get better gas mileage -- way better. Estimates are that to meet California's standards cars sold will have to average 35 miles per gallon in six years, and 42 miles per gallon by 2020.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers of course know how to build cars that get that kind of mileage -- they must be small, or very small, and light, with small engines or gas-electric hybrids. In other words, almost none of the cars they now make will come close. Barring some breakthrough you will not be able to buy a pickup or an SUV or minivan, or even a midsize sedan with a conventional engine. You must want a subcompact or a hybrid, the very cars that don't sell particularly well now, and that carmakers often sell at a loss just to meet federal requirements. You will also pay more. The requirements could add perhaps $4,000 to the price of a vehicle, says the industry. The rules "would basically kill the industry," David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, told The New York Times. "It would have a devastating effect on everybody, and not just the domestics."LiNeBrEaKIf only this will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and our use of foreign oil, as President Obama says it will. Based on past history, that's unlikely. Since federal gas mileage standards were imposed in the 1970s our foreign oil consumption has zoomed, and our average miles driven per year have doubled and we spew more carbon than ever before. And carmakers went broke making money-losing unpopular cars that they had to sell at cut-rate prices just to meet the federal fleet mileage requirements. That didn't work, so we'll try again, even harder.LiNeBrEaKThe rules apply only to new cars. Expect the used car market to thrive. Expect overall greenhouse emissions to drop little. Expect a lot of people to shop for cars in Idaho or Nevada. Expect taxpayers to be asked to underwrite the program, more than they already are.LiNeBrEaKIt would be easier for government to manipulate our personal habits by providing some incentive. High-mileage cars like the Toyota Prius were popular when gasoline was $4 a gallon. Sales have plunged lately, while gas is cheap. If government wants us to want those cars it can raise the cost of gasoline. Tax it. That's the honest, effective way to get us to change, but honesty isn't so appealing in Washington, even now.LiNeBrEaKTracy Warner's column appears Tuesday through Friday.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Arctic 'Black Swans' Worry Scientists: Hard-to-predict catastrophes concern Sandia researchers  	John Fleck, Albuquerque Journal, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	739 words  	Jan. 26--Mark Ivey worries about "black swans" in the arctic. It is not birds that are on the Sandia National Laboratories researcher's mind.LiNeBrEaKIt is global warming, and the prospect of climate changes that are unlikely, but almost impossible to predict, and that would be catastrophic if they come to pass.LiNeBrEaKWhen all you've ever seen are white swans, the old saying goes, you have no way of knowing the odds of a black swan suddenly showing up. You know they are rare, but how rare? LiNeBrEaKSo it is with climate change, according to an analysis of Arctic climate by Ivey and a group of Sandia Labs colleagues.LiNeBrEaKThere are signs that black swans may already be showing up in the Arctic, where global warming is being felt much more quickly than climate scientists had expected. Arctic sea ice reached record low levels in 2007 and recovered only slightly in 2008, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. As sea ice retreats, scientists expect the Arctic to warm more rapidly, because open ocean absorbs more sunlight.LiNeBrEaKEven though it is the middle of winter, there is open water, uncovered by ice, off of Barrow, Alaska, where Ivey and his colleagues maintain a climate research station.LiNeBrEaK"That's just unheard of," Ivey said.LiNeBrEaKIvey's worst-case black swan?LiNeBrEaKWarming tundra releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, with the potential to create a "runaway greenhouse effect," according to Ivey and his colleagues. Changes in global weather patterns follow, which "might create deserts in agricultural regions ... and make entire countries incapable of supporting their present populations."LiNeBrEaK"You've got the possibility of a runaway change," Ivey said in an interview.LiNeBrEaKHow likely?LiNeBrEaKNot very, according to the Sandia researchers. But like a black swan, the scientists say, there is no way to say how unlikely it might be.LiNeBrEaKThe report grew out of a project by Ivey and his colleagues to study the national security implications of climate change. With headquarters at Kirtland Air Force Base south of Albuquerque, Sandia is one of the nation's three nuclear weapons laboratories. Beyond designing and maintaining nuclear weapons, Sandia studies a broad range of national issues, from energy security to the risks of global conflicts over water.LiNeBrEaKThe black swan metaphor has a long history, but it has risen to prominence in the past two years as a result of the collapse of the global finance system.LiNeBrEaKFinancier Nassim Nicholas Taleb made a name for himself with the 2007 book "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable." Taleb predicted the current economic problems and reportedly made a fortune by betting correctly on the resulting economic downturn.LiNeBrEaKTaleb's argument is that the most important long-term risks are not the things you can anticipate and predict, but the rare, catastrophic event.LiNeBrEaKSandia scientists have long specialized in the study of one such black swan -- the risk of a nuclear weapon going off accidentally. The chances are tiny and hard to quantify, but the consequences would be so disastrous that Sandia weapons designers have made a specialty of trying to imagine every conceivable way a nuclear accident might happen in order to prevent them. The Arctic work also draws on nearly two decades of research by a Sandia team that has been measuring climate change at Barrow, on Alaska's north slope.LiNeBrEaKIn national security terms, a warming Arctic will become a concern long before a runaway greenhouse effect could cause a global calamity, according to Bernie Zak, a member of the research team.LiNeBrEaKIce-free sea lanes, which have already shown up in recent years, will open the way for fossil fuel exploration in the Arctic, giving it strategic importance similar to the other oil and natural gas-rich regions of the world such as the Middle East, Zak noted.LiNeBrEaK"If the Arctic goes ice-free in the summer -- which it looks like a very real chance it'll happen, certainly in my lifetime, and maybe a lot sooner -- there's going to be crazy stuff going on up there that has a lot to do with our security," Ivey said.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Rethink how we Recycle: Mayor hopes to boost recycling in Albuquerque and reduce the waste entering city's landfills  	Dan McKay, Albuquerque Journal, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	801 words  	Jan. 26--Mayor Martin Chavez outlined an ambitious plan 18 months ago to boost recycling and stop adding to landfills by 2030.LiNeBrEaKBut the city has failed so far to meet its recycling goals.LiNeBrEaKAlbuquerque recycled about 3 percent of its trash in the most recent fiscal year -- the first since the mayor's announcement. The goal was to reach 8 percent, according to the mayor's original plan.LiNeBrEaKThe recycling rate was only 1. 5 percent when the city started the program, so there's been progress, just not enough to meet the goals. LiNeBrEaKIn an interview Thursday, Chavez said the administration is assembling a plan to get on track. It could involve changing the garbage-rate structure and either privatizing the city's recycling plant or increasing rates to pay for expanding it.LiNeBrEaK"That can happen this fiscal year," Chavez said. "We will take a very large step forward."LiNeBrEaKThe mayor launched the "zerowaste" initiative in June 2007 to help combat global warming. Landfills emit methane -- a greenhouse gas -- and recycling saves natural resources, cuts pollution and saves energy, proponents say.LiNeBrEaKOne barrier to meeting the initial goals was that the City Council didn't approve money to provide blue recycling bins citywide, the mayoral administration contends. Councilors said the plan wasn't well-thought-out, and they authorized a pilot program instead.LiNeBrEaKUnder the program, people put their recyclables in the bins and set them out on their trash day, just like their regular garbage. Providing bins has greatly increased participation in recycling, the administration contends. People must otherwise bundle their recyclables in bags and put them on the curb.LiNeBrEaKAt the beginning of the pilot program, the city was getting 7. 6 pounds of recyclables a household each week. A year later, in the pilot area, the city was receiving 12. 8 pounds a household weekly, according to the city Solid Waste Management Department. The number of households that participated also went up.LiNeBrEaK"We certainly can't go forward without expanding the pilot program citywide," Chavez said.LiNeBrEaKCity Council President Isaac Benton, meanwhile, broached the idea of altering the program before expanding it. The recycling bins are so large, he said, that he doubts people can fill them with recyclables. It might be cheaper to move forward with smaller recycling bins, Benton said.LiNeBrEaKIn the next few months, Chavez intends to propose overhauling the city's garbage rates and bin system.LiNeBrEaKResidents, for example, might get a smaller trash bin but also a recycling bin. Or people could opt to stick with the larger trash bin plus a recycling bin. Their rates would vary depending on what bins they choose to use.LiNeBrEaKOfficials call it a "pay-asyou-throw" system because residents with larger trash bins would have to pay more.LiNeBrEaKThe city also needs to improve the recycling plant to handle more material.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Rethink how we Recycle  	Dan McKay Journal Staff Writer  	FRONT PAGE; Pg. A1  	730 words  	Mayor Martin Ch&aacute;vez outlined an ambitious plan 18 months ago to boost recycling and stop adding to landfills by 2030.LiNeBrEaKBut the city has failed so far to meet its recycling goals.LiNeBrEaKAlbuquerque recycled about 3 percent of its trash in the most recent fiscal year - the first since the mayor's announcement. The goal was to reach 8 percent, according to the mayor's original plan.LiNeBrEaKThe recycling rate was only 1. 5 percent when the city started the program, so there's been progress, just not enough to meet the goals. LiNeBrEaKIn an interview Thursday, Ch&aacute;vez said the administration is assembling a plan to get on track. It could involve changing the garbage-rate structure and either privatizing the city's recycling plant or increasing rates to pay for expanding it.LiNeBrEaK"That can happen this fiscal year," Ch&aacute;vez said. "We will take a very large step forward."LiNeBrEaKThe mayor launched the "zerowaste" initiative in June 2007 to help combat global warming. Landfills emit methane - a greenhouse gas - and recycling saves natural resources, cuts pollution and saves energy, proponents say.LiNeBrEaKOne barrier to meeting the initial goals was that the City Council didn't approve money to provide blue recycling bins citywide, the mayoral administration contends. Councilors said the plan wasn't well-thought-out, and they authorized a pilot program instead.LiNeBrEaKUnder the program, people put their recyclables in the bins and set them out on their trash day, just like their regular garbage. Providing bins has greatly increased participation in recycling, the administration contends. People must otherwise bundle their recyclables in bags and put them on the curb.LiNeBrEaKAt the beginning of the pilot program, the city was getting 7. 6 pounds of recyclables a household each week. A year later, in the pilot area, the city was receiving 12. 8 pounds a household weekly, according to the city Solid Waste Management Department. The number of households that participated also went up.LiNeBrEaK"We certainly can't go forward without expanding the pilot program citywide," Ch&aacute;vez said.LiNeBrEaKCity Council President Isaac Benton, meanwhile, broached the idea of altering the program before expanding it. The recycling bins are so large, he said, that he doubts people can fill them with recyclables. It might be cheaper to move forward with smaller recycling bins, Benton said.LiNeBrEaKIn the next few months, Ch&aacute;vez intends to propose overhauling the city's garbage rates and bin system.LiNeBrEaKResidents, for example, might get a smaller trash bin but also a recycling bin. Or people could opt to stick with the larger trash bin plus a recycling bin. Their rates would vary depending on what bins they choose to use.LiNeBrEaKOfficials call it a "pay-asyou-throw" system because residents with larger trash bins would have to pay more.LiNeBrEaKThe city also needs to improve the recycling plant to handle more material. A private company could build one essentially for free and make money finding markets for the recyclable materials, Ch&aacute;vez said.LiNeBrEaKThe city could also build one itself.LiNeBrEaK"The council will make that decision - whether they want it for free or a rate increase to pay for it," Ch&aacute;vez said. The 14 or 15 employees who work at the plant now would be transferred to other solid-waste jobs if it's privatized, the mayor said. He vowed that no one wouldLiNeBrEaKbe laid off in that scenario.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Arctic 'Black Swans' Worry Scientists;  Hard-to-predict catastrophes concern Sandia researchers 	Copyright &copy; 2009 Albuquerque Journal By John Fleck Journal Staff Writer  	FRONT PAGE; Pg. A1  	668 words  	Mark Ivey worries about "black swans" in the arctic. It is not birds that are on the Sandia National Laboratories researcher's mind.LiNeBrEaKIt is global warming, and the prospect of climate changes that are unlikely, but almost impossible to predict, and that would be catastrophic if they come to pass. When all you've ever seen are white swans, the old saying goes, you have no way of knowing the odds of a black swan suddenly showing up. You know they are rare, butLiNeBrEaKhow rare? LiNeBrEaKSo it is with climate change, according to an analysis of Arctic climate by Ivey and a group of Sandia Labs colleagues.LiNeBrEaKThere are signs that black swans may already be showing up in the Arctic, where global warming is being felt much more quickly than climate scientists had expected. Arctic sea ice reached record low levels in 2007 and recovered only slightly in 2008, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. As sea ice retreats, scientists expect the Arctic to warm more rapidly, because open ocean absorbs more sunlight.LiNeBrEaKEven though it is the middle of winter, there is open water, uncovered by ice, off of Barrow, Alaska, where Ivey and his colleagues maintain a climate research station.LiNeBrEaK"That's just unheard of," Ivey said.LiNeBrEaKIvey's worst-case black swan?LiNeBrEaKWarming tundra releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, with the potential to create a "runaway greenhouse effect," according to Ivey and his colleagues. Changes in global weather patterns follow, which "might create deserts in agricultural regions ... and make entire countries incapable of supporting their present populations." "You've got the possibility of a runaway change," Ivey said in an interview.LiNeBrEaKHow likely? Not very, according to the Sandia researchers. But like a black swan, the scientists say, there is no way to say how unlikely it might be.LiNeBrEaKThe report grew out of a project by Ivey and his colleagues to study the national security implications of climate change. With headquarters at Kirtland Air Force Base south of Albuquerque, Sandia is one of the nation's three nuclear weapons laboratories. Beyond designing and maintaining nuclear weapons, Sandia studies a broad range of national issues, from energy security to the risks of global conflicts over water. The black swan metaphor has a long history, but it has risen to prominence in the past two years as a result of the collapse of the global finance system. Financier Nassim Nicholas Taleb made a name for himself with the 2007 book "The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable." Taleb predicted the current economic problems and reportedly made a fortune by betting correctly on the resulting economic downturn.LiNeBrEaKTaleb's argument is that the most important long-term risks are not the things you can anticipate and predict, but the rare, catastrophic event. Sandia scientists have long specialized in the study of one such black swan - the risk of a nuclear weapon going off accidentally. The chances are tiny and hard to quantify, but the consequences would be so disastrous that Sandia weapons designers have made a specialty of trying to imagine every conceivable way a nuclear accident might happen in order to prevent them. The Arctic work also draws on nearly two decades of research by a Sandia team that has been measuring climate change at Barrow, on Alaska's north slope. In national security terms, a warming Arctic will become a concern long before a runaway greenhouse effect could cause a global calamity, according to Bernie Zak, a member of the research team. Ice-free sea lanes, which have already shown up in recent years, will open the way for fossil fuel exploration in the Arctic, giving it strategic importance similar to the other oil and natural gas-rich regions of the world such as the Middle East, Zak noted. "If the Arctic goes ice-free in the summer - which it looks like a very real chance it'll happen, certainly in my lifetime, and maybe a lot sooner - there's going to be crazy stuff going on up there that has a lot to do with our security," Ivey said.

Arab News (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	UK offers help to study methane emissions  	Arab News, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	368 words  	Jan. 26--RIYADH -- The King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and the British government yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding for joint research on the sources of methane emissions in the Kingdom and identifying the technology suitable for checking such emissions, according to a statement issued by KACST. KACST Vice President Prince Turki S. Al-Saud and British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia William Patey signed the agreement in the presence of several senior officials from both sides at the KACST headquarters in Riyadh. LiNeBrEaKMethane is one of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe joint research project primarily aims to study ways of reducing the level of environmental pollution resulting from methane emissions in addition to locating its major sources and geographical distribution. The project will also help find the technology most suitable for checking emissions in the Saudi environment.LiNeBrEaKThe agreement stipulates joint research to discover ways for the chemical's safe use in the manufacture of value-added products.LiNeBrEaKThe project is significant in the light of the fact that Saudi Arabia is a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKThe 24-month-long project would be implemented in collaboration with a specialized research center in Britain.LiNeBrEaKThe agreement comes under the framework of Saudi-British collaboration for research in environment matters and production of clean energy.LiNeBrEaKKACST had earlier signed agreements with Lotus Engineering UK for reducing effects of automobile industries on environment. It also signed agreements with some British universities for application of nanotechnology as well as membrane technology in water treatment and petrochemical industries.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 		January 26, 2009 Monday   Main Edition	Trying on carbon-neutral trend  	JIM AUCHMUTEY; Staff  	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	992 words  	Think of it as the intersection of good times and good intentions.LiNeBrEaKA new sign at Virginia and North Highland avenues proclaims the intown Atlanta shopping and dining district a "carbon-neutral zone." What it doesn't say is that Virginia-Highland also claims to be the nation's first such zone.LiNeBrEaKWhile this could be seen as the latest chapter in the annals of green marketing --- another emission in all the talk about global warming --- there's actually substance behind the boast. LiNeBrEaKThe carbon-free zone is the result of a pilot project engineered by a local environmental company --- an intricate transaction linking 18 merchants, a trading exchange in Chicago, a charitable foundation in Atlanta and thousands of acres of forest in rural Georgia.LiNeBrEaK"I'm sure most of us don't understand exactly how it works," says Andy Kurlansky of Everybody's Pizza, one of the Virginia-Highland businesses that paid to be part of the venture. "But I still thought it was worthwhile." LiNeBrEaKIt all started with a year-old Atlanta company called Verus Carbon Neutral Partnership. For a fee, it audits a business' carbon footprint: the net effect of its utility use, transportation and waste production on the environment. Verus then calculates an offset, a payment the business can make to compensate for its emissions, usually by funding alternative energy, sustainable forests or some other endeavor that reduces greenhouse gases by removing them from the atmosphere or not producing them in the first place.LiNeBrEaKVerus is the first to admit that it's all rather complicated.LiNeBrEaK"We spend 90 percent of our time explaining how it works," said company founder Eric Taub, a former hedge fund manager who got the germ of the idea from his father-in-law, Richard Sandor.LiNeBrEaKSandor started the Chicago Climate Exchange, a market where carbon credits and offsets are traded like pork belly futures in the interest of fighting climate change through capitalism. Time magazine called him "the father of carbon trading."LiNeBrEaKLast fall, Verus pitched its services to a sympathetic prospect, Antje Kingma, one of the owners of Eco-Bella, a Virginia-Highland shop that sells organic bedding, apparel and housewares.LiNeBrEaKKingma comes from Germany, the breeding ground of the Green Party, and readily agreed to have her business audited. She was shocked when Taub told her that Eco-Bella was responsible for 22 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.LiNeBrEaK"I felt dirty," she says, only half-joking. "I felt evil."LiNeBrEaKTwenty-two metric tons is far below the amount of CO? produced by the average three-bedroom household. But Kingma still wanted to pay environmental penance, so she gladly wrote a check of $87 for the first year's offset.LiNeBrEaKShe thought it would be nice if her neighbors did likewise, so she approached her landlord, Stuart Meddin, whose company owns the adjoining storefronts at the northwest corner of Virginia and North Highland. A veteran of green developments like Glenwood Park, he offered to underwrite the audits for all 18 businesses --- a cost of more than $7,000 --- if they paid for the offsets.LiNeBrEaKKingma presented the idea to the other tenants during their regular meeting last September. It was a terrible time to be floating the idea of another expense --- especially one that's not tax-deductible.LiNeBrEaK"The carbon thing wasn't the issue. People were more concerned about the cost," says Brian Jolly of Half-Moon Outfitters, a store on North Highland.LiNeBrEaKThe owner of DabberDoo, a gift boutique, was skeptical. Christie Harper, an SUV-driving mom from Cobb County, believes global warming is real but suspects it has been exaggerated. Her brother is even more doubtful. When she told him Virginia-Highland was considering going carbon-neutral, he scoffed: "You are freakin' kidding me."LiNeBrEaKIn the end, Harper decided to go along with her neighbors. "I figured it couldn't hurt," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe price of the offsets ranged from $10 a year for Lulu Blue, a petite sweet shop, to $600 for Highland Tap, a steakhouse. Restaurants inevitably leave a larger carbon footprint with their sizable staffs and higher utility use.LiNeBrEaK"I'm the biggest polluter over here," says the Tap's general manager, Ron Haynes, who commutes 30 miles from Peachtree City and employs 35 people.LiNeBrEaKHe's still unsure whether his check bought anything more than a fuzzy feeling of virtue.LiNeBrEaK"It sort of made sense to me when they explained it," he says. "But I do wonder what I'm doing to curb global warming. It feels like I'm just spending money to make up for the damage I'm doing to the environment."LiNeBrEaKWhat did the merchants' money buy?LiNeBrEaKVerus traded it on the Chicago Climate Exchange for offsets that support a "carbon sequestration" project in Georgia. Translation: sustainable forest land managed in a way that maximizes and measures removal of carbon from the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKValley Wood, a Columbus timber company, manages the project for the Holland M. Ware Charitable Foundation of Atlanta, which owns 64,000 acres in Middle and South Georgia.LiNeBrEaKThe foundation, in turn, supports animal welfare causes.LiNeBrEaKTrees and puppies --- no wonder Virginia-Highland feels good about itself.LiNeBrEaKCritics of carbon offsets regard them as something akin to papal indulgences, a modern version of buying absolution. Whatever one thinks of them, they represent cutting-edge environmental thinking of a sort not usually associated with the Deep South.LiNeBrEaK"When we call businesses in California, some of them snub us," said Verus partner Andrew Keenan. "They figure people in a red state like Georgia couldn't know much about the environment. We want to show them that we're not a bunch of hicks."LiNeBrEaKThe carbon-neutral zone is already attracting attention close to home.LiNeBrEaKJust last week, Verus met with the Decatur Downtown Development Authority to discuss the possibilities for that enclave of alternative lifestyles and tree-hugging sensibilities.LiNeBrEaK"It sounds like something Decatur would get behind," said the authority's Linda Harris, who wonders how Virginia-Highland beat it to the punch.

Bennington Banner (Vermont)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Arlington senior wins journalism scholarship  	Keith Whitcomb Jr., Bennington Banner, Vt.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	738 words  	Jan. 26--ARLINGTON -- Not afraid to lead and to hold a different opinion, Samantha VanSchoick, a senior at Arlington Memorial High School, has received the Al Neuharth Free Spirit Scholarship.LiNeBrEaKOnly two people from each state are awarded the $1,000 scholarship named after the founder of USA Today.LiNeBrEaKTo earn the scholarship, VanSchoick, who edits the school's newspaper, The Eagle's Nest, had to write an essay on why she felt she was a free spirit and why she wanted to be a journalist. LiNeBrEaKShe also had to submit samples of her published material.LiNeBrEaKVanSchoick said she submitted samples that showed off a different area of her talents. She submitted a news piece on AMHS being recognized by U.S. News and World Report for being one of the best high schools in America. She also sent in an opinion piece published in The Eagle's Nest, titled "The Sky is ... Falling?"LiNeBrEaKIn the column, VanSchoick offered evidence against global warming, and said that just because something is widely believed, does not mean the evidence supports it.LiNeBrEaK"She has a broader sense than the rest of her classmates," said Gayna Cross, one of VanSchoick's English teachers.LiNeBrEaKCross, up until this year, had been the faculty adviser to The Eagle's Nest, and has been working with VanSchoick since her freshman year in other activities. VanSchoick has been contributing to The Eagle's Nest since her freshman year. At first she began with cartoons, butLiNeBrEaKbegan writing regularly as a junior. Cross said VanSchoick is also conscious of political issues, not just at the national level, but at the state level as well.LiNeBrEaKWhile the initial scholarship is for $1,000, VanSchoick has the opportunity to travel to Washington D.C. in March, all expenses paid, to attend the Neuharth Journalism Conference, which also recognizes working journalists.LiNeBrEaKIt is there that the recipients of the scholarship will receive their awards and have the chance to compete for an additional $50,000. VanSchoick said she hasn't been given many details yet, but she thinks the competition will require the Free Spirit Scholarship winners to report on the award ceremony for the working journalists.LiNeBrEaKWhile her experience has been with print journalism, VanSchoick said she wants to become a broadcast journalist.LiNeBrEaKShe has been accepted to the three colleges she has applied to, with St. John's University in New York City being her top choice, Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C. a close second, followed by Lyndon State College, in Lyndonvill. She said where she goes all depends on how much financial aid she is able to get.LiNeBrEaKVanSchoick said that even though St. John's doesn't have a broadcast program, she can still get a job as an anchor or correspondent with an English degree.LiNeBrEaKShe said she enjoys writing news, but also has a knack for the theater. Her experience on the stage, she said, can help with delivering the news in front of a camera.LiNeBrEaKShe said being the editor of the school's newspaper can be a challenge. "It's stressful right before a deadline, but I enjoy it," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe paper has three sections, she said, one for Fisher Elementary news, one for middle school news, and one for the high school.

The Boston Globe 		January 26, 2009 Monday   THIRD EDITION	Ship discharges threaten sea life  	Bina Venkataraman Globe Correspondent  	HEALTHSCIENCE; Pg. A9  	921 words  	Crisscrossing the seas on global trade routes, cargo ships suck up billions of tons of water to provide a steadying weight, and then dump that water back into the ocean when it's time to take on new cargo. Each year, ocean-faring vessels from overseas discharge enough of this ballast water in US waters to fill about 20,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.LiNeBrEaKWith the discharged ballast water come tiny hitchhikers from afar - invasive species of algae, invertebrates, and young crabs and fish picked up in distant harbors. LiNeBrEaKThese invaders - which threaten to crowd out the sea life native to our waters, and can even pose dangers to humans - are arriving in greater numbers, aided by the rise of global trade, and the advent of faster ships. At the same time, climate change is expected to allow some of these invasive species to thrive farther north than in the past.LiNeBrEaKAll this has sent engineers, scientists, and coastal resource managers scrambling to find ways to deal with these marine invaders before it's too late.LiNeBrEaK"The field is in its infancy," said Nick Welschmeyer, a professor at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and San Jose State University in California. "But there's a mad, grinding rush and competition to have ballast treatment technology work efficiently."LiNeBrEaKOn the Massachusetts coast, scientists already see reasons to step up research efforts. Dense, gooey mats of invertebrates known as sea squirts, probably transferred by ballast water or ships' hulls, have blanketed parts of Georges Bank, a rich fishing commercial fishing ground, over the past few years. Scientists worry they may hinder local fish reproduction and feeding habits. Recently, a red algae that spread rapidly in Narragansett Bay several years ago and competed with native algae species was spotted in Cape Cod Canal and Boston Harbor.LiNeBrEaK"We are very concerned about it, especially because it seems to be spreading," said Adrienne Pappal, coordinator of the aquatic species program at the state's Office of Coastal Zone Management, about the red algae. "It's supposed to be limited by cold water - but we're concerned that it could expand."LiNeBrEaKWith the spread of marine invasive species also comes an increased risk of pathogens that pose a threat to human health. For example, the Chinese mitten crab, which has spread in San Francisco Bay and Oregon and was spotted recently in Chesapeake Bay, plays host to a parasitic worm that has infected people in East Asia with a tuberculosis-like illness.LiNeBrEaKThe challenge is to figure out how to treat the vast volumes of ballast water at a low enough cost, and without harm to the ocean life in places where the treated water is dumped.LiNeBrEaKRules adopted by the United States in 2004 and a 2001 international treaty on ballast water, not yet ratified, have driven much of the research, Welschmeyer said, because the global shipping industry is looking for ways to comply with new and emerging regulations.LiNeBrEaKEfforts to sterilize ballast water using ultraviolet light, or treat it with chemicals toxic to marine life, have had limited success, said Welschmeyer. The flow of the water can be so fast, and the harbors it is drawn from so murky, that ultraviolet bulbs will not kill off all organisms. Another challenge is proving that a treatment works by testing it on all kinds of species. Many invasive hitchhikers are so tiny that scientists cannot tell if they are alive, even under a microscope.LiNeBrEaK"Now everybody is looking for the simple, pregnancy-style stick that will tell us the live/dead status of all the organisms in a tank of water," Welschmeyer said.LiNeBrEaKShips arriving at US ports have to exchange their ballast water for sea water at least 200 miles from shore in the open ocean, where organisms from estuaries abroad have a lower chance of surviving and reproducing. But the rules do not apply to boats that travel up and down the coastline. Even the ships that exchange their ballast water retain residue of tiny creatures in their tanks that continues to get transferred to harbors and estuaries, scientists who study the invasions say.LiNeBrEaKAbout 100,000 ships come to the United States from overseas each year, said Greg Ruiz, a marine ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. He says that rules for ballast water exchange have decreased the concentration of organisms in a given amount of water, even as the problem has been made worse by larger ships, which carry more ballast water, and faster crafts, which allow more organisms to survive a journey.LiNeBrEaKThe coastal management agency in Massachusetts trains a fleet of volunteers to spot invasive species, said Pappal. Last year, they identified eight.LiNeBrEaKSince 1998, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has spent millions of dollars on more than 30 research projects related to ballast water research. The United States has labs to test ballast water treatments in Key West, Florida, and in Wisconsin. Two more are under construction in Washington State and Maryland. Some scientists believe the race to treat ballast water is especially urgent because of warming.LiNeBrEaK"Because New England is warmer, species that have been coming in from ballast water from around the world that previously found New England too cold will now become established here," said James Carlton, a professor and marine ecologist at Williams College who expects to see more invasions here in the years to come.LiNeBrEaK"We try to keep our eyes on the coast," he said. "The world's plants and animals are knocking on our door."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Obama seems to be laying foundation for federal auto emissions standard  	By Jim Tankersley and Ken Bensinger, Chicago Tribune  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	585 words  	WASHINGTON _ By signaling Monday that he'll let California and other states regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, President Barack Obama appears to be laying the groundwork for a single federal carbon standard for vehicles. LiNeBrEaKSuch a standard is already in force in Europe and Japan. Crafting a national rule would please environmentalists, but surprisingly could also satisfy the automobile industry, which has argued that trying to comply with a California greenhouse-gas rule in addition to a federal mileage standard would be cumbersome and costly.LiNeBrEaKAllowing California and 13 other states to enforce the tailpipe rules could amount to a live test run for a federal greenhouse-gas regulation, which would likely be written by the Environmental Protection Agency under authority granted it by the Clean Air Act, observers say.LiNeBrEaK"Today I'm announcing the first steps on our journey toward energy independence, as we develop new energy, set new fuel-efficiency standards and address greenhouse gas emissions," said Obama, who signed an executive order asking the EPA to re-evaluate a proposal by California and 13 other states to enforce their own tailpipe emissions standards. "The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."LiNeBrEaKObama also instructed the Department of Transportation to implement new federal fuel economy standards and touted some $90 billion in clean-energy spending in the massive stimulus bill pending in Congress, including an apparent tenfold increase in federal assistance for the development of super-efficient automobiles.LiNeBrEaKIn order for California to legally regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it needs a waiver from the EPA. In December 2007, the Bush administration refused to grant it. The news that the Obama administration ordered the EPA to reconsider was warmly received in both Sacramento, Calif., and Washington.LiNeBrEaK"Allowing California and other states to aggressively reduce their own harmful vehicle tailpipe emissions would be a historic win for clean air and for millions of Americans who want more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly cars," said California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. "It would be great to actually do this nationwide so car that manufacturers don't just have two standards but that they only have one."LiNeBrEaKSome worry, however, that the high bar set by the California rules comes at an inopportune moment and could further damage the financially troubled U.S. auto industry, which has already thrown itself at the mercy of Washington.LiNeBrEaKThe California rule requires a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2016 from 2002 levels, and likely even further reductions after that. One study indicates that by 2020, carmakers would have to meet a 42. 5 mile per gallon average under the California emissions standard, compared to 35 mpg under federal mileage rules.LiNeBrEaKShortly after Obama announced the orders Monday, his secretary of state named the nation's first special envoy to negotiate global climate-change agreements.LiNeBrEaK(Staff writers Christi Parsons in Washington and Marc Lifsher in Sacramento, Calif., contributed to this report.)

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Obama pushes ahead with climate plan despite recessionary fears: Cap-and-trade could further slow sluggish economy, critics say  	Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	819 words  	Jan. 26--WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration plans to push ahead with efforts to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that it could further slow the recessionary economy.LiNeBrEaKInstead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's "clean energy economy," according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The step would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.LiNeBrEaKAt issue is the so-called cap-and-trade initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants and other installations but allow those that emit more to buy or trade permits with companies that emit less than the prescribed limit. LiNeBrEaKThe idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principle cause of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"If we don't put a price on carbon," said Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, "we'll never get these clean energy sources online."LiNeBrEaKBut cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.LiNeBrEaKPolls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue. By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.LiNeBrEaKDetails of his approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors cap-and-trade. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.LiNeBrEaKThe first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up fossil fuels' costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed Earth.LiNeBrEaKCritics, including many Republicans, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already-struggling families.LiNeBrEaK"I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change," said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, "and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.LiNeBrEaKEconomists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term. Peter Orszag, who heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but "also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods."LiNeBrEaKOrszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits, and if so, how it spends the proceeds.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative-energy research and technology.LiNeBrEaKThat would stimulate the economy and "allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment," said Andy Stevenson, a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.LiNeBrEaKOther experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and now chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, "would raise energy prices at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything [Obama] campaigned on.LiNeBrEaKShapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders -- including Shell oil and the Big Three automakers -- who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit plan earlier this month.LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.com	EMISSIONS (91%); RECESSION (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); POWER PLANTS (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (78%); BIOMASS (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%); LEGISLATORS (76%); WIND ENERGY (76%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (75%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); BIOFUELS (74%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (74%); PUBLIC FINANCE (73%); TAXES and TAXATION (72%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (71%); LEGISLATION (71%); VOTERS and VOTING (69%); POLLS and SURVEYS (67%); INFRASTRUCTURE (53%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (78%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  		Crime/law  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%) ILLINOIS, USA (90%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090126-TB-Obama-pushes-ahead-with-climate-plan-despite-recessionary-fears-0126  	Newspaper  	TB  	2009 Chicago Tribune   		BARACK OBAMA (95%); BARBARA BOXER (55%); PETER ORSZAG (50%)

LiNeBrEaKRoberts and Alito fell one vote short of gutting basic pollution laws.LiNeBrEaKThey voted in Rapanos to ignore the Clean Water Act's text and purpose and to expose countless streams and wetlands to unregulated destruction.LiNeBrEaKIn Massachusetts v. EPA, they tried to rewrite the Clean Air Act to exclude vehicle emissions that cause global warming. Alito also joined a Roberts' dissent that re-interpreted the Constitution to immunize EPA's refusal to enforce the Act's global warming provisions.LiNeBrEaKThey would have banned all such suits by states and citizens, while allowing challenges to any global warming rules that might cost polluters money.LiNeBrEaKAlito wasn't involved in the Exxon Valdez case. Roberts, however, provided the vote to invent a maximum one-to-one ratio of punitive to compensatory damages in order to overturn as excessive a jury verdict that was a tiny fraction of ExxonMobil's profits.LiNeBrEaKGlenn SugameliLiNeBrEaKSenior judicial counselLiNeBrEaKEarthjusticeLiNeBrEaKHamas rantLiNeBrEaKTHE HAMAS-like rant of the writer of the Jan. 20 letter, "Sick of it," portrays Palestinians as totally innocent victims.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the author identifies as Jewish, the redundant letter reveals dangerous ignorance.LiNeBrEaKThe writer calls Palestinians "cousins, sisters, and brothers," yet apparently doesn't know that these same 'relatives' have a goal: not only to kill fellow Jews but also to destroy the Jewish state.LiNeBrEaKA well-programmed propagandist, the writer hurls false accusations at Israel but presents no facts.LiNeBrEaKMiddle East maps are one "fact." They do not include Israel. Instead, they show Palestine replacing the entire Jewish state. Since one picture is worth a thousand words, such maps, widely distributed, make Palestinian intentions crystal clear.LiNeBrEaKAlso facts are statements by Hamas leaders, who caused hundreds of Palestinian deaths by deliberately placing weapons arsenals and rocket launchers amid densely populated areas.LiNeBrEaKWilling to endanger even more Palestinians by further attacking Israel, Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas' military wing, said in an article that ran Jan. 21, that Hamas was "firing more rockets ... developing the range ... the enemy will face more and our rockets will hit new targets, God willing."LiNeBrEaKMaybe the author should look for some less violent cousins.LiNeBrEaKJune BrottLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKDisappointedLiNeBrEaKI am very disappointed in St. Mary's decision to invite the notorious self-described "social activist" Bill Ayers to speak to the student body.LiNeBrEaKAyers represents the worst aspects of open dissent and social activism in a free society.LiNeBrEaKWhen confronted with conditions in our society which he and his cohorts deemed unacceptable they chose to create the Weather Underground, a violent, selfish domestic terrorist organization which committed many violent criminal acts such as bombing of the Pentagon and a New York City police station.LiNeBrEaKAyers was responsible for the death of many and by all rights should have spent his entire life in prison and would have but for a technicality which allowed him to go free. Ayers has gained a certain currency in the world of academia due to his association with President Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKThis is an unfortunate circumstance which gives Ayers credibility when he deserves none. He has never fully confessed to his criminal past and has made it well known that if he had his way more violent, destructive acts against innocent Americans would have been justified.LiNeBrEaKThe school is mistaken in its belief that this a form of free speech and academic freedom.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   Home Final Edition	Pollution-law plans hailed;  But Ohio environmental gains likely to be costly 	Spencer Hunt, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	NEWS; Pg. 01B  	703 words  	During his campaign, President Barack Obama promised sweeping environmental-policy changes.LiNeBrEaKNow that his administration is getting down to business, what can Ohio residents expect?LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental advocates say that we'll have cleaner air and water. Some businesses, however, say that we can expect higher energy bills, more expensive cars and a bigger government.LiNeBrEaKProposals include: LiNeBrEaK* New pollution limits for coal-fired power plants to curb global warming, smog and toxic effects of mercury.LiNeBrEaK* More fuel-efficient cars to cut emissions of gases tied to climate change.LiNeBrEaK* Spending plans to help restore the Great Lakes, build wind turbines and renovate antiquated sewer systems.LiNeBrEaK* Stricter oversight of dairy, pig and egg farms.LiNeBrEaK"Clean energy (will) not only protect our environment, but also rev our economic engine," said Amy Gomberg, program manager for Environment Ohio.LiNeBrEaK\ Coal and climateLiNeBrEaKObama's campaign promise to cut industrial carbon-dioxide emissions by 80 percent in the next 40 years would have a huge impact on power companies that burn coal.LiNeBrEaKIt also could affect customers, who likely would see their bills increase to help pay for new technology.LiNeBrEaKOne idea, underground carbon storage, will take 10 years to figure out, said Bruce Braine, vice president of policy analysis for American Electric Power.LiNeBrEaKThe process could increase the cost of electricity by as much as 35 percent.LiNeBrEaK"What's really at stake are very substantial rate increases," Braine said.LiNeBrEaK\ Clean carsLiNeBrEaKObama is expected to ask today that California and some other states be given permission to set their own standards for carbon-dioxide emissions and fuel efficiency -- standards that would be stricter than the federal government's. The Bush administration had rejected California's request in 2007.LiNeBrEaKCars and trucks make up about one-third of the nation's annual carbon-dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKWade Newton, spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the mandate would add an average of $3,000 to new-car prices.LiNeBrEaKHowever, "This is a necessary part of what our automotive industry has to do to be competitive and move forward," said Teresa McHugh, the Sierra Club's central region organizing manager.LiNeBrEaK\ Economic stimulusLiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups also have designs on an expected economic-stimulus bill that could top $1 trillion. LiNeBrEaKGomberg said Ohio businesses that build parts for wind turbines and solar panels could receive government grants to expand their operations and hire more workers.LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus plan could set aside as much as $8 billion for projects to upgrade aging water-treatment plants and sewer systems nationwide.LiNeBrEaKThat money would go quickly. Columbus expects to spend $2. 5 billion over 40 years to stop sewage overflows during heavy rains.LiNeBrEaKAnother proposal would create a $5 billion program to help restore the Great Lakes. Lake Erie's problems include sewage overflows, an oxygen-depleted dead zone, toxic algae blooms and invasive plants and fish.LiNeBrEaKJeff Skelding with the National Wildlife Federation said every dollar spent to clean the lake would help increase lakeside property values, increase tourism and fishing and reduce lost work hours caused by sewage-related illnesses.LiNeBrEaK"When you invest significant federal and state funding in cleaning up the Great Lakes, you are also investing in the economy of the region," he said.LiNeBrEaK\ Farming oversight LiNeBrEaKObama also promised to monitor and regulate pollution from large livestock farms. Ohio has more than 170 such farms, each of which houses thousands of dairy cows, chickens and pigs.LiNeBrEaKRegulations enacted by the Bush administration exempt farms from needing water-pollution permits if they file plans that say they won't pollute nearby streams.LiNeBrEaKAnother rule exempted most farms from reporting toxic air pollutants from stored animal manure and urine.LiNeBrEaKDave Warner, spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, said government oversight would increase food prices.LiNeBrEaK"It's another cost of doing business," he said.LiNeBrEaKTrent Dougherty of the Ohio Environmental Council said more government oversight would help curb manure spills and air pollution.LiNeBrEaK"We're moving toward what I would hope are some air-quality standards for these operations," Dougherty said. "Today, there are none."LiNeBrEaKshunt@dispatch.com	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); WATER POLLUTION (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); LAKES (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (89%); WIND ENERGY (89%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); SMOG (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (78%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (89%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (78%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); MOTOR VEHICLES (77%); POWER PLANTS (77%); SOLAR ENERGY (77%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (77%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (76%); WEATHER (76%); SEAWEED and ALGAE (76%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (72%)  	AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CO INC (90%)  	NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION (90%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (90%)  	COLUMBUS, OH, USA (92%) OHIO, USA (94%); GREAT LAKES (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); LAKE ERIE (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (94%)  						AEP (NYSE) (90%)  								
Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	States could set tougher limits for cars  	Todd Spangler, Detroit Free Press  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	793 words  	Jan. 26--WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is expected to revive today the bid by California and more than a dozen other states that want to require tougher fuel economy and emissions standards for automobiles by telling the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a Bush administration denial of the states' request.LiNeBrEaKFor years, Detroit and foreign automakers have fought a legal battle to block California and the others from being allowed to set state-by-state limits on vehicle emissions as a way to combat climate change. The automakers said the rule would cost them billions. LiNeBrEaKLast year, former President George W. Bush's administration rejected California's request for a waiver from the federal law -- a needed step if it is to enact its own emission rules.LiNeBrEaKA congressional source familiar with the issue confirmed to the Free Press on Sunday that Obama planned to ask EPA head Lisa Jackson to initiate a new review of the waiver, including a public comment period and study. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because the president had not yet made the announcement.LiNeBrEaKThe White House, without confirming the report, said Obama had scheduled remarks on "jobs, energy independence and climate change" at 10: 30 a.m. today.LiNeBrEaKIf the EPA in an Obama administration were to reverse the Bush administration's decision, it would come as no surprise. Jackson -- the former environmental protection commissioner in New Jersey and Gov. Jon Corzine's chief of staff -- told a Senate committee considering her nomination that she would "immediately revisit the waiver, looking at the science and the rule of law, and relying on the expert advice of EPA's employees in making a determination."LiNeBrEaKEPA employees had told current administrator Steve Johnson that federal law and climate science required him to approve California's request, but Johnson rejected it. Several states have sued over the rejection.LiNeBrEaKObama promised during the presidential campaign to overturn the decision.LiNeBrEaKOn Obama's first full day in office, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a letter asking him to reconsider the Bush refusal of the waiver.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers have waged a lengthy legal fight against California's rules, which set new limits on vehicle emissions to fight gases believed to cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's rules would boost fuel-economy standards on new vehicles to roughly 35 m.p.g. by 2016 and to more than 40 m.p.g. by 2020, depending on the mix of vehicles sold. All major U.S. automakers and the three largest Japanese car companies had sued to block the law, saying it would create a patchwork of state laws, drive up costs and limit sales.LiNeBrEaKNew federal rules would set a lower standard of 35 m.p.g. by 2020, with credits to ease the industry's burden. The Bush administration had estimated Detroit automakers would need to spend $30. 5 billion from 2011 to 2015 to meet interim targets -- though the Bush administration left it to Obama's EPA to work out the details of the new federal requirements. Reports said Obama would order the EPA today to move ahead on that front, as well.LiNeBrEaKDetroit auto companies and the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 11 U.S. and foreign automakers, could not be reached for comment Sunday evening.LiNeBrEaKThe order expected today from Obama is a sign of the tough regulatory environment automakers face under the new administration and the Democratic-led Congress. Obama and incoming Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner have pledged to force big changes in the industry. General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC are surviving on government loans as they try to weather the lowest sales in a generation, brought on by the nation's economic crisis and credit squeeze.LiNeBrEaKGeithner said in his confirmation hearing that aid to automakers should be "in support of a comprehensive restructuring that will leave the industry in a stronger financial position where they can be profitable and healthy without government support.LiNeBrEaK"That's going to require very, very substantial changes by all stakeholders," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn Congress, California now has three key members in positions to set the environmental agenda. Rep. Henry Waxman ousted John Dingell of Dearborn as chairman of the House Energy Committee, Nancy Pelosi is House speaker, and Sen. Barbara Boxer is chairwoman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   ALL S EDITION	Cable Guy keeps a full house hootin';  Nuanced, subtle, suave? Naw. Ain't none of that here 		YOUR LIFE; Pg. B1  	488 words  	Larry the Cable Guy takes a lot of flak for various material in his act that is insensitive.LiNeBrEaKAnd, sure, he tells some jokes that easily could be deemed offensive to this or that group. But as a card-carrying member of the pinko-commie media (he used a few other descriptive words for the news industry that I can't print), allow me to say the following: Who cares? It's just comedy, after all.LiNeBrEaKWhether it's funny is totally subjective, but I'm sure everybody who attended either of his sold-out performances Sunday night in DeVos Performance Hall would agree Larry got 'er done. (Sorry, you knew that was coming.) LiNeBrEaKWhat "'er" is, exactly, is also subjective. If it's to employ humor that observes the human condition with any level of intellectual sophistication, then, no, wrong guy. But if it's to keep crowds of 2,400 in stitches with a barrage of so-ridiculous-you-can't-help-but-laugh one-liners, then the ol' boy did just fine.LiNeBrEaKHere's Larry on getting his first prostate exam: "Is it normal for them to dim the lights and put on a Richard Marx CD?"LiNeBrEaKOn underwear: "I'm wearing a thong right now. It started as boxer shorts."LiNeBrEaKOn his young kids: "They're already farting at a third-grade level."LiNeBrEaKOn digestion: "I ate at Denny's one night, and my Glade PlugIn started a carpet fire."LiNeBrEaKOn his physique: "I'm a medium at Wal-Mart."LiNeBrEaKYou get the idea. I attended the first of the two shows and laughed at about two-thirds of the jokes which, as a virgin to Larry's stand-up act, was more than I was expecting. Having an above-average threshold for fart humor helped.LiNeBrEaKThe material about Viagra was a tad stale, as was a joke-free rant about global warming and Al Gore, referred to as "a turd that won't flush." "The global warming hasn't melted Al Gore. You see the size of that guy?" said Larry, very much calling the kettle black.LiNeBrEaKAnd some of the stuff just plain didn't make sense. One line went something like, "I'd be madder 'n a two-fingered cripple trying to send a text message."LiNeBrEaKHuh? I get the two-fingered thing, but what does "cripple" have to do with it?LiNeBrEaKOh well. One of the things Larry the Cable Guy, real name Dan Whitney, does well is move from one-liner to one-liner so fluidly that the occasional groaner -- and there were more than a few -- just flows by as part of his stream-of-redneck consciousness, which means his shtick works far better on stage than, say, in his movies. (Incidentally, his latest film, "Witless Protection," is up for a bunch of Golden Raspberry Awards, which are like the Oscars for movies that are awful.)LiNeBrEaKThere is something endearing about the haphazardness of his performance. If a joke stinks, he admits it and moves on. His likable, guy-next-door demeanor is, I'm convinced, not just part of the act.LiNeBrEaKI'll still take my Bill Hicks albums any day of the week, but with the world the way it is, there's something to be said for checking your pretensions at the door and laughing at a well-told fart joke.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   ALL S EDITION	Obama pushes emissions back into state hands;  Fuel efficiency also eyed in president's first foray into energy policy 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A2  	288 words  	WASHINGTON -- Plunging into energy policy, President Barack Obama is poised to give states a freer hand in curbing emissions from cars, and to get his government moving on fuel-efficiency standards that could remake the auto industry. LiNeBrEaKObama was to announce his plans today at the White House.LiNeBrEaKThe attention to energy comes as Obama nears completion of his first week as president, with an agenda dominated by economic woes and a push to get a huge stimulus plan through Congress.LiNeBrEaKIn one key move, Obama is aiming toward letting California and other states set their own tailpipe emission standards, a tool for reducing the gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKAnd in the other, Obama will order the Transportation Department to enact short-term rules on how automakers can improve fuel efficiency of their new models based on a 2007 law.LiNeBrEaKThe law requires that by 2020, new cars and trucks meet a standard of 35 miles per gallon, a 40 percent increase over the status quo. But the Bush administration did not set regulations in support of that law.LiNeBrEaKOn car emissions, California needed a waiver from the Clean Air Act to pursue its own course; the Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency denied that permission, which affected at least 13 other states that have followed California's lead.LiNeBrEaKObama will direct EPA regulators to re-examine California's case. The formal process will take time but is expected to end up in the states' favor. The Bush administration rejected the request on grounds that a national fuel-efficiency strategy would work better.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has lobbied Obama to step in and reverse the decision. As a candidate for president, Obama pledged to overturn the EPA's denial.

The Hartford Courant (Connecticut)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Environmentalists Fighting For Programs Amid Downturn  	David Funkhouser, The Hartford Courant, Conn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	852 words  	Jan. 26--With the state's fiscal well drying up, environmentalists are scrambling to protect programs and keep Connecticut moving toward the long-term goals it has set to promote clean energy, curb pollution, preserve open space and fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut a growing budget deficit may put the brakes on much of that effort. "We're all going to have to cut. There's no two ways about it," said state Rep. Richard Roy, D-Milford, co-chairman of the legislature's environment committee. "Anyone who says you can't cut is just whistling in the dark." LiNeBrEaKThe budget for the coming fiscal year, which Gov. M. Jodi Rell will deliver in February, could lop 10 to 15 percent off current spending in state agencies, by some estimates. Also at risk is a long list of ongoing programs, from rebates to homeowners for installing solar panels to capital projects to replace old sewer systems.LiNeBrEaKAll bets are off on what will survive: The state is looking at a multibillion-dollar deficit during the next two years.LiNeBrEaKThe state Council on Environmental Quality, which says the state already is failing to meet its environmental goals, has sent Rell a letter outlining what needs to be done to stay on track. The list includes $130 million for Clean Water Act projects to upgrade sewer and storm water systems, $12 million to help preserve 2,500 acres of farmland this year, $20 million for land conservation and $15 million to fix up state parks.LiNeBrEaKRell did offer some hope last week, touting $175 million in proposals the State Bond Commission will take up on Friday. The list includes some of those Clean Water Act projects and several transit projects.LiNeBrEaKStill, many worry about the impact of cuts on what they say is an already strapped Department of Environmental Protection. Environment Committee Co-chairman Sen. Ed Meyer, D-Guilford, said he is concerned that the DEP won't be able to oversee permits and enforce pollution laws properly.LiNeBrEaK"The DEP is pathetically under-funded," said Lori Brown, executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters.LiNeBrEaK"Basically, we're in protect mode," said House Majority Leader Denise Merrill, who has been active in environmental issues. "One goal this year is just to protect the DEP's existing staff."LiNeBrEaKWith state money tight, some are hoping that expensive infrastructure programs, such as sewer upgrades and improved transportation systems, will get a boost from a federal economic stimulus package. Congressional Democrats' $825 billion version of a stimulus plan could send nearly $600 million this way.LiNeBrEaKBut some groups already are lamenting that the package does not include enough money to keep the 20-year program to clean up Long Island Sound on pace. That program depends on an ongoing effort to upgrade sewer and storm-water runoff systems.LiNeBrEaKSome environmental programs already have been on the block: Rell earlier this month proposed pulling $26 million from energy-related programs to help staunch this year's flood of red ink. Legislators balked and -- for now -- have taken the Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency funds off the cutting board.LiNeBrEaKThose programs, funded by a surcharge on electric bills, pay for renewable energy projects, such as solar panels, and for energy audits and weatherization.LiNeBrEaKBut those who heat with oil lost out: Lawmakers pulled $10 million from a program to give them the same audits and weatherization assistance available to electric and gas heat customers.LiNeBrEaKThe programs are a key part of the state's effort to cut energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKMore With LessLiNeBrEaKWith some cuts all but certain, DEP Commissioner Gina McCarthy already is looking at how to do more with less and how to get things done more quickly.LiNeBrEaKShe launched a program last year to review how permits and other processes at the DEP are handled. The program already has found ways to avoid duplication of effort, streamline functions and speed decisions on permits.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is to protect the agency's "core services," she said.LiNeBrEaKMcCarthy also wants the legislature to give the agency more teeth, including the ability to impose larger criminal penalties and the right to issue orders that include civil penalties of as much as $100,000. Currently the agency must negotiate with polluters or go to court, a process that can take years.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers also are looking at new possibilities for generating revenue. One, backed by Merrill, would charge a small fee for the use of plastic shopping bags and earmark that revenue for environmental programs.LiNeBrEaKA second idea, a "municipal green fund," would give cities and towns the option of charging home buyers a fee, based on a percentage of the transaction, that would go toward local environmental projects.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 26, 2009 Monday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	The heat is on;  New data debunks claims that global warming is hype. 	STAFF  	B; Pg. 8  	434 words  	With the Obama administration expected to soon propose programs to reduce industrial emissions of greenhouse gases that fuel global warming, opponents continue to press their claims that the threat of climate change is either exaggerated or non-existent. Two studies unveiled in the past week provide powerful refutations to their arguments. LiNeBrEaKAccording to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, headed by Dr. James Hansen, last year was the ninth warmest year measured since reliable instrumentation was first used in 1880. The 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1997. The average global temperature for the past five and 10 years is the highest ever recorded.LiNeBrEaKA frequently aired claim by global warming skeptics is that the continent of Antarctica is cooling rather than warming, a result that calls into question whether human activities are really heating up the planet. That theory also took a hit with a new analysis of a half century of temperature data. Previous studies using widely dispersed weather station readings had documented a cooling trend.LiNeBrEaKBy combining ground-based data with satellite readings, researchers demonstrated that in fact temperatures across the ice-bound continent are rising as predicted by climate change computer models. The new findings indicate that temperatures rose nearly a quarter of a degree Fahrenheit per decade since 1957, or more than 1 degree in the past 50 years.LiNeBrEaKWestern Antarctica, which includes a peninsula that juts north toward South America, has warmed faster, partly because it is lower in altitude and its ice sheet is grounded below sea level. Scientists estimate that if the West Antarctica ice sheet melted, it would raise global sea levels by a catastrophic 16 to 20 feet.LiNeBrEaKOn the other end of the world, the past two years have seen record melting of Arctic ice, opening for the first time in recorded history ship lanes on both the eastern and western sides of the North Pole. Climatologists now project that the entire Arctic could be free of summer ice within decades. Equally ominous is the thinning ice sheet on Greenland, which could also contribute to faster rising ocean levels.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is much more than an inconvenient truth. For a coastal state like Texas, it is a growing threat that carries with it weather extremes from drought to flooding and the possibility of stronger hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKRather than continuing to debate the solid science that has been amassed on climate change, Congress must follow the lead of our new environmentally oriented administration and craft solutions to this national security threat.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 26, 2009 Monday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Obama upends Bush policy on environment;  Directive will let states issue standards for auto emissions, fuel efficiency 	JOHN M. BRODER, PETER BAKER, NEW YORK TIMES  	A; Pg. 1  	708 words  	WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama will direct federal regulators today to move swiftly on an application by California and 13 other states to set strict automobile emissions and fuel efficiency standards, two administration officials said Sunday evening.LiNeBrEaKThe directive makes good on an Obama campaign pledge and signifies a sharp reversal of Bush administration policy.LiNeBrEaKGranting California and the other states the right to regulate tailpipe emissions would be one of the most emphatic actions Obama could take to quickly put his stamp on environmental policy. LiNeBrEaKObama stopped short of ordering the agencies to reverse the Bush administration policy, but they are widely expected to do so.LiNeBrEaKOnce they act, automobile manufacturers will quickly have to retool to begin producing and selling cars and trucks that get higher mileage than the national standard, and on a faster phase-in schedule. The auto companies have lobbied hard against the regulations and challenged them in court.LiNeBrEaKBeyond acting on the California emissions law, officials said, Obama will announce that he is moving forward with nationwide regulations requiring the automobile industry to increase fuel efficiency standards to comply with a 2007 law - rules that the Bush administration decided at the last minute not to issue.LiNeBrEaKHe also will order federal departments and agencies to find new ways to save energy and be more environmentally friendly. And he will highlight the elements in his economic plan intended to create new jobs around renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKStimulus planLiNeBrEaKThe announcements will begin a week of efforts to get the economic stimulus plan through Congress. The White House hopes the Senate will confirm Tim Geithner as Treasury secretary today, and Obama plans to travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to meet with both Senate and House Republican caucuses and lobby for his stimulus package. Obama's aides expect the House to vote on its plan on Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKBut the centerpiece of today's anticipated announcement is Obama's directive to the Environmental Protection Agency to begin work immediately on granting California a waiver, under the Clean Air Act, which allows the state, a longtime leader in air quality matters, to set standards for automobile emissions stricter than the national rules.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia already has won numerous waivers for controls on emissions that cause smog, as opposed to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration denied the waiver in late 2007, saying that recently enacted federal mileage rules made the action unnecessary and that allowing California and the 13 other states the right to set their own pollution rules would result in an unenforceable patchwork of environmental law.LiNeBrEaKThe auto companies had advocated the denial, saying a waiver would require them to produce two sets of vehicles, one to meet the strict California standard and another that could be sold in the remaining states.LiNeBrEaKIgnored adviceLiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's environmental agency director, Stephen Johnson, echoed the automakers' claims in denying California's application, ignoring the near-unanimous advice of agency lawyers and scientists that the waiver be granted.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, wrote to Obama last week asking him to swiftly reconsider Bush's decision. The head of California's Air Resources Board, Mary Nichols, also wrote to the new director of the environmental agency, Lisa Jackson, asking for a quick reversal of the Bush policy.LiNeBrEaKNichols said Sunday night that she had not been formally notified that Obama intended to move toward granting the waiver. But she said, "Assuming that it is favorable to our request, we're delighted that the president is acting so quickly to reverse one of the worst decisions by the Bush administration and to get the EPA back on track."LiNeBrEaKThe emissions standards are part of an ambitious California plan to reduce emissions of the gases that are blamed for the heating of the atmosphere. Automotive emissions account for more than one-fifth of all such greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia was joined in its plea by 13 other states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington. Three other states have indicated they plan to adopt the California standard.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Grant wavier on emissions  		OPINION  	466 words  	It looks as though under the Obama administration, California will at last be able to put new limits on tailpipe emissions.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama on Monday directed the Environmental Protection Agency to re-examine whether California and several other states that want to follow its lead should be allowed to impose tougher auto emission standards to fight a buildup of greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKTightening those emissions would have the effect of reducing air pollutants - particularly beneficial here in San Bernardino County where we breathe some of the nation's smoggiest air.LiNeBrEaKIt's been three years since California requested a waiver from the EPA under the Clean Air Act to allow the state to pre-empt federal regulations and enforce its own ahead-of-the-nation limits on emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Act specifically gives California special authority to regulate vehicle pollution because this state began doing it before the federal government did, and the EPA has granted such waivers dozens of times.LiNeBrEaKBut the EPA denied this one, agreeing with automakers that such greenhouse gas limits amounted to requiring vehicle fleets to get higher gas mileage than Congress had required, and drawing charges that the decision had been made politically and not based on scientific facts.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sued the EPA in response in November 2007, several months after the U.S. ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama ordered Monday that the EPA take another look at California's waiver request to see whether it should be granted. We suspect it will be.LiNeBrEaKHe also directed his administration to develop fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover the 2011 model year. Congress passed a law in 2007 requiring that by 2020, new cars and trucks meet a standard of 35 miles per gallon, but the Bush administration did not set regulations to support that law.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed restrictions would force automakers to cut greenhouse emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016. One way to do it would be to increase fuel efficiency to 36. 8 miles per gallon.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers argue against higher fuel-efficiency standards, saying that will they increase costs at a time when U.S. automakers are struggling. It's galling, though, that they spend money to fight higher standards and then beg for bailout money when huge, gas-guzzling vehicles quit selling.LiNeBrEaK"Let me be clear: Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry," the president said. "It is to help America's automakers prepare for the future."LiNeBrEaKFor the environment, for our lungs, even for our national security in terms of not propping up hostile nations with our oil money, that future needs to include lower emissions and better fuel efficiency.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Tougher emission rules rub some the wrong way  	Mediha Fejzagic DiMartino, Staff Writer  	NEWS  	556 words  	FONTANA - Rusty Myers likes to breathe clean air, but he also likes to pay his bills and keep his job.LiNeBrEaK"There is no green for green cars," Fontana resident Myers said.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama on Monday ordered the government to re-examine whether California and other states should be allowed to have tougher auto emission standards to combat a buildup of greenhouse gases, a clean break from Bush administration policy.LiNeBrEaKObama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars. LiNeBrEaKLocal residents wonder if clean air should be on top of California's to-do list.LiNeBrEaK"The state has to balance their budget before they tell others how to run their business," said Michael Wilcock, fleet manager at the Richard Hibbard Chevrolet in Claremont. "They have a lot more to worry about than what happens with EPA."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed restrictions would force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016, which could force them to boost the fuel efficiency in new vehicles to about 36. 8 miles per gallon.LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Act gives the state special authority to regulate vehicle pollution because it started monitoring such pollution before the federal government got into the act.LiNeBrEaKBut a federal waiver is still required; if the waiver is granted, other states can choose to adopt California's standards or the federal ones.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, the Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency denied the state's waiver request.LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials have said they would face billions of dollars in new costs to meet the rules at a time when General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC have received billions in federal loans to stay afloat. LiNeBrEaKWilcock said he feels it's not fair to give the automakers money to bail them out and then impose requirements that are impossible to meet.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers also argued that it could require dealerships in some states to limit sales of large trucks in order to meet the standards.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers have pushed for a single national standard and have contended it would be unfeasible to have to design cars to what they termed "a patchwork" of different standards around the country.LiNeBrEaKA spokeswoman for House Minority Leader John Boehner called the announcement poorly timed and ill-conceived.LiNeBrEaK"Our nation's automakers are struggling - drastically restructuring and shedding jobs just to stay afloat," said Antonia Ferrier, press secretary to the Ohio Republican. "And now they are being forced to spend billions of dollars to comply with California's emissions standards, instead of using that money to save American jobs."LiNeBrEaKKathi Alley of Pomona wants something done about the country's dependency on foreign oil, but with everything going on in the country, she doesn't think it is the right time.LiNeBrEaKAlley, a teacher at the Montessori School House in Rancho Cucamonga, said she has had her work hours cut in half. She also helps out financially her aged parents who depend on Social Security to survive.LiNeBrEaK"It's hitting us all at the knees," Alley said.LiNeBrEaKMyers said he knows there are other solutions to the pollution problem, the automakers just need to look harder.LiNeBrEaK"Let's do what America is known for, being creative and thinking outside the box," Myers said.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Obama to OK states imposing tougher emissions standards  	Margaret Talev, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	570 words  	Jan. 26--WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is expected as early as Monday to give California and other states the green light to impose their own, stricter fuel emissions standards. LiNeBrEaKObama was scheduled to make a significant announcement on climate change midday at the White House, press aides said Sunday. Aides declined to confirm details.LiNeBrEaKAn e-mail from the White House public liaison office to interested parties, including environmental activists, invited their representatives to attend an "important" ceremony to mark "the first environment and energy actions taken by the president helping our country move toward energy independence."LiNeBrEaK"This is a presidential trifecta less than one week in office," said David G. Hawkins, director of climate programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council who received the e-mail.LiNeBrEaK"This will cut global warming pollution, reduce oil dependence and help build a stronger auto industry," he said. Automakers, who pushed to keep the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bush from signing off on California's higher standards, "have got their eyes on the rearview mirror, but if they'd look ahead they'd see this is exactly the medicine they need," Hawkins said. "This is Dr. Obama saying, 'Here's the exercise regime you need.'"LiNeBrEaKActivists and officials from at least 14 states seeking waivers from the federal Clean Air Act have been urging Obama since he took office last week to move quickly on such a change. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote to Obama last week asking him to move forward. A spokesman for the governor declined to comment Sunday on the anticipated step by the Obama administration, saying the governor would wait until formal action was taken to react.LiNeBrEaKThe anticipated step by the president would reverse President Bush's policies and pave the way to force carmakers to sell more fuel efficient vehicles. California's law, enacted in 2002, would require new cars to reduce emissions by roughly 30 percent and translate to a comparable increase in fuel economy, Hawkins said.LiNeBrEaKThe standards had been due to start with the 2009 model year but were delayed by automaker lawsuits and the Bush administration's denial of the California waivers. The other states have sought to adopt California's standards.LiNeBrEaKObama also was expected to direct the Department of Transportation to complete rulemaking for higher national fuel efficiency standards.LiNeBrEaKThe president's campaign platform included promises to tackle global warming and greenhouse gases, through stricter auto emissions standards, more renewable energy and initiating a cap-and-trade program affecting high-emissions producers such as power plants.LiNeBrEaKHe also has said the federal government's buildings and fleets should be more energy efficient, and on Saturday, in his first weekly address as president, said some of the money in the $825 billion-plus economic stimulus package under consideration by Congress would go toward making federal buildings and individual homes more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	345 words  	Jan. 26--The Nebo Robotics Bears and Carolina Crushers teams demonstrated their skills to the McDowell County School Board at last week's regular meeting. The teams were invited to the meeting in honor of their distinguished accomplishments at the regional competition in Greensboro in November. LiNeBrEaKThe kids were introduced by Nebo teacher Stella Brewer.LiNeBrEaKThe Bears went first, taking their robot through a series of tasks and challenges, a re-enactment of their drill at the competition last fall. They then presented a skit about climate change and its impact on western North Carolina, complete with a musical performance.LiNeBrEaKThe kids performed a song set to the tune of the Rolling Stones' "Paint it, Black."LiNeBrEaKThe Crushers team ran their robot through its paces as well, and presented a lecture on a similar topic of man's impact on the climate.LiNeBrEaKBoard Chairwoman Priscilla Owenby declared the performances "excellent" and expressed hope that the other teams from the county -- from Marion and West Marion elementary schools -- could come to a board meeting soon for a similar demonstration.LiNeBrEaKThe McDowell teams distinguished themselves at the Greensboro competition, bringing home three of the 14 awards presented among the dozens of teams who competed.LiNeBrEaKThe Nebo Robotic Bears won first place in the state in the rookie division.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   Final Edition	Utility says it's forced to lobby &lt;|&gt; Regulators pushed renewable energy  	THOMAS CONTENT, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	A News; Pg. 1  	876 words  	A Green Bay utility says state regulators overstepped their bounds and violated its free-speech rights by requiring that the company lobby the Legislature in support of Gov. Jim Doyle's global warming task force.LiNeBrEaK The bill reflecting the findings of the task force has not yet been drafted. But language in a Public Service Commission decision that set electricity rates for customers of Wisconsin Public Service Corp. tells the utility that it "should" support a proposal adopted by the Global Warming Task Force last year to expand the amount of renewable energy used in the state by 2025.LiNeBrEaK "This is kind of like a police officer picking up someone for speeding on I-43 and saying, 'If you write a check to the Police Benevolent Association, we'll forget about this whole speeding deal,' " said Rep. Phil Montgomery, (R-Ashwaubenon), the leading voice in the Republican caucus on energy issues. LiNeBrEaK Business groups concerned about the cost of global warming mandates chimed in against the commission's decision.LiNeBrEaK "In trying to force a regulated utility to lobby on behalf of the task force provisions, we think the agency clearly was overreaching here and sending us down a very slippery slope," said Todd Stuart, executive director of the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group.LiNeBrEaK Along with the other state utilities on the task force, WPS had voted in favor of the recommendations last year when the panel was considering a menu of proposals - including a proposal to increase the amount of renewable energy that state utilities supply to Wisconsin residents. But that's far different from agreeing to support a bill, Montgomery said.LiNeBrEaK Montgomery was a co-author of a bill that required utilities to get 10% of their energy from wind turbines and other sources of renewable energy by 2015. But he worries that a 25% mandate by 2025 would drive up electricity rates.LiNeBrEaK The fact that the language requiring the utility to lobby for the bill was included in a rate case decided by the PSC, a quasi-judicial body, irked Montgomery.LiNeBrEaK "The two are not connected. Since when is it the job of a government agency to tell you that you must lobby for a piece of legislation that has not even been written yet?" Montgomery asked. "This is unheard of."LiNeBrEaKCase still pendingLiNeBrEaK  PSC spokesman Tim LeMonds said his agency could not comment on the matter because the case remains pending. The three-member commission is expected to weigh in on the issue during its next meeting next month.LiNeBrEaK During its deliberations on the rate case last month, one commissioner, Lauren Azar, urged the commission to soften the language it was planning to use, saying it is "a little awkward for the commission to be requiring somebody to support legislation."LiNeBrEaK WPS had agreed to support some of the provisions of the global warming task force package - those related to energy efficiency - as part of a settlement with the Citizens' Utility Board, a customer group that represents residential electricity customers. But during its deliberations, commissioner Mark Meyer suggested adding a provision that the utility also support the proposal to require 25% of the state's electricity to come from renewable sources of energy by 2025.LiNeBrEaK "The provision was unilaterally inserted in the order by the PSCW without a proper basis," said Earl Gustafson, vice president of the Wisconsin Paper Council. "Freedom of speech includes a right to speak - and a right not to be forced to speak or advocate."LiNeBrEaK A key bone of contention in the case is the renewable energy expansion language.LiNeBrEaK WPS has been active on the renewable energy issue in recent years in Madison, expressing concern about the cost of wind power projects and seeking to amend state law to permit large hydroelectric projects such as dams in Manitoba for utilities seeking to comply with a green-power mandate.LiNeBrEaK The global warming task force recommended that by 2025, most of the renewable energy that would be used in Wisconsin could come from outside Wisconsin - including from dams in Manitoba. But because a global warming bill hasn't yet been written or introduced, it's unclear whether it will include that language.LiNeBrEaK In its response to the commission, WPS lawyer Bradley Jackson said the commission has sent WPS "a mixed message." Some of the language in the commission's decision can be interpreted as permitting - and not mandating the utility to lobby a certain way. However, he added, "the commission included this 'suggestion' as a condition of its approval" of the utility's agreement with CUB. Such a condition can be interpreted to be a mandate.LiNeBrEaK "A requirement to support legislation would constitute a violation of WPSC's rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution," Jackson wrote.LiNeBrEaK The Citizens' Utility Board and WPS also want other changes made to an agreement that would change how the utility earns its profit as an incentive for WPS customers to cut back on their energy use. But CUB also agreed with "free speech" arguments being made by WPS and other customer groups.LiNeBrEaK "Utilities cannot be forced to speak," CUB said in its filing.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   BALDWIN REGISTER 01 EDITION	Teacher  prepares for  icy journey     Teacher readies for icy journey  	FRANKLIN HAYES, Staff Reporter  	Z; Pg. 01  	1323 words  	Teacher prepares for icy journeyLiNeBrEaKTeacher readies for icy journeyLiNeBrEaKBy FRANKLIN HAYESLiNeBrEaKStaff ReporterLiNeBrEaKMegan O'Neill will travel to Antarctica to study ice fish and the effects of global warmingLiNeBrEaKStaff ReporterLiNeBrEaKFAIRHOPE - One high school teacher will soon be trading her temperature-controlled greenhouse where she raises African cichlids for a snowsuit and ice fish in Antarctica for two months.LiNeBrEaKFairhope High School science teacher Megan O'Neill was recently chosen to join an expedition to Antarctica in April to study rare species of fish, such as the blackfin icefish, and how their bodies adapt to freezing temperatures near the South Pole.LiNeBrEaKThis is not O'Neill's first trip into icy waters, as the teacher traversed the Arctic Ocean in 2007 while studying glacier tracks on the seafloor. LiNeBrEaKO'Neill, who heads Fairhope High's aquaculture program, is traveling courtesy of the Armada Project, which is paying for her plane ticket, accommodations in Antarctica and putting $1,500 toward hiring a substitute during her absence.LiNeBrEaKFairhope High Principal Beverly Thomas said she is getting donations from community members to cover the remaining cost for a qualified substitute during O'Neill's eight-week absence. When asked if she would ask the Baldwin County Board of Education for funding to cover the sub costs, Thomas replied, "I would not ask them at this point.LiNeBrEaK"We've been asked to cut travel and substitute costs. This is an all-expenses-paid trip."LiNeBrEaKThe Armada Project, administered by the University of Rhode Island and funded by the National Science Foundation, chose O'Neill for both trips because of her devotion to science and her experience in biology and fish, according to project coordinator Andrea Kecskes. Armada officials and the expedition's researchers held a conference call with O'Neill on Jan. 16 that served as an impromptu interview and led to her selection out of seven finalists, Kecskes said.LiNeBrEaK"It was the scientists' decision to pick Megan," Kecskes said.LiNeBrEaKThe University of Maine's Bruce Sidell, who has been researching ice fish in the Antarctic region since the late 1980s, said he chose O'Neill because of her experience raising tilapia, koi and bream for science classes at Fairhope High.LiNeBrEaKThe school has a temperature-regulated greenhouse containing eight, 880-gallon tanks and a separate building holds four, 550-gallon tanks where students learn about monitoring water chemistry and temperature. The tilapia, which usually end up as a fried entree on a plate at the end of the school year, are kept at a sultry 90 degrees inside the greenhouse.LiNeBrEaK"We were presented with a couple of choices of teachers that (Armada officials) felt were prepared for this type of field work," Sidell said. "We looked at the background of these people and her background with fishes was a factor. Of course working with Antarctic fishes is rather substantially different from what you would do in the South. ... After speaking with Megan on the phone we decided, 'Let's go with her.'"LiNeBrEaKSidell said the fish they will be researching have white blood because their bodies lack hemoglobin. It is believed that the ice fish produce a type of antifreeze protein that keeps their bodies warm, O'Neill said.LiNeBrEaK"We're not just capturing fishes. We'll bring these animals back to the laboratory and do some relatively complicated procedures," Sidell said, explaining that his team will be installing surgical implants to track the fish as well as studying their biochemistry and molecular chemistry. Sidell said the experiments are designed to observe the thermal tolerance of the ice fish and gauge the impacts of global temperature change.LiNeBrEaK"We fully anticipate to see a greater sensitivity of very modestly elevated temperatures than what they are used to," Sidell said. "They may very well be particularly imperiled by significant temperature increases. We should probably watch them very closely. They could become sentinel species for a tip off that things really are changing."LiNeBrEaKSidell added that the expedition would allow O'Neill to see how field science is done in the 21st century.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully more than anything else she'll be able to bring back the excitement to her students," he said.LiNeBrEaKO'Neill said unlike her first trip to the Arctic Ocean aboard the Spanish naval vessel HMS Hesperides in 2007, the trip to the Antarctic aboard the 236-foot research vessel Laurence M. Gould through Drake Passage will feature Internet access. O'Neill said she'll be able to check her yearbook students' progress because their publishing software is all online. O'Neill said she will also be able to occasionally interact with her students live via Web cam.LiNeBrEaK"I want to give kudos to (Fairhope High Principal) Dr. Thomas for allowing me the opportunity to go," O'Neill said. "She's helping to find the funding sources in this time of tight funding. It's wonderful she's been able to help me in that area."LiNeBrEaKFRANKLIN HAYES/RegisterLiNeBrEaKMegan O'Neill points to the region of Antarctica she will be visiting later this year as part of an expedition to study the effects of extreme temperatures on fish.LiNeBrEaKFRANKLIN HAYES/RegisterLiNeBrEaKLeft: Fairhope High science teacher Megan O'Neill will travel to Antarctica this spring to study global climate change and the effects of extreme temperatures on fish.

LiNeBrEaKThe move is significant on two fronts: It could empower states to set tougher standards in targeting emissions, which are blamed for contributing to global climate change; and it would be another swift reversal by Obama of Bush administration policy, this time on energy.LiNeBrEaKObama is expected to reveal the auto-emissions policy this morning in the East Room of the White House.LiNeBrEaKObama is also expected to direct the Transportation Department to get moving on rules for automakers to improve fuel economy and to tout proposals that he says would boost clean energy supplies while also producing badly needed jobs in so-called "green" industries.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	EarthTalk: Which parts of the U.S. are hardest hit by global warming?  	By E/The Environmental Magazine, Emagazine.com  	LIFESTYLE  	747 words  	Dear EarthTalk: Which parts of the United States are or will be hardest hit by global warming?LiNeBrEaK_ Aliza Perry, Burlington, Vt.LiNeBrEaKIt's difficult to predict which areas of the U.S. will suffer the most from global warming, but it's safe to say no regions will be unaffected. Scientists already point to increased severity of hurricanes on the East Coast, major Midwest floods and shrinking glaciers in the West as proof of global warming's onset.LiNeBrEaKOf course, America couldn't have asked for a better poster child in the fight to stave off global warming than Alaska, which is undergoing dramatic landscape changes as a result of warming-induced temperature increases, glacial melting and sea level rise. Even Alaska's conservative elected officials can no longer deny human-induced warming is affecting their state. The picture isn't looking too rosy in the western continental U.S. either, which is already facing some of the country' largest temperature increases. The signature glaciers in Montana's Glacier National Park may be all gone within just two decades. LiNeBrEaKA recent report by two leading nonprofits, the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization and the Natural Resources Defense Council, details how the 11 U.S. western states together have experienced an increase in average temperature during the last five years some 70 percent greater than the global average rise. The hottest part of the region has been drought-stricken Arizona, where average temperatures have risen some 2. 2 degrees Fahrenheit _ 120 percent greater than the global rise _ between 2003 and 2007. Researchers also found the West has experienced more frequent and severe heat waves, with the number of extremely hot days increasing by up to four days per decade since 1950.LiNeBrEaKIn the Midwest, seemingly minor increases in temperature have already wrought major effects. In 2006 Lake Erie didn't freeze for the first time in history, which led to "lake effect" snowfalls as more evaporating water was available for precipitation. Likewise, changes in the lake's water temperature have begun to alter fish populations, which in turn affect birds and their migratory patterns. Despite localized heavier snowfalls, though, the region is generally suffering from a drying trend. Farmers worry the result will be lower crop yields and thus more expensive food for American consumers.LiNeBrEaKOn the east coast, coral reef bleaching, heat waves and increased hurricane intensity are just some of the warming-related hazards Floridians have had to deal with in recent years. Washington, D.C.'s famous cherry trees are now blossoming earlier due to temperature increases. Further north, milder-than-typical winter temperatures have been linked to subtle changes in ocean currents. In New York City, the average temperature has increased about four degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, and could get 10 degrees hotter by 2100, according to a study commissioned by the federally funded U.S. Global Change Research Program.LiNeBrEaKBut the bigger problem for New York City, as well as other low-lying areas around the nation's coasts, will be sea level rise: Climate models predict that sea level around the Northeast is expected to rise between } inch and 3 { feet over the course of this century.LiNeBrEaKCONTACTS: Rocky Mountain Climate Organization, www.rockymountainclimate.org; Natural Resources Defense Council, www.nrdc.org; U.S. Global Change Research Program, www.usgcrp.gov.LiNeBrEaKGOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTION?

The New York Times 		January 26, 2009 Monday   National Edition	Eating the Wild  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 22  	308 words  	In America, there are foragers among us, out searching for morels in the spring, and there are hunters  too. Yet most of our food, except for fish caught from the sea, is farmed. We do not trap songbirds for savory pies. (We destroy too many of them through other means.)  LiNeBrEaK  Once you look beyond the parochial culinary habits of most Americans you discover that wildness, and the tastes associated with it, have a talismanic power that is very hard to eradicate. It is what keeps the Japanese whaling and keeps some Africans eating bush meat. And it is one of the things that helps explain the voracious and utterly destructive Chinese appetite for turtles. LiNeBrEaK  As global wealth rises, so does global consumption of meat, which includes wild meat. Turtle meat used to be a rare delicacy in the Asian diet, but no longer. China, along with Hong Kong and Taiwan, has vacuumed the wild turtles out of most of Southeast Asia. Now, according to a recent report in The Los Angeles Times, they are consuming common soft-shell turtles from the American Southeast, especially Florida, at an alarming rate. LiNeBrEaK  Some scientists estimate that two-thirds of the tortoise and freshwater turtle species on the planet are seriously threatened. Some of that is secondhand damage -- loss of habitat, water pollution, climate change. But far too many turtles are being lost to the fork and the spoon. LiNeBrEaK  In the United States, the solution is relatively straightforward. States should impose much tighter restrictions on the harvesting and export of wild turtles. Internationally, the problem is more complicated. There have been efforts to monitor the species of wild turtles found in Chinese markets, but as long as the appetite for turtles -- and traditional medicines derived from them -- persists, we fear it will be hard to curtail such a profitable and disastrous trade.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Hearings eye rising seas that may swamp South Shore  	Jennifer Smith, Newsday, Melville, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	350 words  	Jan. 26--Rising sea levels might seem a distant concern for communities wrestling with budget shortfalls amid a global economic meltdown.LiNeBrEaKBut new forecasts for Long Island's South Shore indicate that over the next decade oceans could rise 2 to 5 inches -- enough to drown marshes, worsen erosion and inundate low-lying areas. LiNeBrEaKThis week a state task force crafting New York's response to that threat is scheduled to hold public meetings in Nassau and Suffolk to discuss the potential impact of a rising sea level.LiNeBrEaKComments gathered from the public will be used to develop formal state guidelines.LiNeBrEaKThose guidelines will likely include recommendations ranging from where to safely build big projects such as sewage treatment plants to how to protect animals and plants threatened by flooding or erosion, said Mark Lowery of the state Department of Environmental Conservation's climate change office.LiNeBrEaKConservative scientific estimates project that global sea levels will rise 7 to 23 inches by century's end as a result of global warming. But recent research indicates that fast-melting ice sheets could speed up the process. Under that scenario, the South Shore could see a rise of 7 inches by the 2020s, according to projections Columbia University developed for Nature Conservancy on Long Island, a conservation group.LiNeBrEaKThe meetings are scheduled on Wednesday at the Nassau County Legislative Chamber in Mineola and on Thursday at Berkner Hall at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton. Both sessions will start with an open house from 4 to 7 p.m., and DEC presentations beginning at 7. A meeting is also planned on Tuesday in New York City.LiNeBrEaKFor more information, call DEC's climate change office at 518-402-8448.

A7  	902 words  	Thrifty behavior stretches needed food assistanceLiNeBrEaKThe story, "Food stamp requests tell bleak tale" (Jan. 15), is saddening. Worse, it just reports figures. We all know someone who is struggling to make ends meet.LiNeBrEaKAfter viewing the Guilford County Web page for food stamp applications, I was shocked to see so few categories asking information from the applicant about other expenses such as mortgage/shelter and utilities.LiNeBrEaKThese people need food or they wouldn't go through this process. Why is there no mention of accountability on the part of the applicant? LiNeBrEaKI would like to see a budget planner right alongside the application for food stamps and make it mandatory to submit these forms together. This would force applicants to realistically look at their finances.LiNeBrEaKWhen 2,800 people applied for food stamps in December (almost a 50 percent increase from 2007), that sets off an alarm. I hope they have taken steps to rein in their finances. Cancel cable TV and premium channels, cancel or review cell phones and plans, use the public library, do not eat out, refill water bottles, utilize averaging programs for utilities, clip coupons, shop food sales. We need to re-educate people on being responsible with their finances. It will empower them to do with less.LiNeBrEaKTroyce HoodLiNeBrEaKGreensboroLiNeBrEaKMarijuana legalization promises many benefitsLiNeBrEaKWhile Julie Westholder ("Risks outweigh benefits for marijuana smokers," letter, Jan. 23) makes some valid points, I would like to advise her that the current policies are not working. While she may consider alcohol and tobacco gateway drugs because they are easily accessible due to being legal, I would argue that marijuana is even more accessible while being illegal. Drug dealers do not ask for IDs. Furthermore, addiction is a disease. Prevention has obviously not worked, so why not move toward rehabilitation?LiNeBrEaKAnother point that needs to be considered is the burden the current policies have put on the system. Mandatory minimum sentencing has filled our jails with nonviolent offenders. When was the last time someone committed a violent crime to support their pot habit? The money saved by not prosecuting these offenders and the money earned by taxing marijuana could pay for the rehabilitation of addicts and give the Drug Enforcement Administration the resources to go after violent drug offenders.LiNeBrEaKIt is time to decriminalize marijuana, take the money earned from taxing it and put it to better use like rehabilitation, enforcement of violent crimes and, God forbid, balancing the U.S. budget.LiNeBrEaKDavid SmithLiNeBrEaKGreensboroLiNeBrEaKLocal efforts must make climate change a priorityLiNeBrEaKWith the Obama administration in place, now is the time to make up for lost time in the battle against global warming. But with economic woes, two wars, terrorism and health care making the headlines, will climate change get the priority it needs? Even without the other priorities, will the coal and oil lobbies force us further down the fossil-fuel road?LiNeBrEaKA group called the National Teach-In on Global Warming is getting the word out. It has presented to Obama a President's Climate Action Plan, a guide for making the revolutionary changes this change requires. As part of its grass-roots efforts, it is planning to have a thousand teach-ins on global warming in early February.LiNeBrEaKLocal environmental groups have joined together to hold one of these teach-ins in Greensboro. This free event will be held Feb. 5 from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church at 607 North Greene St. Come learn about what must be done in Washington, and what we must do here.LiNeBrEaKTo learn more about the national organization, go to http://www.nationalteachin.org.

The Old Testament has Cain killing his brother Abel, and the New Testament predicts "wars and rumors of war." Prehistoric human remains show injuries inflicted by other humans, and history is marked by war after war.LiNeBrEaKThis is not to say that war is desirable. War destroys life and property and breeds disease and poverty that often kill more people than the fighting. Peaceful co-existence benefits both sides, but there is no negotiating with someone who demands your eradication.LiNeBrEaKIf Ms. Latham's pacifist dream was realized and the world renounced violence, freedom and security would only last until one evil person was willing to use violence.LiNeBrEaKEuropean history from the 1930s shows that failure to use force can create larger problems. If France and England had confronted Hitler in 1938, the six-year bloodbath that followed might have been prevented.LiNeBrEaKA T-shirt seen at a local gun show expressed it most succinctly: "War is not the answer - except for fascism, communism and slavery."LiNeBrEaKJeff PickettLiNeBrEaKFranklinvilleLiNeBrEaKHorace Kornegay belongs to greatest generationLiNeBrEaKHorace Kornegay was unfailingly a kind, courteous and decent man.

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	AGENCY PASSES NUCLEAR DEBATE TO STATE  	By CHRISTINE STAPLETON Palm Beach Post Staff Writer  	LOCAL; Pg. 1B  	461 words  	Florida's utility regulators have crafted their vision of Florida's green energy future without answering the billion-dollar question: What is green energy?LiNeBrEaKMonths of intense lobbying and public hearings on how and when Florida's energy companies should go green ended on Jan. 9 with the state's Public Service Commission deciding not to decide whether nuclear power is green enough to be part of the state's mandate to reduce greenhouse gases. The issue -- raised by Florida Power and Light, the state's largest producer of nuclear power -- was the only issue the commission did not decide. The prickly question now goes to the legislature, where FPL is a major political player. LiNeBrEaK"The legislature and the governor and the country seem to be for cleaner energy and you can't say clean energy and -- because you don't like nuclear -- exclude it from the discussion," Commission member Nancy Argenziano said. "I am in favor of sending it over to the legislature. That is their policy call. Not ours."LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago the governor asked the commission to draft a Renewable Portfolio Standard, which will require power companies to generate a specific amount of power from renewable energy sources -- such as solar, wind and biomass -- by a deadline. Nuclear power is not included in the state's legal definition of "renewable energy."LiNeBrEaKFPL, which has invested billions of dollars in nuclear power and intends to spend billions more, asked the commission to recommend to the legislature that Florida should have a "clean" rather than "renewable" energy portfolio, since nuclear power produces no greenhouse gases. FPL generates no power in Florida from renewable energy sources. The "clean" standard proposed by FPL would allow the company to fulfill its obligation to generate green power with its new nuclear reactors, set to go online in about 10 years.LiNeBrEaK"That is what the debate over clean and renewable energy is all about -- how to limit greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change while also keeping customer costs manageable," FPL spokesman Mayco Villafana wrote in response to questions from The Palm Beach Post. "Our view is that the clean energy portfolio standard will produce the largest emissions reductions at the lowest cost to customers."LiNeBrEaKBut the company's "clean" energy proposal angered environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK"Nuclear is not, by any stretch of the imagination, clean or renewable," said Rob Brinkman, chairman of the Suwanee and St. Johns Sierra Club. "It leaves us with toxic waste for millions of years."LiNeBrEaKTaking the debate to the legislature without a recommendation gives FPL a strong advantage.LiNeBrEaK"I would expect it to be quite political," said Tommy Burroughs, a member of the Governor's Action Team on Energy and Climate Change.LiNeBrEaK~ christine_stapleton@pbpost.com	RENEWABLE ENERGY (91%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); LOBBYING (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); WIND POWER PLANTS (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); GOVERNORS (89%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (78%); BIOMASS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (77%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (60%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (50%)  	FLORIDA POWER and LIGHT CO (57%)  		FLORIDA, USA (96%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	March 24, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   SOONER EDITION	EMISSIONS POLICY IN REVERSE;  PA. IS INCLUDED AMONG 14 STATES TO HAVE REGULATORY POWER ON VEHICLE FUEL EFFICIENCY 	John M. Broder and Peter Baker, The New York Times  	STATE; Pg. A-1  	750 words  	WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will direct federal regulators today to move swiftly on an application by California and 13 other states, including Pennsylvania, to set strict automobile emissions and fuel efficiency standards, two administration officials said last night.LiNeBrEaKThe directive makes good on a campaign pledge and signifies a sharp reversal of Bush administration policy. Granting California and the other states the right to regulate tailpipe emissions would be one of the most emphatic actions Mr. Obama could take to quickly put his stamp on environmental policy. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama stopped short of ordering the agencies to reverse Bush administration policy, but they are widely expected to do so.LiNeBrEaKOnce they act, automobile manufacturers will quickly have to retool their plants before they begin producing and selling cars and trucks that get higher mileage than the national standard, and on a faster phase-in schedule. The auto companies have lobbied hard against the regulations and challenged them in court.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama will use the announcement to bolster the impression of a sharp break from the Bush era on all fronts, following his decisions last week to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; tighten limits on interrogation tactics by Central Intelligence Agency officers; order plans to withdraw combat forces from Iraq; and reverse former President Bush's financing restrictions on groups that provide or discuss abortion overseas, administration officials said.LiNeBrEaKBeyond acting on the California emissions law, officials said, Mr. Obama will announce that he is moving forward with nationwide regulations requiring the automobile industry to increase fuel efficiency standards to comply with a 2007 law -- rules that the Bush administration decided at the last minute not to issue.LiNeBrEaKHe will also order federal departments and agencies to find new ways to save energy and be more environmentally friendly. And he will highlight the elements in his economic plan intended to create new jobs around renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThe announcements, to be made in the East Room, will begin a week of efforts to get the economic stimulus plan through Congress. The White House hopes the Senate will confirm Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary today, and Mr. Obama plans to travel to Capitol Hill on tomorrow to meet with both Senate and House Republican caucuses and lobby for his stimulus package. Mr. Obama's aides expect the House to vote on its plan on Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKBut the centerpiece of today's anticipated announcement is Mr. Obama's directive to the Environmental Protection Agency to begin work immediately on granting California a waiver, under the Clean Air Act, which allows the state, a longtime leader in air quality matters, to set standards for automobile emissions stricter than the national rules.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has already won numerous waivers for controls on emissions that cause smog, as opposed to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration denied the waiver in late 2007, saying that recently enacted federal mileage rules made the action unnecessary.The auto companies had advocated the denial, saying a waiver would require them to produce two sets of vehicles, one to meet the strict California standard and another that could be sold in the remaining states.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's environmental agency director, Stephen L. Johnson, echoed the auto makers' claims in denying California's application, ignoring the near-unanimous advice of agency lawyers and scientists that the waiver be granted.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, wrote to Mr. Obama last week asking him to swiftly reconsider Bush's decision. The head of California's Air Resources Board, Mary D. Nichols, also wrote to the new director of the environmental agency, Lisa P. Jackson, asking for a quick reversal of the Bush policy.LiNeBrEaKThe California law, which was originally meant to take effect in the 2009 model year, requires automakers to cut emissions by nearly a third by 2016, four years ahead of the federal timetable. The result would be an increase in fuel efficiency in the American car and light truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon from the current average of 27.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia was joined in its plea by 13 other states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington. Three other states have indicated they plan to adopt the California standard. Together they account for about half of the American market for cars and light trucks.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Cutting our carbon  		COMMENTARY; Pg. 4  	459 words  	Rhode Island has signed on to a promising regional effort to address climate change while lowering dependence on fossil fuels. Modeled after a California initiative, the agreement paves the way for a  low carbon fuel standard  to be followed, eventually, by 11 states. These states are the same as have joined in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, plus Pennsylvania. They are the New England states along with New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. LiNeBrEaKRGGI seeks to limit greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants with a  cap-and-trade  system. Essentially, the plants pay for, and ultimately will have to reduce, the carbon they produce. States then use the revenue for energy-efficiency projects. Low carbon fuel standards take a broader approach. They apply to all types of fuel providers, including those that power cars and heat homes. And, rather than dictating the best substitutes, they let businesses choose.LiNeBrEaKThe result should be a flexible framework for ushering in a badly needed transition, while maximizing innovation. Under the low-carbon fuel standard, fuel producers will have to reduce the amount of carbon their products generate. But they can take a number of approaches, from mixing biomass fuels, such as ethanol, into gasoline to buying credits from other fuel providers (a supplier of electricity, for instance). Ideally, the standards would tighten over time, encouraging pursuit of better technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the financial crisis has complicated matters, the arrival of President Obama signals a new national approach to energy issues. Steven Chu, Mr. Obama s choice to head the Energy Department, has promised aggressive action on both climate change and energy independence. During the campaign, Mr. Obama supported the concept of a low-carbon fuel standard. But Mr. Chu may favor other routes to the same goal. Though Mr. Obama has said he hopes to make renewable energy a focus of the stimulus package, he should take care not to stifle innovation by rewarding some alternatives too lavishly.LiNeBrEaKThe pact that Rhode Island has joined emerged from promptings by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, who assembled a task force on biofuels in 2007. The task force has urged scrapping specific mandates (favoring cellulosic biofuels, for instance) in favor of the  technology-neutral  low carbon fuel standard.LiNeBrEaKAbsent a nationwide effort, the regional agreement, for now, makes sense. The New England and Mid-Atlantic states share a fuel-distribution system, and the pact could conceivably help by creating a larger market for cleaner fuels. We are unlikely to have a clear picture of our energy future for a while. A low-carbon fuel standard at least helps level the field for trying out alternatives.

L02  	414 words  	MAHWAH ? Fifth-graders learned how tough it can be to generate energy when employees from Sharp Electronics visited the Joyce Kilmer School to present its Solar Academy.LiNeBrEaKA handful of student volunteers had the chance to turn cranks that were wired to a light bulb in an effort to illuminate it. Rotating the handle round and round, the group could only get the bulb to flicker. LiNeBrEaK"It's a lot of work to release energy and create energy," Rich Montier, a human resources manager at the Mahwah-based company, declared to a classroom filled with two dozen students.LiNeBrEaKTwo employees from Sharp, which makes solar panels, among other things, visited the school last week and will return again tomorrow to put on the program. Conceived by scientists from the corporation's Japanese headquarters and honed for the United States, it's aimed at educating children about renewable and non-renewable energy, global warming and how to conserve resources.LiNeBrEaKStudents learned what climate change is, what they can do about it, how pollution affects global warming, what happens when the Earth's temperature rises and where electricity comes from. They also had a primer on solar energy.LiNeBrEaKMahwah students are the first in New Jersey to participate in the program. It has also been presented in Suffern, N.Y., at the R.P. Connor School. Students at Ramsey schools are slated to get it next.LiNeBrEaKMembers of the Mahwah Schools Foundation first viewed the program and approved it for their district. "We thought it was fabulous and the fact that it is free is wonderful," said Suzanne Curry, a Mahwah Board of Education member who is the liaison to the foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe hour-long program includes a discussion, led by Elaine Eltringham, a credit manager for Sharp, on climate change and ways students could help conserve energy. She suggested unplugging cellphone chargers when they're not being used and turning off the faucet when brushing your teeth.LiNeBrEaK"We have to try to break those habits," said Eltringham, who lives in Ramsey.LiNeBrEaKSeveral students asked questions throughout the program and some were brought up to participate as volunteers. Each student left with a solar-powered Sharp calculator and a workbook to reinforce the concepts.LiNeBrEaK"I think that Sharp designed an excellent presentation," said Ruth Gillman, principal of Joyce Kilmer. "Renewable energy is the future and the future is now. Our students need to understand the technology of solar power and other sources of renewable energy."LiNeBrEaKE-mail: priesa@northjersey.com	STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); VOLUNTEERS (89%); SCHOOL PRINCIPALS (78%); HUMAN RESOURCES (73%) MAHWAH; SCHOOL  			NEW JERSEY, USA (93%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 North Jersey Media Group Inc., All Rights Reserved  			COLUMN  	PHOTO, ALLISON PRIES/STAFF - Jackson Hope, right, from Joyce Kilmer School in Mahwah, assisting Rich Montier during a science experiment.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   All Editions	Earth in warming cycle  		NEWS; DID YOU KNOW?; Pg. A02  	252 words  	Earth's atmosphere has gone through many warming and cooling cycles ? and is currently believed by many to be warming. What evidence would indicate that a cooling cycle has begun? LiNeBrEaKFirst, it would have to get cooler ? for many years and worldwide.LiNeBrEaKThe overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that the world is now warming for man-made reasons, due to greenhouse gases. That's based on decades of observations, measurements of heat reaching the surface and an understanding of the physics of the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKSomething similar and just as scientifically robust would be required to indicate that a cooling cycle has begun.LiNeBrEaK"It would take actual observations to say that we're cooling; it would take many decades of that," said Andrew Weaver, a climate expert at the University of Victoria in Victoria, British Columbia.LiNeBrEaKWorldwide ? and records need to be global ? 2008 was tied for the eighth warmest year in records that go back to 1880, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. True, last year was a tad cooler than 2007 or the record-setting year of 2005, but it was close to a full degree warmer than the 100-year average.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, eight of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001 and the other two weren't much earlier ? 1997 and 1998.LiNeBrEaKWeather varies year to year. Even when the world is warming, not every year can be hotter than the previous year, mostly because of the influence of the Earth's oceans and weather effects such as El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a, Weaver said.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	California adding green jobs, leading nation in energy efficiency  	Matt Nauman, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	651 words  	Jan. 26--California added green jobs in recent years at a much more rapid pace than non-green jobs, a new report released today says.LiNeBrEaKFrom 2005 to 2007, the number of green jobs grew 10 percent, to about 105,000 in California, according to the 2009 California Green Innovation Index. During the same period, state-wide job growth was about 1 percent.LiNeBrEaKA surprising number of the green jobs -- 20 percent -- were manufacturing jobs, the report notes, with the growth spread fairly evenly across diverse segments of clean-technology, including advanced materials, transportation, air and environment, and green building. LiNeBrEaKFrom 1995 to 2007, the number of green jobs in California grew 15 percent and the number of green businesses increased 28 percent. Green jobs are defined as ones that provide products and services leveraging renewable energy resources, reducing pollution, conserving energy and natural resources, and repurposing waste.LiNeBrEaKThe data snapshot, however, ends in early 2007, which means that the turbulent economy that became the recession of 2008 and continues into 2009 isn't reflected in these numbers.LiNeBrEaKThe report was issued by Next 10, a Palo Alto non-profit that focuses on the intersection of the economy and the environment. It was founded and funded by F. Noel Perry, a former venture capitalist. The research was conducted by Collaborative Economics of Mountain View.LiNeBrEaKSome other highlights of the report:LiNeBrEaK--Energy productivity, which researchers define as total gross domestic product produced per unit of energy, is 68 percent higher in California than in the rest of the United States. In 2006, California created $2. 17 of GDP for every 10,000 BTU of energy consumed, compared to $1. 29 of GDP for every 10,000 BTU of energy consumed in the rest of the nation.LiNeBrEaKThat's important, said Perry, because it shows that energy-efficiency doesn't have to inhibit economic growth.LiNeBrEaK--From 2002 to 2007, California was the leader in patent registrations for green technologies, especially in the fields of solar energy, fuel cells and batteries.LiNeBrEaK--A Field Survey commissioned as part of the research shows that a vast majority of Californians believe that global warming is a serious threat to the state's economy (69 percent) and its quality of life (73 percent).LiNeBrEaK--The $3. 3 billion in venture investments in California clean-tech companies in 2008 represented 57 percent of the total U.S. investment in the segment. Of that, $1. 8 billion went to Silicon Valley companies. Most of the money (69 percent) went to energy-generation projects; 8 percent went to transportation.LiNeBrEaK--Registrations of alternative-fuel vehicles, including hybrids as well as those running on electricity or natural gas, topped 100,000 in California for the first time in 2007. That represented more than 2 percent of California's car registrations.LiNeBrEaKAs the Obama administration moves to use energy-efficiency and renewable energy as a source of job growth, California could be an exporter of its expertise to other states, Perry said.LiNeBrEaK"Imagine where the country could be if it were as efficient at California," Perry said.LiNeBrEaKTracey Grose, a Collaborative Economics vice president, noted that many calculations of the number of green jobs rely on modeling or existing job categories, and neither results in an accurate accounting. Her firm relied on a broad spectrum of sources, including a sophisticated Internet search for data, to reach its data.LiNeBrEaKContact Matt Nauman at (408) 920-5701 or at mnauman@mercurynews.com	ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (89%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%); RECESSION (76%); FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY (75%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (75%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (73%); SOLAR ENERGY (73%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (73%); PATENTS (72%); VENTURE CAPITAL (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (69%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES (68%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (66%)  		General  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090126-SJ-California-adding-green-jobs-leading-nation-in-energy-efficiency-0126  	Newspaper  	SJ  	2009 San Jose Mercury News   																
San Jose Mercury News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Obama embraces California vehicle emissions efforts  	Frank Davies, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	887 words  	Jan. 26--WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama declared Monday that California's pioneering vehicle emissions controls, blocked for years by the Bush administration, will help launch a national effort to tackle global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We will make it clear to the world that America is ready to lead," Obama said at an elaborate East Room ceremony attended by industry leaders and advocacy groups.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state officials praised Obama's decision to order a swift review of the state's request for a waiver under the Clean Air Act, allowing California to enforce strict limits on tailpipe emissions. At least 14 other states have adopted the California standard, with four more in the process, representing about half the nation's population. LiNeBrEaKPolitical leaders on all sides expect the review by the Environmental Protection Agency will lead to approval of the California standard soon.LiNeBrEaKWith both words and pageantry, Obama made Monday's announcement the most significant declaration on global warming ever delivered by an American president. He promised new spending on green initiatives and tighter nationwide fuel-efficiency standards, and hinted he will move ahead soon with broad limits on greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Now California finally has a partner and ally in the White House," Schwarzenegger said at a Sacramento news conference. "Promises were made by President Obama, and promises were kept."LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Environment Committee, said she expects EPA approval "in a matter of weeks" because "every scientist and legal expert at EPA already recommended approval" before Administrator Stephen Johnson turned down the state.LiNeBrEaKMary Nichols, who will enforce the standard as chair of the California Air Resources Board, said final approval would come by May at the latest.LiNeBrEaKNichols also said the targets for emissions reductions are still realistic despite the delays and earlier EPA rejection: a 22 percent drop by 2012, and a 30 percent drop by 2016. She said automakers should have "no major difficulty" in reaching efficiency goals through 2013, based on their own reports to Congress on producing more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers had a muted reaction to Obama's decision, reflecting their precarious position as an industry now dependent on huge federal loans. Dave McCurdy, chief executive of the Auto Alliance of 11 manufacturers, said the industry was "ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach" to fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKSome auto dealers, citing the closing of about 900 dealerships last year, reacted negatively. "If we have 13 states for which separate cars and trucks need to be made, a lot more dealerships are likely to close in those states," said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.LiNeBrEaKObama on Monday also directed the Transportation Department to come up with guidelines by March on steps to reach an average fuel efficiency of 35 mpg for all passenger vehicles by 2020, if not sooner, to comply with a 2007 law.LiNeBrEaKObama also went beyond his two decisions to signal a more ambitious campaign to limit carbon emissions and move toward energy independence. He touted the spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy in his $825 billion economic recovery plan and said he embraces a major U.S. role in reducing global emissions.LiNeBrEaKBy taking national action against global warming, Obama said, "we will ensure that nations like China and India are doing their part, just as we are now willing to do ours."LiNeBrEaKNichols and some environmental leaders said that was a clear indication that Obama plans to push for mandatory limits on carbon emissions from all sources this year.LiNeBrEaK"He was not just talking about taking care of a campaign promise or reversing a bad policy, but that was a positive signal that he wants to do more on global warming, including cap and trade (legislation) this year," Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKBoxer, a California Democrat, said she will announce basic principles later this week for a bill that would set caps on emissions and allow industries that get under those caps to trade and sell emissions credits.LiNeBrEaKHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, said last week that she wants the House to pass a cap-and-trade bill this year.LiNeBrEaKThe new administration could have announced Monday's decisions with little fanfare, but Obama chose a high-profile event, surrounded by Wal-Mart executives, energy experts and environmentalists, to frame the policy change as the first step in an aggressive effort to reduce energy dependence and tackle climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe historic shift was not lost on Attorney General Jerry Brown, who had sued the EPA to get its decision reversed: "Today's dramatic announcement marks the first time that an American president has taken decisive action to deal with global warming."LiNeBrEaKMercury News Staff Writer Matt Nauman contributed to this report.

San Mateo County Times (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Sierra Point project on hold over solar panels  	Christine Morente, San Mateo County Times, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	521 words  	Jan. 26--BRISBANE -- The city's planning commission held off approval of a project at Sierra Point because the applicant failed to consider the use of solar panels on the property. LiNeBrEaKThe developer is pushing for energy-generating wind turbines, but Commissioner Jameel Munir wanted to see an analysis, renderings and a cost-benefit analysis of solar panels.LiNeBrEaK"Putting in solar power makes a great statement for Brisbane," he said Thursday night. "I'd like to see a certain percentage of energy from alternate energy sources, and that's not there."LiNeBrEaKThe issue is expected to come back on Feb. 26 to lay down the groundwork so alternate renewable studies are done before the project moves forward.LiNeBrEaKIf Opus West Corporation's plan is approved, it would build 438,104 square feet of office space; 1,388 parking spaces; and a 1,175-car garage on nearly 9 acres of vacant property northwest of Marina Boulevard east of U.S. Highway 101.LiNeBrEaKThe project would also incorporate the extension of the regional Bay Trail along the north and west border of the site.LiNeBrEaKThe project is expected to use 17. 5 percent less energy than a typical development of that size, said Randall Ackerman, vice president of Real Estate Development for Opus West.LiNeBrEaKThe intent is to achieve silver LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, certification, which is based on a green building-rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council.LiNeBrEaKAt the north end of the garage, two wind turbines could be installed to generate energy.LiNeBrEaKFirst, a consultant would put in an anonometer to record wind speed data and determine if the windmills are feasible for that location.LiNeBrEaKAckerman asked the commission to consider the Sierra Point project without the solar panels because there would be limited space on the office building's roof.LiNeBrEaKThe garage roof could be an option, however Opus West isn't interested in putting in the system. A different company could do it, Ackerman said.LiNeBrEaKResident Richard Reel encouraged the developer to not only look at having solar panels in lieu of trees in some places, but to consider installing car recharging stations in the parking lot.LiNeBrEaKTony Attard -- a former Brisbane planning commissioner and councilman who cofounded the city's Committee for Renewable Energy for the Baylands -- said the city needs to do its part in fighting global warming.LiNeBrEaK"This can only work if we as a city take a stand and be responsible," Attard said. "Solar Panels should be mandated on the garage as a condition of the use permit.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (West Covina, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Comic book writer competes for chance to be published  	Rebecca Kimitch, San Gabriel Valley Tribune, West Covina, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	362 words  	Jan. 26--Like writers across the Southland, San Dimas resident Shannon Cronin, 30, has had screenplays languishing in his computer for years.LiNeBrEaKBut instead of letting those dreams die inside the circuitry on his desk, the computer programmer recently decided to try a new media, one that he has loved for years: comic books. LiNeBrEaKAnd already those ideas are coming to life.LiNeBrEaKCronin's comic Lifespan is competing in an online contest by DC Comic's Zuda.com for the chance to be published. If it gets the most votes, it will be put to print.LiNeBrEaKThe story is unique. Lifespan creates a alternate reality in which global leaders have responded to over population, a collapsing economy and global warming by setting everyone's lifespanLiNeBrEaKat 77. 5 years. At that age, you must surrender your life, or be hunted down and executed.LiNeBrEaKIn this reality, money is no longer used to buy what you want or need. Instead, you pay for new cars, beautiful homes, or even children with days, months, or years off your life expectancy.LiNeBrEaKLifespan is currently in fourth place. Cronin doesn't expect it will rise any higher on the list before the contest ends on Friday.LiNeBrEaKBut the Covina native and Charter Oak High School graduate is confident it has a future. Getting into the big comic names like DC and Marvel may be tough, but he might find a home with an independent publisher, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There are a lot of people who say they want to do it, but don't actually follow their dream and get out there and do it ... so I am hoping my chances are pretty good," he said.LiNeBrEaKSo how many years of his life would Cronin be willing to pay for comic book success?LiNeBrEaK"That's a really tough question," he said.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   FINAL Edition	State's plan to slow down warming now in fast lane;  Obama telling EPA to act quickly on California's request 	Zachary Coile and Robert Selna, Chronicle Staff Writers  	Main News; Pg. A1  	904 words  	 President Obama, in his first major environmental act since taking office, will order the Environmental Protection Agency today to move swiftly on a request by California and other states to set the nation's toughest vehicle emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKObama plans to make the announcement at a White House ceremony, according to congressional sources briefed on the plan. The move signals a sharp break with the Bush administration, which rejected California's request to enforce its rules limiting greenhouse gases from cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaKWhile Obama's order only requires the EPA to reconsider California's request, all sides expect the agency will approve it. His new EPA administrator, Lisa Jackson, must finish a formal review before making the decision, but environmentalists were already cheering the likely outcome. LiNeBrEaK"These are monumental decisions that will have an immediate impact in reducing global warming pollution in the United States," said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Just days into office, President Obama is showing America and the world that he will lead our country in a bold new direction to protect the environment and fight global warming."LiNeBrEaKObama's presidential directive could ultimately transform the entire U.S. auto fleet. If the EPA approves California's request for a waiver to enforce its rules, any state can opt for either the federal or the state's emissions standards. Thirteen states have adopted California's rules, covering about half the nation's population, and a half-dozen more, including Florida, are considering doing so. Automakers probably would be forced to sell more fuel efficient cars and trucks in every showroom nationwide.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Sen. Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has lobbied Obama to approve the state's request, called his expected announcement "more than welcome news."LiNeBrEaK"An immediate EPA review of the waiver decision shows respect for California and the 18 other states ... who are waiting for the green light to address global warming pollution from motor vehicles," Boxer said. "When the waiver is signed, it will be a signal to Detroit that a huge market awaits them if they do the right thing and produce the cleanest, most efficient vehicles possible."LiNeBrEaKThe auto industry opposes California's rules and has fought a long-running legal battle to block the standards. Automakers have warned of the perils of creating a patchwork of vehicle emissions rules and have lobbied Congress instead for a single national standard.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's rules would require vehicles to reduce their greenhouse gases by 30 percent by 2016. The transportation sector is the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, at about 38 percent of total emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe state's regulations are much more stringent than even the higher fuel economy standards passed by Congress and signed by Bush in 2007, which requires vehicles to reach an average fuel economy of 31. 5 miles per gallon by 2015. The state's rules require automakers to meet a fleetwide average of 36 miles per gallon by 2016. LiNeBrEaKObama's directive is also expected to force the Transportation Department to complete interim fuel economy standards to implement the 2007 law, which the Bush administration chose not to do. The goal is to speed the shift to more efficient vehicles, and the new rules would be issued by March so automakers would have time to update their fleet for the 2011 model year.LiNeBrEaKThe East Room announcement is expected to be attended by Jackson, top EPA and Transportation Department officials and environmentalists, among others, Capitol Hill sources said.LiNeBrEaKObama's decision is a victory for California leaders, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols, who wrote letters last week urging the president to take action. Schwarzenegger's spokesman, Aaron McLear, said Sunday night that the governor was "withholding comment until the president has something to say."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's landmark law limiting greenhouse gas emissions was written by former Assemblywoman Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills Los Angeles County and passed by the Legislature and signed by then-Gov. Gray Davis in 2002. It was supposed to go into effect starting in the 2009 model year. One thorny issue the EPA may decide is in which model year California's rules would now take effect to give automakers enough time to transition.LiNeBrEaKSenate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, who was in the Assembly when the law was passed, said Obama's announcement "represents the beginning of a very different and much more positive relationship between California and the federal government."LiNeBrEaK"California did not get a whole lot of attention in the past eight years," Steinberg said. "This is an important signal that things will be different."LiNeBrEaKDerek Walker, director of the California Climate Initiative for the Environmental Defense Fund, said Obama's move also suggests that the new president rejected the automakers' assertions that California's rules would hurt the industry and the economy.LiNeBrEaK"This is a tremendous out-of-the-gate move by the new president and shows that he is taking a fresh look at environmental and energy policy from the perspective of sound science," Walker said. "It also shows that he understands the strong nexus between economic stimulus and environmental protection."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   FINAL Edition	Golden State sets green example;  Energy efficiency found to boost economy 	David R. Baker, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1015 words  	If President Obama is serious about creating a green economy, he should look to California. LiNeBrEaKA new report shows that, since the 1970s when the state government first started requiring more energy-efficient buildings and appliances, California has grown more prosperous and added jobs even as its citizens cut the amount of energy they use and the greenhouse gases they produce. Despite the current economic crisis, which finds the state in a budget and job quandary, the findings should provide ammunition to those who want Obama to launch a green revolution, encouraging renewable power and energy efficiency as a way of generating jobs during the recession.LiNeBrEaKThe 2009 California Green Innovation Index conducted by the public policy group Next 10 tracks how the state's economy has grown over the past three decades. Cutting energy bills let California consumers and companies spend their cash on other things, and helped create 1. 5 million jobs, according to the report. LiNeBrEaK"If California had not moved as forcefully to decrease energy consumption over the last three decades, we would be in a much more precarious economic position right now," said F. Noel Perry, venture capitalist and founder of Next 10. "Imagine where the country could be if it were as efficient as California."LiNeBrEaKAssessing green economyLiNeBrEaKThe index also examines the current state of California's green economy, adding up the amount of venture capital flowing into clean-tech companies and the number of patents they have received. The researchers, from the Collaborative Economics consulting firm, also counted jobs at green companies throughout California and found that they employ about 105,000 people.LiNeBrEaKThe index, the second in what Next 10 plans to be an annual series, has its limitations. For example, to get a thorough count of green jobs, researchers had to use data from January 2007. Their total doesn't include the rapid growth of green-tech companies for most of the last two years, nor does it reflect the layoffs of recent months.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the index illustrates just how difficult the fight against global warming will be. LiNeBrEaKCalifornia now produces 10 percent less greenhouse gas emissions per person than in 1990, according to the report. But the state's overall emissions continue to rise along with the size of the population. Total emissions rose 4 percent between 2003 and 2006. LiNeBrEaK"The fact that per capita emissions have gone down by 10 percent in California is a pretty remarkable achievement," said Cliff Chen, senior energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. "The flipside is that California has also been one of the fastest growing states since 1990, so it's not surprising that total emissions increased." LiNeBrEaKChen, who did not work on the index, also noted that California's landmark law limiting greenhouse gas emissions won't take effect until 2012. "The real work of reducing emissions in California is just beginning," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Innovation Index includes a grab-bag of economic data, from how many hybrids Californians drive to the state's growing use of solar power. Among the details:LiNeBrEaK-- From 2005 to 2007, jobs at green companies grew by 10 percent, while the state economy's overall number of jobs grew 1 percent. Green companies include those developing renewable power, new fuels or ways to use existing resources more efficiently.LiNeBrEaK-- While Californians were cutting their individual energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, the state's economy grew. Gross domestic product, per capita, rose 28 percent from 1990 to 2006.LiNeBrEaK-- California leads the nation in registering patents for green technologies and materials. The state also rakes in the most venture capital for green startup companies, reaching a record $3. 3 billion in 2008. LiNeBrEaK-- California's economy uses energy far more efficiently than the rest of the country. The amount of gross domestic product California generates for every unit of energy used is 68 percent higher than in the rest of the nation. In part, that's a reflection of the state's high concentration of high-tech businesses and relative scarcity of factories.LiNeBrEaKThe report's authors say California's experience shows the potential of a green economy - to a point.LiNeBrEaKCan't offset recessionLiNeBrEaKThey caution that the number of jobs generated by green companies is still small, on par with the biotech industry. It probably won't make up for the hundreds of thousands of jobs disappearing across the country as the recession deepens.LiNeBrEaK"We don't want to argue that green job growth is going to save us from this recession," Perry said. "The growth year over year will be substantial, but it's not going to save us."LiNeBrEaKEconomists not connected with the index agree. LiNeBrEaKStephen Levy with the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy said improving energy efficiency will help the national economy in the long run. But many of the jobs created by the switch to a green economy could prove to be short-lived. LiNeBrEaK"There are all of these one-time things," he said. "You build out the electrical grid. You retrofit buildings. ... You may get some short-term benefit while you're pursuing a long-term benefit."LiNeBrEaKOthers say that the green industry's growth could stall now that energy prices are low again. Americans worried about their personal finances might not be willing to shell out extra money for a fuel-sipping hybrid car or solar panels on their homes.LiNeBrEaK"When gas is $2 a gallon, you can preach efficiency, but it's tough," said Stanford economist John Shoven. "If the Obama administration in particular doesn't really push green infrastructure projects, the momentum is going to slow."LiNeBrEaKPerry says, however, that the long-term benefits of energy efficiency and green jobs can be substantial. He points to the estimate that California's efficiency policies in the last 30 years helped create 1. 5 million jobs, an estimate produced last year by UC Berkeley economist David Roland-Holst.LiNeBrEaK"There we're talking about a significant number of jobs that can really make a difference," Perry said.LiNeBrEaKOnline resources LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKTo read the 2009 California Green Innovation Index, go to www.next10.org 	ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (92%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (90%); JOB CREATION (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); RESEARCH (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (78%); RECESSION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); CONSUMPTION (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); POPULATION SIZE (77%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); LAYOFFS (76%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (72%); CAPITAL MOVEMENTS (71%); PATENTS (69%); VENTURE CAPITAL (66%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (78%); US PRESIDENTS (78%) BUSINESS; ECONOMY; CA; ENVIRONMENT; GLOBAL WARMING; ENERGY  			CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%) USA CALIFORNIA  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (74%)  		Solar installers Frank Teague left and Delmar Oliveira of Akeena Solar work in Oakland.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Obama pushing stronger fuel-efficiency standard  	By Ben Feller The Associated Press  	NEWS; National; World; Local  	477 words  	WASHINGTON &raquo; President Barack Obama ordered the government Monday to re-examine whether California and other states should be allowed to have tougher auto emission standards, a clean break from Bush administration policy. LiNeBrEaKJumping into the seemingly never-ending national energy debate, Obama also directed his administration to get moving on new fuel-efficiency guidelines for the auto industry in time to cover 2011 model-year cars.LiNeBrEaK"For the sake of our security, our economy and our planet, we must have the courage and commitment to change," Obama said in his first formal event in the ornate East Room of the White House.LiNeBrEaK"It will be the policy of my administration," he said, "to reverse our dependence on foreign oil while building a new energy economy that will create millions of jobs."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia and at least a dozen other states have tried to come up with tougher emission standards than those imposed by the federal government, but Obama said that "Washington stood in their way." The president wants the Environmental Protection Agency to take a second look at a decision denying California -- and the other states that want to follow its model -- permission to set its own tailpipe emission standards.LiNeBrEaKMore broadly, Obama sought to show he was not waiting to put his stamp on energy policy, which has both near-term implications on the sagging economy and long-range effects on pollution, climate change and national security.LiNeBrEaK"Year after year, decade after decade, we've chosen delay over decisive action," Obama said. "Rigid ideology has overruled sound science. Special interests have overshadowed common sense. Rhetoric has not led to the hard work needed to achieve results -- and our leaders raise their voices each time there's a spike on gas prices, only to grow quiet when the price falls at the pump."LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Act gives California special authority to regulate vehicle pollution because the state began regulating such pollution before the federal government got into the act. But a federal waiver is still required; if the waiver is granted, other states can choose to adopt California's standards or the federal ones.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007 the Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency denied California's waiver request, gaining praise from the auto industry but touching off a storm of investigations and lawsuits from Democrats and environmental groups who contended the denial was based on political instead of scientific reasons.LiNeBrEaKObama on Monday directed the EPA to re-examine the decision. That does not yet overturn anything. But still, the states' wanting their own power considered it a victory.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against, states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said. He added: "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Obama embraces California vehicle emissions efforts  	By Frank Davies Mercury News Washington Bureau  	BREAKING; Politics; News; National; State; Local; Business  	981 words  	WASHINGTON   President Barack Obama declared Monday that California's pioneering vehicle emissions controls, blocked for years by the Bush administration, will help launch a national effort to tackle global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We will make it clear to the world that America is ready to lead," Obama said at an elaborate East Room ceremony attended by industry leaders and advocacy groups.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state officials praised Obama's decision to order a swift review of the state's request for a waiver under the Clean Air Act, allowing California to enforce strict limits on tailpipe emissions. At least 14 other states have adopted the California standard, with four more in the process, representing about half the nation's population. LiNeBrEaKPolitical leaders on all sides expect the review by the Environmental Protection Agency will lead to approval of the California standard soon.LiNeBrEaKWith both words and pageantry, Obama made Monday's announcement the most significant declaration on global warming ever delivered by an American president. He promised new spending on green initiatives and tighter nationwide fuel-efficiency standards, and hinted he will move ahead soon with broad limits on greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Now California finally has a partner and ally in the White House," Schwarzenegger said at a Sacramento news conference. "Promises were made by President Obama, and promises were kept."LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Environment Committee, said she expects EPA approval "in a matter of weeks" because "every scientist and legal expert at EPA already recommended approval" before Administrator Stephen Johnson turned down the state.LiNeBrEaKMary Nichols, who will enforce the standard as chair of the California Air Resources Board, said final approval would come by May at the latest.LiNeBrEaKNichols also said the targets for emissions reductions are still realistic despite the delays and earlier EPA rejection: a 22 percent drop by 2012, and a 30 percent drop by 2016. She said automakers should have "no major difficulty" in reaching efficiency goals through 2013, based on their own reports to Congress on producing more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers had a muted reaction to Obama's decision, reflecting their precarious position as an industry now dependent on huge federal loans. Dave McCurdy, chief executive of the Auto Alliance of 11 manufacturers, said the industry was "ready to work with the administration on developing a national approach" to fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKSome auto dealers, citing the closing of about 900 dealerships last year, reacted negatively. "If we have 13 states for which separate cars and trucks need to be made, a lot more dealerships are likely to close in those states," said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.LiNeBrEaKObama on Monday also directed the Transportation Department to come up with guidelines by March on steps to reach an average fuel efficiency of 35 mpg for all passenger vehicles by 2020, if not sooner, to comply with a 2007 law.LiNeBrEaKObama also went beyond his two decisions to signal a more ambitious campaign to limit carbon emissions and move toward energy independence. He touted the spending on energy efficiency and renewable energy in his $825 billion economic recovery plan and said he embraces a major U.S. role in reducing global emissions.LiNeBrEaKBy taking national action against global warming, Obama said, "we will ensure that nations like China and India are doing their part, just as we are now willing to do ours."LiNeBrEaKNichols and some environmental leaders said that was a clear indication that Obama plans to push for mandatory limits on carbon emissions from all sources this year.LiNeBrEaK"He was not just talking about taking care of a campaign promise or reversing a bad policy, but that was a positive signal that he wants to do more on global warming, including cap and trade (legislation) this year," Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKBoxer, a California Democrat, said she will announce basic principles later this week for a bill that would set caps on emissions and allow industries that get under those caps to trade and sell emissions credits.LiNeBrEaKHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, said last week that she wants the House to pass a cap-and-trade bill this year.LiNeBrEaKThe new administration could have announced Monday's decisions with little fanfare, but Obama chose a high-profile event, surrounded by Wal-Mart executives, energy experts and environmentalists, to frame the policy change as the first step in an aggressive effort to reduce energy dependence and tackle climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe historic shift was not lost on Attorney General Jerry Brown, who had sued the EPA to get its decision reversed: "Today's dramatic announcement marks the first time that an American president has taken decisive action to deal with global warming."LiNeBrEaKMercury News Staff Writer Matt Nauman contributed to this report.LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKUnder the Clean Air Act, California has special authority as a longtime leader on air quality issues to set standards for auto emissions stricter than federal rules " if it gets a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency. In dozens of cases, California has never been turned down for such a waiver " until the current waiver, sought in 2005, was rejected in 2007. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKCalifornia"s emissions standards for vehicles are favored by environmentalists because they set direct controls on greenhouse gases that pollute the air and contribute to global warming. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKCalifornia"s standards are opposed by automakers because they say it would cost them billions of dollars to produce cars that meet the requirements. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAs automakers pass on increased costs to consumers, the cost of vehicles could rise by thousands of dollars, although the increased fuel economy could save a driver $1,000 to $2,000 over the life of the car.

He added: "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over. My administration will not deny facts; we will be guided by them."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's proposed restrictions would force automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKAt least 13 other states - Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington - have already adopted California's standards, and they have been under consideration elsewhere, too.LiNeBrEaKUnder California's approach, car makers would need to boost fuel efficiency in new vehicles to about 36. 8 miles per gallon in the states that chose to adopt the California standards.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers, which sued to block the state regulations, argued that it could require dealerships in some states to limit sales of large trucks in order to meet the standards. They have pushed for a single national standard.LiNeBrEaKRequiring automakers to build cars that get more miles to the gallon will reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the tailpipes of vehicles.LiNeBrEaKA law passed by Congress in 2007 requires that by 2020, new cars and trucks meet a standard of 35 miles per gallon, a 40 percent increase over the status quo. But the Bush administration did not set regulations in support of that law.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Obama ordered new guidelines in place to start affecting cars sold in 2011.LiNeBrEaKHe also promised a broader, bipartisan review with the auto industry.LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials have also said they would face billions of dollars in new costs to meet the rules at a time when General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC have received billions in federal loans to stay afloat.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration estimated the federal fuel economy rules would cost the industry more than $100 billion to implement the changes by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"Let me be clear: Our goal is not to further burden an already struggling industry," Obama said. "It is to help America's automakers prepare for the future."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday will appoint a special envoy for climate change as the Obama administration moves to restore America's credentials in environmental policy, said U.S. officials familiar with her decision.

LiNeBrEaKAnd already those ideas are coming to life.LiNeBrEaKCronin's comic Lifespan is competing in an online contest by DC Comic's Zuda.com for the chance to be published. If it gets the most votes, it will be put to print.LiNeBrEaKThe story is unique. Lifespan creates a alternate reality in which global leaders have responded to over population, a collapsing economy and global warming by setting everyone's lifespan at 77. 5 years. At that age, you must surrender your life, or be hunted down and executed.LiNeBrEaKIn this reality, money is no longer used to buy what you want or need. Instead, you pay for new cars, beautiful homes, or even children with days, months, or years off your life expectancy.LiNeBrEaKLifespan is currently in fourth place. Cronin doesn't expect it will rise any higher on the list before the contest ends on Friday.LiNeBrEaKBut the Covina native and Charter Oak High School graduate is confident it has a future. Getting into the big comic names like DC and Marvel may be tough, but he might find a home with an independent publisher, he said.LiNeBrEaK"There are a lot of people who say they want to do it, but don't actually follow their dream and get out there and do it ... so I am hoping my chances are pretty good," he said.LiNeBrEaKSo how many years of his life would Cronin be willing to pay for comic book success?LiNeBrEaK"That's a really tough question," he said.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   SECOND EDITION	'Carbon credits' program draws fire There is no reduction in carbon in the air if projects would have been built anyway.  	By Joe McDonald and Charles J. Hanley The Associated Press  	NEWS; Pg. A11  	622 words  	XIAOXI, China - The hydroelectric dam, a low wall of concrete slicing across an old farming valley, is supposed to help a power company in distant Germany contribute to saving the climate - while putting lucrative "carbon credits" into the pockets of Chinese developers.LiNeBrEaKBut in the end, the new Xiaoxi dam may do nothing to lower global-warming emissions as advertised. And many of the 7,500 people displaced by the project still seethe over losing their homes and farmland. LiNeBrEaK"Nobody asked if we wanted to move," said a 38-year-old man whose family lost a small brick house. "The government just posted a notice that said, 'Your home will be demolished.'"LiNeBrEaKThe dam will shortchange German consumers, Chinese villagers and the climate itself, if critics are right. And Xiaoxi is not alone.LiNeBrEaKSimilar stories are repeated across China and elsewhere around the world, as hundreds of hydro projects line up for carbon credits, at a potential cost of billions to Europeans, Japanese and soon perhaps Americans, in a trading system a new U.S. government review concludes has "uncertain effects" on greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKOne American expert is more blunt.LiNeBrEaK"The CDM" - the 4-year-old, U.N.-managed Clean Development Mechanism - "is an excessive subsidy that represents a massive waste of developed world resources," says Stanford University's Michael Wara.LiNeBrEaKForced relocations have become common in China as people in hundreds of communities are moved to clear land for factories and other projects, provoking anger and occasionally violent protests. But what happened here is unusual in highlighting not just the human costs, but also the awkward fit between China's authoritarian system, in which complaints of official abuse abound, and Western environmental ideals.LiNeBrEaKThose ideals produced the Clean Development Mechanism as a market-based tool under the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement to combat climate change. The CDM allows industrial nations, required by Kyoto to reduce emissions of gases blamed for global warming, to comply by paying developing nations to cut their emissions instead.LiNeBrEaKCompanies thousands of miles away, such as Germany's coal-burning, carbon dioxide-spewing RWE electric utility, accomplish this by buying carbon credits the U.N. issues to clean-energy projects like Xiaoxi's. The proceeds are meant to make such projects more financially feasible.LiNeBrEaKAs critics point out, however, if those projects were going to be built anyway, the climate doesn't gain, but loses.LiNeBrEaKSuch projects "may allow covered entities" - such as RWE - "to increase their emissions without a corresponding reduction in a developing country," the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) said in its December review.LiNeBrEaKThe system's defenders call it essential for hard-pressed industrialized nations to meet their Kyoto quotas, and say the CDM's standards are being tightened.LiNeBrEaK"It's not as if we're printing money in a garage," Yvo de Boer, U.N. climate chief, said of the credits. "Lots of legitimate questions are being asked," he acknowledged, but, "That's why I'm happy we have a transparent process."LiNeBrEaKThat transparency - online project documents and a U.N. database - allowed the AP to analyze in detail this exploding market, which attracts projects ranging from small solar-power efforts in Africa, to emissions controls on giant chemical plants in India and China.LiNeBrEaKThe AP has found that hydroelectric projects, whose climate impact is most widely questioned, have quickly become the No. 1 technology in the CDM, and China in particular is rushing in to capitalize.LiNeBrEaKThe Chinese now have at least 763 hydro projects in the CDM approval pipeline and are adding an average of 25 a month. By 2012, credits for those projects alone could be worth $4 billion.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Letting states set 'green' rules  		NEWS; Pg. 004  	277 words  	President Obama is poised to let California and other states set their own auto emission standards in their drive to slash greenhouse gases, an official familiar with the decision said yesterday. LiNeBrEaKThe move is significant on two fronts: It could empower states to set tougher standards in targeting emissions, which are blamed for contributing to global climate change; and it would be another swift reversal by Obama of Bush administration policy, this time on energy.LiNeBrEaKPlunging into his first full week as president, Obama is expected to reveal the auto-emissions policy this morning in the East Room of the White House. The official familiar with the details spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan had not yet been announced.LiNeBrEaKObama also is expected to direct the Transportation Department to get moving on rules for automakers to improve fuel economy. A 2007 law requires that by 2020, new cars and trucks meet 35 miles per gallon, a 40 percent increase over current standards. The Bush administration ended its tenure before putting the new fuel-economy rules in place.LiNeBrEaKOn tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks, California and at least 13 other states have sought permission to enact tough standards by getting waivers under the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's Environmental Protection Agency denied that permission, arguing that it was more effective to have a national strategy in curbing greenhouse gases. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has lobbied Obama to step in and reverse the decision.LiNeBrEaKToday Obama will order the EPA to reconsider the California decision, a process that could take time but is expected to end up in the states' favor.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 		January 26, 2009 Monday 	Pollution agency veteran Eger to become chief  	By Dennis Lien dlien@pioneerpress.com  	POLITICS; Legislature; Minnesota-Twin Cities  	253 words  	Gov. Tim Pawlenty on Monday appointed Paul Eger as commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.LiNeBrEaKEger, 35, replaces Brad Moore, who left the agency last fall to take a job in the private sector. LiNeBrEaKSince 2002, Eger has held several positions at the MPCA, including assistant commissioner for water policy and clean water policy manager. Most recently, he managed the agency's internal operations as deputy commissioner.LiNeBrEaKBefore joining the MPCA in 2002 as its legislative liaison, Eger was a committee administrator for the late state Sen. Sam Solon, of Duluth. He also served as the legislative assistant to state Sen. Jim Metzen, DFL-South St. Paul.LiNeBrEaKAn Eagan resident, Eger is a graduate of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., and has a master's degree in public administration from Hamline University.LiNeBrEaKIn a recent note to staff, Eger signaled changes at the MPCA because of the state's budget problems.LiNeBrEaK"We need to examine the work we do and how we do it, and plan for a sustainable, smaller agency that attends to our highest priorities,'' Eger said.LiNeBrEaKPaul Aasen, advocacy director for the St. Paul-based Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said Eger faces two key challenges: trying to integrate climate change implications into all the MPCA does and making sure money it will receive through a recently passed constitutional amendment is spent appropriately.LiNeBrEaKThe MPCA monitors environmental quality and enforces environmental regulations in the state.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 		January 26, 2009 Monday   Metro Edition	Save your money, body and planet;  These healthful, helpful tips hit that trifecta. 	SARAH MORAN  	VARIETY; Pg. 1E  	892 words  	Special to the Star TribuneLiNeBrEaKAny chance you're looking to save a little cash, improve your health or protect the Earth this year? Many simple, everyday habits achieve all three at once. So give your wallet, body and planet a boost by following the tips below, courtesy of the pros at the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, the University of Minnesota School of Public Health and Mississippi Market Co-op in St. Paul.LiNeBrEaKBuy food locally. Local food doesn't need to be shipped far, which reduces refrigeration and transportation pollution and the likelihood of contamination. Shipping from afar takes longer, meaning nutrients may degrade, whereas fresh, local foods may provide more beneficial vitamins and minerals. Because there are fewer transportation costs, local food -- especially from farmers' markets or community supported agriculture (CSAs) -- is often cheaper. See www.landstewardshipproject.org/csa.html. LiNeBrEaKGrow your own food. Even if you live in an apartment, grow a few pots of tomatoes, lettuce or herbs. You control how it's grown, get the freshest stuff possible and save money.LiNeBrEaKBuy bulk and go back to basics. A cup and a half of canned organic black beans costs $1. 79, but the equivalent amount of organic, locally grown black beans in bulk at Mississippi Market is only 42 cents. Bulk foods use much less wasteful packaging. Focus on healthful, fiber-filled, cheap options such as dried beans, peas, oatmeal and whole grains.LiNeBrEaKCut back on meat, especially red meat. Cattle consume resources and emit methane gas, a likely contributor to climate change. (One hundred percent grass-fed meat, however, is usually much less damaging to the environment and is also more healthful.) Reduce or replace red meat with poultry or fish, or other sources of protein such as beans and eggs. Incorporate meat into a dish by adding it to stew, instead of letting this expensive item take center stage. Eat more vegetarian meals (think bean burrito instead of beef burrito) and more international meals, which are usually less meat-centered.LiNeBrEaKCook at home. Fast food involves potentially harmful ingredients, additives and cooking methods, plus wasteful packaging. Spend the weekend cooking big batches (saves energy and time) of soup or casserole, and then freeze the food in portion-sized glass containers for later use.LiNeBrEaKIn winter, eat canned and frozen produce. There's not a lot of fresh local produce around in winter. But cheaper canned or frozen foods usually have higher nutrient contents because they must be canned or processed within 24 hours of being picked. Compare that to the broccoli that was trucked from California and is two weeks old by the time you eat it.LiNeBrEaKRethink cleaning and hygiene products. Check out Minneapolis-based Restore Products, made from renewable, plant-based and biodegradable ingredients. They don't have hazardous chemicals or ingredients that may be carcinogenic, so you don't have to worry about safety, irritation or toxins harming your home or body. After buying laundry detergent, dish soap, gentle soap or other products, refill the original container at area co-ops or Whole Foods, which have Restore refill stations. See www.restoreproducts.comLiNeBrEaKShop with your own reusable bags for discounts. Mississippi Market customers get a 5-cent credit for each grocery bag they reuse and a 10-cent credit for each egg carton they reuse when buying bulk eggs.LiNeBrEaKAvoid plastic. Plastic is harsh on the Earth and usually doesn't degrade. If you're hosting a party, use real dishes and washable, cloth napkins. Bring your own silverware to work, and pack lunches in glass containers. Instead of throwing away money buying disposable bottled water, invest in a glass, stainless-steel or aluminum water bottle, such as those made by Sigg and Klean Kanteen. If you drink and eat from these materials you won't have to worry about the potential health consequences of bisphenol-A (BPA) and other chemicals found in some plastics.LiNeBrEaKRecycle and compost. Recycle, because making products from virgin materials creates more pollution and requires more energy and water than remaking existing products. You can easily set up a compost in your back yard for everything from grass trimmings to vegetable peels to coffee grounds, or call your city to see which trash haulers pick up composting. Composting improves your soil, reduces the need for fertilizer and water and cuts back on landfill waste. Recycling and composting significantly decrease trash pickup needs, which can slash your trash bill. See www.reduce.org/compost or www.greenguardian.org.LiNeBrEaKPlow less, mow less, water less. Instead of plowing, grab a shovel and get some exercise. You'll save on gas and reduce air pollution. Use a push mower in the summer or just mow less often to cut gas use and air pollution (and give neighbors a little more peace and quiet). Mowing less also means grass may do better with less water in the summer, saving the resource and expense.LiNeBrEaKWalk and bike. Use leg power to get library books or return movies. This built-in exercise saves gas money and reduces air pollution.LiNeBrEaKCut power. Switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs, turn off lights, open windows instead of running air conditioning, buy Energy Star products and keep appliances on a power strip that's turned off when not in use.LiNeBrEaKSarah Moran is a freelance health writer in Minneapolis.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	661 words  	Jan. 26--Instead of driving a glossy new luxury vehicle, when the president of Keystone College wants to make an impression, he takes out the school's used 1996 Toyota RAV-4.LiNeBrEaKDonated by a former student and current trustee, it has no spark plugs or pistons, its engine is almost silent, and it plugs into a wall socket.LiNeBrEaKIt's not greased lightning; it's electric. LiNeBrEaKRescued from the crusher, this car has a storied past, one that highlights how much things have changed in the past few years.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia and Hawaii have established aggressive electric car agendas, General Motors plans to begin manufacturing the electric Chevy Volt in 2010, and President Barack Obama has announced a plan to get 1 million electric vehicles onto American roadways by 2015.LiNeBrEaKIn Lackawanna County, the commissioners plan to buy at least four hybrid electric vehicles in the near future, Commissioner Mike Washo said, although he was not ready to release specifics.LiNeBrEaKWith four electric vehicles in its fleet, Keystone College is ahead of the curve. In addition to its RAV-4 -- donated by Scranton native and former Bell Laboratories researcher David Turock -- the college purchased three vans from a California manufacturer for its campus maintenance fleet.LiNeBrEaKPresident Edward Boehm said Keystone's interest in the technology stems from a larger mission to teach students environmental stewardship. Among other measures, the school is researching the potential for generating its own electricity by installing a wind turbine.LiNeBrEaKMr. Turock said his interest in the technology grew when he met many of the people behind the 2006 documentary "Who Killed the Electric Car?"LiNeBrEaKThe film recounts how the car narrowly missed being taken off the road forever by the very company that made it.LiNeBrEaKMr. Turock became so passionate about the electric car's possibilities he joined them in a nonprofit venture, Plug-In America, whose objective is "to educate as many people as possible that this is indeed a viable form of transportation," he said.LiNeBrEaKMore widespread use could help release America from dependence on foreign oil, Mr. Turock said.LiNeBrEaK"It also has the potential to address global warming and climate change, and pollution," he said. "I look for technology that has a beneficial impact to society. I can't think of another that's more apropos for these times."LiNeBrEaKMr. Turock drives an electric car on his commute to work each day and recharges it each night.LiNeBrEaKDespite its benefits, people are sometimes hesitant about driving an electric car, until they try it, he said.LiNeBrEaK"They see that, 'Gee, it has real pickup. It doesn't drive like a golf cart.' ... The only thing it doesn't have is an engine that burns gasoline and pollutes," Mr. Turock said.LiNeBrEaKContact the writer: ssolie@timesshamrock.comAutomotive alternativesLiNeBrEaK&acirc;- &acirc;[#x20ac][#x201a]Keystone's Toyota RAV-4-EV has a nickel metal hydride battery that stores 23 kilowatts of energy.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	368 words  	Jan. 26--Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama took the first step today toward allowing Washington and 13 other states to implement tough, new auto tailpipe emission standards, fulfilling a campaign pledge and reversing a controversial Bush administration decision made over the advice of federal scientists and lawyers. LiNeBrEaKMore than half of Washington state's air pollution comes from motor vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThe new standards require a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaKThe standards were first adopted by California, but required a waiver to the Clean Air Act. Washington and the other states piggy-backed on the California standards.LiNeBrEaKBut in 2007 the Environmental Protection Agency refused to grant the waiver, arguing it would result in a patchwork of state regulations and national fuel-efficiency standards would be more effective. The EPA had never before rejected similar waiver requests.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA position echoed that of the auto industry, which said if the waiver was granted it would have to start producing two different types of cars -- one to satisfy the stricter requirements of the 14 states and the other for the remaining states.LiNeBrEaKToday, Obama ordered the EPA to review the rejection of the waiver -- a move expected to eventually clear the way for states to set their own emissions standards.LiNeBrEaK"The federal government must work with, not against the states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Obama said, less than a week after taking office. "The days of Washington dragging its heels are over.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 26, 2009 Monday 	Inhofe calls expected Obama move 'environmental thuggery'  	Jim Myers, Tulsa World, Okla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	348 words  	Jan. 26--WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe on Monday described as "environmental thuggery" an expected announcement by President Obama to move toward allowing California and other states to regulate their own tailpipe emissions for vehicles. LiNeBrEaKThe Oklahoma Republican warned such a "patchwork" approach would cost jobs in the beleaguered auto industry.LiNeBrEaKAs the top Republican of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, Inhofe continues to take a leading role on such environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKHe believes that such a move on vehicle emission by the Obama administration on emissions would not only cost jobs but take a step in the opposite direction of the president's focus of improving the economy.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the current chairman of the Senate committee, welcomed such a move by Obama.LiNeBrEaK"Reports of President Obama's decision to revisit the outrageous denial of the California waiver by the Bush Administration are more than welcome news," Boxer said.LiNeBrEaKShe said an immediate review by the Environmental Protection Agency of the waiver decision shows respect for her state and the others, which represent more than half of the nation's population who are waiting for a green light to address global warming pollution from motor vehicles.LiNeBrEaK"As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I will be working with the new EPA administrator to ensure that the California waiver moves forward as fast as possible," she said.LiNeBrEaK"When the waiver is signed, it willLiNeBrEaKbe a signal to Detroit that a huge market awaits them if they do the right thing and produce the cleanest, most efficient vehicles possible."LiNeBrEaKObama is expected to make his announcement later this morning.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		January 26, 2009 Monday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Obama to allow states to set strict car emissions standards  	JOHN M. BRODER  	FRONT; Pg. A1  	815 words  	By John M. Broder and Peter BakerLiNeBrEaKThe New York TimesLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama will direct federal regulators today to move swiftly on an application by California and 13 other states to set strict automobile emissions and fuel efficiency standards, two administration officials said Sunday evening.LiNeBrEaKThe directive makes good on an Obama campaign pledge and signifies a sharp reversal of Bush administration policy. Granting California and the other states the right to regulate tailpipe emissions would be one of the most emphatic actions Obama could take to quickly put his stamp on environmental policy. LiNeBrEaKObama stopped short of ordering the agencies to reverse the Bush administration policy, but they are widely expected to do so.LiNeBrEaKA utomobile manufacturers, on a faster phase-in schedule, will have to retool to begin producing and selling cars and trucks that get higher mileage than the national standard . The auto companies have lobbied hard against the regulations and challenged them in court.LiNeBrEaKBeyond acting on the California emissions law, officials said, Obama will announce that he is moving forward with nationwide regulations requiring the automobile industry to increase fuel efficiency standards to comply with a 2007 law - rules that the Bush administration decided at the last minute not to issue.LiNeBrEaKHe will also order federal departments and agencies to find new ways to save energy and be more environmentally friendly.LiNeBrEaKT he centerpiece of today's anticipated announcement is Obama's directive to the Environmental Protection Agency to begin work immediately on granting California a waiver, under the Clean Air Act, which allows the state, a longtime leader in air quality matters, to set standards for automobile emissions stricter than the national rules.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has already won numerous waivers for controls on emissions that cause smog, as opposed to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration denied the waiver in late 2007, saying that recently enacted federal mileage rules made the action unnecessary and that allowing California and the 13 other states the right to set their own pollution rules would result in an unenforceable patchwork of environmental law.LiNeBrEaKThe auto companies had advocated the denial, saying a waiver would require them to produce two sets of vehicles, one to meet the strict California standard and another that could be sold in the remaining states.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's environmental agency director, Stephen Johnson, echoed the auto makers' claims in denying California's application, ignoring the near-unanimous advice of agency lawyers and scientists that the waiver be granted.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican, wrote to Obama last week asking him to swiftly reconsider Bush's decision. The head of California's Air Resources Board, Mary D. Nichols, also wrote to the new director of the environmental agency, Lisa Jackson, asking for a quick reversal of the Bush policy.LiNeBrEaKJackson indicated in her confirmation hearing this month that she would "aggressively" review California's application. The environmental agency has routinely granted California such waivers dozens of times over the past 40 years.LiNeBrEaKThe California law, which was originally meant to take effect in the 2009 model year, requires automakers to cut emissions by nearly a third by 2016, four years ahead of the federal timetable. The result would be an increase in fuel efficiency in the American car and light truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon from the current average of 27.LiNeBrEaKThe emissions standards are part of an ambitious California plan to reduce emissions of the gases that are blamed for the heating of the atmosphere. Automotive emissions account for more than one-fifth of all such greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia was joined in its plea by 13 other states, including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington. Three other states have indicated they plan to adopt the California standard. Together they account for about half of the American market for cars and light trucks. Virginia was not among the states seeking a change.LiNeBrEaKCharles Territo, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the car makers would prefer a single national standard and needed time to develop new fuel-sipping models.LiNeBrEaK"Applying California standards to several different states would create a complex, confusing and very difficult situation for manufacturers," he said last week in anticipation of the Obama administration's announcement.LiNeBrEaKthe California lawLiNeBrEaKThe state will require automakers to cut emissions by nearly a third by 2016, four years ahead of the federal timetable.

The Washington Post 		January 26, 2009 Monday   Suburban Edition	Obama to Take Steps On Car Fuel Efficiency  	Juliet Eilperin and Steven Mufson; Washington Post Staff Writers  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	650 words  	President Obama plans to instruct key federal agencies today to reexamine two policies that could force automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars that yield fewer greenhouse gas emissions, according to sources who have been briefed on the announcement.LiNeBrEaKThe move, which the White House has privately trumpeted to supporters as "the first environment and energy actions taken by the president, helping our country move toward greater energy independence," could reverse two Bush-era decisions that have helped shape the nation's climate policy and its auto market. LiNeBrEaKObama will instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider whether to grant California a waiver to regulate automobile tailpipe emissions linked to global warming, sources said, and he will order the Transportation Department to issue guidelines that will ensure that the nation's auto fleet reaches an average fuel efficiency of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, if not earlier.LiNeBrEaKOn Dec. 19, 2007, then-EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson blocked the efforts of California and more than a dozen other states to limit automobiles' carbon dioxide emissions, arguing that President George W. Bush had addressed the issue by signing a law that same day raising the corporate average fuel-efficiency standard to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. But California's tailpipe emissions rules would have effectively required even greater fuel-efficiency increases, by seeking to cut vehicles' greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent between 2009 and 2016, something American automakers have resisted.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration never issued near-term guidelines for tighter fuel-efficiency standards: The Transportation Department circulated a proposal last fall that would have required auto companies to build new cars averaging as much as 31. 8 miles per gallon by 2015, compared with the current level of 27. 5 miles per gallon, but it announced less than two weeks before Bush left office that it would not issue formal guidelines.LiNeBrEaKDaniel J. Weiss, who directs climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, praised the new administration for pressing ahead with ambitious fuel economy goals.LiNeBrEaK"President Obama's actions will reduce our oil dependence by speeding the production of the gas-sipping cars of the future," Weiss said. "He understands that oil and gasoline prices will rise with our recovering economy, and more fuel-efficient cars will help families cope with higher prices. And other countries will want to buy our more-efficient vehicles."LiNeBrEaKOfficials at General Motors and Ford said they were not aware of what the announcement would be. The White House declined to discuss the president's planned energy announcement.LiNeBrEaKObama, who has consistently urged U.S. automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars, is likely to accelerate the timeline for raising the nation's corporate average fuel economy for cars and trucks. The Transportation Department guidelines must be issued by April in order to affect the 2011 auto fleet.LiNeBrEaKGranting a waiver for California to regulate tailpipe emissions would affect nearly half the U.S. auto market. Thirteen other states -- including Maryland -- and the District have already adopted California's proposal, while at least four others have pledged to do so. When the EPA rejected the waiver, Obama issued a statement saying the decision "is yet another example of how this Administration has put corporate interests ahead of the public interest. If the courts do not overturn this decision, I will after I am elected president."LiNeBrEaK"Not only is the new president a man of his word, but he's making a dramatic break with the Bush administration's climate policy," said Frank O'Donnell, who heads the advocacy group Clean Air Watch. "It's a powerful signal that science -- and the law -- will guide his administration's decisions. This should prompt cheers from California to Maine."

Arab News (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Share of alternative energies set to surge  	Arab News, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	450 words  	Jan. 25--DUBAI -- Credit Suisse research forecasts that the share of alternative energies in the worldwide energy supply is expected to grow significantly within forthcoming decades. This increase will be primarily driven by the political risk of relying on declining oil reserves and concerns about global warming, which has inspired many countries to enact renewable energy standards. As a result of increasing demand, various industries within the alternative energy sector are currently experiencing rapid double-digit growth, most noticeably the dynamic wind and solar industries. While these energies today make up a small portion of the total renewable energy market (7. 3 percent), some industry exponents expect wind and solar to contribute more than 25 percent to renewable energy by 2030. LiNeBrEaK"Alternative energy is a long-term theme. Driven by rising energy costs and regulatory mandates in many countries, it is rapidly gaining share in the global energy supply," said Miroslav Durana, head alternative energy research for Credit Suisse. "However, as these young industries quickly increase their capacity, component supply shortages and execution problems are likely. As a result, many alternative energy companies show high earnings growth but also relatively high earnings risk. Therefore, Credit Suisse recommends a diversified investment in selected stocks across all alternative energy themes or in an alternative energy index," he added.LiNeBrEaK"It is an exciting time for alternative energy with market dislocation likely and heavy competition for investment" said Jeffrey Culpepper, vice-chairman of the investment banking department in the EMEA region and head of the investment banking department for Credit Suisse in the MENA region. "We are, therefore, delighted to partner with the World Future Energy Summit and be strategically positioned when the renewable business gathers in early 2009."LiNeBrEaKBassam Yammine, co-CEO of Credit Suisse Middle East and head of investment banking and asset management for Credit Suisse in the Middle East, said: "This unique event is very important for the Middle East and its future growth. Credit Suisse's partnership with the summit underscores the bank's strong commitment both to the region and to the advancement of sustainable energy overall."

The Arizona Daily Star (Tucson)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Citizens sought to gather data on science of nature  	Tom Beal, The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	986 words  	Jan. 25--Migrating birds signal spring. A wise gardener knows when the last frost usually occurs.LiNeBrEaKWe can't help but notice when our mesquites lose their leaves in our pools or the olive blooms trigger runny noses.LiNeBrEaKConverting that folk wisdom to scientific data is the goal of the National Phenology Network, run by the U.S. Geological Survey and housed at the University of Arizona. LiNeBrEaKScientists learn a lot about our environment by studying variations over time in the budding dates of plants or the migration of animals, and they are more and more looking toward those records as indicators of climate change, said Jake Weltsin, executive director of the Phenology Network.LiNeBrEaKIt's a labor-intensive science that usually involves decades of commitment to careful observation of a single geographic area.LiNeBrEaKAt Tumamoc Hill, west of Tucson, for instance, scientists at the Desert Laboratory have kept data on the plants that grow and the animals that live or pass through there for more than 100 years.LiNeBrEaKAt Walnut Gulch, whose intermittent stream enters the San Pedro River near Fairbank, southeast of Tucson, hydrologists have meticulously measured and mapped the watershed for 52 years.LiNeBrEaKSometimes technology can help -- automated stream gauges and weather stations, satellite photos of vegetation greening up. But some things need the human touch -- and eyes and ears -- provided by armies of volunteers.LiNeBrEaKThe best data on bird migration comes from the Audubon Society's seasonal bird counts.LiNeBrEaKProject BudBurst has been gathering data on the first flowering of plants for years and is now a part of the Phenology Network.LiNeBrEaKThe expanding program of the national network wants to enlist thousands more citizen scientists to record the leafing out of trees, the blooming of flowers, the arrival of bees and butterflies, and the hibernation of animals.LiNeBrEaK"You can't build an instrument to tell you when a robin shows up or a bud bursts," said Gary Woodard, associate director of SAHRA, which stands for Sustainability of semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas.LiNeBrEaKWoodard's group is working on a redesign of the network's Web page that will make it simpler for citizen scientists to sign up. By March, they expect to complete their effort to make it easy to use.LiNeBrEaKWoodard has his own budding phenology network, Rainlog.org, which has enlisted 1,700 volunteers to record precipitation data in Arizona.LiNeBrEaKWeather watchers already had networks of weather stations and automatic gauges when Rainlog was launched in 2005, but adding the citizen volunteers allowed it to saturate the area with data collectors.LiNeBrEaKAaryn Olsson, a senior research specialist at the UA's Office of Arid Lands Studies, is working on a program that will use Rainlog's data in the battle against buffelgrass, the invasive pest that is threatening the very survival of the Sonoran Desert with annihilation by fire.LiNeBrEaKBuffelgrass is spreading faster than enlisted armies of weed whackers can dig it up, and naturalists have come to the reluctant conclusion that only herbicides will get it under control.LiNeBrEaKYou can kill it with Roundup, Olsson said, but only when it's green, and it's green only when it stays moist for a few days.LiNeBrEaKOlsson wants to match photo and eyeball observation with Rainlog data to pinpoint when and where buffelgrass is most vulnerable, and dispatch volunteers to deal with it.LiNeBrEaKWeltsin said his group's goal is to standardize the collection of citizen science and bring it all to a single database where matches between groups can be made and volunteers can easily choose projects close to home.LiNeBrEaKHe said that "taking the pulse of the planet" through phenological record-keeping has many important and immediate applications.LiNeBrEaK"What about ragweed production?" he asked. "The flower production is the phenological event. It's important to human allergies."LiNeBrEaKWith the right data, you can predict the onslaught, he said. "You can plan your outdoor events, your shipments of antihistamines."LiNeBrEaKUltimately, Weltsin hopes to enlist tens of thousands of citizen scientists to monitor both plants and animals.LiNeBrEaKThe Phenology Network announced late last year that it was adding a wildlife program to the mix, in conjunction with the Wildlife Society.LiNeBrEaK"We're trying to identify organisms that are relatively easy to identify, sensitive to climate change, broadly distributed and visible -- such as roadrunners or cactus wrens or doves," Weltsin said.LiNeBrEaKThe Phenology Network also wants to standardize programs in existence and bring in data that have been routinely collected by natural-resource managers in state and federal programs.LiNeBrEaK"The key is creating a national phenology database. That's what USGS is going to provide, working with UA to do that.LiNeBrEaK"We want to increase standards, choose the sweetest species, then bring in the public," he said.LiNeBrEaKDEFINITIONLiNeBrEaKPhenology is the study of periodic plant and animal life-cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate.LiNeBrEaKSource: National Phenology Network Web siteLiNeBrEaKHOW TO HELPLiNeBrEaKThe National Phenology Network -- at USANPN.org -- is revamping its Web site to make it easier for citizen scientists to volunteer for projects.

The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Talk about evolution!  	The Augusta Chronicle, Ga.  	COMMENTARY  	436 words  	Jan. 25--How big of a priority is global warming? Not as big as some would have you think.LiNeBrEaKThat's according to a new Pew Research Center poll, in which more than 1,500 people were asked about their top priorities for elected leaders. Remember, these people were part of an electorate that put into office Barack Obama. The New York Times' Andrew Revkin recently pointed out that our new president has mentioned stabilizing climate and preventing nuclear conflict in the same breath. LiNeBrEaKSo how did global warming fare in the Pew poll? Dead last, out of 20 priorities. The entire list, in order: the economy, jobs, terrorism, Social Security, education, energy, Medicare, health care, deficit reduction, health insurance, helping the poor, crime, moral decline, military, tax cuts, environment, immigration, lobbyists and trade policy -- then global warming.LiNeBrEaKExpect to hear more of that sentiment from the keynote speaker for the second International Conference on Climate Change March 8-10 in New York City.LiNeBrEaKCzech Republic President Vaclav Klaus, also current president of the European Union, is the author of the book Blue Planet in Green Shackles, in which he asserts that proposed global warming policies not only are unsupported by science, but that they threaten freedom and prosperity worldwide.LiNeBrEaKThat's not to say all news about our changing climate should be ignored. Remember those recent stories about how the South Pole is getting colder? Well, it is -- in parts. But a new study released in the latest edition of the journal Nature has found that Antarctica overall has gotten warmer, by eight-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit, since the 1950s. Considering that Antarctica accounts for 90 percent of the world's ice, that study suggests dire implications for the world's sea levels.LiNeBrEaKArguments continue to mount in support of both sides of the global warming debate. The sticking point is the extent to which mankind is responsible, and an increasing number of scientists agree that the plight of global warming cannot be laid solely, or even chiefly, at humans' feet.LiNeBrEaKIf there's one thing in this debate that can be agreed on, it's this: There's nothing wrong with working toward a cleaner planet.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	469 words  	Jan. 25--As President Barack Obama took the oath of office Tuesday, 12-year-old Kevin Lauderbaugh of Bemidji stood a couple of miles away, sharing the moment with crowds of people. LiNeBrEaKThe Bemidji Middle School seventh-grader traveled to the nation's capital Jan. 17 to attend the Junior Presidential Youth Inaugural Conference as a Junior Inaugural Scholar.LiNeBrEaKAs a part of the conference, he attended the presidential inauguration.LiNeBrEaK"It was fun and it was tiring," said Kevin, who returned to Bemidji Wednesday. "We were walking all over the place."LiNeBrEaKWith masses of people around him, Kevin could neither see nor hear the inauguration on the large TV screens that were set up for the crowds.LiNeBrEaK"Everybody else was taller than us," he said.LiNeBrEaKLater that day, Kevin and the other Junior Inaugural Scholars -- middle school students from across the United States -- went to an inaugural ball.LiNeBrEaK"We had lots of fun doing that," Kevin said.LiNeBrEaKThe president, he said, did not attend that particular ball.LiNeBrEaKDuring the conference, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, former Secretary of State and founder of America's Promise Alliance, and Al Gore, former vice president and Nobel Prize winner, spoke to the youth.LiNeBrEaKKevin said having Gore as a speaker was one of his highlights of the conference.LiNeBrEaK"(I) shook hands with him," Kevin said.LiNeBrEaKHe said Gore spoke about global warming and its effect on the earth. He also said Gore spoke about a push to get the United States to move more toward wind and solar power.LiNeBrEaKFilmmaker, mountaineer and author Erik Weihenmayer also spoke to the youth. Weihenmayer wrote the book "Touch the Top of the World: A Blind Man's Journey to Climb Farther than the Eye Can See."LiNeBrEaKThe conference also featured a private film screening of "The Third Monday in October" and discussion with the film's directors and stars.LiNeBrEaKKevin said visiting the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum was another highlight of the conference. While in Washington, D.C., he also saw the Washington Monument and the U.S. Capitol.LiNeBrEaK"We saw lots of people," he added.LiNeBrEaKKevin traveled to Washington in the summer of 2007 to attend the Junior National Young Leaders Conference after his fifth-grade teacher, Pat Reynolds, nominated him for it.LiNeBrEaKHe noted that he wants to one day return to Washington to study more about history.LiNeBrEaKKevin lives in Bemidji with his grandparents, Larry and Gail Lauderbaugh, and two sisters, Stephanie, 10, and Nikki, 9.

The Boston Globe 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	The other global warming Even if we contain the greenhouse effect, says a Tufts astrophysicist, we'll have another heat problem on our hands  	By Bina Venkataraman  	IDEAS; Pg. C1  	1835 words  	Human civilization will heat up the planet; the glaciers will melt and the seas will rise. It's a familiar refrain by now, with a familiar solution: stop pumping out the greenhouse gases that trap the sun's heat.LiNeBrEaKBut even if we bring the greenhouse effect under control, says a Tufts astrophysicist, the earth will warm up anyway, thanks to a completely different source of heat that we create ourselves.LiNeBrEaKOver the next 250 years, calculates Eric J. Chaisson in a recent paper, the earth's population will start generating so much of its own heat - chiefly wasted from energy use - that it will warm the earth even without a rise in greenhouse gases. The only way to avoid it, he says, is to rethink how we generate energy.LiNeBrEaKHis paper examines the planet's growing pool of waste heat, a widespread phenomenon that nonetheless has been little studied as a cause of climate change. Nearly everything that uses or generates energy - chiefly power plants, but also cars, snowblowers, computers, and light bulbs - squanders some energy as wasted heat. And the larger and more energy-hungry the human population grows, the more waste heat remains in our atmosphere. LiNeBrEaK"What this means for humans is that this is the ultimate limit to growth," said Dennis Bushnell, the chief scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center, who urged Chaisson to publish his idea. "As we produce more kilowatts, we have to produce more waste heat."LiNeBrEaKChaisson's prediction suggests we need to change our energy policy - not just by keeping emissions low, but by shifting toward power sources that don't add new heat to the earth's system.LiNeBrEaKThe culprits in the waste-heat problem are not only dirty fossil fuels like coal and oil, but also some "clean" power sources like nuclear and geothermal energy, which still add to the problem by pumping new heat into the atmosphere. The only way to stop waste heat-induced global warming, in Chaisson's view, is to rely on energy that already reaches the earth's surface: sunlight, and the wind and the waves that it powers.LiNeBrEaKCritics say Chaisson's paper describes a scenario so far in the future, and so dependent on projections, that there's simply no way to know if it will come to pass. They also say it could distract us from the far more urgent problem of greenhouse gases. But the idea has piqued the interest of several scientists from around the world who see an opportunity to avert a crisis before future generations have to face it. And in a broader sense, it also suggests a new framework for decisions, one that appreciates the long road we - and our planet - have traveled in our evolution from the microbes of the primordial oceans and the stardust of the cosmos.LiNeBrEaKThat kind of long-range thinking is exactly what drew Chaisson's attention from astrophysics to the topic of global warming. His research typically focuses on the origins and evolution of stars and galaxies, and during a seminar on climate change in 2007, Chaisson asked himself: If we look at the earth as a spinning ball in space, reliant on the Sun, but where people plow new energy sources, how long will it be before all that new energy heats the planet up? He scribbled out some rough calculations to predict the eventual explosion of waste heat.LiNeBrEaKThe concept was not entirely new to him. With his mentor and friend, the late astronomer Carl Sagan, Chaisson had often discussed the notion that no civilization on any planet could survive over the long term unless it relied on energy from "its parent star."LiNeBrEaK"It just came as a no-brainer," he said, of the waste heat idea.LiNeBrEaKChaisson published his paper last year in a journal of the American Geophysical Union. Since then, he has received a flurry of e-mails from intrigued researchers and has spoken about it at conferences from the West Coast to Europe.LiNeBrEaKHis predictions are based on a simple but fundamental law of science: Energy can't be perfectly harnessed, but tends to dissipate, usually in the form of heat. The concept, also known as entropy, is laid out in the inviolable second law of thermodynamics.LiNeBrEaKIn practice, this means that any machine we run, whether a car engine or a power plant, not only does the work we're asking it to do, but emits heat - a lot of heat. Think of touching a lightbulb, or holding your hand over your exhaust pipe after your car has been running for only a few minutes. The heat you feel is energy radiating uselessly into the air. On a much larger scale, the same thing happens when we burn coal or oil, run a nuclear plant, even bring geothermal energy up from beneath the earth's surface.LiNeBrEaKAltogether, humans waste about two-thirds of the energy we produce on earth. More than half of the energy it takes to run a car's engine, for example, is squandered as waste heat, most of which pours out of exhaust pipes. Power plants regularly release more energy in waste heat that they make in electricity. Currently, all this heat makes little difference for our climate: it mostly dissipates into space. But the more energy humans use to fuel our societies and to feed our populations, the more waste heat we will emit. Eventually, as more economies industrialize, and as the population grows, that heat will become a significant problem.LiNeBrEaKEven if we capped all greenhouse gas pollution, Chaisson calculated, in roughly 300 years the planet will warm at least 3 degrees Celsius, if our non-renewable energy use increases in line with historical trends and UN projections of population growth. Though 3 degrees might sound small, such a rise in average global temperatures would lead to dire consequences, including significant sea level rise and mass extinction of species, according to scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKThe impact of waste heat from power plants, cars, and factories can already be measured in certain ways. The lakes, rivers, and oceans around nuclear power plants heat up as the water used to cool reactors is discharged into them. And waste heat contributes to "heat islands" in cities. A 2007 study of Tokyo showed that summer temperatures in neighborhoods with office buildings are warmer by nearly 2 degrees Celsius when air conditioning units are running - because as the units cool the insides of buildings, they also pump heat into the air.LiNeBrEaKThe only way to stop this wasted heat from warming our atmosphere is to avoid generating it in the first place, which means using the energy that naturally comes to the planet. When a wind or wave turbine spins, or a solar panel collects rays, they're using energy that's already part of the system.LiNeBrEaKToday, many climate scientists view waste heat as a negligible problem compared to greenhouse gas emissions. The heat-trapping effect of greenhouse gases has 100 times the effect on global warming that waste heat does, said Mark Flanner, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who uses computer models to simulate waste heat. Flanner agrees with Chaisson, however, that it will play a much larger role over the long term.LiNeBrEaK"If we assume the current growth in nonrenewable energy use, the heat flux will be of equal magnitude to the greenhouse effect 200 years from now," he said.LiNeBrEaKStill there are several big unknowns in Chaisson's predictions. One is his assumption that power plants and engines will continue to be quite wasteful. History suggests that societies tend to become more, not less, energy-efficient as technologies improve. Today's machines are far more efficient than yesterday's, and if that trend continues, the problem of global waste heat could be slower to develop - although the laws of thermodynamics say it's impossible to reduce wasted energy to zero.LiNeBrEaK"We just don't know if there is a point at which energy use will level off," said Yangyang Liu, an atmospheric scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory who was intrigued by Chaisson's paper, but thinks it may overestimate waste heat's contribution to long-term global warming. "The efficiency to convert energy to work will also probably improve over time."LiNeBrEaKAlso uncertain is how much waste heat the planet's oceans can absorb before the overall temperature rises. And Chaisson's starkest scenarios assume that the human population will grow at certain rates, although it could drop sharply from widespread disaster or disease.LiNeBrEaKSince his paper was published in July, the most frequent criticism Chaisson has heard is that the waste-heat problem diverts attention from the far more urgent question of how to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. If we cook ourselves with carbon dioxide first, critics say, waste heat will make little difference.LiNeBrEaK"I can't show that the estimates are wrong," said John Merrill, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography. "But I can say that there are many hurdles caused by climate change and other environmental and social challenges that we need to address a lot sooner than this set."LiNeBrEaKChaisson concedes that in looking 300 years into the future, not just 50 or 100, his critique sits outside current debates over climate change. But he warns that taking a long-term view is vital to human survival - even if the coming environmental catastrophe is something that neither we, nor our children, are likely to see in our lifetimes.LiNeBrEaK"It's true, it's not important now," he said, while sitting below a timeline of the universe in his office at Tufts. "But from the point of view of an astrophysicist, we shouldn't be digging up any resources on our planet when we have plenty of energy coming from our parent star, the sun."LiNeBrEaKLong-range ideas like Chaisson's are uncommon in the realm of policy, where the pressure is great to deal with present-day challenges that affect people alive today. But such long-term thinking has been an important thread in the environmental movement, and holds an undeniable grip on the popular imagination. Rachel Carson's early and influential book "Silent Spring" opened by imagining a future in which pesticides had killed all the songbirds. More recently, last summer's animated blockbuster "Wall-E" set its story on a post-apocalyptic Earth, a wasteland heaped with trash.LiNeBrEaKIn the hope that thinking far, far ahead will catch on among scientists and policymakers, Chaisson has been spreading his perspective. Foundation for the Future, a Seattle-based nonprofit dedicated to contemplating the "long-term future of humanity," invited him to present at a meeting in Paris hosted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.LiNeBrEaKEnergy has been the key ingredient that has sustained human life, the growth of our intelligence and civilization, Chaisson told them. But the way we are making it could thwart our evolution, and our survival, if we do not adapt now. "Humans are part of an evolving universe stretching across billions of light-years of space, and billions of years of time," he said. Then he asked, "Who are we to think that change ought now to stop?"LiNeBrEaKBina Venkataraman writes about science for the Globe.

Buffalo News (New York) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	For banks, more than money is green;  Not real polluters, they're nevertheless going eco-friendly 	By Jonathan D. Epstein - NEWS BUSINESS REPORTER  	PROSPECTUS; Pg. P9  	2096 words  	Environmental scientists don't usually find their niche working for a global bank. But don't tell that to Sharon Walck.LiNeBrEaKFor the past few months, the 43-year-old Western New Yorker with an environmental degree has been responsible for HSBC's efforts to be more environmentally sensitive throughout North America.LiNeBrEaKNot only does the bank recycle paper, cups and rainwater, but it uses solar power to heat a new branch and gives generously to environmental causes. And it encourages its customers and contractors to do better.LiNeBrEaKIt even sends employees on weeklong research trips for environmental fieldwork. LiNeBrEaK"We're all on this journey in the green economy," said Walck, senior vice president of corporate sustainability for HSBC North America Holdings, the Mettawa, Ill.-based parent of HSBC Bank USA. "It's really around corporate responsibility."LiNeBrEaKWelcome to environmentally friendly banking, where money isn't the only subject that's "green" anymore. As concern over the protecting the environment has taken center stage, even industries like banking that didn't consider themselves polluters have felt the pressure to be cleaner and recognized the benefit of being good stewards of the earth.LiNeBrEaK"It's hard not to be sensitive to the global environmental issue," said James J. Beardi, executive vice president of corporate services at MandT Bank Corp. "We're not trying to win any awards. We're just trying to be a good corporate citizen."LiNeBrEaKThe most obvious step that banks and other white-collar industries take is to encourage or require recycling of paper, cans and bottles, or to use supplies made of recycled materials. But many banks locally and nationally have started going beyond that, seeking ways they can have more of an impact by using less energy, avoiding travel, volunteering and encouraging customers and vendors.LiNeBrEaK"There are always additional things that companies can be doing," said Hal Wentworth, senior vice president and director of sales and marketing for Community Bank System in DeWitt.LiNeBrEaK&gt; Mixed motivesLiNeBrEaKTheir motivations are generally threefold: part civic duty, part reputation and part financial self-interest.LiNeBrEaKWith the increased attention on climate change, global warming, pollution and other environmental issues, bank executives say they do recognize their responsibility individually and as a corporation.LiNeBrEaK"You don't pick up the newspaper or listen to any reports without thinking about green these days," said Cindy Crotty, Key- Corp executive vice president and commercial bank head, who spearheads the company's environmental efforts. "It's something everybody feels they can contribute toward."LiNeBrEaKBut they also know that the more they can do, the better they will look to customers, employees and communities. Several national environmental groups have targeted certain companies and industries for public criticism and embarrassment, while many firms have faced shareholder proposals calling for better environmental practices or reporting.LiNeBrEaKAnd many customers now choose to do business only with companies that are "green."LiNeBrEaK"Customers want to know what are you doing in these efforts," said Michael Mackay, first vice president of operations for First Niagara Financial Group. "It really has become a major issue internally for the bank as well as for our customer base."LiNeBrEaKFinally, the banks and other corporations see a financial benefit: reducing waste and energy also saves them money.LiNeBrEaK"There's a lot of passion around this and it's a great way to get your employees engaged around something that helps shareholders," Crotty said.LiNeBrEaKMost banks now push electronic banking. That includes not only checking balances and conducting transactions, but also paying and receiving bills and bank statements online, and using debit cards.LiNeBrEaKBanks also are using new check-scanning and imaging technology to convert paper checks to electronic data, either at branches or at business customers' offices. That eliminates the need to transport, process and store paper checks, and cuts down on the need for couriers. And it speeds up transactions.LiNeBrEaK"It helps the banks because we have happier customers," said Wentworth of Community Bank, which even uses recycled paper for its direct mail. "But it also happens to be good for the environment as well."LiNeBrEaK&gt; Carbon neutralityLiNeBrEaKBut some go further. HSBC has long been one of the most active environmentally throughout the world. Even back in 2000, the bank was already known as oneLiNeBrEaKof the industry leaders in what is now often called "corporate sustainability."LiNeBrEaKThat year, HSBC invested $50 million in its "Investing in Nature" program to support environmental organizations worldwide. It established an environmental reporting system in 2001, and in September 2003 became one of the first banks to adopt the Equator Principles, a voluntary system of guidelines that applies to lending policies. And last month, it adopted the Climate Principles.LiNeBrEaKIn October 2005, it was the first bank to become completely "carbon-neutral," which means its global operations in total contribute no extra carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. HSBC Bank USA that month even designed and built a prototype "zero-carbon" branch in Greece, N. Y.LiNeBrEaKThe branch uses solar panels for geothermal heating and cooling, features "intelligent" lighting systems and recycles rainwater. Water usage is down 71 percent and energy by 52 percent, compared to conventional branches, and the use of clean renewable energy and solar panels has saved over 11 tons of carbon dioxide, HSBC claims.LiNeBrEaKSimilar features are now in place at the company's recently built, $100 million North American headquarters in Illinois, where roof water flushes toilets, the landscaping is drought-resistant and electricity comes from wind farms. All cups are recyclable, and employees are required to use recycling bins.LiNeBrEaKIts "green IT" strategy, launched in 2005, calls for cutting energy use in information technology by 8 percent and carbon emissions by 6 percent by 2011, as well as reducing water use. That will also save HSBC $11 million a year, based on current utility prices.LiNeBrEaKOptions include increased use of video conferencing to reduce the need for air travel, as well as using green building standards for new facilities. For example, plans for a new data center in England call for using energy generated by computers to heat a nearby public swimming pool.LiNeBrEaK&gt; A $90 million effortLiNeBrEaKIn 2007, HSBC committed $90 million globally over five years to achieve its targets by showcasing environmental innovation. Today, nine of every 10 HSBC employees work in offices where energy and water use, and the waste and carbon dioxide produced, are evaluated and reported publicly. U. S. employees seek to divert 85 percent of generated waste to recycling and composting.LiNeBrEaKThe bank also introduced its GreenRide carpooling program and a preferred-parking program for low-emission or hybrid vehicles. And it launched a flexible work program in 2007 called HSBC@Work to allow employees to work from home instead of commuting. HSBC expects 20 percent of staff to participate.LiNeBrEaKWorldwide, the bank partnered with 385 institutional investors on an annual survey about greenhouse gas emissions and commissioned online research in 12 countries about consumer attitudes toward climate change. And it teamed up with the Climate Group, Earthwatch Institute, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the World Wildlife Fund in a five-year $100 million partnership to fight climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe program calls for protecting major rivers and making Hong Kong, London, Mumbai, New York and Shanghai cleaner, while conducting what the bank calls the "largest-ever experiment on the long-term effects of climate change on forests."LiNeBrEaKOfficials hope to create "climate champions" who will undertake research and bring back knowledge and experience to their communities.LiNeBrEaKIn North America, HSBC employees can spend two weeks at a time at an Earthwatch research facility on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland, doing fieldwork and lab work.LiNeBrEaKFinally, the bank even brought its environmental philosophy to clients, developing "sector guidelines" to discuss with customers how to have better environmental practices. And it has reportedly cut back on lending to palm oil, soybean and timber companies, ceasing business with about one-third of clients in those industries in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia.LiNeBrEaK&gt; B of A's initiativesLiNeBrEaKBank of America also has taken this seriously. The company in 2007 announced a $20 billion, 10-year effort to address climate change through "sustainable business practices," innovative lending and investing, new products and services, and changes to how it operates.LiNeBrEaKSince then, it loaned money to a nonprofit to buy and protect 50,000 acres of redwood forest timberland, invested in solar power and renewable energy at schools, municipalities and businesses, and introduced a credit card that gives rewards points that can be invested in renewable energy projects. It also reimburses employees $3,000 for buying hybrid cars.LiNeBrEaKIt now has an internal "Energy Team" that promotes energy efficiency, explores alternatives and finds new ways to conserve energy. From 2000 to 2006, the bank cut paper usage per employee by 40 percent, and now recycles nearly 50,000 tons of paper annually. And it's set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 9 percent by 2009.LiNeBrEaKIt committed $1. 4 billion to achieve environmental certification in all new offices and branches, including a high-rise office building in New York City. And its paper procurement policy not only encourages recycling but targets illegal logging and protects forests.LiNeBrEaKFinally, the nation's largest bank last month said it will phase out lending to coal mining companies that use the controversial practice of mountaintop removal to get at the coal.LiNeBrEaK&gt; Other banks' effortsLiNeBrEaKOther banks have been more low key.LiNeBrEaK"Our green initiative is probably a well-kept secret," MandT's Beardi said. "We thought we'd be shorter on hyperbole and longer on doing things."LiNeBrEaKFirst, MandT upgraded its inhouse recycling, especially in larger facilities such as in Buffalo. The bank is conducting an energy audit, examining the efficiency of its infrastructure, windows, lighting and HVAC systems in major buildings.LiNeBrEaKExecutives want workers to take advantage of various ride-sharing programs in the community. And MandT is urging employees to be more energy-conscious ? shutting off lights, computers and coffee machines.LiNeBrEaKThe bank is also seeking to reduce the amount of paper it uses, programming copy machines to automatically copy both sides instead of just one side. That has cut paper usage by 11 million sheets since 2006.LiNeBrEaKAt KeyCorp, Crotty is now surveying the bank's districts nationwide to find out what the bank is currently doing to be more environmentally friendly.LiNeBrEaKKey's branch modernization effort has incorporated "green" elements, such as using insulated "low-e" glass, landscaping, better lighting and video screens in its offices. The bank also replaced cooling towers at its Buffalo call center with environmentally friendly coolants.LiNeBrEaKRecycling has picked up, especially in call centers. Printing is double-sided, and employees now fax documents by e-mail. The bank is also using less wasteful inks.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of us are not printing off all the PowerPoints that we get," Crotty said. "We're being a lot more conscious about the paper we use."LiNeBrEaKAt a recent internal training conference, officials replaced bottled water with water pitchers and glasses instead, and also gave out recycled binders and cloth bags for carrying papers.LiNeBrEaK"We're in such a disposable world," Crotty said. "It's gotten to the point where people realize this is not good for anyone, and people are willing to do their share to help."LiNeBrEaKFirst Niagara is trying to cut the flow of paper. The bank put expense reimbursements and other forms online, and allows for electronic signatures so documents don't have to be printed as they move from person to person. It cut courier runs from daily to three times a week.LiNeBrEaKAnd executives plan to introduce online account opening in the first quarter.LiNeBrEaK"Things that would take days because it would take time for the paper to move can now be done instantaneously," Mackay said.LiNeBrEaKIts insurance agency has even developed a "green" practice to detect risks and prevent losses at clients. After all, officials reason, risks to the environment could also harm employees.LiNeBrEaK"People who take care with the environment are also more likely to take care with other things," said John Costello, executive vice president at First Niagara Risk Management.LiNeBrEaKe-mail: jepstein@buffnews.com	ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (91%); BANKING and FINANCE (90%); MATERIALS RECOVERY and RECYCLING (90%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (90%); COMMERCIAL BANKING (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (79%); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (79%); CLIMATE CHANGE (79%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (79%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (79%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); COMMUNITY BANKS (78%); HOLDING COMPANIES (74%); BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (73%); SOLAR ENERGY (71%); SHAREHOLDERS (50%)  	MandT BANK CORP (67%); HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC (56%); HSBC BANK USA NA (56%); COMMUNITY BANK SYSTEM INC (52%)  	NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (67%); SIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (67%); NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING (67%); SIC6022 STATE COMMERCIAL BANKS (67%)  	BUFFALO, NY, USA (79%) NEW YORK, USA (90%) NORTH AMERICA (94%); UNITED STATES (90%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved  				Sharon Cantillon/Buffalo News Sharon Walck, HSBC North America's senior vice president for corporate sustainability, leads the banking giant's environmental efforts from her office in HSBC Center in downtown Buffalo.

Buffalo News (New York) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Grocery stores wrestle with cutting energy costs;  Renovations, lighting and reusable bags among green solutions 	By Samantha Maziarz Christmann - NEWS BUSINESS REPORTER  	PROSPECTUS; Pg. P20  	1276 words  	Folks throughout Western New York, whether for financial or environmental reasons, are looking for ways to curb energy consumption. Supermarket owners, who count energy costs as their highest expenditure after labor, are no different.LiNeBrEaKBut grocery stores can't exactly hand out extra sweaters and turn down thermostats.LiNeBrEaKSo how do they do it?LiNeBrEaKLocal grocery retailers continue to wrestle with that question, and have pinned down some environmentally friendly answers in the process.LiNeBrEaK"Better energy efficiency and sustainability are good for a company's bottom line, but well beyond that comes the benefit of making a positive contribution to our environment," said Kate McKenna, spokeswoman for Tops Markets. LiNeBrEaKTops recently announced massive plans for renovation and expansion at its stores over the next five years, and McKenna said environmental sustainability efforts and energy efficiency will figure into them prominently.LiNeBrEaKGrocery stores spend roughly $4. 84 per square foot in energy costs annually, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Multiply that by millions of square feet and even the smallest adjustments start making a big financial and environmental impact.LiNeBrEaKThe average cost of energy expenditures is roughly equivalent to a grocery store's average profit margin of about 1 percent, according to information from National Grid. That makes energy reduction an influential factor on the bottom line.LiNeBrEaK&gt; Keeping coolLiNeBrEaKRefrigeration accounts for more than 35 percent of energy costs, making it a prime target for improvement efforts.LiNeBrEaKWegmans has begun to move away from a standard coolant called R404a in favor of the more environmentally friendly glycol in its refrigeration systems. Since the mid-1990s, each newly built location uses the non-polluting food-grade glycol, accounting for more than a third of the chain's 72 stores.LiNeBrEaKThe company said that small change prevents 2,376 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per store annually.LiNeBrEaKThe company settled on glycol after reviewing replacements for the notoriously polluting greenhouse gases that had traditionally been used as refrigerants -- chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons-- which have been found to deplete the ozone layer.LiNeBrEaKThough glycol is not less expensive than traditional refrigerants, the company feels it is the better alternative. The non-toxic gas is said to be safer for use in confined spaces and near food -- such as in walk-in coolers -- and can be used in lower quantities, reducing the possibility of leaks.LiNeBrEaK"Sustainability is something customers have been asking about more and more lately, and it's something we've been committed to for a long time," said Ann McCarthy, Wegmans spokeswoman.LiNeBrEaKIn Tops' first round of renovations, which began with an overhaul of its Olean store, the company installed a modern energy-management system to reduce electricity use in refrigeration and lighting. Tops has also begun using frozen food display cases with "anti-sweat heaters," which reduce energy consumption.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this year, Aldi Supermarkets opened an environmentally upgraded store in East Syracuse which will serve as a prototype for all new Aldi locations. Referred to as an Aldi Generation 1 building, the store uses a more efficient refrigeration system estimated to cut energy costs by 42 percent. The glycol-using system allows for greater computerized temperature control of coolers.LiNeBrEaKThe store uses high-performance coils and energy-efficient fan motors in its display cases. It also hangs curtains over cooler doors while the store is closed to keep warm air from store aisles from seeping into coolers, lightening the burden for the unit's air compressor. Walk-in coolers also have energy-efficient evaporator coils to regulate moisture.LiNeBrEaKBudweys Supermarkets, which has stores in North Tonawanda and in the Town of Tonawanda, is upgrading to more efficient fan motors and defrosters in its refrigerator cases. The company projects it will recoup the $35,000 per store cost within one year of energy savings.LiNeBrEaK&gt; Enlightened lightingLiNeBrEaKLighting accounts for another 11 percent of energy use, according to the EPA profile. With that in mind, Wegmans has begun to relamp all 5,700 overhead lighting fixtures in its Rochester stores, replacing older, less efficient components with brighter high-efficiency fluorescent ones.LiNeBrEaKThe move is expected to cut energy use by half -- bringing a return on the $1. 5 million investment within three years.LiNeBrEaKLighting fixtures in Wegmans' Western New York stores are scheduled for retooling, too, depending upon how well the pilot program in the Rochester stores goes.LiNeBrEaKAldi and Wegmans are also using LED lighting in signage, refrigerator doors and cooler cases. The LED lights use about 80 percent less energy than traditional fluorescents, but also save on cooling costs because they emit less heat, meaning coolers won't need to work as hard as with traditional light sources.LiNeBrEaKAldi's prototype store is designed with higher ceilings, taller windows and skylights in order to rely more on natural sunlight.LiNeBrEaKTops uses energy-efficient light bulbs -- and if you've ever gone shopping there late at night, you've noticed it dims overhead lighting during off hours.LiNeBrEaKBudweys is removing the plastic shields over its light fixtures, allowing the bulbs to shine brighter than when hidden by the ballast. That small change will save the company $500 per week.LiNeBrEaK&gt; Driving greenLiNeBrEaKTransportation makes up another big chunk of energy cost and usage.LiNeBrEaKWegmans recently upgraded its delivery fleet with 121 new aerodynamic trucks equipped with special high-efficiency, low-emission engines made locally at the Cummins Engine Plant in Jamestown. The new trucks will cut emissions by 90 percent, in accordance with tightened EPA standards.LiNeBrEaKWegmans also is training its drivers in fuel-conservative driving strategies and maps their routes to maximize efficiency. The company expects improved performance and fuel economy to save 92,000 gallons of fuel per year.LiNeBrEaKTops' delivery trucks run on biodiesel fuel, and like the Wegmans fleet, are programmed to shut down automatically if they idle longer than five minutes at a time. Chugging idly for shorter periods reduces both fuel consumption and carbon emissions for better air quality.LiNeBrEaKWegmans also has made significant efforts to buy food locally, reducing the amount of fuel needed to transport goods to stores.LiNeBrEaKTops, since it returned to local operation, also has widely publicized its efforts to partner with local companies such as H2Gro Greenhouses in Youngstown, which hydroponically grows environmentally friendly tomatoes.LiNeBrEaK&gt; Paper, plastic, neither?LiNeBrEaKMost grocery stores have been trying to wean customers away from plastic bags, offering inexpensive reusable ones instead. Now a state law requires it.LiNeBrEaKThe new legislation, called the "Plastic Bag Reduction, Reuse and Recycling Act," also requires retailers to have a plastic bag recycling program in place to cut down on the enormous plastic waste caused by bags.LiNeBrEaKTops, through a partnership with Virginia-headquartered alternative building material supplier Trex Company Inc., even turns its bags into building materials. Trex creates recycled and reclaimed decking, railing, fencing and trim products using recycled wood and plastic fibers (including Tops bags) which Tops uses as part of its construction and renovation efforts.LiNeBrEaKAldi charges shoppers a small fee per bag and Budweys is looking for a solution to eliminate plastic bags entirely within three months.LiNeBrEaK"Stores use so many plastic bags and they're not biodegradable," said Frank Budwey, Budweys owner. "We're looking for something more progressive and greener."LiNeBrEaKe-mail: schristmann@buffnews.com	GROCERY STORES and SUPERMARKETS (96%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); OIL and GAS CONSUMPTION (89%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); CONSUMPTION (78%); FROZEN FOODS (77%); RETAILERS (77%); BUILDING RENOVATION (74%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (73%); COMPANY PROFITS (73%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (72%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (69%); OZONE DEPLETION (62%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (78%) SUPERMARKETS  	NATIONAL GRID PLC (90%)  		NEW YORK, USA (73%) UNITED STATES (73%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (56%)  			Bill Wippert/Buffalo News Wegmans driver Ron Newman, left, uses a computer with satellite tracking to maximize efficiency.

Buffalo News (New York) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	UB aims to become 'climate neutral'  	By Jay Rey - NEWS STAFF REPORTER  	PROSPECTUS; Pg. P32  	416 words  	The University at Buffalo has long been a local leader when it comes to environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKBut now UB is embarking on an even more aggressive agenda. It is among the hundreds of colleges and universities -- which includes local schools like Alfred University and Fredonia State College -- that have set out to become "climate neutral." LiNeBrEaKIn other words, UB wants to offset all of the greenhouse gas emissions it produces to the point where it has a neutral effect on global warming.LiNeBrEaKUB already has some success in this area. A few examples:LiNeBrEaK* In 2003, it opened the Creekside Village housing complex, the first building in Western New York to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, with such conservation features as a heating and air-conditioning system that pumps out more or less air depending on the number of people inside.LiNeBrEaK* In 2006 UB began using solar panels to generate a portion of the electrical power used for Norton Hall on the North Campus.LiNeBrEaK* In 2007 the university hit a milestone when an energy conservation project launched in 1997 results in $15 million in savings -- more than the project's original cost.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, UB officials estimate energy conservation efforts have resulted in more than $100 million in savings over the past three decades.LiNeBrEaKBut becoming climate neutral will be a huge task and require UB to be much more aggressive when it comes to conserving energy and purchasing green power, according to UB Green, the environmental stewardship office at the school.LiNeBrEaKThe office completed the first quantitative study last year on how UB impacts on the environment, primarily through use of fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, UB's annual average greenhouse gas emissions are equal to the amount produced by 25,000 cars, according to the report. Students, staff and faculty drive more than 79 million miles a year, just to get to and from campus, the report showed.LiNeBrEaKAnd it doesn't consider that UB -- which has about 28,000 students -- wants to grow its three campuses and add 10,000 students and 2,400 staff in the next decade and a half.LiNeBrEaK"We've taken the position that technology alone won't bring us to carbon neutrality, and we're going to have to work on the culture of our university," said Robert G. Shibley, professor of architecture and planning and a senior adviser to President John B. Simpson.LiNeBrEaKShibley chairs the Environmental Stewardship Committee, which is carving out a plan for UB to become carbon neutral. Its draft report is due in March.LiNeBrEaKe-mail: jrey@buffnews.com	ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); CARBON OFFSETS (89%); GREEN BUILDING (78%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); HVAC SYSTEMS (76%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (74%); SOLAR ENERGY (69%)  			BUFFALO, NY, USA (88%) NEW YORK, USA (88%) UNITED STATES (88%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved  																
Buffalo News (New York) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Praxair could be big supplier of liquid hydrogen for cars  	By Aaron Besecker - NEWS NIAGARA BUREAU  	PROSPECTUS; Pg. P45  	628 words  	Praxair began "thinking green" at its Niagara Falls facility long before global warming became a common term in the United States.LiNeBrEaKThe company started making liquid hydrogen -- much heralded for its potential as an environmentally friendly fuel -- in the Cataract City after breaking ground here in 1980.LiNeBrEaKAfter a major expansion nine years later, Praxair continues to turn an industrial byproduct from nearby chemical plants into a commodity used in various industries, including steel, glass, pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals. LiNeBrEaK"We continue to make a high-quality product. We intend to be there a long time from now, as well," said Maureen C. Fama, a spokeswoman for the Danbury, Conn.-based company.LiNeBrEaKTwo nearby chemical facilities sell Praxair the hydrogen gas they produce as a byproduct of their operations.LiNeBrEaKThe potential for hydrogen fuel is viewed as important because vehicles powered by hydrogen burn cleaner and are more efficient than those using gasoline.LiNeBrEaKBut there are challenges. It would take about $55 billion over the next 15 years to make hydrogen-fueled cars common by 2050, according to a National Research Council of the National Academies study reported by the Associated Press in July.LiNeBrEaKAt the Niagara Falls site, hydrogen gas arrives at Praxair via underground pipelines, said Fred Ranck, plant manager.LiNeBrEaK"We get it as a gas, we remove trace impurities and then we liquify," Ranck said, outlining the production process.LiNeBrEaKThe process is energy intensive, running various equipment that cools and compresses the gas.LiNeBrEaKMuch of the energy used in production is needed for cooling the hydrogen, the second coldest gas in the world, down to minus 425 degrees Fahrenheit.LiNeBrEaKThe gas the Royal Avenue plant receives is about 98. 9 percent pure, company representatives said. Oxygen and nitrogen are among what's extracted before the substance is liquified and sold.LiNeBrEaKWhen the system's running perfectly, the plant can make 40 tons of liquid hydrogen a day.LiNeBrEaKThe Niagara Falls facility is actually two independent plants, which each perform the same operations and can be used interchangeably, if needed, or both at once, Ranck said.LiNeBrEaKIn all, about 99 percent of all the electricity used at the plant is in the production process, company officials said. The system is extremely reliable and extremely efficient, Ranck said.LiNeBrEaK"We don't waste anything here," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe plant, which is the largest of Praxair's four hydrogen production facilities in the United States and the second-largest liquid hydrogen plant in the country, employs about 90 people.LiNeBrEaKThe company's other hydrogen-making plants are in Ontario, Calif.; McIntosh, Ala., and East Chicago, Ind.LiNeBrEaKBut making liquid hydrogen isn't the only thing the plant does. In fact, it's only about 4 percent of everything produced at the facility, which draws in air from the atmosphere, separates it into oxygen, nitrogen and argon and sells them as liquids.LiNeBrEaKThe plant employs about 40 drivers, who haul tanks up and down the East Coast, including to New England and Virginia, and occasionally to the West Coast.LiNeBrEaKIn July 2006, the company announced it was renovating nearly 30,000 square feet at its Town of Tonawanda facility for a new engineering and design operation, in part due to a surge in demand for gases the company produces, including hydrogen.LiNeBrEaKPraxair employs 1,130 people at its Tonawanda site.LiNeBrEaKBesides from gaseous hydrogen, there are other ways to produce liquid hydrogen, including using natural gas. But the plant would have to be reconfigured if another source had to be used, Ranck said.LiNeBrEaKNew uses of liquid hydrogen are being studied, but none is at a point where anything about them could be disclosed, the company said.LiNeBrEaK"I just hope that our two suppliers won't go away," Ranck said.LiNeBrEaKe-mail: abesecker@buffnews.com	HYDROGEN POWERED VEHICLES (91%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES (90%); HYDROGEN ENERGY (90%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); INDUSTRIAL GAS MFG (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); CHEMICALS (76%); CHEMICALS MFG (76%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (76%); PHARMACEUTICALS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); SPECIALTY CHEMICALS INDUSTRY (71%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (68%); RESEARCH REPORTS (68%) ALTERNATIVE FUELS  			CALIFORNIA, USA (79%); CONNECTICUT, USA (79%); INDIANA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved  	NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (55%)  			Associated Press At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month, General Motors Corp. displayed the drive train for a hydrogen fuel cell car.

Buffalo News (New York) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Attorneys change course as clients become proactive on environmental issues  	By Jonathan D. Epstein - NEWS BUSINESS REPORTER  	PROSPECTUS; Pg. P12  	1307 words  	Kevin M. Hogan has seen a real sea change in the kind of work he's being asked to do.LiNeBrEaKIn the past, the attorney at Phillips Lytle LLP largely worried about litigation and regulatory issues for his clients, who mainly cared about being "green" when they ran afoul of new environmental laws.LiNeBrEaKThese days, by contrast, he's helping them go above and beyond those same laws as they eagerly jump on the bandwagon to become as proactively green as possible, avoiding any trouble from the get-go.LiNeBrEaKInstead of spending his time in court or responding to compliance allegations, he's filing applications and permits for earth-friendly energy projects and property development. LiNeBrEaK"Companies are investing lots of dollars trying to portray themselves as being good environmental stewards, and running their businesses in a good environmental fashion," said Hogan, a partner in the firm's Environment and Energy group. "Companies have even less tolerance for finding themselves in any situation that garners negative publicity."LiNeBrEaKAs the world increasingly adopts "green" as the international color, law firms have changed the focus of their environmental practices to adapt to the new needs and desires of clients.LiNeBrEaKTwenty or 30 years ago, environmental laws were still relatively new and many companies either didn't know or didn't care enough to comply. They were more dismissive of the new regulations that were hindering their ability to operate -- and more willing to fight when someone challenged them.LiNeBrEaKIn the past, environmental laws were also thought to be something that only industrial companies like manufacturing plants or coal mines needed to worry about. After all, white-collar businesses weren't pumping out smoke or polluting the waterways, so why should they be concerned about the environment?LiNeBrEaKBut all of that has changed, as more people -- and companies -- have recently acknowledged what they see as the impact of past environmental damage and the risks of climate change on the entire world.LiNeBrEaK"This is one area where business and public views are in alignment," said Gary M. Schober, president and CEO of Hodgson Russ LLP, Buffalo's largest law firm. "People now have enough knowledge. They're convinced we have to do business in a way that doesn't jeopardize the earth and our future."LiNeBrEaKAs a result, lawyers like Hogan are now finding their clients practically falling over themselves to be proactive on the environment, as they are more sensitive not only to their reputation, but also to the realities of protecting the planet.LiNeBrEaK"We're not in the age of midnight dumpers by any stretch. That's ancient history at this point," said Andrea Schillaci, primary environmental attorney at Hurwitz and Fine PC. "Companies are more conscious of environmental liability. Consumers are looking to do business with companies that are environmentally responsible."LiNeBrEaKAnd that has a bottom-line effect as well.LiNeBrEaK"It's an area in which businesses will do what they can because it's the right thing to do," Schober agreed. "But even more importantly, it's in their economic interests."LiNeBrEaKSo where expertise in the courtroom and familiarity with pollution liability used to be a necessity for a lawyer, attorneys today are being called upon to understand the nuances of redeveloping "brownfields," installing or building renewable energy projects, and meeting the criteria for environmentally friendly new construction. Leaks are out, but LEED is in.LiNeBrEaK"Environmental attorneys were not performing the kind of work then that they are now," said Steven J. Ricca, partner in the Environmental and Economic and Land Development practices at Jaeckle Fleishmann and Mugel LLP. "Environmental attorneys dealt with compliance issues and consulting on issues. What I spend most of my time doing now is land-use and environmental procedures."LiNeBrEaKThe changes in environmental law stem in part from structural changes in the economy.LiNeBrEaKFor one thing, the shift toward service industries and the trend toward moving manufacturing offshore means there's far fewer dirty industrial plants in places like Western New York. That means less regulatory compliance work for attorneys and fewer landfills or hazardous waste sites to clean up.LiNeBrEaKAdditionally, companies have realized that it costs them far less to do the regulatory compliance work in-house, since it doesn't require going to court and they don't have to hire expensive legal counsel. So as laws have changed and the economy has slid, they're adding to their internal legal staff and cutting back outside.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, regulators themselves aren't as quick to pull the trigger on a lawsuit.LiNeBrEaK"Regulators today will only litigate if they are certain to win," Ricca said.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps one of the biggest changes, however, is that companies -- and their attorneys -- are now being proactive to avoid trouble instead of reactive when trouble arises.LiNeBrEaK"As we've gotten more knowledgeable and we've come to appreciate the consequences of not protecting our environment, people are just more careful these days because they have to be," Schober said.LiNeBrEaK"The more they spend on reputation, the less tolerant of any situation that will garner bad publicity," Hogan agreed.LiNeBrEaKThat means companies will take extra measures to ensure they are not only complying with the letter of the law, but going above and beyond so they aren't living on the edge.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of money can be saved by being proactive and creative at the front end," Schillaci said. "Instead of defensive litigation, it's more proactive compliance with regulations."LiNeBrEaKAnd if they are confronted with trouble, they're far less likely to fight and more willing to look for the quick settlement, whether it's with regulators or private litigants. In turn, regulators are more receptive to listen.LiNeBrEaK"There's greater emphasis on resolving situations that do arise," Hogan said. "Clients are less willing to fight. Even when the clients are right and the agency or citizen is wrong, it's rarely portrayed that way in the press and it has a detrimental effect on the reputation."LiNeBrEaKThe ultimate result is less court time. "Any businessman who cavalierly goes into litigation is making a mistake," Schober said. "It's expensive, time-consuming and disruptive."LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, though, attorneys are getting more demand for other types of work, largely focused on environmentally sensitive development issues. In many cases, environmental and land development work blend together, so the lawyers have diversified as "smart growth" and "walkable communities" have become buzzwords.LiNeBrEaKRather than continue suburban sprawl and clear additional land for new developments, companies are trying to re-use existing facilities in urban areas for different purposes, without incurring heavy costs for litigation on top of any cleanup costs. And redeveloping such "brownfields" could require legal work to obtain permits and state tax credits, which have become harder to qualify for as the state cuts back.LiNeBrEaK"We've been seeing an upsurge in brownfields redevelopment, and I think that'll continue as well," Schillaci said. "That's been very good for this area."LiNeBrEaKAnd many companies and developers are increasingly looking to capitalize on the popularity of going "green" by seeking status as a LEED-certified building. LEED refers to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, and builders will seek certification under the highest level possible, even changing their plans to achieve a higher ranking.LiNeBrEaKFinally, lawyers are helping companies get approval for renewable energy projects, such as wind farms, hydro-electric facilities and ethanol plants.LiNeBrEaK"Companies and law firms are so much more sensitive to green issues and reputation," said Chip Grieco, also a Jaeckle attorney. "It's not about smokestacks anymore. It's about how to make money in a green economy because that's what people are interested in."LiNeBrEaKe-mail: jepstein@buffnews.com	ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); MAJOR US LAW FIRMS (90%); LAWYERS (89%); LEGAL SERVICES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); BUSINESS LIABILITY (77%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (77%); TOXIC TORTS (77%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (76%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (74%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (74%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (69%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (64%); COAL MINING (50%); WATER POLLUTION (50%) LAW FIRMS  	HODGSON RUSS LLP (84%); HURWITZ and FINE (50%); PHILLIPS LYTLE LLP (92%); HURWITZ and FINE PC (81%)  		BUFFALO, NY, USA (52%) EARTH (92%); NEW YORK, USA (52%) UNITED STATES (52%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved  				Bill Wippert/Buffalo News Kevin M.

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Restoring science to rightful place  	Chattanooga Times Free Press, Tenn.  	COMMENTARY  	516 words  	Jan. 25--Among the many welcome areas of national policy that President Barack Obama pledged in his inaugural address to reshape from the focus of the Bush years is the administration's approach to science-based findings. His administration, he said, "will return science to its rightful place." That should elicit hallelujahs from ordinary citizens as well as members of the science community. LiNeBrEaKA return to science-based decisions will have an enormous impact on issues across the board -- from environmental concerns to food safety, from the efficacy of pharmaceutical drugs to sex education, from stem-cell research to genetically modified crops.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration became notorious early on for squelching the findings of scientific panels and agency scientists in order to shape public policies in ways desired by specific constituencies, industries and lobbyists for vested interests.LiNeBrEaKThe president's politically appointed subordinates, for example, regularly suppressed, edited or rewrote scientific findings with which they disagreed strictly on ideological grounds.LiNeBrEaKHigh-level scientific reports on global warming and climate change were routinely suppressed, distorted or effectively misrepresented by untrained agency managers put in office for their political views and their willingness to enforce politically biased dictates from higher levels in the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKSo were findings on the adverse effects of air pollution, the dumping of mining waste into streams and rivers, the effect of pollution on aquifers and water tables.LiNeBrEaKScientists tried to fight back. Yet even after they joined forces to raise concerns, the administration defeated them by simply refuting their claims and then ignoring them.LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, for example, more than 60 prominent scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, published a statement claiming the Bush administration had systematically "misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implications of its policies."LiNeBrEaKThe group cited the administration's blatant distortion of science to promote partisan or ideological policy goals in such areas as biomedical research, nuclear weapons, human health and the environment.LiNeBrEaKReversing the distortion and abuse of scientific findings may take some time. Research grants on stem cells, for example, must be modified. Executive rules and regulations imposed to require a top-down review of routine procedures at a range of agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug administration, must be studied and revised.LiNeBrEaKStill, it's likely that good science will soon prevail again. Americans may rejoice in that.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Obama likely to allow states to enforce tougher emissions standards  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	318 words  	WASHINGTON _ President Barack Obama will announce on Monday that he is directing the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider California's request to set stricter motor vehicle emissions and fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government, sources familiar with the decision said. LiNeBrEaKThe move will set the stage for the EPA to grant the request, which the Bush administration denied in late 2007 _ a decision Obama emphatically pledged to reverse while on the campaign trail.LiNeBrEaK"If the courts do not overturn this decision," he said in a December 2007 press release, "I will after I am elected president."LiNeBrEaKEPA administrator Lisa Jackson pledged to reconsider the request _ and hinted she supported granting it _ during her Senate confirmation hearing earlier this month. Seventeen states are set to adopt California's standards if the EPA permits them.LiNeBrEaK"This should prompt cheers from California to Maine," said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, who praised Obama as "a man of his word" for the decision.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement will come during a late-morning address Monday on jobs, energy independence and climate change, scheduled to take place in the White House East Room.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's standards would force automakers to produce cars that are far more efficient than those called for under current federal rules _ an average of 3 miles per gallon more by 2015, and 7 mpg more by 2020, by some calculations.LiNeBrEaKAuto manufacturers sued to block them, and they say their adoption could add thousands of dollars to the price of new cars.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Obama remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1010 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Obama administration plans to push ahead with efforts to aggressively limit greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming despite fears that could further slow the recessionary economy.LiNeBrEaKInstead of backing away, the administration plans to portray the limits as a boost for America's "clean energy economy," according to congressional leaders and energy experts who have talked with top Obama advisers. The step would spur competitiveness and promote investment in renewable alternatives to imported oil, the government will argue.LiNeBrEaKAt issue is the so-called cap and trade initiative, under which the government would set limits on carbon emissions by power plants, factories and other installations but allow those that emit more to buy or trade permits with companies and facilities that emit less than the prescribed limit. LiNeBrEaKThe idea is that raising the cost of pumping more carbon into the atmosphere would encourage companies and other emitters to cut back, thus reducing a principle cause of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"If we don't put a price on carbon," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, "we'll never get these clean energy sources online."LiNeBrEaKBut cap-and-trade would amount to a tax, raising energy costs. And several independent studies have suggested that emissions limits could be a drag on economic growth, a concern raised frequently by opponents of climate change legislation.LiNeBrEaK"The whole economic issue will be front and center in the debate on this," said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, who has discussed President Barack Obama's global warming plans with senior administration officials, "on both sides."LiNeBrEaKPolls show voters increasingly losing interest in the global warming issue. By pressing ahead anyway, Obama would be sticking with a program he said during the campaign would be a high priority of his presidency.LiNeBrEaK"There's a general consensus that things are going to be done with climate" in Washington this year, said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer-winning "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power," who recently updated his book with an epilogue on Obama and energy.LiNeBrEaKHe added: "We're going to go through a very intense national seminar on cap and trade and carbon tax."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKDetails of the administration's approach are far from set, though Obama has repeatedly said he favors cap-and-trade. The administration will argue that greenhouse gas restrictions should be part of a two-pronged effort to stimulate renewable energy supplies and ensure demand for the megawatts they'd produce.LiNeBrEaKThe first part is to invest heavily in wind power, solar power and biofuels, through the massive stimulus bill working its way through Congress. The second is to help that power compete with cheaper fossil fuels by pumping up fossil fuels' costs to reflect the potential economic damage from a warmed Earth.LiNeBrEaKCritics, including many Republicans on Capitol Hill, say those moves will only increase energy prices and hurt already struggling families.LiNeBrEaK"I just have concerns on the impact on the economy with all of the issues of global climate change," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who sits on the Senate's energy and environment committees, "and what restrictions there's going to be, what expenses there's going to be for American taxpayers.LiNeBrEaKEconomists generally agree that limiting emissions is likely to curb economic growth, at least in the short term. Peter Orszag, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office who now heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, told Congress last year that emissions limits would reduce long-term economic risks but "also impose costs on the economy ... in the form of higher prices for energy and energy-intensive goods."LiNeBrEaKOrszag also testified that the size of those costs could depend on whether the government sells emissions permits and if so, how it spends the proceeds. Environmentalists have recently pushed that idea one step further, arguing that if Congress passed emissions caps today, it could borrow against the future revenues from permit sales and spend the money on alternative energy research and technology.LiNeBrEaKThat would stimulate the economy and "allow polluters to transition from a high-polluting environment to a low-polluting environment," said Andy Stevenson, a former hedge fund manager who is now a finance adviser for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.LiNeBrEaKOther experts are more skeptical. Subsidizing alternative energy could stimulate the economy, said Robert Shapiro, an economic adviser to former President Bill Clinton and now chairman of the U.S. Climate Task Force. But a cap-and-trade system, he said, "would raise energy prices, at a time when you're trying to increase consumption. ... It goes against everything (Obama) campaigned on."LiNeBrEaKShapiro and many economists would prefer for the government to tax carbon emissions and refund the proceeds straight to taxpayers. The Democratic leaders working with Obama on climate legislation prefer cap-and-trade. So do a coalition of business leaders _ including Shell oil and the Big Three automakers _ who joined with some environmental groups to release an emissions-limit proposal earlier this month.LiNeBrEaKBoxer said Friday that she has learned from the defeat of a cap-and-trade bill in the Senate last year. She's set to unveil basic principles of a simpler, more focused plan within a week in hopes of passing a bill by year's end.LiNeBrEaKHer counterpart on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., talks even more optimistically: He has promised a bill by Memorial Day.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Left not sold on Obama's regulation czar pick: Cass Sunstein's critics say cost-benefit reliance tips toward industry  	Tom Hamburger and Christi Parsons, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	882 words  	Jan. 25--WASHINGTON -- Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein, a widely admired public intellectual and friend of President Barack Obama's, has spent years delving into the obscure issues of regulatory law and behavioral economics.LiNeBrEaKThough he is generally described as left-of-center, Sunstein's academic interests in regulation have led him to raise questions about the constitutionality of liberal favorites like workplace safety laws and the Clean Air Act. He has embraced a controversial "senior death discount" that calculates the lives of younger people as having a greater value than those of the elderly. LiNeBrEaKUntil recently such debates have taken place largely in the rarefied world of legal scholarship. But now that Obama has named Sunstein to serve as his regulatory czar, environmentalists and labor activists are digging into his voluminous body of work -- and wondering what policies might emanate from a man so dedicated to calculating the dollar value of every regulation.LiNeBrEaKSunstein, a former professor at the University of Chicago Law School, where Obama also taught, has reiterated in recent days his belief in "defending a strong regulatory state." Much of his academic and popular work is devoted to understanding human behavior and determining which systems will motivate people, corporations and nations to do the right thing.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental activists say his published views on cost-benefit analysis are more aligned with what they'd expect from a George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan appointee.LiNeBrEaKThe more a regulation stood to cost industry, the less likely those administrations were to impose it.LiNeBrEaK"If a Republican nominee had these views, the environmental community would be screaming for his scalp," said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, a Washington-based advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKInstead, the response has been muted, as environmental and labor groups question the wisdom of criticizing the nominee of a popular new president who has promised to support their agenda.LiNeBrEaKAt first blush, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs might sound like a remote bureaucratic outpost. Since the Reagan era, however, it has had significant influence over federal efforts to protect the public from unsafe food, toxic chemicals, polluted air, climate change and workplace hazards.LiNeBrEaKThat's because the office reviews any major regulatory idea that comes from an executive branch agency, a power well-known to business lobbyists.LiNeBrEaKThey are applauding Sunstein's appointment, hoping he might slow the march back toward aggressive regulation under Obama.LiNeBrEaKLabor and environmental advocates, on the other hand, want Democratic senators to question Sunstein closely at his confirmation hearing. Chief among their concerns are his legal theories and their potential to hamper tough regulation.LiNeBrEaKAFL-CIO legislative director Bill Samuel said Sunstein is "a respected scholar and a strong believer in government regulation."LiNeBrEaKBut he added: "We have concerns about some of his academic writings regarding his approach to regulatory policy and regulatory review. We want to hear more from him about how he intends to approach regulatory policy."LiNeBrEaKSunstein declined to comment for this story, saying he wouldn't speak publicly before confirmation hearings.LiNeBrEaKBut in an e-mail to Obama advisers this month provided to the Tribune, Sunstein said he has devoted much of his career to supporting strong regulation and to figuring out how to make it better.LiNeBrEaK"I do talk a lot about cost-benefit analysis," he wrote in the letter, "and that gets me in trouble in some quarters."LiNeBrEaKHe described his first book, "After the Rights Revolution," published in 1990, as a "sustained defense of the regulatory state, above all in the environmental area."

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Sierra Point project on hold over solar panels  	By Christine Morente San Mateo County Times  	NEWS  	445 words  	BRISBANE   The city's planning commission held off approval of a project at Sierra Point because the applicant failed to consider the use of solar panels on the property. LiNeBrEaKThe developer is pushing for energy-generating wind turbines, but Commissioner Jameel Munir wanted to see an analysis, renderings and a cost-benefit analysis of solar panels.LiNeBrEaK"Putting in solar power makes a great statement for Brisbane," he said Thursday night. "I'd like to see a certain percentage of energy from alternate energy sources, and that's not there."LiNeBrEaKThe issue is expected to come back on Feb. 26 to lay down the groundwork so alternate renewable studies are done before the project moves forward.LiNeBrEaKIf Opus West Corporation's plan is approved, it would build 438,104 square feet of office space; 1,388 parking spaces; and a 1,175-car garage on nearly 9 acres of vacant property northwest of Marina Boulevard east of U.S. Highway 101.LiNeBrEaKThe project would also incorporate the extension of the regional Bay Trail along the north and west border of the site.LiNeBrEaKThe project is expected to use 17. 5 percent less energy than a typical development of that size, said Randall Ackerman, vice president of Real Estate Development for Opus West.LiNeBrEaKThe intent is to achieve silver LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, certification, which is based on a green building-rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council.LiNeBrEaKAt the north end of the garage, two wind turbines could be installed to generate energy.LiNeBrEaKFirst, a consultant would put in an anonometer to record wind speed data and determine if the windmills are feasible for that location.LiNeBrEaKAckerman asked the commission to consider the Sierra Point project without the solar panels because there would be limited space on the office building's roof.LiNeBrEaKThe garage roof could be an option, however Opus West isn't interested in putting in the system.

The Daily News of Los Angeles 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   VALLEY EDITION	Sun can offer L.A. a world of benefits  		OPINIONATED/EDITORIAL; Pg. A14  	916 words  	AS a very young man, I witnessed how a renewable-energy project - building dams to harness the hydropower of the Tennessee River - provided a powerful economic stimulus that created thousands of what we now call green-collar jobs.LiNeBrEaKThe Tennessee Valley Authority, which I chaired under President Carter, transformed the most poverty-stricken part of America into a thriving middle- class region. LiNeBrEaKNow President Obama and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa have the same basic idea: by harnessing the sun and the wind, we can create new, green-collar jobs.LiNeBrEaKThe L.A. Solar Initiative, Measure B, on the March 3 ballot is a splendid example of how to put thousands of Angelenos to work while simultaneously combating global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn L.A., where more people die each year from air pollution than car crashes, we have the opportunity to act. We can lead the nation in the use of solar energy to actually replace fossil fuels that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is the largest and one of the dirtiest public utilities in the nation. Nearly 50 percent of its electricity comes from coal, while less than 1 percent is produced from solar.LiNeBrEaKThe Coalition for Clean Air, Coalition for Solar and Clean Energy, Los Angeles Federation of Labor AFL-CIO, and the American Lung Association have formed a coalition to support the mayor's plan to install 400 megawatts of solar power on commercial rooftops here in L.A. - more than any other city in the nation.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, the discussion and coverage thus far has dwelt on the clumsiness of the process in which this plan was presented to the voters. In fact, much of what has been said is misinformation that fails to connect this plan to the problem we all want to solve - global warming.LiNeBrEaKThis is just the kind of action that is urgently needed to help solve our climate crisis.LiNeBrEaKFaced with a global-warming crisis that threatens life as we know it, the opponents say it will cost too much. They are wrong - they can't even count the beans correctly. They estimate using numbers based on what the small solar companies are charging to put panels on individual homes - about $9 a watt.LiNeBrEaKToday, the going wholesale price is at or below $3 a watt, and going down, for the thin film product the DWP will be using in its solar panels. The best estimate of DWP installed price is $3. 75 a watt.LiNeBrEaKWhen Measure B is implemented, DWP will be buying large quantities of modules and installing them on large commercial flat rooftops. It's a basic rule of economics: Prices come tumbling down when big purchasers leverage their power in the marketplace.LiNeBrEaKIt is my considered judgment that Measure B is the lowest-cost option available for action now to combat global warming. The sun's energy is free and infinitely renewable, and the costs of capturing its power are largely borne on the front end.LiNeBrEaKSolar panels, over their 25-year life, will be cheaper than the natural-gas power they will replace when they are owned by the utility. After the initial panel installation, it is much like a hydroelectric dam. If the city owns the equipment, it gets steadily lower in cost each year as the original investment is depreciated.LiNeBrEaKSolar panels just sit there making clean power, and only the inverters that convert it to usable electricity require replacement over time.LiNeBrEaKWith the reduced interest rates for tax-free municipal bonds combined with tax credits in the early years, the costs of the solar panels are essentially the same as their value during the daylight peak hours.LiNeBrEaKFinally, with this solar program we will have inflation-proof power for 20 years - something that fossil fuels or even privately owned solar can't deliver because private power purchase contracts have escalation clauses in them that make them more expensive over time.LiNeBrEaKPublic ownership that doesn't charge the customer to make a profit is another reason this is such a good deal for L.A. That is also why the DWP's rates are significantly lower than Edison's rates in L.A. County.LiNeBrEaKBut there are other major benefits of Measure B.LiNeBrEaKMeasure B will help stimulate our economy by creating thousands of well-paying, green-collar jobs on which people can raise a family.LiNeBrEaKIt includes a preference for solar manufacturers based here in Los Angeles. This means the DWP, by switching to solar, invests directly back into L.A. It also means solar manufacturers, who are building facilities and creating tens of thousands of jobs across the country, will have a significant incentive to locate in L.A. and bring those new jobs here.LiNeBrEaKUsing solar power instead of gas-fired power will significantly reduce air pollution - an important benefit hardly mentioned in the debate thus far.LiNeBrEaKSolar power installed on rooftops in Los Angeles will help the DWP reduce power failures throughout the city because it will supply power at the load center where these failures typically occur during peak usage, when the sun is hottest. Strategic placement of the solar panels in places where the distribution system is weak will improve the power reliability, something that is worth a lot to those who would otherwise suffer blackouts on hot summer days when the solar panels will be strong.LiNeBrEaKAs the former general manager of the DWP who got rid of two coal-fired power plants while avoiding rate increases and blackouts, it is my considered opinion that Measure B is the lowest-cost option available for action now to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKIt is a giant step forward in the mayor's promise of a green Los Angeles.

Enid News and Eagle (Oklahoma)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Obama earns respect from Sen. Inhofe  	Cindy Allen, Enid News and Eagle, Okla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	727 words  	Jan. 25--President Barack Obama has been in office less than a week, but he's already earned some respect from one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate.LiNeBrEaKSen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., was in Enid Friday to visit Vance Air Force Base and visit with officials here about what he foresees in the political environment for the military. So far, Inhofe thinks Obama has struck the right tone as far as support for the military.LiNeBrEaK"If you'll look at last Tuesday's inaugural message, there were two strong military messages," Inhofe said. "I think a lot of that he is a very smart person, he knew what he had to do to get elected and he had the far left clearly on his side. Now, he's rising to the occasion of governing. I believe that." LiNeBrEaKInhofe said he was im-pressed with the scene in Washington on inauguration day. He said he awoke at 5 a.m. and went out on the mall to walk among the people.LiNeBrEaK"It was something I haven't seen in my life," he said. "There was a feeling of there's been a renaissance, a transformation, a major change."LiNeBrEaKInhofe praised Obama for reaching out to the Republican leadership after the election. After personal conversations with Obama about the military, Inhofe said he feels "comfortable we're going to continue the rebuilding" of the military.LiNeBrEaKInhofe said he also believes Obama will be reasonable when it comes to really closing the detention center at Guan-tanamo Bay. He said signing the executive order to close the facility was the political thing to do, but he has room to change his mind.LiNeBrEaKInhofe said he also sees some give and take from Obama regarding the environment. Inhofe said he vehemently opposes Obama's pick of Carol Browner as energy czar. Browner headed the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clinton administration. Inhofe said he is concerned she is going to propose major changes that will be costly.LiNeBrEaKInhofe said he was happy to hear Obama mention the environment just briefly in his inaugural message.LiNeBrEaK"(Obama) and I talked, and I said I only ask you one thing -- consider the economics of anything Carol tries to talk you into," Inhofe said.LiNeBrEaKInhofe has been an outspoken critic of science regarding human factors in global warming, and he said he's getting more support from his fellow senators. He said there are some conservative Democrats that also are concerned about any expensive environmental proposalsLiNeBrEaKOne area he has concerns with the Obama administration is in spending and the stimulus package. Inhofe was against the original $750 billion bailout package, and he was against allowing all the decisions on those monies to be left in the hands of the administration with no accountability.LiNeBrEaK"Obama is under a lot of pressure to do a stimulus program," Inhofe said. "We're looking at trillions, not billions of dollars. I blame both the Democrats and the Repub-licans for starting that level of thinking on money."LiNeBrEaKEven though he disagreed with the Bush deficits, he said the total of all those deficits is only about a third of what's being discussed with the bailout and stimulus programs.LiNeBrEaKIf there is a stimulus package, Inhofe said the money needs to be increased for highways. Right now, the House version of a stimulus package calls for $30 billion for highways, with Oklahoma getting around $400 million.LiNeBrEaKHe said he has worked with other senators to put together a letter asking for more money for highways. He said Oklahoma has one of the best department of transportation directors in Gary Ridley, and there are projects right now that have been identified and are ready to go.LiNeBrEaK"That's the one thing in the stimulus program that would really stimulate anything," he said.LiNeBrEaKInhofe also was complimentary of some of Obama's cabinet picks, including Hillary Clinton as secretary of state and Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary.LiNeBrEaKHe said he's positive about the military installations in Oklahoma, saying there may be opportunity in training the Iraqi and Afghan military with the T-6s.

The Fresno Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Overturn EPA's bad decision: California should get waiver for new greenhouse gas emissions standards.  	The Fresno Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	665 words  	Jan. 25--The Obama administration isn't wasting any time getting to work, and we'd like to add one more chore to the fast-track list: Overturning the Bush administration's opposition to California's aggressive attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe state passed the law in 2002. It sets new fuel standards for autos and trucks in an effort to reduce those emissions blamed for global climate change. California is the world's 12th largest producer of the emissions, and its efforts to reduce that pollution can have real consequences. LiNeBrEaKThe standards the state has adopted are more stringent than federal rules, which California -- alone among the states -- is allowed to do under the terms of the 1967 Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKThat's because California was already regulating air pollution when the Clean Air Act was passed. Under the federal law, other states may adopt California's standards or obey the less stringent federal rules; they may not strike out on their own.LiNeBrEaKBut California must get a waiver from the federal Environmental Protection Agency when it wishes to adopt stricter rules. In the past, the EPA never flatly denied such a waiver request. This time it did, despite the fact that legal and scientific experts at the agency recommended approval.LiNeBrEaKIt was pretty clear that pressure from the auto industry was behind the move, although the EPA and the Bush White House denied that. The automakers and the Bush administration said they wanted a single, nationwide standard for fuel efficiency in vehicles instead of many different ones.LiNeBrEaKThat was a specious argument. What California proposed to do would probably amount to a de facto national standard, because so many states are choosing the California proposal. At last count, 13 had adopted the more stringent standards, and three others were getting ready to do so. Those states account for about half the nation's population, meaning that there would be, at most, two standards -- and probably only one, since the automakers have already lost this battle in court, and would be well advised to throw in the towel and just build cars to the stricter California standards.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's rules could, in fact, help the beleaguered automakers, if it means they build more fuel efficient cars that are more attractive to consumers.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent a letter to the new president just the day after the inauguration, asking him to move quickly to reverse the Bush administration's denial of the EPA waiver. Obama's nominee for the top job at EPA, Lisa Jackson, hasn't been confirmed by the Senate yet, but that's likely to happen soon. When it does, we hope she will move quickly to do the right thing and give California the permission it needs to proceed.LiNeBrEaKHow quickly is up in the air. California Air Resources Board chairwoman Mary Nichols -- herself on the short list for the EPA job that Jackson will fill -- believes the process can be put on a fast track, since the EPA already has an "ample record" to help it reconsider the Bush administration decision.LiNeBrEaKThe signs are good. During the presidential campaign, Obama backed California's approach, and while in the Senate he was a co-sponsor of a bill by Sen. Barbara Boxer to force EPA approval of the waiver.LiNeBrEaKAnd Jackson told Boxer at her confirmation hearing last week that, "If I'm confirmed, I will immediately revisit the waiver."LiNeBrEaKWhat the EPA did in 2007 was a mistake. The new administration should move as rapidly as possible to repair the damage.LiNeBrEaKTell us what you think.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	Scientists find breakthrough in D.C.;  President Obama promises to loosen restrictions placed by Bush administration 		NATIONAL; Pg. A11  	768 words  	WASHINGTON -- When he vowed in his inaugural address to "restore science to its rightful place," President Barack Obama signaled an end to eight years of tension between science and government.LiNeBrEaKBut many of the Bush administration's restrictions on science, like those governing stem cell research, will take time to be removed. And whether the Obama administration entirely reverses Bush's strict controls over the government's main scientific agencies remains to be seen.LiNeBrEaKStill, many scientists are exuberant. Staff members throughout the government's scientific agencies held inaugural parties last week, and many reported being teary-eyed with joy. LiNeBrEaK"If you look at the science world, you see a lot of happy faces," said Frank Press, a former president of the National Academy of Sciences and former science adviser to President Jimmy Carter. "It's not just getting money. It's his recognition of what science can do to bring this country back in an innovative way."LiNeBrEaKSuppressed findingsLiNeBrEaKOn issues such as stem cells, climate change, sex education and contraceptives, the Bush administration sought to tame and, in some cases, suppress the findings of many federal scientific agencies. Besides discouraging scientific pronouncements that contradicted administration policies, officials insisted on tight control over even routine functions of key agencies.LiNeBrEaKIn early 2004, more than 60 influential scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, issued a statement claiming the Bush administration had systematically distorted scientific fact in the service of policy goals on the environment, health, biomedical research and nuclear weaponry.LiNeBrEaKThe administration, it said, "misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implications of its policies."LiNeBrEaKJust last month, the inspector general of the Interior Department determined agency officials often interfered with scientific work in order to limit protection for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKThese are the sort of wounds to scientific integrity Obama promised to heal in his inaugural address.LiNeBrEaKNo easy taskLiNeBrEaKIt will take more time to do what officials in the Obama administration's transition teams have also promised, to reverse many of the policies scientists found objectionable.LiNeBrEaKThis week, for instance, Obama is expected to announce an end to Bush's restrictions on human embryonic stem cell research. But, until new regulations are written and formalized, laboratories that have received grants to investigate human embryonic stem cells will still have to confine their research to lines created before Bush's order in 2001.LiNeBrEaK"In the area of stem cell policy, there was a fair degree of discussion and, one might even say, tension between the views of the agency and the Bush administration," said Dr. Raynard Kington, acting director of the National Institutes of Health.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the institutes are "prepared to respond quickly in how to implement that planned change" in stem cell policy, Kington said the process likely will take months.LiNeBrEaKObama transition officials said the new administration will loosen the oversight the Bush administration imposed over scientific agencies.LiNeBrEaKDuring the Bush years, for instance, Food and Drug Administration officials could not issue even routine press releases without approval from supervisors at the Department of Health and Human Services. The result was a backlog that caused some announcements to be issued days after the events in question occurred. Some documents advising industry about how to follow some agency rules were never issued. Warning letters to pharmaceutical companies required additional review by agency lawyers. The result: the number of such letters plunged.LiNeBrEaKWilliam Hubbard, an associate FDA commissioner who retired in 2005, said top Bush administration officials were so reflexively opposed to nearly all regulations that, even when consumer groups, industry associations, scientists and drug agency officials all agreed that new rules were needed, top officials rejected them. With less stringent oversight, agency officials most likely soon will issue new rules to prevent contamination of eggs and produce and to tighten the oversight of imports, Hubbard said.LiNeBrEaKAt the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, former Director Julie Gerberding e-mailed to agency staff members a 1,600-word farewell Wednesday defending her reorganization efforts, which many critics said vastly weakened the agency.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration must decide whether unwinding her changes would cause more harm than good. Whatever the answer, the tumult of the multiyear reorganization will linger for a long time.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Tweak gardening practices as the weather goes to extremes  	Georgia Tasker, The Miami Herald  	LIFESTYLE  	1002 words  	Jan. 25--As climate change brings weather extremes, hotter temperatures and increasing demand on a diminishing water supply, not only our gardens but our gardening techniques must be fine tuned.LiNeBrEaKHere are some ways in which you can cope with climate change and its impacts on the landscape:LiNeBrEaKMake sure you are irrigating only when and what you must. LiNeBrEaKFertilize judiciously, watching plants for signs of nutrient deficiency.LiNeBrEaKMake and apply compost that will lessen the landfill bulk and benefit your plants.LiNeBrEaKLearn to recognize plant stress.LiNeBrEaKKeep abreast of new weeds, insects and diseases.LiNeBrEaKKeeping the irrigation system in top shape is like keeping the lawn mower blade sharp. It makes sense. Among the smartest things we did last year was to have the sprinkler system inspected.LiNeBrEaKBecause we were watering before sun-up, beginning at 4 a.m., we seldom saw the sprinklers working. Our zoned areas for the lawn began tzt-tzt-tzting long before even the dogs were awake. Simply by watching each zone run on "test" we were able to find major and minor leaks, thanks to the Mobile Irrigation Lab, which offers free inspection for systems in Miami-Dade County. Sprinkler heads eventually were readjusted or replaced; the missing rain gauge no longer is missing; the backwash device is installed.LiNeBrEaK(For the Miami-Dade Mobile Irrigation Lab, call 305-242-1288. Palm Beach and Broward counties share a mobile lab: 561-683-2285, ext. 113.)LiNeBrEaKConsider microirrigation devices or Leaky Pipe, the hoses that sweat, to direct water to plant root zones. Save the tzt-tzt-tzting for the lawn, and reduce its size by expanding planting beds.LiNeBrEaKFertilizing regularly produces healthy plants, but also pushes growth. New growth means plants require more water. Can a plant be healthy and water-thrifty at the same time?LiNeBrEaKYes. We are over-waterers here, for starters. By cutting back on water, rather than threatening the life of most plants, you may be prolonging it. However, as the gardener in charge, you must learn to interpret what the plant is telling you about its health and provide nutrients when you see something amiss -- if you are not being preemptive and using controlled-release fertilizer in spare amounts.LiNeBrEaKWhile native plants are pretty self-reliant, there is a way to tell when your natives and non-natives need help in our poor soils: Read their leaves. They will send signals this way.LiNeBrEaKNitrogen deficiency: Leaves that are pale yellow, from the top of the plant to the bottom, need nitrogen. They will die back from the tips.LiNeBrEaKManganese: New leaves will show blotches, mottling and turn yellow when lacking manganese. Plants will have skimpy blooms. Palms will produce yellow fronds much reduced in size and brown along the edges.LiNeBrEaKMagnesium: Older leaves will show yellow mottling between veins, starting at the leaf tip. The margins will curl. In orchids, leaves will turn red.LiNeBrEaKIron: Yellow between veins; eventually even veins turn yellow. This sometimes occurs with manganese deficiency.LiNeBrEaKPotassium deficiency in palms is especially rampant in our soils. Old fronds have orange or yellow flecks.LiNeBrEaKControlled-release palm fertilizer 8-2-12 with 4 percent magnesium is ideal for South Florida's alkaline soils as it provides minerals over time, including extra potassium that palms require, plus micronutrients.LiNeBrEaKComposting returns nutrients to the earth and allows plants to absorb them readily. Compost allows the microflora and microfauna in the soil to flourish. Recycle kitchen waste (including coffee grounds in paper filters), add garden soil, leaves, pine needles, etc.LiNeBrEaKFor an excellent tutorial on composting, see www.compostinfo.com, a site from the University of Florida. It takes only a few months to create a barrel-full.LiNeBrEaKDo not throw small amounts of yard waste on the trash pile, instead chop up leaves and twigs and add to the compost.LiNeBrEaKRemove weeds by hand. Not only are they unattractive, they are thieves. They steal nutrients and water needed by ornamental plants.LiNeBrEaKFicus whitefly, lobate lac scale, pink hibiscus mealybug, laurel wilt disease on red bay and avocados, citrus greening, cabbage palm disease . . . all of these new pests and diseases are thriving in our climate. When plants become stressed, insects and diseases can easily find a foothold.LiNeBrEaKWhat to do when plants are heat-stressed in summer? Craig Morell, chief horticulturist at Pinecrest Gardens, has this answer: In a gallon of water, mix 2 teaspoons of 20-20-20; and 1 tablespoon each of Lesco Iron Plus Liquid, Lesco High Manganese Liquid, potassium nitrate, magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt) and non-grease-cutting dish detergent, such as Ivory or Publix generic. Apply as a spray or crown or root drench.LiNeBrEaKMorell suggests using this four times a year. However, in summer, when nighttime temperatures do not go below 75 and daytime is above 90, a combination of Epsom salt and potassium nitrate (1 tablespoon each per gallon) may be used once a month on plants with a need for metals, such as gardenias and shrimp plants, or plants that show bleached leaves or other stress.LiNeBrEaK"I don't believe warming will be so quick that plants can't adapt, but flowering trees need seasonality and if we continue to get warmer winters, we will lose them," he says.LiNeBrEaKHe is watching poincianas flower later and holding flowers into November; tabebuias are flowering as often as three times a year.LiNeBrEaK"Spring is coming earlier," Morell said. "Winters are getting warmer and warmer; plants are getting softer and softer. If we get a freeze, we're in deep trouble."LiNeBrEaKAs plants disappear from your garden because of heat, cold or stress, replace them with natives or drought-tolerant specimens.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	South Miami leaders debate public works hire: The City Commission discussed the hiring of a public works and planning director and other issues for hours during Tuesday's meeting.  	Erika Capek, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	492 words  	Jan. 25--With three items on the agenda and the city manager's report, the South Miami City Commission meeting managed to take three hours, frustrating residents in attendance. LiNeBrEaKCity manager Ajibola Balogun's report took up the majority of the time regarding the hiring of a new public works director and planning director and tentative route plans for Florida Power and Light lines to come through South Miami.LiNeBrEaKThe route will need to be decided by February or March and the application is due in June.LiNeBrEaK"We need to protect the Ludlam Trail at all costs," said Commissioner Jay Beckman.LiNeBrEaKNewly elected commissioner Valerie Newman suggested coming up with a compromise for everyone such as burying the lines, since most residents don't want the lines running through their neighborhoods.LiNeBrEaKThe commissioners plan to attend a workshop in the next few weeks to further discuss this issue.LiNeBrEaKIn regards to the hiring of a public works and planning director, the commission came to a disagreement. Mayor Horace Feliu and Beckman thought the city has been fine for half a year without one and has saved money.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Vice Mayor Brian Beasley, Commissioner Velma Palmer and Newman agreed to pass a motion to "direct the city manager to place legitimate ads in legitimate publications to hire a public works and planning director."LiNeBrEaKSome residents agreed the position needed to be filled.LiNeBrEaK"You guys spent 45 minutes talking about hiring a public works and planning director," said resident Sharon McCain. "It's your responsibility to hire responsible department heads."LiNeBrEaKIn other action Tuesday, the commission passed 3-2 a resolution adopting a proposed work program prepared by the Green Task Force which will result in South Miami becoming carbon-neutral by 2030.LiNeBrEaKFeliu, Newman and Beasley voted in favor of the resolution.LiNeBrEaK"We need to have a milestone and quantifiable means of measuring the progress we're making through the years," Feliu said.LiNeBrEaKNewman agreed, saying global warming is a "very real issue."LiNeBrEaKHowever, Beckman said there's much misinformation about global warming and that he doesn't understand the commitment to 2030 when the parameters are going to change.LiNeBrEaKAn amendment was also made to the resolution with the same results allowing the Green Task Force to utilize the city's grant writers and lobbyist and to update the city manager about progress and applications.LiNeBrEaKThe last item regarding a resolution about the installation of a wall sign on the historic Shelley building was quickly approved by a 5-0 vote.LiNeBrEaKThe next commission meeting will be Feb. 3 at 7: 30 p.m.	CITY GOVERNMENT (96%); TALKS and MEETINGS (91%); CITIES (90%); APPROVALS (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (61%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%); FLORIDA POWER and LIGHT CO (57%)  	Arts  	MIAMI, FL, USA (94%) FLORIDA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 25, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090125-MI-South-Miami-leaders-debate-public-works-hire-0125  	Newspaper  	MI  	2009 The Miami Herald   																
The New York Post 		January 25, 2009 Sunday 	'TRUTH' IS, DIRECTOR HAS BOLTED  		All Editions; Pg. 10  	323 words  	FAMED "Exorcist" director William "Billy" Friedkin has just walked out of the La Scala operatic production of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth," citing "creative differences" with the script by Pulitzer-nominated J.D. "Sandy" McClatchy.   LiNeBrEaKAn insider said there was tension between Friedkin, a notorious diva, and McClatchy from the start, although "Billy got Sandy hired onto the project in the first place."  LiNeBrEaKMcClatchy wrote a "top-rate" libretto treatment for the famed opera company in Milan, Italy. The assignment "was not easy," the insider said: "Nobody wants an opera about global warming, so Sandy turned it into an actual story with characters."  LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, Friedkin had more grandiose ideas. "Billy wanted it to be like a Cirque du Soleil production," our source said. McClatchy balked, and the composer and La Scala backed him up.  LiNeBrEaKFriedkin is known for a heavy hand doctoring scripts. In screenwriter Joe Eszterhas' "Hollywood Animal: A Memoir," Eszterhas claimed that in 1994, Friedkin's wife Sherry Lansing, then head of Paramount Pictures, made him issue a statement that he supported Paramount's hiring of Friedkin as director for his "Jade" script.  LiNeBrEaKIn fact, Eszterhas did not want Friedkin, whom he considered a "washed-up has-been," to direct the picture, but gave in to Lansing's wishes. Eszterhas protested privately that Friedkin was butchering his script, but Paramount paid him millions for his silence. The movie with Linda Fiorentino and David Caruso was a bomb.  LiNeBrEaKSince 2006, Friedkin has directed operas, but his ego remains undimmed. Of Alfred Hitchcock, Friedkin once said, "I don't give a flying [bleep] . . . I'm not a worshipper of his, nor have I ever set out to emulate him. But I'm glad people deify directors, because I make more money that way."  LiNeBrEaKA rep for Friedkin didn't return calls and McClatchy - who was just appointed president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters - couldn't be reached.

The New York Post 		January 25, 2009 Sunday 	A POX ON ALL THE CELEBUTARDS  	ANDREA PEYSER   	All Editions; Pg. 26  	621 words  	Celebutards. They eat, sleep and breed just like ordinary humans. But at some point between the moment a movie script wanders into the hands of a world-class celebutard such as George Clooney, and the words travel through lilting vocal chords and land on unsuspecting ears, something terrible occurs. LiNeBrEaKA dull thinker such as Madonna becomes a self-appointed sage. Sean Penn boldly breaks bread with tyrants and enemies of his country, and vapid pop singer Sheryl Crow calls for rationing toilet paper to one sheet per sitting.  LiNeBrEaKCelebutards have long been my obsession, as well as my curse. I can't fathom why intelligent people can't be bothered to vote, yet they well know the political ravings of a Michael Moore, and trust the World Trade Center conspiracy theories of a Rosie O'Donnell. With time and attention, these wackos only gain power and credibility. In an age when fabulousness is too often mistaken for gravitas, we must be vigilant. We must know the difference between philosophers and blowhards, between Soren Kierkegaard and Susan Sarandon. We must know our celebutards. LiNeBrEaKHere are five of my favorites. Chose your own! LiNeBrEaKBRANGELINA  LiNeBrEaKThey go together. Like Hollywood and glamour. Tattoos and body piercings. Like celebutards and their mission to save the planet. They are Angelina Jolie, the bisexual, bloodobsessed, brother-kissing Illustrated Woman who could badly use a sandwich, and Brad Pitt, the Angelina-obsessed hunk who could badly use a shave. LiNeBrEaKBrad and Angie set out to create a village, and they did - ignoring homegrown orphans to accumulate an international brood. "I think we'll crap out somewhere between seven and nine children," Brad told Charlie Rose. LiNeBrEaKBARBRA STREISAND LiNeBrEaKIn the celebutard field, there exists stiff competition for the title Dumbest Woman Alive. On her Web site, Babs mixed up "Iran" and "Irag" - as she spelled it. At Madison Square Garden she dressed down a heckler with the words, "Shut the f - - - up!" For all this and more, she wins the title. LiNeBrEaKBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN LiNeBrEaKI used to believe in Bruce Springsteen. I also used to believe in the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny and Hanukkah Harry. Bruce's song "41 Shots" condemned the tragic, but mistaken, shooting of African immigrant Amadou Diallo by cops. "I consider it an outrage that he would be trying to fatten his wallet by reopening the wounds of this tragic case," said Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch. LiNeBrEaKAL GORE  LiNeBrEaKIt may appear problematic to include Gore with celebutards such as Paris Hilton. Gore served as vice president. Paris served time. But each won fame, fortune and the best restaurant tables due to his fawning entr&eacute;e into Hollywood. LiNeBrEaKAs Gore's movie, "An Inconvenient Truth" - an exaggerated global-warming fantasy masquerading as a documentary - won an Oscar, realize that one should do as Gore says, not as he does. Gore's Nashville estate was drinking electricity and natural gas at a rate 20 times the national average. LiNeBrEaKOPRAH WINFREY  LiNeBrEaKThe most powerful woman in America was not born rich or royal. Host of the highest rated daytime talk show in TV history, Oprah wields the power to move merchandise and elect presidents. To make life worth living. She is Oprah. She is our queen. LiNeBrEaKOprah has called this her "crash" moment - when she suffered unspeakable racism. It came when Oprah was denied entry, 15 minutes past closing time, at the Hermes boutique in Paris, where signature Birkin bags start at $6,000. "Do you know who I am?" Oprah barked. The store apologized. It won't discriminate against Oprah again.

The New York Times 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	All-Electric Vehicles Bought for Airport  	By DIANA MARSZALEK  	Section WE; Column 0; Westchester Weekly Desk; ENVIRONMENT WHITE PLAINS; Pg. 5  	668 words  	  AS part of its continuing effort to reduce the Westchester County Airport's toll on the environment, the county has replaced all of the airport's motorized ground service equipment, like aircraft tractors, water trucks and baggage loaders, with electric versions.LiNeBrEaK  Based on the current price of gasoline, the new equipment is expected to save the county about $200,000 a year in fuel costs, and it will eliminate the emission of 27,000 tons of greenhouse gases over the vehicles' 14-year life span, county and environmental officials said. The previous equipment used about 121,000 gallons of fuel a year, they said. LiNeBrEaK  The 25 pieces of new equipment cost a total of $2. 47 million. A Federal Aviation Administration grant covered $1. 1 million of that cost. The airport paid for the rest, county officials said.LiNeBrEaK  County Executive Andrew J. Spano said at a Jan. 14 news conference announcing the purchases that, given the fuel costs, the airport expects to recoup the cost of the equipment in five to six years. The environmental benefit -- reducing emissions that cause global warming -- will be more immediate, he said. ''It's getting carbon out of the atmosphere,'' Mr. Spano said.LiNeBrEaK  Lawrence C. Salley, the county transportation commissioner, described the acquisition of the electric equipment as one step in a multifaceted effort by the airport to become increasingly environmentally friendly. LiNeBrEaK  Westchester County Airport, one of a handful of airports that have been certified for meeting international environmental standards,  continually evaluates its operations' impact on the environment and looks for ways to reduce it, Mr. Salley said.LiNeBrEaK  Besides using environmentally friendly equipment and products, like deicers, the airport also monitors water quality at the adjacent Kensico Reservoir, has put in place a spill-prevention program and protects airport wetlands, Mr. Salley said.LiNeBrEaK  Airport noise, recycling programs and waste disposal also are regularly evaluated and improved when possible, he said. LiNeBrEaK  ''This is not just one activity,'' he said. ''This is an entire environmental management system.''LiNeBrEaK  The airport's pursuit of the new equipment was backed with seed money from the New York Power Authority and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. Both promote clean transportation programs.LiNeBrEaK  The Westchester County Airport is the fifth airport in the state that has worked with the Power Authority to initiate energy-efficient projects, Power Authority officials said. Kennedy International, La Guardia, Albany International and Stewart International are the others.LiNeBrEaK  ''This is what we need to be doing everywhere,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the Power Authority's president and chief executive, adding that the impact of clean air programs reach beyond Westchester County. LiNeBrEaK  ''People all over the world will benefit,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  Robert G. Callender,  vice president for programs at the State Energy Research and Development Authority, agreed. Westchester Airport's acquisition of electric equipment, Mr. Callender said, is in keeping with Gov. David A. Paterson's larger goal of New York's being a leader in the use of clean technology.LiNeBrEaK  LUKE TONACHEL, a vehicles analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City, said the airport's switch to electric vehicles is a worthy step toward the larger goal of reducing harmful pollution. LiNeBrEaK  ''It makes good sense,'' Mr. Tonachel said, adding that reducing oil consumption, local pollution and emissions that contribute to global warming are all benefits and that ''electric equipment is also likely to be cheaper.'' LiNeBrEaK  There also will be more eco-friendly projects to come at the airport, Mr. Spano said. Officials are evaluating the option of using natural gas for heating systems, which would reduce emissions and allow for the removal of 63 underground oil tanks, he said. Encouraging private operators, like private jet providers, to use electric equipment  will also likely occur in the near future, he said.

Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Growing piles of problems: Fears mount on how OUC handles ash from coal plant  	Kevin Spear, The Orlando Sentinel, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1243 words  	Jan. 25--Flick on a light switch, turn up the thermostat, cook a casserole or vacuum the rug, and a pile of noxious ash near Orlando grows bigger.LiNeBrEaKIt comes from burning more than 2 million tons of coal every year at the Curtis H. Stanton Energy Center electric plant east of Orlando. City residents contribute more than they might think. Electrical output for an average home generates more than 500 pounds of ash every year.LiNeBrEaKHarm caused by fueling power plants with coal -- from mining that flattens Appalachian forests to air pollution that triggers global warming -- has been a long-standing concern. But today, fears are growing over the way the nation stores this ash laced with the nastiest ingredients of coal, including arsenic, lead, mercury and radioactive elements.LiNeBrEaKCongress is starting to talk tough about regulating the stuff, and the person named to run the Environmental Protection Agency has put coal ash at the top of her agenda. With the Obama administration expected to turn toward more-aggressive environmental enforcement, individual states will be under greater pressure to follow that lead. LiNeBrEaKThe good news is, better pollution controls have reduced the fine ash, mercury and chemicals that cause smog and acid rain that goes through power-plant chimneys and into the atmosphere. The bad news is, that bad stuff is going somewhere else.LiNeBrEaKAs recently as December, a liquid sludge of coal ash burst from a dam at a Tennessee plant, releasing a billion gallons that smothered hundreds of acres and fouled nearby rivers.LiNeBrEaKOUC told to investigateLiNeBrEaKIn Florida, utilities get rid of coal ash in ways not as likely to result in a massive spill. Still worrisome, however, are the toxic ingredients that can leach from ash piles and gradually seep into surrounding soil and aquifers.LiNeBrEaKSometime early this year, Florida environmental regulators expect to ask the city-owned Orlando Utilities Commission to investigate its power-plant ash pile in east Orange County. Those officials suspect the relatively young landfill is leaking too much radioactivity into the waters of the area's shallow underground aquifer.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery of elevated radioactivity, emitted possibly by uranium and radium found in coal, could be a red flag that the lining installed to contain ash pollutants is failing. The liner was approved by authorities to be effective for a long time: forever. The ash pile, resembling an elongated hill and holding several million tons, is a permanent disposal place.LiNeBrEaKState authorities say there isn't an immediate threat to people. The 70-foot-tall ash pile stands between OUC's power plant and the Orange County landfill. The nearest subdivisions of Eastwood and Avalon Park are more than 2 miles away.LiNeBrEaK"The good thing is, it's out there by itself," said Tom Lubozynski, a state Department of Environmental Protection administrator in Orlando.LiNeBrEaKFeds eye tighter rulesLiNeBrEaKWhile state officials wait to learn more, federal authorities are likely to push for tighter restrictions.LiNeBrEaKLisa P.

She also signaled interest in tighter regulations.LiNeBrEaK"The EPA currently has, and has in the past, assessed its regulatory options, and I think it is time to re-ask those questions," she told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.LiNeBrEaKIn 2001, EPA officials proposed to label coal ash as a contingent hazardous waste, meaning the agency would deem properly managed ash dumps as nonhazardous, and improperly stored ash as hazardous.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal soon vanished because of industry resistance, said Stephen Smith, director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. That group, along with Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project, is now lobbying for stiffer federal controls.LiNeBrEaKTwo weeks ago, U.S. Rep. Nick J.

Environmentalists prefer that ash be disposed in a dry form -- as at OUC's plant -- and under more stringent rules for construction and environmental monitoring.LiNeBrEaKPotentially at stake for OUC is whether the utility will have to install a more expensive and more durable liner, built with clay and sheets of chemically resistant plastic, under future deposits of ash. Such a measure, if needed, would help ensure that future generations don't inherit a heap of a toxic mess.LiNeBrEaKAt the rate of disposal during its first 20 years, the 312-acre landfill has room for an additional half-century's worth of ash.LiNeBrEaKFor complete illustrations, see printed copy.LiNeBrEaKCoal power's dirty sideLiNeBrEaKDon't think of the Orlando Utilities Commission plant as fire-breathing and smoke-belching. The plant's 2 coal-fired generators are relatively young, clean -- you can tour in office clothes -- and better than average at controlling pollution. But the plant's appetites and wastes are enormous. Here's a look:LiNeBrEaKAir Pollution (2007): Discharges of 6,468 tons of sulfur dioxide (acid rain, particles), 8,761 tons of nitrogen oxides (smog). That's better than average but more than limits allow today. Also released: 6. 5 million tons of carbon dioxide, or as much as 1. 3 million small cars emit.LiNeBrEaKCooling Towers: Twin towers evaporate 10 million gallons daily of recycled sewage in a process that cools boiler water for reuse.LiNeBrEaKCoal consumption (2008): The plant consumed 2. 4 million tons of coal, arriving in 240 trainloads.LiNeBrEaKCoal Ash Landfill: 312 acres, 70 feet to top, now holds 5. 8 million tons of ash and lime, with space for an additional 15 million tons. Ash buried here in 2007 contained about 1. 7 million pounds of arsenic, 600,000 pounds of lead, 3,540 pounds of mercury and 2. 7 million pounds of nickel.LiNeBrEaKSOURCES: OUC, Sentinel research	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL MINING (90%); AIR POLLUTION (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); WATER POLLUTION (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (77%); ACID RAIN (75%); FINES and PENALTIES (75%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (75%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (73%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (73%); NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY (73%); CITY LIFE (71%); CITIES (71%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); SMOG (70%); INVESTIGATIONS (69%); APPROVALS (68%); LANDFILLS (64%)  	ORLANDO UTILITIES COMMISSION (64%)  	Construction  	ORLANDO, FLORIDA, USA (95%) FLORIDA, USA (95%); TENNESSEE, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090125-OS-Growing-piles-of-problems-Fears-mount-on-how-OUC-handles-ash-from-coal-plant-0125  	Newspaper  	OS  	2009 Orlando Sentinel   	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (55%)

Palo Alto Daily News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Forum seeks to encourage resident participation in housing update  	Joshua Melvin, Palo Alto Daily News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	420 words  	Jan. 25--A local group is trying to boost area residents' interest in the updating of statewide housing goals with a forum Monday in Mountain View.LiNeBrEaKInstead of taking a numbers or policy-heavy approach, the League of Women Voters of Los Altos-Mountain View-sponsored forum will attempt to show residents how the housing element connects with environmental and social issues, co-organizer Sue Russell said. The element is a portion of the guide for growth all California cities have, the general plan. State law requires that the element -- which plans for both low- and higher-income housing -- be updated every seven years to account for population growth. LiNeBrEaKThe event is slated to open with a presentation from Don Weden, former lead planner for the Santa Clara County Planning Department. Weden said his talk will cover major challenges the Bay Area is facing. An aging population, the end of consistently cheap oil, higher food prices and climate change all need to be taken into account when planning how and where new housing is built, Weden said.LiNeBrEaK"We have got to plan to become more intelligently urban," he said. "It's about creating livable, green, urban neighborhoods."LiNeBrEaKFollowing Weden's talk, Los Altos and Mountain View planning department representatives will get a chance to respond.LiNeBrEaKRussell said the planners were sent a series of hard questions on topics like how cities intend to house an aging population and reduce greenhouse gas production through urban planning. Russell, a retired affordable housing project planner, said she is hoping for answers but isn't certain she will get them.LiNeBrEaK"I think some of these questions haven't been asked before," she said.LiNeBrEaKBut even having the topics broached could motivate attendees to get involved in the housing element update. In the coming months, area cities will be holding public forums where residents can voice their ideas, Russell said.LiNeBrEaKEach city's element is due to the California Department of Housing and Community Development by June 30 and will be valid until 2014.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully it will get people thinking," Russell said of Monday's forum.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	How we select front-page stories for our paper  		REVIEW and OPINION; Pg. F01  	554 words  	A local explosion would probably make it.LiNeBrEaKA bombing in Iraq might not.LiNeBrEaKA local woman becoming the state's Teacher of the Year would make it.LiNeBrEaKA United Nations report on global warming might not.LiNeBrEaKWe are often asked: How do The Patriot-News editors choose stories for the front page? The answer lies in the role of a local newspaper in today's digital age.LiNeBrEaKMost of us now get our breaking news electronically. Our own Web site, PennLive.com, features up-to-the-minute local news stories and video -- often 25 or 30 local stories each day. LiNeBrEaKSo what do we hope to give you on the front page of your print newspaper each morning?LiNeBrEaKFor starters, we're a local paper and most of the stories will be about the midstate or Pennsylvania. That doesn't mean we think the local Teacher of the Year is more important than a cease-fire in Gaza. It means you've probably already heard about the cease-fire by the time you pick up the paper in your driveway or at the store.LiNeBrEaKWhen we run stories about national or world events, we try to give you the big picture. We go beyond the headlines to tell you what the news means, what's coming next, or what you can do about it.LiNeBrEaKOne of the most common perceptions people have about the front page is that it has to include only the most "important" stories -- which usually means the most serious ones.LiNeBrEaKSerious stories are important. But we could fill the paper twice over daily with stories about crime, strife or social ills.LiNeBrEaKThere is more to our beloved midstate than that. There is more to us as Americans than that.LiNeBrEaKSo you might find a story about something serious and important on our Local and State section, while our front page brings you a family overcoming hardship, a young girl who has achieved something wonderful, or the trials and triumphs of our favorite football team.LiNeBrEaKAre those the most important stories? No. But they make us human, they make us central Pennsylvanians, and we know many of our readers enjoy them.LiNeBrEaKThe magic word is "many." During a typical week, about 448,000 people will pick up this newspaper. They probably have 448,000 ideas about exactly what should be on the front page and what should not.LiNeBrEaKWe've seen our share of those differences through the years. A deer hunting photo from several years ago stirred a tremendous response. A ton of readers wrote to say they thought the photo was overly brutal. Those letters brought a vigorous defense from many hunters who said it portrayed a time-honored part of our culture.LiNeBrEaKWhen we published our poster cover of Barack Obama's historic inauguration on Wednesday, with a transcript of his inaugural address on the reverse side, we received calls from grandmothers who wanted 20 copies as mementos for their grandkids, e-mails from readers who said the page brought tears to their eyes -- and one reader who complained that we should rename ourselves "The Obama News."LiNeBrEaKOnly one thing is certain: Nearly half a million readers will never agree about anything.LiNeBrEaKIf some of our front-page stories inform you, if some fascinate you, if some inspire you, if some stir you to anger or to action, then we've probably done our job pretty well.LiNeBrEaKAnd if not, please let us know. After all, that's why we have another page in the newspaper -- with letters to the editor.LiNeBrEaKDAVID NEWHOUSE is executive editor of The Patriot-News: dnewhouse@patriot-news.com	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); WAR and CONFLICT (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%)  			PENNSYLVANIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%); IRAQ (90%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  	hrn  	2009 The Patriot News Co.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	OBAMA'S ONLINE ARMY;  IT COULD HELP SET THE NEW PRESIDENT'S AGENDA, MOBILIZE SUPPORT FOR HIS PROPOSALS AND DIMINISH THE INFLUENCE OF ENTRENCHED WASHINGTON INTEREST GROUPS 	JOEL BLEIFUSS  	EDITORIAL; Pg. H-1  	575 words  	President Barack Obama owns the names, e-mail addresses and gigabytes of other data on 13 million Americans who signed up to receive news from his campaign. Those 13 million -- 3. 1 million of whom contributed a total of $700 million -- account for 19 percent of the 67 million Americans who voted for him.LiNeBrEaKThis corps of supporters could change the American political landscape. LiNeBrEaKCentrist Democrats may have to learn how to deal with a galvanized electorate pushing them left.LiNeBrEaKWill the armies of the Internet force members of Congress to retool careers that were built on cultivating politics as usual?LiNeBrEaKWill pundits find their role as media filter bypassed by Obama's direct outreach to Americans?LiNeBrEaKWashington lobbyists could have to calculate how much the corporate campaign contributions that they bundle have declined in value. After all, how do they do business in the face of a movement that is not theirs to influence?LiNeBrEaKJay Dunn, a flack for the PR firm FD Americas, told Bloomberg News that in the wake of Mr. Obama's election, lobbyists will have "to be part of a larger strategy" that includes "a much more assertive grassroots community outreach." In other words, in order to counter Mr. Obama's netroots, K Street will have to manufacture grassroots -- what is known in the PR industry as "Astroturf organizing."LiNeBrEaKThe significance of all this is not lost on Richard Viguerie. The direct mail guru of the Republican right told Bloomberg, "It could be life-changing for American politics. It allows Obama to be independent of everybody."LiNeBrEaKEverybody in Washington, that is. Mr. Obama's 13 million supporters hope their new president will take his cues from them -- that their voices be heard above those of status quo Democrats and corporate flacks, and, perhaps, even sway Mr. Obama's centrist inclinations.LiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 18, Mr. Obama's campaign manager David Plouffe e-mailed the online legions and asked them to rank the following four "goals for this movement": helping Obama "pass legislation through grassroots efforts"; electing "state and local candidates who share the same vision for our country"; training "volunteers in the organizing techniques we used to elect Barack"; and "working on local issues."LiNeBrEaKRespondents were then offered a checklist of 26 issues they would be "interested in volunteering or organizing around," such as "LGBT issues," "War in Iraq," "Environment and global warming" and "Health care."LiNeBrEaKFollowing that, more than 1,500 people signed up to host "Change is Coming" house parties on Dec. 13 and 14 to discuss what they want to do. According to Christopher Hass, the "Obama HQ Blogger," the "input" received from the surveys and house parties "will help guide the future of this grassroots movement."LiNeBrEaKThe incoming administration has also set up Change.gov, a website that allows people to register and discuss policy on its blog. Registered readers can rate the proposals put forth, moving the most popular ideas to the top of the blog.LiNeBrEaK"Before our eyes, we are witnessing the beginning of a rebooting of the American political system," writes Micah Sifry on the blog of TechPresident.com.LiNeBrEaKOf course, this "movement" runs the risk of devolving into astroturf. The limitation of Mr. Obama's online operation is that, since he owns it, it might not challenge him should he backslide. Yet to the extent that it circumvents the propaganda of the right, Mr. Obama's online army could make the difference in realizing a progressive agenda.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	PREDATORY LIONFISH FOUND IN FLORIDA KEYS  	Cammy Clark, McClatchy Newspapers  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-10  	798 words  	KEY LARGO, Fla. -- Becky Fowler was shipwreck-diving 66 feet below the surface, exploring a watery paradise, when she came face to face with a 4-inch-long, zebra-striped Cujo of the deep.LiNeBrEaKYes, the dreaded lionfish has made its way to the Florida Keys. Ms. Fowler's discovery, confirmed a few days later by divers who captured and dissected the creature, has sent shivers through the Keys' fishing and tourism industries. LiNeBrEaKJust as pythons have disturbed the natural ecosystem of the Everglades, the lionfish could someday become a scourge of the Keys. A Bluto Blutarsky of the water kingdom, it will eat anything it can cram into its mouth -- sea horses, crustaceans and all manner of native fish -- and is a breeding machine.LiNeBrEaKAlso, it stings divers, painfully.LiNeBrEaK"We knew this 'perfect predator' was coming," said Lisa Mitchell, executive director of the Key Largo-based Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF), which responded to Ms. Fowler's discovery. "We just didn't know when."LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish is a native of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but was introduced to Atlantic waters 16 years ago. Some blame the ballast of sea-going vessels. Others cite selfish aquarium owners, who dump the fish when they outgrow their tanks.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of the culprit, the lionfish has since caused ecological havoc on fragile Atlantic ecosystems already burdened by overfishing, pollution and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's another huge challenge for the tropical marine ecosystem, on par with habitat degradation and overfishing," said Dave Score, superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. "Lionfish are altering the diversity of an area that has taken hundreds of thousands of years to adapt and evolve."LiNeBrEaKAnd, of course, with the Keys heavily dependent on tourism, diving and recreational and commercial fishing, it is an economic threat as well as an environmental one.LiNeBrEaKTrue, only one fish has been found thus far. But the plague of Everglades Burmese pythons likely began with a single snake. Then a second. Then, a bacchanal of breeding and -- voila -- snakes are devouring alligators whole.LiNeBrEaK"Lionfish are eating their way through the [Atlantic] reefs like a plague of locusts," said Mark Hixon, a coral reef ecology expert at Oregon State University. "This may well become the most devastating marine invasion in history."LiNeBrEaKLong before the South Carolina accountant made her discovery while diving the Benwood shipwreck off Key Largo's Atlantic Coast, the Keys had been bracing for this day. It had created an official response plan and held workshops to educate the public.LiNeBrEaKNow that the fish has arrived, Keys officials will be taking the matter "very seriously," said Scott Zimmerman, executive director of the Florida Keys Commercial Fishermen's Association. The lionfish hardly looks like the menace it is. It grows to a maximum of 20 inches long. Because of its exotic features -- the zebra striping and a feathery mane of fins -- it is a favorite for aquarium keepers.LiNeBrEaK"Lionfish are the No. 2 aquarium fish in the U.S., behind clownfish," said Bruce Purdy, owner of Davie, Fla.-based Blackbeard's Cruises, which hosts Bahamas diving excursions.LiNeBrEaKBut the beauty is a beast.LiNeBrEaKThe first documented Atlantic sightings came days after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when six lionfish were spotted in Biscayne Bay and traced to a private aquarium swept away from a Miami waterfront home.LiNeBrEaKIt is believed that lionfish hitched a ride north on the Gulf Stream, up the East Coast, as far as Rhode Island. Other currents and eddies led the lionfish to Bermuda, then to the Bahamas and farther south to the Caribbean as well as Belize. The lionfish was "completing a loop" by reaching the Keys, said Lad Akins, REEF's director of special projects.LiNeBrEaKThey are fearless fish, their bravado bolstered by the poison released by their sharp spines. Cold water appears to be their only real enemy. Otherwise, they thrive at depths ranging from a few inches to 500 feet.LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish's coloring allows it to strike its prey from the protective camouflage of a coral reef.LiNeBrEaKLionfish eat like no other fish in the Atlantic, using their fanned-out fins to block escape by prey. They devour commercial fish, such as grouper and snapper juveniles, as well as those species' food supplies.LiNeBrEaKJust how voracious are they?LiNeBrEaKIn a 2008 University of Oregon State study, the first to quantify the severity of the situation, research teams observed one lionfish gorging on 20 small fish in less than 30 minutes.LiNeBrEaKScientists fear the lionfish will kill off helpful species, such as algae-eating parrotfish, allowing seaweed to overtake reefs.LiNeBrEaKIf the lionfish multiply, Ms. Mitchell of REEF offers one possible remedy: Fishermen could start to catch them for commercial sale.LiNeBrEaK"They are delicious," she said. "Kind of like hogfish, but not quite as mild."

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Final Edition; All Editions	New evidence, old argument;  Modern science offers facts that would be a gift for Darwin 	John Mangels, Plain Dealer Reporter  	BOOKS; Pg. E5  	646 words  	NONFICTIONLiNeBrEaKWhy Evolution is TrueLiNeBrEaKBy Jerry A. Coyne.LiNeBrEaKViking, 282 pp., $27. 95.LiNeBrEaKDecember 2005 should have marked the end of longstanding attempts to sneak biblical creation tales into public school science classes.LiNeBrEaKThat's when federal judge John E. Jones III ruled that creationism's latest incarnation, intelligent design - the belief that a supernatural overseer, rather than evolutionary processes, brought about complex life - is "a religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory."LiNeBrEaKJones, a conservative, church-going judicial appointee of former President George W. Bush, drove a stake into the heart of the creationist movement. The judge dismissed as "breathtaking inanity" the Dover, Penn., school board's policy of misrepresenting evolution and promoting intelligent design as a viable alternative. LiNeBrEaKBut creationism evolves. As Scientific American magazine reports this month, the movement's backers have shifted to a more subtle strategy by insisting schools subject evolution to "critical analysis."LiNeBrEaKIn Louisiana, a law signed in June by Gov. Bobby Jindal, a rising Republican star, allows teachers under the guise of academic freedom to use materials other than standard textbooks to help students "critique" certain scientific theories such as evolution and global warming. And at the Creation Museum near Cincinnati, which has drawn more than 630,000 visitors since its 2007 opening, a new exhibit will take on the "inaccuracies" of Charles Darwin's work.LiNeBrEaKAll this makes Jerry Coyne's lucid, accessible "Why Evolution Is True" desperately needed. With logic and clarity, the University of Chicago professor presents the vast trove of scientific evidence that supports Darwin's theory.LiNeBrEaKOther recent pro-Darwin books have focused more on defusing the philosophical angst - no room for God, no purpose or morality to life - that evolution seems to spark. Coyne, an evolutionary geneticist who studies fruit flies, goes straight for the scientific proof. He draws on fresh findings from his own field, and from paleontology, molecular biology, geology and other disciplines to make the case that evolution is "far more than a theory, let alone a theory in crisis," but "a fact."LiNeBrEaKWhere's the evidence? You can find it practically anyplace, from fossil digs and genetics labs to doctor's offices, back yards, even your kitchen, where foods like bananas, broccoli, tomatoes and wheat were domesticated by growers mimicking evolutionary techniques.LiNeBrEaK"We can directly witness natural selection leading to better adaptation," Coyne writes. "Insects have become resistant to DDT and other pesticides, plants have adapted to herbicides, and fungi, worms and algae have evolved resistance to heavy metals that have polluted their environment."LiNeBrEaKEveryone knows about drug resistance, but few realize that it is a superb example of natural selection in action. "We see fruit flies adapting to extreme temperature, honeybees adapting to competitors, and guppies becoming less colorful to escape the notice of predators. How many more examples do we need?" Coyne asks.LiNeBrEaKThere are plenty more, and Coyne uses them to torpedo the major claims of intelligent design: That "transitional" fossils don't exist, that there's no evidence of new species evolving, that evolution is insufficient to explain "complex" organs such as the eye. Calmly, he addresses difficult topics like the origin of race, the rise of humans from our primate ancestors and whether our genes predestine behavior.LiNeBrEaK"Why Evolution Is True" is not likely to sway avowed creationists, but it's invaluable, engrossing reading for anyone who's uncertain of the facts or who has struggled with how to respond to anti-evolution arguments.LiNeBrEaKFebruary is the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth. Jerry Coyne's book is a perfect birthday gift.LiNeBrEaKJohn Mangels is The Plain DealerLiNeBrEaKscience writer.LiNeBrEaKTo reach John Mangels:LiNeBrEaKbooks@plaind.com	CREATIONISM (92%); RELIGION (90%); NON FICTION LITERATURE (90%); MATH and SCIENCE EDUCATION (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (89%); EVOLUTION THEORY (89%); BIOLOGY (89%); EVIDENCE (86%); SCIENTIFIC METHOD (78%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (77%); TEXTBOOKS (77%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (75%); JUDGES (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); ACADEMIC FREEDOM (72%); EXHIBITIONS (70%); MUSEUMS and GALLERIES (70%); WITNESSES (69%); PESTICIDES (67%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (67%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (63%); BIOCHEMISTRY (61%); SEAWEED and ALGAE (61%); PESTICIDE MFG (60%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (60%); HERBICIDES (60%)  	SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN MAGAZINE (56%)  		CHICAGO, IL, USA (68%) LOUISIANA, USA (79%); TENNESSEE, USA (79%); ILLINOIS, USA (68%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday 	The wonders of Sea Grant  	BARRY A. COSTA-PIERCE  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 4  	764 words  	IT IS WITH SADNESS that Rhode Island Sea Grant notes the passing of one of its heroes, former Sen. Claiborne Pell, a founder of the National Sea Grant College Program and an ardent supporter of Rhode Island Sea Grant as one of our nation s first Sea Grant programs, and its hosts, the Graduate School of Oceanography and the University of Rhode Island.LiNeBrEaKOn May 2, 1966, Senator Pell spoke to his Senate colleagues about the idea of establishing  Sea Grant Colleges  modeled after the successful Land Grant colleges, touting the idea as a way to use ocean resources in a  productive manner, while maintaining principles of conservation.  Senator Pell convened a hearing of the U.S. Senate at URI on a bill to create Sea Grant, the first time a U.S. Senate hearing was convened at a state university. In October 1965, the first Sea Grant conference was held in Newport, with much fanfare, on  The Concept of a Sea Grant University.  The Sea Grant conference was described by The Boston Herald-Traveler as  one of the most interesting examples of high-level brainstorming since the days of the New Deal.  LiNeBrEaKThree years after the Sea Grant concept was born, President Johnson signed into law the bill creating Sea Grant on Oct. 15, 1966.LiNeBrEaKToday, the Sea Grant College Program is a unique federal-state partnership that supports science that takes into account the needs of coastal communities and stakeholders. Sea Grant funds not only basic science but also applied research, which is translated through education and outreach for public benefit. Since its inception, for example, Rhode Island Sea Grant has sponsored research and outreach that have saved lives at sea, helped craft the state s coastal-management program, responded to an oil spill, increased public access to the shore, tested fishing gears that dramatically reduced bycatch, identified impacts that global climate change is having on Narragansett Bay, crafted policies to mitigate those impacts, and fostered stewardship of Rhode Island s salt ponds, among other notable achievements.LiNeBrEaKThe program has sent over 80 students to Washington, D.C., as part of the Dean John Knauss (the first dean of the URI School of Oceanography) Fellowship program to work in the federal government and see first-hand how ocean and coastal laws and policies are created and implemented. Many of those students have returned to lead institutes and agencies or work in the private sector on environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, Rhode Island Sea Grant developed a legal program in partnership with Roger Williams University to provide legal research and outreach on marine and coastal issues. Over the past few years the program has held important national conferences on offshore renewable energy, ecosystem-based management, and the U.S. Ocean Commission.LiNeBrEaKWe celebrate the vision, courage and hard work of Senator Pell to bring the dream of Sea Grant to fruition. Sea Grant has grown from the original four pioneering universities   URI, the University of Washington, Oregon State University and Texas AandM University   to become a world-class partnership network of the finest 32 marine universities with a Sea Grant program in each coastal and Great Lakes state under the direction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s National Sea Grant College Program. All of these achievements were made possible by Senator Pell, who fought not only to get the National Sea Grant Act passed but also to keep the program alive during the cuts to Sea Grant of the Reagan and Bush eras.LiNeBrEaKSome years back, when Rhode Island Sea Grant celebrated its 30-year anniversary at the home of the URI president, the senator beamed with pride on what we had become but mentioned to me that we still had much to do   the oceans were in deep trouble, and the more profound visions of what Sea Grant could become still had not been realized.LiNeBrEaKWhile waiting in line to pay respect to the senator s family after his funeral in Newport, I read for inspiration the senator s stirring speech given at the first Sea Grant meeting in Newport in 1965. Senator Pell urged the gathered leaders to  voyage forward  as boldly as another great resident of Newport, Alexander Agassiz, had in 1877 aboard the Blake, marking the first major U.S. oceanographic explorations that originated from a berth close to the hotel where the senator was speaking.LiNeBrEaKThank you, dear Senator, our Sea Grant ocean hero. May you rest in peace.LiNeBrEaKBarry A. Costa-Pierce is director of the Rhode Island Sea Grant College Program and a professor of fisheries and oceanography at the University of Rhode Island.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Professor takes part in landmark climate change study  		NEWS; Local; Pg. 3  	2208 words  	Scott Rutherford, an assistant professor in the department of environmental science at Roger Williams University, is co-author of a scientific paper that made international news last week with its findings of warming in Antarctica, where earlier studies had tracked more cooling.LiNeBrEaKThe paper in the journal Nature was picked up in hundreds of publications and Web sites as far away as Australia and South Africa.LiNeBrEaK It s kind of neat,  Rutherford said last week of all of the attention.LiNeBrEaKRutherford had studied with one of the key authors, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University, a speaker at last fall s Honors Colloquium on Climate Change at the University of Rhode Island. Other co-authors in the study represent prestigious institutions around the country such as the University of Washington, the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., NASA s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City and NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. LiNeBrEaKFor years, some weather observation stations have reported cooling in parts of Antarctica, findings cherished by climate change skeptics. The challenge for assessing conditions on the entire continent, according to Rutherford, was that scientists had climate data from a few weather observation stations over a long period of time, and more comprehensive satellite data for many more locations, but for a shorter period of time.LiNeBrEaKTo generate longer record estimates for more places, the scientists correlated the relatively short-term satellite data with the more long-term weather station data.LiNeBrEaK I took the satellite data and ran it through my algorithm and got a reconstruction,  Rutherford said.  Then we discussed the results. LiNeBrEaKRutherford helped analyze more than one million data points in order to create a clearer picture of temperatures during the last 50 years. The work was summarized in a paper entitled:  Warming of the Antarctic ice-sheet surface since the 1957 International Geophysical Year. LiNeBrEaKAn abstract of the paper notes that earlier assessments of Antarctic temperature changes emphasized the contrast between strong warming on the Antarctic Peninsula and slight cooling of the Antarctic continental interior. The scientists concluded that picture was incomplete due to the sparseness of data. Their work showed that  significant warming extends well beyond the Antarctic Peninsula to cover most of West Antarctica. LiNeBrEaKThe paper may have gotten more attention because CNN carried video last week of shopping-center-sized chunks of ice breaking off an ice shelf in the Antarctica.LiNeBrEaKAlong with hundreds of stories, the paper attracted the attention of the Heartland Institute, an organization that supports climate change skeptics. James M. Taylor, a lawyer and senior fellow at the institute, warned against assigning much value to the paper, because he said it relied on  subjective data interpretation from well-known global warming alarmists. LiNeBrEaKRutherford said the scientific method accepts scientific criticism   that can lead to more knowledge. Writing op-ed pieces does not contribute to science, he said. In the meantime, Rutherford said he is aware of another study based on boring holes in the ice sheet that supports the conclusions of his team.LiNeBrEaK Will this end the debate? No,  Rutherford said.  There are some people who will not accept anything as proof. There s nothing you can do about that. I just keep my head down and keep doing science. LiNeBrEaKFilm looks at lack of imaginative playLiNeBrEaKProvidence Children s Museum, the Lincoln School and Southside Community Land Trust will present a free public screening of Where Do the Children Play? on Wednesday from 6: 30 to 8: 30 p.m. at Lincoln School s Ebner, Elson, Hart Music Center, 301 Butler Ave., Providence.LiNeBrEaKThe documentary examines an issue of growing concern among pediatricians, mental-health experts, educators and environmentalists: more and more children are growing up with little or no opportunity for unstructured play, especially outdoors.LiNeBrEaKThe event is presented with assistance from the U.S. Alliance for Childhood, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that works for the restoration of play in children s lives.LiNeBrEaKFollowing the screening, Children s Museum s executive director Janice O Donnell, Lincoln School early childhood visual arts teacher Giovonne Calenda, and Southside Community Land Trust education director Leo Pollack will lead an audience discussion about the issues.LiNeBrEaKWhere Do the Children Play? grew out of Elizabeth Goodenough s work on  secret spaces of childhood  at the University of Michigan. The film was written and directed by Christopher Cook and produced by Michigan Television.LiNeBrEaK Children need free time every day to discover their own abilities, desires and limitations,  says Goodenough, who also edited the film s companion volume, A Place for Play.  Open-ended exploration and play in woods, fields, vacant lots or other semi-wild spaces enhances curiosity and confidence throughout life. LiNeBrEaKThe American Academy of Pediatrics recently issued a statement: children have far too little time for unstructured play, which leads to increased stress in their lives. Causes of the demise of play cited by the group include parental fears of  stranger danger  and the explosion of electronic entertainment   to the point of addiction for some   in the lives of today s children. These and other issues are explored in the film.LiNeBrEaKFor information about the screening, contact Calenda at gcalenda@lincolnschool.orgLiNeBrEaKCape Wind impact subject of lectureLiNeBrEaKVin Malkoski, an aquatic biologist with the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and a leader in Massachusetts  environmental review of the proposed Cape Wind offshore wind farm, will describe the factors considered by his agency in reviewing the potential impact of Cape Wind on fisheries.

Jack Reed recently announced that URI will receive $1. 829 million in federal funding for its Sea Grant College Program, under the auspices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The money will be used for research projects, including studies on climate change, effects on nutrient inputs to Narragansett Bay, an investigation of the effects of crabs on salt marsh die-offs and a study designed to better enumerate and further reduce by-catch mortality in flounder.LiNeBrEaKThe National Sea Grant College program provides federal funding to more than 30 state Sea Grant programs at universities across the country, for research, education and outreach on coastal resource use and conservation. URI s program, at its Graduate School of Oceanography, focuses it efforts on coastal protection and sustainable fisheries. Federal funding for the Sea Grant program is matched by state and private funding.LiNeBrEaKHabitat restoration gains recognitionLiNeBrEaKThe Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has received Coastal America s 2008 Partnership Award for its work on the South Coast Habitat Restoration Project. The project consisted of the restoration of 40 acres of eelgrass habitat near Charlestown s Ninigret Pond and was done with the help of the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Environmental Management, URI, the Salt Ponds Coalition and the towns of South Kingstown, Charlestown and Westerly.LiNeBrEaKThe eelgrass habitat in the pond area became depleted following the 1952 creation of the Charlestown Breachway. Work on the restoration project began in 1997 with the dredging of the pond and the construction of a catch basin to capture sediment.LiNeBrEaKCoastal America was established in 1991 as a collaboration between federal, state and local government, and other groups, in an effort to solve coastal problems.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Journal is a listing of brief news items about the actions of individuals, organizations and businesses that affect the air we breathe, the water we drink and the landscape that surrounds us.

You could question, "what took him so long to close the barnyard gate?" Having to hire 55 people to do a job that should have been "work in progress" is just plain poor management. -- Billy J. Braughton, Henrico LiNeBrEaKA person steals $500 from a convenience store and has the privilege of living in a jail cell and eating jail food while waiting for trial. Bernard Madoff allegedly swindles $50 billion from investors and gets to stay in his Manhattan pent-house apartment eating gourmet food and drinking fine wines while waiting for trial. Isn't this a great country! -- David Stiles, RichmondLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming? Where? -- Noreen Brown, RichmondLiNeBrEaKIs America a great country, or what? President Barack Obama has proven that dreams do come true, and that America truly is the land of opportunity. Somewhere between the Atlantic and the Pacific is a little Asian or Latino child, a Muslim, a Jew, and a Cheyenne child, all dreaming of becoming president some day. So, let's stop sniping, and start co-operating, and put our shoulders to the wheel, and help Obama get our country out of the ditch and back on the road. We'll all be better off if he becomes the best president in history. -- Ernest Irby, HenricoLiNeBrEaKIn his State of the Commonwealth address, Gov. Tim Kaine proposed doubling the cigarette tax, ostensibly to cover Medicaid's funding of smoking-related lung illnesses. In the minority response to the address, Del. David B. Albo, R-Fairfax, proposed using the tobacco settlement fund to finance road construction. Wasn't the extorted tobacco fund suppose to cover medical costs of tobacco-related illnesses? But then again, a new tax for roads is unpopular, so those who rule us just play musical chairs with revenue sources and hope that taxpaying John Q. Public doesn't notice. -- Max Maizels, RichmondLiNeBrEaKGiven the goals of Habitat for Humanity and the current economic crisis, perhaps it is efficacious to purchase and renovate foreclosed properties. Prospective families can move into existing neighborhoods they can afford more quickly and still be required to participate in the rehab process. Neighbors' property values would also be supported. -- Judy Jones, PowhatanLiNeBrEaKThe new president and the old Democratic-controlled Congress will spend more taxpayer money than anyone had expected before Nov. 4, 2008. The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, is $700 billion, and President Barack Obama's stimulus proposal will probably be another $850 billion. Are the Democrats finally beginning to define "change you can believe in?" Can we really afford all of this? -- Joseph W. A. Childress, PalmyraLiNeBrEaKOur economy, banks, homes, and jobs are in great jeopardy, but our nation can still spend a small fortune on the past election. Spend an estimated $150 million on a party in Washington. Pay entertainers and athletes millions. Spend millions to advertise at a football bowl, and bail out half the universe. Someone is blowing smoke. -- Ken C. Slater, ChesterfieldLiNeBrEaKIs anyone else upset with the quality and lack of accuracy of our local weather forecasts? The Internet sites providing weather also suffer this problem . . . . Forecasts that state we have a 50 percent chance of rain, and we get none, are just an example. Modern technology for observing the weather is a godsend, but forecasts are often inaccurate, resulting in canceled plans, especially as related to outdoor activities. -- Richard G.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 25, 2009 Sunday 	In climate fight, a time for civil disobedience?  	By Patty Henetz The Salt Lake Tribune  	POLITICS; News; State  	877 words  	Take the train. Dial down your heat. Write your senator.LiNeBrEaKTaking those individual steps surely helps in the battle against global warming. But, scientists and advocates warn, it's no longer enough to fend off climate disaster.LiNeBrEaKGet ready, some of them say, to hijack oil-lease sales (like a college student did in Utah), to climb smokestacks in protest (like Greenpeace activists did in England), to trespass at power plants (like demonstrators plan to do in Washington, D.C.).LiNeBrEaKIt's time, these environmentalists say, for some good, old-fashioned civil disobedience -- the types of nonviolent acts proven effective by the famous (Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks) and the faceless (students at Tiananmen Square, anti-war protesters on college campuses, women suffragists in street marches). LiNeBrEaKAt a recent Environmental Ministry meeting at Salt Lake City's First Unitarian Church that drew more than 300 people, Tim DeChristopher, the 27-year-old University of Utah economics student who disrupted a December drilling-lease auction, called for an "uprising."LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher didn't use the word lightly, he said, yet "anything short of that will not get us where we need to go."LiNeBrEaKHeeding such calls, organizers are mobilizing for a mass act of nonviolent civil disobedience March 2 to protest coal-fired power plants and the damage industrial pollution has caused to the planet's climate.LiNeBrEaK"We're hoping and preparing for thousands," said Matt Leonard, the Greenpeace coordinator for the event. "It will certainly be the largest such action on climate change in U.S. history. We hope it will be the first of many."LiNeBrEaKProtesters will gather at the Capital Power Plant in Washington -- source of heat and refrigeration for the entire Capitol complex -- walk on to the property, sit down and thereby break the law.LiNeBrEaK"Enough is enough. Action needs to be taken," Leonard said. "But to really meet the climate crisis, we need collective action. You can't do that by buying light bulbs and hybrid vehicles."LiNeBrEaK&raquo; Gore's plea: The March 2 demonstration will be the first major protest since former Vice President Al Gore, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, in September called for moral lawbreaking.LiNeBrEaK"If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration," Gore told the Clinton Global Initiative gathering to loud applause, according to Reuters news service.LiNeBrEaKSince then, author and environmentalist Bill McKibben and poet Wendell Berry have chimed in. Last month, they wrote an open letter, which has circulated widely on the Web, urging mass civil disobedience against coal in March.LiNeBrEaK"We will cross the legal boundary of the power plant, and we expect to be arrested," they wrote. "The worldwide daily reliance on coal is the danger; this is one small step to raise awareness of that ruinous habit and hence help to break it."LiNeBrEaKBut the thought of moving beyond conventional acts -- voting, lobbying, giving up cars -- stumps or scares some would-be activists. Others would never dream of breaking the law.LiNeBrEaKAfter the First Unitarian Church meeting, Robert and Amy Matheson said they felt more aware of the enormity of climate disruption but were unsure what to do next. They didn't know what civil disobedience looked like and were wary of it -- given the risks.LiNeBrEaK"I'm kind of a chicken," Amy Matheson said. "I wouldn't be willing to sacrifice my family, my freedom, my life."LiNeBrEaKMaybe if he were emotionally invested, Robert Matheson reasoned, he would be less afraid.LiNeBrEaK&raquo; Personal stake: All humans are invested in coal, activists say, even if they don't recognize it.LiNeBrEaKCoal-industry advocates point out that the United States gets about half its electricity from coal; nearly all of Utah's electricity is coal fired. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates domestic coal could last for over 250 years at current-use levels.LiNeBrEaKThe countries where coal is the primary energy fuel are polluting everyone's lives. Some of the evidence: unprecedented asthma rates in children, the enduring drought in the American Southwest, the worst drought in Australia in 1,000 years, crop failures in Africa, the filthy air on the Wasatch Front, the cheat grass on the Western range and the fires that feed on it.LiNeBrEaKGrowing awareness of coal's downside led a British jury in September to acquit Greenpeace activists who climbed a 650-foot coal-plant smokestack in an attempt to shut it down. The jury reasoned that global warming is causing greater harm than Greenpeace.LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher saw his own transgression as a step toward Earth's salvation. With climate chaos looming, he said, "How could I not do this? How could I sit by and be complicit in my own destruction?"LiNeBrEaKThe U. student could face federal felony charges and even prison for his protest. Still, he urges more people to do what he did: If an opportunity presents itself, find your voice and stand your ground.LiNeBrEaKBut don't go all out without cause, warned Daniel Kessler, a Greenpeace spokesman in San Francisco. "There's no reason for civil disobedience if another [measure] is more effective."LiNeBrEaKphenetz@sltrib.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); PROTESTS and DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); WAR and CONFLICT (90%); POWER PLANTS (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); OIL and GAS LEASES (77%); COAL INDUSTRY (76%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (76%); TRESPASSING (76%); PROTESTANTS and PROTESTANTISM (74%); HYBRID VEHICLES (73%); NOBEL PRIZES (72%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (71%); HISTORY (71%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (69%); AWARDS and PRIZES (64%); CONSTRUCTION (62%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (50%)  			SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (94%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	February 7, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  	GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL (57%); UNIVERSITY OF UTAH (55%)  	AL GORE (51%)  														
Seattle Times (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Support for Seattle tunnel already caving in  	Andrew Garber, Seattle Times  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1136 words  	Jan. 25--OLYMPIA -- Gov. Chris Gregoire's plan to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct with a tunnel is already running into trouble.LiNeBrEaKThe coalition backing the $4. 2 billion project appears fragile. And some legislative leaders doubt a key element of the proposal -- allowing King County to pass a motor-vehicle excise tax to support increased public transit -- will pass this session.LiNeBrEaKThere are other hurdles as well, including House Speaker Frank Chopp and House Majority Leader Lynn Kessler, who question the wisdom of digging a tunnel. And it's not clear how the Legislature will respond to proposals to close a $400 million gap in state funding for the tunnel with tolls.LiNeBrEaKThe project is tenuous, said Steve Mullin, president of the Washington Roundtable, an association of corporate executives backing the tunnel. LiNeBrEaK"I don't see this as a done deal at all," he said. "Getting consensus on anything related to the viaduct has proved incredibly difficult. If it wasn't, we'd have had resolution on this years ago."LiNeBrEaKThe problems facing the project weren't dwelt on when Gregoire, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels and King County Executive Ron Sims held a news conference Jan. 13 to announce their support for drilling a nearly two-mile-long tunnel to replace the viaduct.LiNeBrEaKThe three leaders expressed confidence it was the right choice for the region, and they are backed by a broad coalition of business and downtown interests.LiNeBrEaK"There was no time throughout this process where we thought we'd come to a solution with which everyone would agree," Gregoire said at the time. "We have come to one, however, in which the majority of folks, thankfully, do agree."LiNeBrEaKBut within days, the Sierra Club Cascade Chapter sent out a letter opposing the tunnel because it fails to do enough to get drivers out of their cars to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"We are missing a great opportunity to invest in transportation solutions that will meet our future needs for both reduced carbon emissions and a resilient economy," Mike O'Brien, chairman of the Sierra Club chapter, said in the letter. "The cost of our shortsightedness today will be paid by the next generation."LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club and other groups concerned about global warming want to replace the viaduct with a combination of surface streets, beefed-up transit and improvements to Interstate 5. They said they're open to additional research for digging a tunnel in the future -- but not now.LiNeBrEaKThe groups thought that was where political leaders were headed until Gregoire, Sims and Nickels announced the tunnel.LiNeBrEaKPart of the advocacy groups' concern is that the tunnel option, which would allow cars and freight to bypass downtown traffic, would encourage more people to drive. The surface route was expected to create longer trips and more of an incentive for people to use mass transit.LiNeBrEaKTax a hot-button issueLiNeBrEaKWhat's apparently still keeping some of the advocacy groups onboard the tunnel plan is a proposal to let King County pass a 1 percent motor-vehicle excise tax, or $100 yearly on a $10,000 car.LiNeBrEaK"Our acceptance of the deal is completely dependent on the (excise tax) being part of the solution," Rob Johnson, executive director of the Transportation Choices Coalition, said in an e-mail. The group advocates for increased use of public transportation, in part, as a way to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe tax would raise an estimated $120 million a year.LiNeBrEaKThe additional transit is needed in part because the tunnel, without ramps at Seneca Street and Western Avenue, wouldn't provide the same access to downtown as the viaduct.LiNeBrEaKAlso, the tunnel and surface-street improvements essentially replace the traffic capacity of the existing viaduct, said Ron Paananen, deputy urban-corridors administrator for the state Department of Transportation. The additional transit would help accommodate future growth, he said.LiNeBrEaKKing County wants the money to expand bus service up to 25 percent countywide. To a certain extent, it's also a bailout for Metro Transit, which is collecting less sales tax than officials predicted.LiNeBrEaKUnder the proposal, the Metropolitan King County Council would be able to approve the tax increase without putting it before voters. But the Legislature would have to grant the county authority to do so -- and that's the rub. Lawmakers are wary of any tax vote in the middle of a recession.LiNeBrEaKThere's also concern that allowing King County to pass a car-tab tax without voter approval would prompt other cash-strapped counties in the state to ask for the same ability.LiNeBrEaKVoters already have approved two Tim Eyman initiatives in the past decade to roll back highly unpopular car-tab taxes. And Eyman recently proposed another ballot measure that requires local governments to keep car tabs at $25 with a $5 filing fee, unless they're approved by voters.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see the Legislature that interested in raising transportation taxes this year," said state Sen. Ed Murray, of Seattle, chairman of the Senate Democratic caucus.LiNeBrEaKKessler, D-Hoquiam, the House majority leader, summed up the tax proposal this way: "Bad timing. Way too much."LiNeBrEaKEven some Metropolitan King County Council members seemed uncertain about passing a tax increase.LiNeBrEaKReagan Dunn, R-Maple Valley, said a car-tax boost absolutely must go to the voters in a weak economy. "It's an incredibly sensitive situation right now," he said.LiNeBrEaKLarry Phillips, D-Magnolia, said the Legislature should at least give the county the option of putting a car-tab tax to a public vote.LiNeBrEaK"The big unknown"LiNeBrEaKThe excise tax is not the only thing tunnel advocates have to worry about.LiNeBrEaKHouse leaders are particularly concerned about the fact the state is responsible for any cost overruns with the proposed 54-foot-wide tunnel.LiNeBrEaKKessler said she met recently with Gregoire to discuss the project.LiNeBrEaK"I said, 'Governor, I don't think the taxpayers of this state want to be on the hook for unknown cost overruns. The Big Dig comes to mind in Boston,' " she said, referring to a tunnel project where costs exceeded $14 billion.LiNeBrEaKKessler said the governor told her the state was only responsible for overruns related to the state's portion of the project. "And I said, 'Well, that's the tunnel. The big unknown.'

Jonathan Martin, Politico  	POLITICS; News  	1367 words  	President Barack Obama is taking far-reaching steps to centralize decision-making inside the White House, surrounding himself with influential counselors, overseas envoys and policy "czars" that shift power from traditional Cabinet posts.LiNeBrEaKNot even a week has passed since he was sworn in, but already Obama is moving to create perhaps the most powerful staff in modern history - a sort of West Wing on steroids that places no less than a half-dozen of his top initiatives into the hands of advisers outside the Cabinet.LiNeBrEaKFor all the talk of his "Team of Rivals" pick in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama last week handed the two hottest hotspots in American foreign policy to presidential envoys - one to former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, and the other to a man who knows his way around Foggy Bottom better than Clinton does, Richard Holbrooke.LiNeBrEaK"Czar" Carol Browner will head up Obama's fight on global warming, where once his energy and environmental chiefs might have stepped in. Tom Daschle scored a ground floor office in the West Wing not by running Health and Human Services - but because of his role as Obama's health-reform czar. LiNeBrEaKPulling power close is something all recent presidents have done - and on the campaign trail, Obama spoke out against George W. Bush's attempt to expand his executive authority.LiNeBrEaKBut when it comes to building his own team, Obama is taking the notion of a powerful White House staff to new heights, leaving little doubt who will set policy and guide the politics of the his newborn administration.LiNeBrEaKThe structure could pose an early test for Obama -- whether he can referee turf battles and policy skirmishes between presidential advisers and his Cabinet, which contains some formidable figures as well. Obama comes to the job lacking the executive experience of his two predecessors, governors-turned-presidents.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama appears willing to take that chance. Aides say he believes the Cabinet structure is outdated because it doesn't recognize that problems like global warming sprawl across several agencies, often requiring a sort of uber-Cabinet member - a czar - to confront them.LiNeBrEaKThat helps explain the selection of Browner as an "energy-environment" czar, said one Obama aide.LiNeBrEaK"Some of the Cabinet agencies were created before the most pressing issues of today," this aide said. "To have people cut through a bureaucracy that doesn't match the times we're in is just more effective."LiNeBrEaKWhat's notable about Obama's approach - and expands on the approaches taken by Bush and Bill Clinton - is the number of different areas where Obama is seeking to tap a central figure, outside the Cabinet structure, who will carry out his wishes.LiNeBrEaKHandling a prized portfolio of issues including national security, homeland security, the economy and energy are a handful of super-staffers who could just as easily have filled top Cabinet posts: National Security Adviser Jim Jones, Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan, Director of National Economic Council Larry Summers and likely Urban Policy director Adolfo Carrion.LiNeBrEaKSummers and Browner bring significant stature as Cabinet veterans in the Clinton administration, having served, respectively, as Treasury Secretary and EPA director. Carrion was considered for HUD secretary. Jones, a retired Marine four-star general and former head of NATO, has the credentials to be Defense Secretary.LiNeBrEaKThe structure also allowed Obama to bypass the Senate confirmation process on two nominees who would have proven controversial, by merely picking them for White House jobs instead.LiNeBrEaKSummers was under fire from women's groups for remarks made as Harvard president - but even as economic adviser, he's overshadowing Treasury Secretary pick Tim Geithner as Obama's economic spokesman.LiNeBrEaKBrennan was thought to be Obama's No. 1 choice to head the CIA, but anti-torture advocates effectively scuttled his expected nomination by crying foul over Brennan's work in formulating Bush administration interrogation policy.LiNeBrEaKAnd then there is Daschle - whose role illustrates the true power of the "czar" in Obama's set-up. In many ways, Daschle's most important job for Obama isn't running the massive agency, the Cabinet duties. It's designing and implementing a health-care overhaul - and Daschle reportedly pushed to make sure the health reform job would part of his portfolio if he took the agency slot.LiNeBrEaKThis is not to say that other Cabinet members will be shut out of the decision-making process.LiNeBrEaKObama's education secretary, Arne Duncan, is a longtime Friend of Barack who no doubt will get his calls returned. Robert Gates at the Pentagon served Bush as well and knows the ropes. And given her stature and relationships across the world, Clinton will surely command respect as Secretary of State - even as Mitchell was named as Mideast envoy while Holbrooke will handle Afghanistan and Pakistan.LiNeBrEaKObama's moves formalize what White House veterans have always known - the Cabinet is close to a president, his White House team closer and more influential.LiNeBrEaK"The only people who believe a Cabinet government exists are political scientists," observed Ken Duberstein, a former Chief of Staff to President Reagan. "Location, location, location - proximity to the president is always what matters."LiNeBrEaKMany of these White House posts, especially the czar-like functions, are what the occupants make of them. And it's difficult to see individuals with such gold-plated resumes not exerting considerable influence in their areas of responsibility.LiNeBrEaKThat Obama would empower his White House is in keeping with the modern presidency, an institution that, even as the size of the federal government has grown, has consolidated within the West Wing and adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building.LiNeBrEaKClinton's closest adviser, his wife, operated out of both the residence and her own West Wing office. And after the drubbing Democrats took in 1994, it was Dick Morris who represented a constituency of one in the Oval Office, plotting the policies and politics of Clinton's 1996 comeback with a White House guest pass.LiNeBrEaKBush had powerful foreign and national security policy figures in his first-term Cabinet, but his domestic policy came entirely out of a White House in which figures such as Dick Cheney and Karl Rove were indisputably the Decider's deciders. Cheney, especially, played a decisive role in setting economic and energy policy, was often the administration's top Capitol Hill liaison and kept close watch on nominations and appointments.LiNeBrEaK"Every administration in recent years has worked to centralize power in the White House." observed Bruce Reed, who served at the time as White House domestic policy chief under Clinton and now leads the Democratic Leadership Council. "In difficult times, with a host of front-burner issues, the president wants a lot of top people close to him."LiNeBrEaKCabinet agencies may only be a few blocks away, but their distance in practice is far more vast. It's the White House staff that has the president's ear, that briefs him each day and fields his questions and complaints. It's here where decisions are most often made, not in the full-dress Cabinet sessions.LiNeBrEaKBut skilled Cabinet members can find ways to get their voices heard. "In the Clinton years the economic team owed a lot of its strength to [Treasury Secretary] Robert Rubin not just being in Cabinet but coming to the morning meetings," recalled one former White House official.LiNeBrEaKStephen Hess, a staffer in the Eisenhower and Nixon White Houses and now a scholar of the presidency, said that the onus is on most Cabinet members to prove themselves worthy of influence.LiNeBrEaKGeorge Shultz, Hess recalled, started as something of an unknown Secretary of Labor under Nixon, which is "not an overworked job in any Republican administration." Nixon even misspelled Shultz's name in his introductory notes.LiNeBrEaKBut as he spoke up at Cabinet meetings, it became clear the former University of Chicago business school dean was intelligent and politically astute, and he quickly moved up to budget chief, then Treasury Secretary before ultimately serving as Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State.LiNeBrEaK"Such people figure out for themselves how to get a little more elbow room," Hess observed.

St. Joseph News-Press (Missouri)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	St. Joseph man is 'a rising star of innovation': Man to receive honor for electric tractor  	Susan Mires, St. Joseph News-Press, Mo.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	814 words  	Jan. 25--Andy DeShon turns the key and the lawn tractor springs to life.LiNeBrEaKBut you can't tell. There's no roar of the engine, no puff of exhaust. Only when he pushes the throttle wide open does the hum of the electric motor become loud enough to detect. Even as Mr. DeShon engages the mower blade and cuts a swath across the grassy lot, the converted lawn tractor is relatively quiet.LiNeBrEaK"You can talk on the phone while you're mowing the yard," Mr. DeShon said. LiNeBrEaKIt's just one benefit of the battery-powered lawn tractor he designed. The tractor will run for about two hours on battery power, then can be recharged by plugging into an outlet. That means cheaper fuel and fewer carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The carbon footprint is minute. It has just a fraction of the emissions of an internal combustion engine, even if the electricity is from a coal-fired electric plant," he said.LiNeBrEaKMr. DeShon has been tinkering with the innovation for 20 years. He has secured patents and exclusive marketing rights for his work.LiNeBrEaK"When I found the right combination of batteries, electric motors and electronics, we were able to outfit original equipment manufacturers' tractors," he said.LiNeBrEaKWith 14 prototypes already built, Mr. DeShon has a licensing agreement with Kubota to equip its lawn tractors with the electric motors.LiNeBrEaK"We are, sooner rather than later, going to set up an assembly plant in St. Joseph," he said.LiNeBrEaKThis week, Mr. DeShon is taking a couple of the tractors to Jefferson City, where they will be displayed in the rotunda of the Capitol. It's only possible because the electric motors do not produce emissions.LiNeBrEaKLarry Lee, a business specialist with the Small Business Technology and Development Center at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, nominated Mr. DeShon for the honor.LiNeBrEaK"Andy DeShon is a rising star of innovation by not taking 'no' for an answer, and while others complained of fuel prices and global warming, Andy did something about it," Mr. Lee wrote.LiNeBrEaKMr. DeShon's idea holds great potential, Mr. Lee said, because battery technology continues to improve.LiNeBrEaK"I think there's a lot of cities and states that can use it today and even more down the road," he said.LiNeBrEaKMr. DeShon, who holds a degree from the University of Missouri and works in ammonia refrigeration, got interested in electric motors when his uncle's dealership sold an electric lawnmower manufactured by General Electric. In the 1980s, he began working with battery-powered forklifts in his warehousing job. In 1998, he started doing serious research and development work, then four years ago, he hired engineers.LiNeBrEaKThe motor was fine-tuned and ready to run, but Mr. DeShon said he needed help getting the idea commercialized. The local Science and Technology Incubator connected him with Mr. Lee.LiNeBrEaKMr. DeShon studied the outdoor power industry to keep up with trends. From the experience with the prototypes, Mr. DeShon knew he wanted to work with Kubota.LiNeBrEaK"All their tractors are heavy-duty and user-friendly. There's no comparison with these tractors," he said.LiNeBrEaKUnder his partnership, Kubota will manufacture the lawn tractors in Georgia, then ship them to St. Joseph without engines. He'll install the electric motor and battery pack.LiNeBrEaK"We utilize all their safety features, so the quality and workmanship don't change," Mr. DeShon said.LiNeBrEaKIt takes about six hours to recharge the battery, at a cost of 35 to 50 cents, and the battery powers all the accessories. The retrofitted tractor has the same horsepower and speed as the original. From St. Joseph, the tractors will be shipped to California, Colorado and Texas -- where consumers are demanding alternatives with fewer emissions. With the modifications, the Kubota tractor still will be priced below a comparable John Deere model.LiNeBrEaK"This is a niche market with a high-quality tractor I'm comfortable promoting, because I know it will stand the test of time," Mr. DeShon said.LiNeBrEaKHe hopes to produce 1,000 units the first year and said St. Joseph has a qualified work force because of factories such as Altech and Snorkel. He's working on other agreements for other models. The biggest challenge now is obtaining funding for the assembly plant.LiNeBrEaK"Getting the financing in this economic climate puts it in a different level of difficulty," Mr. DeShon said.LiNeBrEaKBut with 20 years of research behind him and an electric lawn tractor humming beneath him, he has no doubts of success.LiNeBrEaK"We'll keep pressing on," he said.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Final Edition	Buying carbon credits gains steam  	SUSAN HYLTON World Staff Writer  	News; Pg. A10  	571 words  	A pilot program that allows carbon credits to be purchased from farmers and ranchers in western Oklahoma could help protect air and water quality in Tulsa if state officials can secure a buyer. The Western Farmers Electric Cooperative, an Anadarko-based power supply system, has agreed to purchase 8,000 acres in the North Canadian River Watershed to help offset the amount of carbon dioxide it produces to power Altus Air Force Base and other cooperative areas. Clay Pope, executive director of the Oklahoma Association of Conservation Districts, said they would like to do the same thing with eastern Oklahoma landowners in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed, which is the source of Tulsa's drinking water.  LiNeBrEaKPope said that agricultural carbon sequestration has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by up to 15 percent each year. "This isn't the total answer to the problem of climate change, but it is a piece to the puzzle," Pope said. "This is something that can help reduce carbon dioxide significantly and achieve our water quality goals." Typically, the buyer is a company that is seeking to offset the amount of carbon dioxide it is releasing into the atmosphere, which many scientists believe is contributing to climate change. Carbon sequestration increases the amount of photosynthesis that takes place, which results in an oxygen byproduct. Landowners can reduce carbon output by implementing techniques such as grass and tree planting, rotational grazing and no-till crop production which reduces erosion and runoff. With no-till farming, herbicides are used so that soybeans, for example, can grow in wheat stubble without a need to retill the land. No-till agriculture is equal to a 2- to 3-inch rain by holding moisture in the soil that would make it easier to grow biofuel crops like sunflowers, Pope said. In addition, it reduces the amount of diesel fuel that is spent on machines tilling the land. Carbon sequestration through no-till agriculture in western Oklahoma sold to WFEC for $3. 50 a metric ton of sequestered carbon dioxide. Rates in national and global markets vary. Pope said that no-till farming stores 0. 4 to 0. 6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per acre a year. "It's something we're just beginning in Oklahoma. You're not going to get rich doing it. It's a way to reward good stewardship," Pope said. Pope said landowners in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed have already been working to protect water quality with riparian zone restoration. The 150- to 300-foot buffers between the water and agricultural practices help reduce the harmful nutrient levels caused by excessive chicken litter and cattle grazing. In addition, Pope said that the Oklahoma Conservation Commission will soon launch a Carbon Certification program to assist buyers and sellers by verifying emission offsets. LiNeBrEaKHow it works LiNeBrEaKA company or individual purchases a carbon credit from a landowner who practices certain farming methods that absorb carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKCompanies purchase carbon credits voluntarily. Greenhouse gases are not regulated by the federal government, but many o_cials believe that mandatory caps are part of the future. Proposed legislation gives credit or flexibility to companies that adopt greenhouse gas reduction methods early.LiNeBrEaK Susan Hylton 581-8381 susan.hylton@tulsaworld.com 	AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (90%); CARBON OFFSETS (90%); WATER QUALITY (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); CROP PRODUCTION (89%); EROSION CONTROL (89%); RIVERS (89%); AGRICULTURE (78%); BIOMASS (77%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (77%); EROSION (73%); AIR FORCES (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (72%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (72%); SCIENCE NEWS (71%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (71%); BIOFUELS (69%); DIESEL FUEL (69%); HERBICIDES (64%); ARMED FORCES (56%) News  	FARMERS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE INC OF NEW MEXICO (58%); WESTERN FARMERS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE INC (58%)  	SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (58%)  	TULSA, OK, USA (92%) OKLAHOMA, USA (98%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	January 26, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Tulsa World   												It is hoped that the plan to offset carbon dioxide is adopted in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed.   				
Ventura County Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 25, 2009 Sunday 	Obama is urged to let tougher air rules stand: Pavley, governor ask for fast EPA waiver  	Timm Herdt, Ventura County Star, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	873 words  	Jan. 25--SACRAMENTO -- If President Barack Obama wants to move quickly on his pre-election pledge to combat global warming, California officials want him to know there is an off-the-shelf plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that his administration could put into action within months.LiNeBrEaKLess than 24 hours after the new president took office, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sen. Fran Pavley, the author of the state's landmark tailpipe emissions law, separately wrote Obama. They asked that his administration promptly issue a waiver that would allow California and other states to begin implementing regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. LiNeBrEaKEnforcement of the California regulations was put on hold in late 2007 when the Bush administration denied a federal EPA waiver that must be issued before the state can move ahead.LiNeBrEaK"The action your administration takes will have a tremendous impact nationwide, not just here in California," wrote Pavley, D-Agoura Hills. "This action will help expedite and spur innovation in our automotive industry to manufacture clean, efficient cars."LiNeBrEaKPavley said she is optimistic action will be taken quickly, noting that EPA Administrator-designate Lisa Jackson told senators during a confirmation hearing last week that, if confirmed, she intends to "immediately revisit" the waiver issue.LiNeBrEaKThe California law, enacted in 2002, would require automakers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent by 2020 and 27 percent by 2030.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations were originally intended to first affect 2009 model cars, but state officials say there is no need to rewrite the law's timetable because automakers have already made some improvements to their current fleets that meet the law's initial requirements.LiNeBrEaKIn a letter to Jackson, state Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols says reconsideration of the waiver could be handled through an expedited hearing schedule that addresses only the issues cited by former EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson in his rejection of the original request.LiNeBrEaK"At most, all that is needed is a short supplemental comment period," Nichols wrote.LiNeBrEaKIndustry opposes state limitsLiNeBrEaKThe auto industry, which has fought the California law from the outset, continues to assert that allowing state-level regulation of greenhouse emissions would create regulatory chaos.LiNeBrEaK"We share the concerns of California and the Obama administration on the need to enhance energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles," said Charles Territo, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. "We believe a national standard would be much more effective and much less chaotic."LiNeBrEaKPavley and other advocates counter that the California regulations would instantly become a de facto national standard because up to 18 other states have either adopted the California standards or are poised to do so. Those states, which include such populous places as New York and New Jersey, account for more than half the cars in the nation.LiNeBrEaKThe federal Clean Air Act gives California special status in adopting air quality regulations. The state is allowed to adopt standards more stringent than federal requirements but must receive a waiver each time it does so. Before the Bush administration denial, the EPA had routinely granted more than 50 previous waiver requests.LiNeBrEaKOnce a waiver is granted California, all other states have the option of either abiding by federal regulations or adopting the California standards.LiNeBrEaKA push toward progressLiNeBrEaKPavley said she believes the auto industry is poised to meet the California standards. She noted American automakers outlined steps they were taking to produce more efficient, less polluting cars when they presented business plans to Congress late last year when seeking a federal bailout.LiNeBrEaK"I think they're all getting close," she said. "I think we're past the tipping point."LiNeBrEaKTerrito said one of the problems for automakers is the fleet efficiency averages needed to meet the new standards would vary from state to state, depending on consumer choices. In California, for instance, a majority of new vehicles purchased are cars while in Oregon, a majority of purchases are for SUVs and light-duty trucks.LiNeBrEaKPavley indicated she would be willing to consider such concerns, perhaps by allowing for interstate averaging among the participating states similar to plans to allow for the trading of carbon credits among the seven states that participate in the Western Climate Initiative.LiNeBrEaKThe problem has been that the industry has yet to participate in discussions over the details of how to implement the law, she said.LiNeBrEaK"They never engaged in the substance at any level of discussion," she said. "It's always been their first priority to file lawsuits, and they've lost in every courtroom."

The Washington Post 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Met 1 Edition	Energy Costs Generating Light-Bulb Solutions  	Lisa Rein; Washington Post Staff Writer  	METRO; Pg. C01  	1208 words  	They don't have the sex appeal of windmills or the cool factor of solar panels but cost a fraction of the price. In fact, their methods can be as low-tech as plugging a leaky air duct.LiNeBrEaKGovernments and utility companies across the Washington region are starting to roll out new "energy-efficiency" campaigns with the potential to lower bills, carbon emissions and the area's dependence on foreign oil without building a single coal or nuclear plant. Energy experts say that they can reap large benefits by encouraging people to retrofit homes with changes as simple as new shower heads, light bulbs and refrigerators.LiNeBrEaKEfficiency programs were popular in the 1980s and early 1990s but receded to the background during the more recent era of deregulation. Now, concerns about global warming, rising fuel prices and price tags in the billions of dollars for new power plants have prompted new interest. States from California to Massachusetts are mandating that utilities offer subsidies on home energy audits, discounts on energy-saving light bulbs and appliances, and rebates or low-interest loans to homeowners who install insulation, replacement windows or weatherstripping along the sides of a doorway. And the federal government would increase spending on efficiency programs under President Obama's stimulus plan. LiNeBrEaKWith some of the country's most aggressive efficiency standards for devices from washing machines to traffic signals, Maryland is helping to lead the way. Proceeds from emissions-permit sales to power plant owners are allowing the state to provide millions of dollars to help low-income homeowners conserve energy. Last month, state regulators ordered Pepco, Baltimore Gas and Electric and three other utility companies to offer their residential and business customers a suite of energy-saving strategies this year, including a $40 home audit whose cost can be waived if the customer agrees to have energy-saving light bulbs installed throughout the house.LiNeBrEaKMaryland won't pay for you to save energy. All customers will bear the cost of the new programs with a monthly surcharge of up to $2. 50 on their monthly electric bill, according to preliminary estimates -- even if they do nothing.LiNeBrEaKSkeptics say it's not clear that the programs will make a real dent in the region's energy use, and many homeowners would not see significant savings unless they invest thousands of dollars. Still, experts predict that the investments eventually will pay for themselves and then some, helping depress Maryland's demand for power by the equivalent of three coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaK"You'll break even or make money if you do nothing more than screw in a few fluorescent light bulbs," said Douglas Nazarian, chairman of the Maryland Public Service Commission.LiNeBrEaKThe District is adding and beefing up similar programs. And in Virginia, where Dominion Virginia Power says it has sold 2. 4 million low-energy bulbs and received tens of thousands of hits on its Web site section of energy-saving tips, the General Assembly is considering several bills that would require utilities to come up with efficiency programs. Like leaders in Maryland and the District, Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has pledged to reduce the state's carbon footprint, setting aggressive goals of a 19 percent reduction by 2025. Both states and the District also have pledged to tap into alternative power sources and offer high-tech devices that cycle down thermostats and air conditioners when demand peaks.LiNeBrEaK"No, you're not going to invite all the neighbors over to show off your insulation," said Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. "But the savings can be considerable."LiNeBrEaKD.C. resident Elizabeth Fox said she was thrilled to take advantage of an existing city program to get a lengthy, free audit of her 100-year-old leaky home in Northwest after she received a flier in the mail. "We got a written report we kept referring back to" while renovating the home's third floor, she said. She added new insulation and a super-efficient washer, dryer and hot-water heater, and air conditioner. Her heating bill last month was well over $500, "so I can't say we've stopped the leaky air," she said. But with the third floor in use for the first time, "Our energy bills have stayed the same, so that's a savings."LiNeBrEaKAt least 12 states have mandated energy-efficiency programs since 2006, among them three New England states that have adopted rules requiring that utilities show they have pursued such strategies before they are allowed to build new power plants, Nadel said.LiNeBrEaKObama's stimulus plan would help retrofit 2 million homes and three-quarters of federal buildings to be more efficient, saving low-income homeowners $350 a year in utility costs, on average. Former president George W. Bush's fund to bail out the financial industry revived a little-known federal tax credit of $500 for efficiency investments that had expired in 2007.LiNeBrEaKDuring the period when Maryland, the District and many other areas deregulated, energy companies cut costs to prepare for competition and pledged to let the free market take care of energy efficiency. That competition never materialized, leaving some Maryland customers with rate increases of more than 70 percent.LiNeBrEaKAdvocates of energy-efficiency programs say today's strategies are more refined because of new technology. The twisty, low-energy light bulbs, which use one-third of the power of conventional ones, didn't exist a decade ago. Hot-water heaters, stoves and other appliances burn far less power now than they used to.LiNeBrEaK"What was energy efficient 10 years ago is not energy efficient today," said Malcolm Woolf, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's top energy adviser. O'Malley (D) led the General Assembly to adopt one of the country's toughest conservation goals last year, calling for a reduction in energy demand of 15 percent by 2015.LiNeBrEaKToday's programs are being marketed more aggressively and offer homeowners more incentives. Still, it's not clear how many will participate.LiNeBrEaK"The only sure thing is that everybody pays a surcharge, but how we make sure everybody benefits is something we struggled with," Nazarian said.LiNeBrEaKIn Maryland, the PSC initially rejected a program devised by BGE, saying its projected $130 million in marketing and administrative costs was excessive. The plan approved last month cut those costs by almost 45 percent.LiNeBrEaKMarketing will matter, though. Allegheny Power sent unsolicited energy-saving light bulbs to tens of thousands of customers in Western Maryland in 2007, then charged their bills under a plan approved by regulators. The commission and lawmakers were deluged by furious customers, and the utility was forced to apologize and offer refunds.LiNeBrEaKWhen Maryland's five utilities have their programs up and running, they will have invested about $1 billion through 2015. Pepco, which serves 750,000 residential customers in Maryland and the District, plans to subsidize a higher-end audit in both jurisdictions that will cost homeowners $100. Officials predict that at a minimum, Maryland customers could save $20 a year by replacing six conventional light bulbs with compact fluorescent ones. By replacing 12 bulbs and a leaky heat pump, the savings could shoot to $700.

The Washington Post 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Every Edition	A Gentleman And His Canal;  On Amsterdam's Waterways, Going With The Flow of History, Art and Maybe Love 	William Powers; Special to The Washington Post  	TRAVEL; Pg. P01  	1812 words  	"Why not finish your book in my villa in Tuscany?" my British friend Annabelle said to me over cocktails in her London flat. Beside us, her Oxford friends traded quiet ironies in the queen's English. "We hate to board it up for fall," she continued, "and would love to house a writer." As I drained my gin and tonic down to its ice, I had to admit to myself that being a freelance has perks. Sure, there's no health insurance or 401(k). But one can occasionally benefit from such European aristocratic traditions as the sharing of second homes, off-season, with starving artists.LiNeBrEaK"It's in an Italian architecture magazine this month," Annabelle continued, as if the phrase "villa in Tuscany" lacked persuasive punch.LiNeBrEaKTuscany was tempting, but I had an even more appealing option: a historic canal house in Amsterdam. LiNeBrEaKMy Dutch friend, Jacques, had just offered me a room in his four-bedroom house "in Amsterdam." I wasn't so tactless as to ask: "So, which canal are you on?" But I imagined a handsome chap like Jacques on the Keizersgracht (Emperor's Canal) or Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal) or even the city's first canal, the famous Herengracht, the Gentleman's Canal.LiNeBrEaKSo I turned down Tuscany and headed to Amsterdam, thinking along the way how pleasant it would be if we could choose our own epoch. No one consulted me about being born into the age of global warming, weapons of mass destruction and product placement. If I could choose -- and travel indulges just this sort of escape-artistry -- Amsterdam's 17th-century Golden Age wouldn't be a bad option. I closed my eyes and imagined the view of the Gentleman's Canal from my classicist mansion, a de Hooch or Vermeer painting springing to life outside the window.LiNeBrEaKAlas, a single glance at Jacques's digs undermined my century-switching fantasy. He lived in a condo in an Amsterdam suburb called Almere. The 1970s functionality of the place screamed Munch, not Vermeer. And since Jacques had just moved in to the unfurnished place, I was relegated to a thin foam mattress on the floor.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, I felt compelled to have Jacques's meals prepared when he returned from the office, leaving little time for the 1 1/2 -hour sojourn to the canals (inconveniently, by foot, bus, train and foot again). I did manage to make it in one day but took a wrong turn en route to the Gentleman's Canal and ended up lost in the alleys of  De Wallen, the city's red-light district, amid male and female prostitutes, sex shops and museums dedicated to cannabis and carnality.LiNeBrEaK"Do you want to watch two people having sex?" a gruff Dutchman asked me in front of a peep-show entrance.LiNeBrEaKOkay, so I was curious. And it was only two euros. But I suppose I feel the same way about making love as I do about tennis: much better to play than to watch. "I have to get back to Almere," I told the man, gloomily, "to put Jacques's pot roast in the oven."LiNeBrEaKDuring dinner (unfortunately, in front of the TV), Jacques translated the evening news. Amsterdam, he said, is positioned for efficient insertion into the 21st-century Flat World, the level playing field promised by globalization. As he listed the enormous corporations headquartered in Amsterdam (Heineken International, the ING financial services company, Delta Lloyd Group, Philips), the 17th-century Golden Age seemed to vanish entirely. I'd traded Tuscany for this?LiNeBrEaKTo escape the television and Jacques's smoking, I took an after-dinner walk through an Almere park that sprang from AutoCAD, the architectural software, with its concrete paths and monoculture of pines spaced precisely 30 feet apart. I was so awash in regret that I hardly noticed a car racing into the middle of the park, right toward me.LiNeBrEaKI spun around just as one of the ugliest men I've ever seen leapt out of the car and pointed at me, shouting a guttural word that could only translate as "Yooou!"LiNeBrEaKTwo younger men and a 20-something woman jumped out as well. She pointed at me and exclaimed that -- yes! -- I'd done it. The three men charged.LiNeBrEaKI fled. After a quarter-mile, one of them tackled me. The others caught up and began kicking me in the ribs and skull. Protecting myself with my arms as best I could, I shouted: "I'm American!" Oops, wrong thing to say. The blows rained down even harder. Just as the lights and sirens arrived, I fainted.LiNeBrEaKI woke up later in a hospital bed, calming figures of authority leaning over me, a kind of Fisher-Price set come to life: doctor, nurse, policeman.LiNeBrEaK"They claim they mistook you for a thief," the doctor said.LiNeBrEaK"But they're in jail now," the policeman added, "and under Dutch law those drug addicts will have to pay you."LiNeBrEaK"How much?" I managed to eke out, mentally scanning my bruised body; amazingly, nothing was broken.LiNeBrEaK"Seven . . . " he started to say.LiNeBrEaKWell, go on, I thought. Seven thousand? Seventeen thousand? By gosh, I was feeling so much better.LiNeBrEaK"Seven hundred euros."LiNeBrEaKThis anticlimactic sum reminded me of the scene in "Austin Powers" where Dr. Evil holds the world hostage for just $1 million. Still, the day's thuggery had a silver lining. Those 700 euros were my ticket to the Gentleman's Canal.LiNeBrEaKI used the little windfall and Craigslist to rent an apartment in a registered 17th-century canal house for a week. My Amsterdam address: 10 Herengracht.LiNeBrEaKNearly as I'd dreamt it, my light-drenched living room's four slightly wavy glass windows overlooked the canal. Around the Golden Bend sat the homes of the city's historically richest residents, such as the De Neufville family at Herengracht 475, with its splendid facades, and Herengracht 466, designed by the well-known baroque architect Philips Vingboons.LiNeBrEaKAn architect acquaintance (I'd met her a year before, in La Paz, Bolivia), the 30-year-old Mymza, came for a visit. Half Dutch and half Bolivian, Mymza is not only physically striking but also in possession of a charming blend of northern European exactness and Latin spontaneity.LiNeBrEaKWhen I opened the door, she exclaimed in Spanish, "&Acirc;&iquest;Dios mio, que te pas&Atilde;&sup3;?" (My God, what happened to you?), as she gingerly caressed the bruise on my jaw. Then, looking past me, she added in English, "And how did you score something on the Gentleman's Canal?"LiNeBrEaKAs I explained the connection between the bruise and the flat, she gawked over the splendor of it all. We sipped tea on my rear patio-deck, enjoying a hidden angle into Amsterdam's canal zone. The backs of the canal houses face into one another, so we spied into the lives of my well-heeled neighbors, their stuccoed ceilings and courtyard gardening. Finally, Mymza said: "I have a surprise for you."LiNeBrEaKIt couldn't have been a better one: an old-fashioned black bike. Amsterdam has long been awash in bicycle culture, but with today's eco-consciousness, it boasts more than a half-million bikes, and ubiquitous racks and bike lanes.LiNeBrEaKAs the days passed in the canal zone, my life increasingly resembled a 17th-century fairy tale. Mymza and I biked together alongside the girdle of concentric canals, ringing our handlebar bells just for the crisp sound of it. She'd often reach up to touch overhanging tree leaves as we passed by, a periodic connection with nature in the city. We'd stop, and she'd point out canal-house gable distinctions or indicate double-wide mansions with coach houses.LiNeBrEaKWe biked to the Rijksmuseum for Rembrandt one day and to the Stedelijk for Mondrian the next. Then we visited the city's most popular museum, the Van Gogh, designed by Gerrit Rietveld. "Look how van Gogh employs light," Mymza said in front of his famous sunflowers, which exploded in yellow, practically jumping off their canvas. The Van Gogh Museum is arranged chronologically, tracing the painter's tragic life, and we watched the skies darken in one of his last works, "Wheat Field With Crows," which conveys a bleak loneliness, perhaps a suicide note put to canvas. Van Gogh took his own life at age 37.LiNeBrEaKEach morning, I watched the light on the canal through the windows, and one day I felt inspired to paint it. I purchased oil paints and tried -- okay, I failed miserably -- to capture the water's milky gleam.LiNeBrEaKOne evening Mymza, who dabbles  in photography, looked at my attempts at painting and insisted we try something. Grabbing cameras and a bottle of cabernet, we made for the canal below. From a Herengracht dock, we took a hundred photos of the leap of moon- and street-lamp-light on the water. Art, it seemed, was so much more than form and color; it had to do with understanding light and its transitions.LiNeBrEaKI felt a transition in me: The line between tourist and I-live-here was starting to blur. I had a gorgeous apartment, albeit for only a week, a beat-up Dutch bike and even a favorite local hangout, a dimly lit cafe that I found so much more appealing than the crowded ones on Leidseplein. And while there was dope on the cafe menu, neither Mymza nor I would partake. Marijuana is overkill in a city so afloat in sensory experience: luxuriating over spicy Indonesian cuisine in canal-side bistros, the sound of October leaves crunching under my bike wheels. And then there's the friendly nature of the locals, best captured by the Dutch word "gezellig."LiNeBrEaKGezellig could be translated as "cozy." I'd slipped out of the 21st century since I'd left dreadful Almere and cozied into an earlier era, one that I didn't really wish to leave.LiNeBrEaKAstride my bike in front of the canal house the next day, I lingered to chat with two of my Herengracht neighbors, a distinguished mid-50s couple, before biking alone out of the network of canals to the harbor. A strong, chilly wind blew in from the North Sea, and it seemed it might rain. I thought of Joseph Conrad's description of Amsterdam as seen from a boat in his 1906 "Mirror of the Sea." I gazed into the mirror of the sea, noticing the way it refracted the ash-gray sky, and I tried to view the light as Vermeer might have.LiNeBrEaKOn my final night in the canal house, I held a dinner party. Jacques made it in from the distant condos of Almere. Another architect friend named Belle also showed up, along with some acquaintances of Mymza's.LiNeBrEaKAt the end of the evening people were extending invitations. Wait a minute, I thought. I'm just passing through, right?LiNeBrEaKMymza came up behind me and threaded her arms around my waist. She'd invited me to stay a while longer. In her flat.LiNeBrEaKJacques's eyes met mine, and he laughed, a very gezellig guffaw, and I knew why: In a week he'd watched me go from pauper in Almere to Golden Age prince in Amsterdam. I'd slaved in Jacques's kitchen and suffered blows, but in the end stumbled into money, muse and maybe even love. "My friend," he said, the Gentleman's Canal glazed with sparking lamplight below, "you've been Amsterdamed."LiNeBrEaK William Powers is author, most recently, of "Whispering in the Giant's Ear: A Frontline Chronicle From Bolivia's War on Globalization" (Bloomsbury/Macmillan).

The Washington Post 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Every Edition	Rhodes Scholar's 'Goofy' Ideas Slashed Energy Costs at College House in Half  		EXTRAS; Pg. LZ03  	1052 words  	 Lucas Brown, who grew up in Leesburg and is a senior at Oberlin College in Ohio, worked on a project called a SEED (Student Experiment in Ecological Design) house. He and his roommates devised unusual ways to cut energy costs while they were living in the house.LiNeBrEaKBrown, 22, was cited for his environmental activism last year when he won a Rhodes Scholarship, which he will use to study at Oxford University. In an interview with loudounextra.com reporter Charity Corkey, he talked about the SEED house and the Rhodes Scholarship, which is awarded to 32 Americans annually. LiNeBrEaKQ Tell us about the SEED house you co-founded with two other Oberlin students.LiNeBrEaK A We had been working in New Orleans together, gutting flood-damaged houses and talking about how global warming could be leading to these more devastating hurricanes, and we wanted to take control of our carbon emissions. We wanted to do something personally.LiNeBrEaKSo we came back to campus and started working on designing and financing a renovation to a college-owned house. After a couple of years, we moved in, but a lot of the budget had gotten used just making sure the house met safety codes. It's very old. So, with hardly any money for green features, we had to improvise, and ended up making a lot of small, simple, quirky lifestyle changes that slashed our energy bills in half.LiNeBrEaKAnd because our green techniques were pretty goofy, most people in our tour groups and church workshops get excited about bringing the fun stuff home.LiNeBrEaKWhat were some of the techniques and features you developed to save energy?LiNeBrEaK The house is a duplex, so we have two identical sides and a good amount of friendly competition between them. We unplugged all of the kitchen appliances on one side of the house. When we unplugged the fridge on my side, I was grumpy about not having milk for morning coffee or ingredients to cook lunch. But it made us go to the other side of the duplex more often, so our community became closer, a completely unexpected and rewarding byproduct.LiNeBrEaKLast year, we kept a creepy picture of [former North Carolina senator] John Edwards above the shower to get people out of there quicker. We also have "shower clocks" filled with sand that remind us how long we've been showering. We recycle our sink water and use it to flush the toilet, and we have pet worms that compost our food. We usually try to study in the same room, so instead of using eight light bulbs, we use one.LiNeBrEaKA lot of people ask us what our house rules are, but we don't have any. Everyone has different needs, so we don't ban anyone from doing anything. Some people need longer showers, or it's important to them to get their hair dry. As one visitor commented, "You guys seem more eco-friendly than eco-fascist."LiNeBrEaK To date, who holds the record for shortest shower, and what was their time?LiNeBrEaK I think Andy Barnett, the marathon runner who lived in SEED last year, still holds the record at two minutes 15 seconds. We're talking about a full cleaning here, too -- you can't skip the shampoo and have it count. Andy is intense about everything.LiNeBrEaK How many students live in the SEED house? And are you still living there?LiNeBrEaK Eight students live there. It was a tough decision, but I decided to pass the torch and not live there this year. Those of us who founded it were worried about the transition once we graduated, and we wanted to be here on campus while the SEED house was becoming its own, independent organization.LiNeBrEaK What was your initial reaction when you found out you'd been selected as a Rhodes Scholar?LiNeBrEaKAfter all our interviews, the selection committee deliberated for a couple of hours while we watched football and played cards in the lounge next door. Then the chairperson invited us into the conference room, spoke briefly and read the two names.LiNeBrEaKI was totally stunned. I really didn't think I was at all qualified for a scholarship like this. I still thought they might have misspoken, but a lot of people were shaking my hand, and then there were only two of us left in the room, so it seemed to be a mistake they were sticking with.LiNeBrEaKEven now, I think I'm a little unqualified. When they published the biographies of the Rhodes Scholars, everyone had eight or 10 lines, and they really couldn't say that much about me, so one of my Loudoun friends calls me Short Paragraph. But my mom always said it's better to be lucky than good.LiNeBrEaK You've also conducted research for D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) on the city's job-training programs, helped design the Web site ilovemountains.org and lobbied Congress for environmental change. With all this experience, where do you see yourself in 10 years? What do you hope to accomplish?LiNeBrEaKI'd like to continue to work on environmental issues. Specifically, I'm interested in how we can join economic growth with environmental improvement, how we can create jobs while reducing the harm that environmental problems cause to people.LiNeBrEaKI've always been interested in helping people, and it's really the people I've met -- in New Orleans, in the coalfields of Appalachia -- that keep me motivated to work on environmental issues.LiNeBrEaK What projects will you work on when you join the other Rhodes Scholars in Oxford in October?LiNeBrEaKI'll start a master's degree in economics. That'll be my big project.LiNeBrEaKAlthough you have lived in Ohio for four years, you have been able to visit your home in Leesburg fairly regularly. When you move to Oxford, what will you miss about Loudoun County?LiNeBrEaK I'll miss the hills the most. When I'm driving home, I start to get excited once I get on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and the whole landscape turns into a series of rolling hills. But that's mostly an emotional response to other things I love about Loudoun -- my family and the laid-back, friendly culture.LiNeBrEaK How do you think that growing up in Loudoun -- where rural areas meet the suburbs -- has affected your viewpoint on the environment?LiNeBrEaK I'm not sure the increasing suburbs in Loudoun had too big of an impact on my environmental interest. I'm mostly interested in environmentalism for the people's lives that are at stake because of global warming, unhealthy air or polluted water.LiNeBrEaK UP CLOSE is a feature in which Loudoun County residents talk about their jobs, interests and experiences in the community.

The Washington Post 		January 25, 2009 Sunday   Regional Edition	Warming Trends Alter Conservation;  Experts Think Old Paradigm of Fixed Boundaries Will Not Work as Sea Levels Rise 	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A03  	1368 words  	At the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on Maryland's Eastern Shore, sea-level rise threatens to drown the brackish marsh on which migrating shorebirds depend. In Northern California, the shrinking snowpack has reduced stream flows that sustain the delta smelt, a federally threatened fish species. Higher summer temperatures in northern Minnesota have depressed the birthrates of the area's once-populous moose, and just 20 inhabit the Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge that was designed in part to shelter them.LiNeBrEaKAs climate change begins to transform the environment in the United States and overseas, policymakers and environmentalists are realizing that the old paradigm of setting aside tracts of land or sea to preserve species that might otherwise disappear is no longer sufficient. It was an idea that worked in 1872, when one of the reasons cited for establishing Yellowstone National Park was to help preserve the few remaining buffalo.LiNeBrEaKBut as temperatures rise and animals and even plants migrate to more hospitable habitats, fixed boundaries set years ago no longer provide the protection some species need. Experts are exploring new strategies, focusing on such steps as protecting migration corridors, collecting and transplanting seeds, making sanctuary boundaries flexible and managing forests in novel ways. LiNeBrEaK"We have focused on one single principle: You protect the place where the animals live," said Lawrence A. Selzer, president and chief executive of the Conservation Fund. "That's fine as long as everything's static."LiNeBrEaKNow, with rapid change, federal agencies, including the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are beginning to draft management policies that take global warming into account.LiNeBrEaKNOAA Assistant Administrator Richard W. Spinrad advocates creation of a national climate service to give agencies across the federal government better access to scientific projections so they can anticipate and plan for eventualities such as extended droughts and changes in water flows.LiNeBrEaK"Many people felt this was a marginal issue to their particular missions, and now they're realizing it's not," Spinrad said, adding that the new thinking reflects "the accelerated pace in which we are seeing the direct impact of climate change on the environment. . . . The need for a national climate service is as strong now as the need for a National Weather Bureau was 120 years ago."LiNeBrEaKComing up with concrete strategies for coping with warming trends is a tougher challenge. Anne Morkill, who manages the Key Deer National Wildlife Refuge north of Key West, Fla., said her staff is working with the Nature Conservancy and Florida International University on models of sea-level rise to determine to what extent saltwater intrusion will erode the rocky pine habitat that supports the Key deer and other species. The refuge was created in 1957 to protect the rare subspecies of white-tailed deer, which became geographically isolated 20,000 years ago; after dwindling to a low of 25, the population now stands at 500 to 700.LiNeBrEaKRefuge managers could try to relocate the deer, Morkill said, but "a Key deer outside the Florida Keys is no longer a Key deer." Moreover, she said, officials need to ask themselves: "How much resources should we use today to preserve a habitat that may disappear in 50 years?"LiNeBrEaKProtecting wildlife, these experts say, can involve setting aside more land for species to migrate, protecting higher-elevation habitats that have lower temperatures and rooting out invasive species that threaten native ones. Scientists are suggesting that managers of marine sanctuaries look for coral reefs capable of withstanding higher temperatures and change sanctuary boundaries if necessary.LiNeBrEaK"You can change those lines as long as that flexibility is written into the policy," said David Obura, who directs the nonprofit research and advocacy group Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian Ocean.LiNeBrEaKTeri Rowles, lead marine mammal veterinarian at NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, said scientists have recently spotted gray whales north of Barrow, Alaska, in the early months and a humpback whale in the North Slope area, signs that arctic animals are moving north to seek new territory. "That puts them in new areas we have not had to manage before," she said.LiNeBrEaKDan Ashe, science adviser to Fish and Wildlife Director H. Dale Hall, said agencies such as his need "to think on much broader scales about conservation" and shift from basing their projections on past climate patterns to an uncertain future. "We have to be much more predictive, which is an uncomfortable place for us to be," Ashe said.LiNeBrEaKInterior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne created a climate change task force in March 2007 that outlined 80 climate policy options on Dec. 3; the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a more detailed draft climate plan less than two weeks later, urging the agency to find ways to connect broader landscapes and assess which species are at the highest risk because of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"It would have been better if we had started to address it sooner," Ashe said, "but right now we're in a pretty good spot."LiNeBrEaKBut Patty Glick, senior global warming specialist for the group National Wildlife Federation, said that "it's only in the last year or so the federal agencies are starting to take notice" of how higher temperatures will affect conservation efforts.LiNeBrEaKAcademics and conservation groups have just begun to calculate the costs of trying to protect landscapes and species in light of climate change. The Wildlife Federation has called on the government to set aside $7. 2 billion annually for the next two decades to help natural resources in the United States adapt to global warming. Sandy Andelman, who directs Conservation International's tropical ecology, assessment and monitoring network, University of Minnesota environmental economist Stephen Polasky and colleagues have calculated that it could cost at least $5. 8 billion overall to safeguard biodiversity in the humid tropics unless the world slashes its greenhouse-gas emissions quickly.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers suggest that countries use some of the future revenue generated from auctioning off greenhouse-gas pollution permits to fund these conservation efforts, but Polasky acknowledged it might be hard to "outcompete" other interest groups that will seek to channel these funds to programs such as "green" technology projects or energy subsidies for low-income Americans.LiNeBrEaKTo prod government officials, conservation activists have begun making projections about the future state of sensitive habitats across the globe. In May, the Wildlife Federation published a report estimating that the sea level would rise 27 inches by 2100 and that the Chesapeake Bay region -- including Blackwater -- would lose more than 90 percent of its tidal fresh marsh, tidal swamp and brackish marsh by the end of the century. The group said the projections were conservative.LiNeBrEaKThe Nature Conservancy has calculated that just maintaining California's Mount Hamilton wilderness in the face of warming will cost more than $100 million over the next 30 years, triple the current cost, for activities such as land acquisition and restoration and relocation of species.LiNeBrEaK"The cost analysis is giving a heads-up this is definitely business unusual," said Rebecca Shaw, the conservancy's director of science in California. "We're not going to meet our management goals, and, if we do, we're going to bankrupt the state in the process."LiNeBrEaKStill, environmentalists say there are ways to prepare for such an unpredictable future. Thomas Dwyer, who directs conservation programs for the northern Pacific flyway at Ducks Unlimited, said he is hoping to preserve wetlands for migrating waterfowl by acquiring conservation easements on farmland lying behind dikes along the Pacific Northwest coast to "let the sea migrate inland" as its level rises. If the water rises high enough, Dwyer reasons, some owners might be willing to let conservation groups buy their undeveloped land and breach the dikes.LiNeBrEaK"We just need to look down the road 30 or 40 years and make sure we can have options to restore these estuaries," he said.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	HSBC: Green concerns continue into downturn  	Nareerat Wiriyapong, Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	451 words  	Jan. 24--Consumers continue to demand that their governments fund emission-reduction projects, despite the current financial crisis, according to an international HSBC survey.LiNeBrEaKThe poll of 12,000 general consumers in 12 countries, including five Asian nations, found that most respondents want their governments to do more to tackle climate change, partly through investing in clean and renewable energy. LiNeBrEaKThey want governments to support projects in these sectors that might not be commercially viable otherwise, said Teresa Au, HSBC's head of corporate sustainability for the Asia Pacific region.LiNeBrEaKConsumers in India, China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Australia took part in the survey during September and October 2008, after the outbreak of global financial troubles, said Ms Au.LiNeBrEaKShe said HSBC aimed to be the first "carbon-neutral" bank and to provide financial solutions for consumers to run green projects, partly by offering funds to reduce energy consumption.LiNeBrEaKThe economic threat from climate change is very clear, she said. She added that reducing emissions could cost half of the world's gross domestic product, although it could be cut to 1-2 percent of GDP by rapid and effective action.LiNeBrEaKMs Au recently participated in the Asia Pacific business forum in Bangkok, attended by over 200 climate change experts. Most panelists were optimistic that efforts to move toward low-carbon economies would not be delayed by the deepening global financial crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe new US administration has put climate change mitigation activities at the core of its $825US-billion economic stimulus package, said James Gifford, executive director of Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).LiNeBrEaKRichard Welford, chairman of CSR Asia, said the private sector has realised that there is no time for seeking profit by ignoring the imminent threat of climate change.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap), the region is currently responsible for 34 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also home to seven of the world's 15 worst greenhouse gas-emitting countries.LiNeBrEaKBut the Asia-Pacific region has plenty of skilled human resources for developing clean energies and technologies, said Noeleen Heyzer, undersecretary-general of the United Nations and Escap's executive secretary.

The Boston Globe 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   THIRD EDITION	Going green doesn't have to mean going broke  	Paul Johnson  	OP-ED; Pg. A11  	703 words  	PREVENTING global warming and preserving the environment are unlikely priorities for cities and towns in a time of shrinking revenues. Going green seems too costly to consider when you're going broke.LiNeBrEaKOr so people think. What many mayors and town managers don't realize is that getting on the environmental bandwagon and going green can actually save their cities and towns money. And getting started can be cost-free or very inexpensive and surprisingly easy.LiNeBrEaKMunicipal officials and community energy-activists ate up these revelations at the recent Smart Growth Smart Energy conference at the Boston Exhibition Center, where representatives from the state's Department of Energy Resources described what the Green Communities Act could do for strapped local budgets. LiNeBrEaKSaving energy dollars is no easy task for cities and towns with their multiple buildings, overlapping metering systems, scattered billing information, and diffuse accountability. But it is estimated that municipal buildings frequently waste up to 30 percent of the energy dollars poured into them. The Green Communities Act - together with the rebate programs now offered by the utilities - makes it possible to capture many of these lost dollars.LiNeBrEaKThe law aims to help cities and towns save energy in schools, city halls, and firehouses, and generate their own energy from renewable sources. To become eligible for the state's assistance, municipalities have to get over one big hump: They have to establish how much energy they are using. This can be a Pandora's box of hitherto unidentified areas of waste, and municipal leaders with neither money nor staff to solve the problems may opt to keep the lid on.LiNeBrEaKBut establishing energy use is a vital first step - and the state is now offering assistance to cities and towns to find and destroy their energy hogs. Coming online is an Energy Information Reporting System that consolidates a community's energy bills and provides energy use by individual building, by the square foot, by department, and in some cases at intervals as short as 15 minutes, making it easy for communities to monitor energy use in all their buildings.LiNeBrEaKWhat does it cost a city or town to access this new information system? Nothing.LiNeBrEaKWith detailed information on energy use, you may find that your high school is using twice the energy comparable high schools in your region are using. You can now request a free audit from the state to find the problem, which may be anything from inadequate weather-stripping to energy-inefficient lighting or a low-performing furnace.LiNeBrEaKHere's where the utility companies come in. They will provide and install everything from compact fluorescent light bulbs and sensors that automatically turn off lights when a room is not occupied, to high-efficiency motors and whole new heating and air conditioning systems. For free? Not quite, but the companies offer rebates of up to 75 percent, resulting in a comparatively small expenditure with 0 percent financing that will usually pay for itself within two years.LiNeBrEaKAnd there's an alternative route that is even easier. Your town can sign a seven- to 10-year contract with an energy service company. You continue paying what you're now paying for energy while the service company provides and installs energy-efficient systems and pays for them with the difference between the cost of running the old systems and the savings from running the new. At the end of the contract period, the new systems - and all future savings - are yours. Your bills go down accordingly.LiNeBrEaKThe state has also set up a $10 million fund for cities and towns that will jump through the necessary hoops - such as promising to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles - in order to become designated green communities. With this money, municipalities can buy solar panels for a high school, or put up a wind turbine to generate their own energy. They might even use the money to develop an alternative energy-related industry in town, producing jobs and profits.LiNeBrEaKSeems like a no-lose situation. Cities and towns across the Commonwealth would be smart to jump on these new opportunities as quickly as possible.LiNeBrEaKPaul Johnson is a green building consultant and community activist based in Gloucester.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Activists digging into new regulatory czar's body of work for clues to his policy direction  	By Tom Hamburger and Christi Parsons, Chicago Tribune  	NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS  	892 words  	WASHINGTON _ Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein, a widely admired public intellectual and friend of President Barack Obama, has spent years delving into the obscure issues of regulatory law and behavioral economics.LiNeBrEaKThough he is generally described as left-of-center, Sunstein's academic interests in regulation have led him to raise questions about the constitutionality of liberal favorites like workplace safety laws and the Clean Air Act. He has embraced a controversial "senior death discount" that calculates the lives of younger people as having a greater value than those of the elderly.LiNeBrEaKUntil recently such debates have taken place largely in the rarefied world of legal scholarship. But now that Obama has named Sunstein to serve as his regulatory czar, environmentalists and labor activists are digging into his voluminous body of work _ and wondering what policies might emanate from a man so dedicated to calculating the dollar value of every regulation. LiNeBrEaKSunstein, a former professor at the University of Chicago Law School where Obama also taught, has reiterated in recent days his belief in "defending a strong regulatory state." Much of his academic and popular work is devoted to understanding human behavior and determining which systems will motivate people, corporations and nations to do the right thing.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental activists say his published views on cost-benefit analysis are more aligned with what they'd expect from a George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan appointee. The more a regulation stood to cost industry, the less likely those administrations were to impose it.LiNeBrEaK"If a Republican nominee had these views, the environmental community would be screaming for his scalp," said Frank O'Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, a Washington-based advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKInstead, the response has been muted, as environmental and labor groups question the wisdom of criticizing the nominee of a popular new president who has promised to support their agenda.LiNeBrEaKAt first blush, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs might sound like a remote bureaucratic outpost. Since the Reagan era, however, it has had significant influence over federal efforts to protect the public from unsafe food, toxic chemicals, polluted air, climate change and workplace hazards.LiNeBrEaKThat's because the office reviews any major regulatory idea that comes from an executive branch agency, a power well-known to business lobbyists. They are applauding Sunstein's appointment, hoping he might slow the march back toward aggressive regulation under Obama.LiNeBrEaKLabor and environmental advocates, on the other hand, want Democratic senators to question Sunstein closely at his confirmation hearing. Chief among their concerns are his legal theories and their potential to hamper tough regulation.LiNeBrEaKAFL-CIO political director Bill Samuel said Sunstein is "a respected scholar and a strong believer in government regulation."LiNeBrEaKBut he added: "We have concerns about some of his academic writings regarding his approach to regulatory policy and regulatory review. We want to hear more from him about how he intends to approach regulatory policy."LiNeBrEaKSunstein declined to comment for this story, saying he wouldn't speak publicly before confirmation hearings.LiNeBrEaKBut in an e-mail to Obama advisers this month provided to the Tribune, Sunstein said he has devoted much of his career to supporting strong regulation and to figuring out how to make it better.LiNeBrEaK"I do talk a lot about cost-benefit analysis," he wrote in the letter, "and that gets me in trouble in some quarters."LiNeBrEaKHe described his first book, "After the Rights Revolution," published in 1990, as a "sustained defense of the regulatory state, above all in the environmental area." The book lists as its first goal to "defend government regulation against influential attacks."LiNeBrEaK"I also believe that significant steps should be taken to control the problem of global warming," he said in the e-mail, excerpts of which were provided to the Tribune by a person close to the transition who asked not to be identified.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview, John Podesta, leader of Obama's transition, called Sunstein "brilliant." Sunstein's academic prowess would enrich debate in the Obama White House, he said.LiNeBrEaKFew labor or environmental groups offered to comment on Sunstein's selection.LiNeBrEaKAn organization of liberal lawyers, however, will publicly cast a stone at Sunstein this week. On Monday the Center for Progressive Reform plans to release an 18-page review of his work by member scholars expressing concern.LiNeBrEaK"Professor Sunstein's long track record on regulatory issues is decidedly conservative. As longtime colleagues of professor Sunstein who have debated him numerous times in a variety of settings, we write this paper to explain those concerns," the report says.LiNeBrEaKThe report describes federal regulation as "badly broken" after years of neglect and undermining, particularly by GOP appointees.LiNeBrEaK"Professor Sunstein would seem to represent more of the same," the report says.

The Hour (Norwalk, Connecticut)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Predicting a boom in solar power  	Lauren Mylo, The Hour, Norwalk, Conn.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	639 words  	Jan. 24--WILTON -- Although you may not see ubiquitous solar panels while driving through Wilton, the officials of Alteris Renewables, Inc. say the idea is becoming more accepted.LiNeBrEaK"It's just the fact that you had to believe number one, climate change was a real issue, and number two, the United States uses so much energy," said Ron French, Alteris' president and former president of Solar Works, Inc., which combined with SolarWrights, Inc. of Stonington to become Wilton-based Alteris Renewables, Inc. in October.LiNeBrEaKThe company name is a combination of "alt" as in alternative energy and "teris," from the latin word terra which means earth. LiNeBrEaK"It's probably the biggest industry in the world," said chief operating officer Tim Seamans of energy production, which for Alteris means solar electric (photovoltaic), solar thermal and wind energy solutions. "We created a name that was beyond solar."LiNeBrEaKSeamans is the former chief financial officer of Solar Works, Inc., and Robert Chew, former president of SolarWrights is now Alteris' president of residential business with a headquarters in Bristol, R.I.LiNeBrEaKThe officials said as more people realize the benefits of solar systems -- reduced electric bills, no emissions, energy independence, an increased home value and energy leadership, to name a few -- more are signing on.LiNeBrEaK"There's nothing in a solar panel that's expensive -- it's not made of diamonds or gold," said French. "The same thing will happen to solar as with a Mac -- the first one was $5,000 and it did nothing."LiNeBrEaKBut solar panels have already proven they are capable of producing results, even if they lack prevalence: A 193. 6 kilowatt solar energy system installed by SolarWorks at R.C. Bigelow will avoid about 5,020,809 pounds of carbon dioxide during 25 years.LiNeBrEaKFrench said it's one of the most important things his customers look for: The positive environmental impact.LiNeBrEaKSteve Edwards, director of public works in Westport, said he knows the financial benefits are a long time coming for a system like the one the town installed in the Westport Firehouse through Solar Works three years ago, but he said it's been a great decision.LiNeBrEaK"It certainly is a step in the right direction (of conservation)," said Edwards of the town's 23 kilovolt system through the help of a Clean Energy grant. "It works very well, and we're very happy with it."LiNeBrEaKThe company has also installed systems in regional commercial and residential buildings and schools such as the Newtown Youth Academy, United Natural Foods and Greenwich Academy, as well as six residential systems in Wilton.LiNeBrEaKFrench said one state program that may help increase solar systems popularity is the Connecticut Solar Lease Program.LiNeBrEaKThe program is targeted at moderate-income Connecticut homeowners and allows a no money down, fixed rate opportunity to install a solar system through many local companies, including Alteris. The lease is fixed for the first 15 years.LiNeBrEaKFrench said there's a savings associated with the fixed rate and the fact that the engineering life of a system is 25 years or more.LiNeBrEaK"It's much like the newly inaugurated president in his move to use, in his words, the sun, wind and soil, to provide power," said Seamans.LiNeBrEaKWith a grin, French added: "We had the same idea he did but decided not to run for president."LiNeBrEaKAlteris is a portfolio company of Riverside Partners, a Boston-based technology and health care private equity firm. The headquarters is at 523 Danbury Road.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	New satellite monitors climate;  Japan's orbiter will collect data on methane, CO2 	ERIC TALMADGE, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	A; Pg. 20  	274 words  	TOKYO - Japan on Friday launched the first satellite to monitor greenhouse gases worldwide, a tool to help scientists better judge where global warming emissions are coming from, and how much is being absorbed by the oceans and forests. LiNeBrEaKThe orbiter, together with a similar U.S. satellite to be launched next month, will represent an enormous leap in available data on carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, now drawn from scattered ground stations.LiNeBrEaK"I'm saying Christmas is here," said an enthusiastic Inez Fung, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. "Now we get about 100 observations every two weeks. With the satellite we'll get a million."LiNeBrEaKThe satellite - named Ibuki, which means "breath" - was sent into orbit along with seven other piggyback probes on a Japanese H2A rocket. Japan's space agency, JAXA, labeled the launch a success, and officials said they were monitoring the satellites to ensure they entered orbit properly.LiNeBrEaKIbuki, which will circle the globe every 100 minutes, will measure reflected light from the Earth to determine the density of the two gases.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to global warming, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels by power plants, motor vehicles and other sources. Methane has a variety of sources, including livestock manure and rice cultivation.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide emissions rose 3 percent worldwide from 2006 to 2007, international science agencies report.LiNeBrEaKIf emissions are not reined in, a U.N. scientific panel says, average global temperatures will increase by 4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100, causing damaging disruptions to the climate.

The Jamestown Sun (North Dakota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Could region be in for harsher weather for next few years?  	Keith Norman, The Jamestown Sun, N.D.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	523 words  	Jan. 24--The cold and snowy winter this season might be attributed to a change in temperature of the Pacific Ocean, said John Wheeler, meteorologist for Forum Communications Co. If that proves true the northern Plains could see several years of harsher weather in the future. LiNeBrEaK"2008 was the coldest year since 1996," Wheeler said. "That is a break in a trend of much above average weather and might be attributed to a shift in weather patterns involving sea surface temperatures in the Pacific."LiNeBrEaKThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation was discovered by fisheries scientists studying cycles in salmon populations in the late 1990s. They found surface temperatures of the eastern Pacific Ocean vary on about a 30-year cycle not only affecting fish populations but the weather inland. By studying historic records they have been able to establish a record of the phenomenon back to the 1880s.LiNeBrEaK"The sea temperature in the eastern part of the Pacific has been in a warm phase since 1980," said Dr. Steve Hu, associate professor at the School of Natural Resources and a staff member of the High Plains Regional Climate Center both located at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. "But it is now showing signs of reverting to the cold phase. The previous cold phase was from 1948 to 1979, the stormy years of the 1960s were in the cold phase."LiNeBrEaKBut Hu said the situation is more complex than just anticipating cold and stormy winters for the next three decades.LiNeBrEaK"The PDO controls about 30 percent of the weather factors for the northern Plains," he said. "The warm phase weakens the El Nino and La Nina effects. The next 30 years the cold phase will intensify those effects."LiNeBrEaKEl Nino and La Nina are Pacific Ocean currents near the equator that have an impact on the weather conditions of North America on an approximately 18-month cycle. According to the Web site of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, La Nina means wetter and colder winters in the northern part of the United States. El Nino weather tends to bring wetter weather to the south and drier winter conditions to the northern United States.LiNeBrEaKThe region is currently under the influence of a developing La Nina, according to the Web site of the National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center.LiNeBrEaKHu said while the warm PDO seen for the last 30 years has played a part in warmer average temperatures seen in parts of the United States over the past decades it can't be seen as the sole cause of the statistics often used to argue the existence of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Global warming is on a global scale," Hu said. "PDO is a minor thing in the total system of worldwide climate."

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Water: Cities, agriculture compete for precious, dwindling resource  	Jonah Owen Lamb, Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	2839 words  	Jan. 24--Draw a tall cool glass of water from the tap anywhere in this county, and you'll be drinking water that came out of the ground.LiNeBrEaKFor cities and farms alike, most water comes from one source -- wells. Much of the water Merced County uses comes from a common groundwater basin pumped by thousands of wells that, for the last 30 years, have been sucking down that resource.LiNeBrEaKThe communal depletion has taken a toll on the basin. In some areas of the county, wells are drying up.LiNeBrEaKFor most of the county's history, each year the bucket of water the county drinks from has been replenished with every winter's rains. But a complex nexus of growth, drought and failure to plan may be changing the calculus of water use in California and Merced County. LiNeBrEaKEver-expanding cities in Merced County -- still minor users in the broader picture -- are increasingly competing for water with farmers and the environment. This urban-rural-ecological division wouldn't be as much of an issue if climate change wasn't bearing down on the age-old weather pattern people have come to expect.LiNeBrEaKLess rain in the future will mean less water for more people, crops and local ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKIn preparation for this looming shift, state and federal authorities are trying to lessen the effects of both climate change and its human causes.LiNeBrEaKBut local land use, development and their impacts on water planning comprise another issue. Today, a collection of interests compete over the same sources of water. The success or failure of local preparations for the impending water crisis will make all the difference.LiNeBrEaKSome contend that unless cities,the county, water providers and farmers come together and plan intelligently for the future, the days to come will be ugly. If each local entity continues as before without regard to its neighbors, the basin may fall into legal infighting, governing water use through the courts -- or worse.LiNeBrEaKOne alternative is to form an elected body that governs collective resources. A body that may fundamentally alter the pattern of development and governance in the county -- with limits.LiNeBrEaKAnd because water under the ground knows no jurisdictions, the extreme solution might be a super agency with power over all water resources in the state. That is a solution few local governments would be happy with.LiNeBrEaK"Everyone will have to make compromises in order for all of us to survive," said Hicham Eltal, the chairman of an outfit that may be the future of water planning in Merced County -- MAGPI (Merced Area Groundwater Pool Interests). He's now a senior official of the Merced Irrigation District, the organization historically charged with managing a huge chunk of water resources.LiNeBrEaKBut to understand the future of water, you need to understand its present.LiNeBrEaKNo one knows exactly how much water there is below the ground. But there is an idea of how much water the county uses.LiNeBrEaKA 2001 study, the Merced Water Supply Plan, illustrates the competing forces that use water in Merced, as well as the burden that humans put upon the Eastern Merced Basin. The study looked at eastern Merced County, which sucks roughly a million acre-feet out of the ground each year. An acre-foot is the equivalent to the yearly water use of one Valley family or 326,000 gallons.LiNeBrEaKIt's no secret who uses the most water in Merced County -- farmers. In 2000, they collectively pumped 828,000 acre-feet from the ground just in the eastern half of the county. That number is projected to increase to 1,042,000 by 2040.LiNeBrEaKUrban pumping, the source of all urban water, only accounted for 39,000 acre-feet in that same period. But that number is projected to jump to 118,000 by 2040. The remaining water used comes from surface water, such as Lake McClure and the Merced River.LiNeBrEaKIf you want a sense of how many pumps use the basin's water, the 16,000 or so well permits issued by the county since 1975 would illustrate part of the picture. In the last three years alone, the county issued 843 such permits; many of those -- 578 -- were domestic permits.LiNeBrEaKWhile there are far fewer urban wells, ag wells only pump during the growing season, while urban wells pump year-round. The city of Merced, for instance, has 21 wells that automatically pump water all year. Atwater pumps anything from 8 to 14 million gallons a day. Livingston pumps roughly 1 million gallons a day.LiNeBrEaKThe implications of this increasing and varied demand are spelled out in the Merced Water Supply Plan: "Rapid population growth, changing agricultural practices, increased dependence on groundwater, and increased demands for water for environmental purposes have resulted in increased concern over the future of a reliable water supply"LiNeBrEaKThat study is not alone in its concerns for the future.LiNeBrEaKA study by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, titled "Preparing California for Climate Change," points out that the average temperatures in the state will increase by 2 to 4 degrees by mid-century, much of which will occur in the summer months.LiNeBrEaKAnd the Central Valley will feel much more of the heat than other areas. The warming will mean less rain, the study speculates. The warmth will reduce the snowpack in the mountains that for centuries has been counted on to supplement water needs when the rains tail off in the spring. The study says that snowpack may be reduced by anywhere from 12 to 42 percent.LiNeBrEaKTo further drive home the point, the California Department of Water Resources stated in the 2009 California Water Plan that "California is facing a significant water crisis in its history." That may address the current drought, but with the state's population projected to grow by more than 20 million people in the next 50 years, a water crisis may become the norm.LiNeBrEaK"We are seeing change, big change and we need to respond to it," said Deidre Kelsey, a Merced County supervisor.LiNeBrEaKOn farms across Merced, water and its future are more than a topic of conversation or conservation. It's about economic survival.LiNeBrEaKCindy and Bill Lashbrook count themselves lucky among Merced County farmers. They own a parcel on a Michigan-shaped bend in the Merced River north of Livingston. They have easy access to river water, a well and even a parcel with access to irrigation water if they need it.LiNeBrEaKBut the relative liquid abundance that feeds their 74 acres of cherry, almond and blueberries hasn't prevented them from taking a number of steps to reduce their use of water. They use drip irrigation on their orchards and have spread mulch across the ground cover to keep the soil moist. "We are fairly lucky here on the east side," Cindy Lashbrook said. She also sits on the county planning commission.LiNeBrEaKBut even as they try to reduce their farm's water use, they're aware of the stresses that collective use is putting on the basin. Bill Lashbrook said it takes twice as long as it once did for his well to cycle water up from underground. "This groundwater thing is scary," he said. "Everybody is saying it's dropping."LiNeBrEaKHowever painful, added Cindy Lashbrook, farming must make some changes to save water. Some marginal farmland may have to be retired. And some water-intensive crops, such as alfalfa, corn and cotton, may not have a future here. But, she added, cities will also have to make some sacrifices.LiNeBrEaKAside from farmers like the Lashbrooks, conservation efforts by cities, farmers and water purveyors are either in the works or already being practiced.LiNeBrEaKMerced Irrigation District, according to Eltal, its chief engineer, has made meaningful leaps in conserving its water use. Over the last decade, besides increasing efficiency, the district has cut back its pumping. "We used to run wells even in normal years," he said. Now MID only pumps when its reservoir is running low. In 2008, MID pumped 100,000 acre-feet from the ground, for example.LiNeBrEaKAside from drought years, by using more surface water, MID hopes to have less of an impact on the basin's health. One effort it has pushed is to get farmers to stop pumping and instead use surface water delivered by MID. This and other efforts have enabled the district to recharge the basin to the tune of 58,000 acre-feet a year.LiNeBrEaKEltal notes that conservation of farm water is double-edged. Less water used by farmers may reduce pumping and the use of water, but it also means less water is cycling back down into the soil, then into the water table to be used again.LiNeBrEaKCities, too, however late in the game, are increasing their conservation efforts.LiNeBrEaKMike Wegley, the acting director of public works in Merced, contends that conservation can make an important difference. Besides looking to irrigate landscaping with reused water as well as encouraging more water-efficient landscaping, the city plans to mandate low flushing toilets and shower heads that use less water. The city also plans to meter new water hookups. "Once it is metered, people take more notice of their consumption," he says.LiNeBrEaKThe same kinds of conservation ideas are emerging in other cities in the county too. Even businesses are pondering water.LiNeBrEaKJoseph Gallo Farms, owner of 12,000 acres in Merced County, has a fairly complicated water reuse and recycling program. Carl Morris, the dairy's general manager, says he does "a whole lot trying to reduce the amount of water our farming operation uses." Like others in the county, Gallo gets water from wells, MID and surface water. But it has set up a series of water reuse systems that not only saves water but money, said Morris.LiNeBrEaKAn example is the reuse of their cooling system water to wash out cow pens. After the water is used to clean their premises, it is then used to irrigate fields for feed. The dairy also uses old water piped to one of its ranches from a cannery to irrigate fields. Morris calculates that these and other reuse measures save the dairy a million gallons a day.LiNeBrEaKBusiness and government aren't the only ones that recognize the need to use less water.LiNeBrEaKJohn Grant and his wife, Lisa Kayser-Grant, live in a house he built tucked behind a line of thick trees on Bear Creek Drive in Merced. It doesn't look like the other houses in the neighborhood, all with green lawns laid out before them.LiNeBrEaKThe Grants' lawnless yard is just one sign of their consciousness about water. Everything they plant in the backyard, says Lisa Kayser-Grant, is something they can eat. They plan to put in a gray water system that will reuse their washing machine, shower and dish- water in the garden. They also plan to put in a composting toilet that uses no water.LiNeBrEaKTheir tactics are partly driven by their desire to live off the grid, but also by the knowledge that easy access to clean drinking water is coming to an end. "We are very out of touch with our sources of water," Lisa Kayser-Grant suggests, about most policy makers.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think the leadership is knowledgeable of how critical this thing is," chimed in John Grant.LiNeBrEaKThis sentiment is shared by others.LiNeBrEaKWhile there have been efforts to plan for water shortages, critics contend that the leadership across the county has failed to grasp the magnitude of the problem.LiNeBrEaKDiana Westmoreland Pedrozo, executive director of the Merced County Farm Bureau, said none of the county's leaders has been planning as they should about water. She admits that part of the blame lies with overlapping jurisdictions that make cooperation difficult.LiNeBrEaKBut that doesn't excuse the rapid development the county has seen over the past decade. "We need to get away from the idea that all they have to do is drill a well and everything is going to be fine," she says. "That has been the attitude for all of this development that was overblown, and we have no idea what the implications are going to be."LiNeBrEaKCities and the county haven't wanted to deal with the issue, she said: "If our leaders don't step up we are going to be in some real trouble."LiNeBrEaKGreg Wellman, Atwater's city manager, clearly sees the looming crisis. And he admits that cities haven't done as much as they could have. "Could local government have done more? Yes. But that doesn't mean we can't play catch-up now," he says.LiNeBrEaKCounty Supervisor Kelsey says that where the county is concerned there hasn't been adequate planing for water. But, she noted, since the county doesn't actually have authority over any water source, its officials have been limited in terms of planning. "We don't control water," she said. But she does recognize that the many interests in the county are going to have to join forces if a planned communal effort is going to work. "You have all these moving parts in the county, and they compete," she observes. "They must cooperate. When things don't work out collectively you'll see someone get sued."LiNeBrEaKThe only such effort on the horizon -- MAGPI -- is in the embryonic stage.LiNeBrEaKEltal says the hope is that MAGPI members will form a joint powers authority (JPA) that includes all the east side's players in an elected body that would govern water use. "We are trying to say, 'Let's work together so we are in sync,'" he proposes.LiNeBrEaKThe first step, says Eltal, is to get an idea of how much water there is. In March, a groundwater study that will answer this question is slated to begin. Once the study is complete, there'll be real data on how much water there is under the ground.LiNeBrEaKOnly then, says Eltal, can the basin start moving forward to some kind of agreement. The goal would be a regional body that governs water use. In a lot of ways, says Eltal, this would change how cities and local governments work. It would be government within limits -- ecological limits.LiNeBrEaKWhile so far there has been cooperation with MAGPI on the east side, some don't see it as a silver bullet for water cooperation.LiNeBrEaKCounty Supervisor Jerry O'Banion thinks the current structure of water management will be able to face the coming challenges. He isn't opposed to the idea of MAGPI, but he isn't assured that it will solve all the area's future water problems. "I question what would be the value of one additional level of government," he says.LiNeBrEaKAtwater's Wellman says there is definitely a need for cooperation when it comes to water planning, but a JPA may not be the only answer. "I think the issue is up for grabs," he says. "Given the magnitude of the problem, you may have some kind of state initiative."LiNeBrEaKMost experts agree that no matter what kind of body or law comes down the pipe, a limit on development is going to occur. And that may change fundamentally how the government and the economy work.LiNeBrEaK"We are going to have to change the economic paradigm," says Andrew Gutierrez, a systems analyst at UC Berkeley who was part of a study on climate change's effect on the state. "We can't continue to have this paradigm of unbridled growth as an indicator of economic health. There will be a conflict between economics and ecology."LiNeBrEaKFor Sharon Hermosillo, who lives among almond orchards near Le Grand, such cosmic concerns are not as pressing as her tap failing to run after her well ran dry last year. "This summer toward the end of the summer, all of a sudden there was no water," she recalls. She went a month without water. Her neighbors' wells have been going dry too.LiNeBrEaKHermosillo's new deeper well cost almost $20,000 to put in, she reckons. And like Hermosillo, everyone else in the area is sucking from the same sinking pool. Two orchards near her have also sunk new wells recently. "I don't know what I would do if it happened again," she said. "Maybe I should move?"LiNeBrEaKIf local leadership fails to create workable strategies, what happens to Sharon Hermosillo may well portend what happens to many Mercedians in the future's water wars.LiNeBrEaKCommentsLiNeBrEaKAdd CommentLiNeBrEaKHelp and InfoLiNeBrEaKPost Your CommentLiNeBrEaKYou are signed in as:LiNeBrEaKSubmit Your CommentLiNeBrEaKYou need to be logged in to leave a comment.LiNeBrEaKCommenting on this story has been closed.LiNeBrEaKMercedSunStar.com is pleased to be able to offer its users the opportunity to make comments and hold conversations online.

"Now we get about 100 observations every two weeks. With the satellite, we'll get a million."LiNeBrEaKThe satellite - named "Ibuki," which means "breath" - was sent into orbit along with seven other piggyback probes on a Japanese H2A rocket. Japan's space agency, JAXA, said the launch was a success, and officials said they were monitoring the satellites to ensure they entered orbit properly.LiNeBrEaKIbuki, which will circle the globe every 100 minutes, is equipped with optical sensors that measure reflected light from the Earth to determine the density of the two gases.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to global warming, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels by power plants, motor vehicles and other sources. Methane has a variety of sources, including livestock manure and rice cultivation.LiNeBrEaKInternational science agencies report that carbon dioxide emissions rose 3 percent worldwide from 2006 to 2007. If emissions are not reined in, a U.N. scientific panel says, average global temperatures will increase by 4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100, causing damaging disruptions to the climate.LiNeBrEaK"Global warming is one of the most pressing issues facing the international community, and Japan is fully committed to reducing CO2," said Yasushi Tadami, an official working on the project for Japan's Environment Ministry. "The advantage of Ibuki is that it can monitor the density of CO2 and methane gas anywhere in the world."LiNeBrEaKScientists currently depend on 282 land-based stations - and scattered instrumented aircraft flights - to monitor carbon dioxide at low altitudes. Ibuki, orbiting at an altitude of about 415 miles, will be able to check gas levels in entire columns of the atmosphere at 56,000 locations.LiNeBrEaKWith the current ground-level network, "due to the relatively small number of locations, only large-scale regional averages could be determined" for greenhouse-gas emissions, said Swiss climatologist Fortunat Joos, of the University of Bern.LiNeBrEaKWith satellite readings, he said, "one would perhaps be able to discriminate carbon emissions from different countries."LiNeBrEaKSuch data could help negotiators in ongoing global climate talks determine more precisely who would need to reduce emissions by how much to protect the climate.LiNeBrEaK"Basically, we're sort of doing detective work," Fung said. "We may be able to see fossil fuel emission hotspots."LiNeBrEaKAP, Kyodo NewsLiNeBrEaKA rocket carrying the world's first greenhouse-gas monitoring satellite takes off Friday from the Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan.

The New York Times 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	Europe to Ask Wealthy Nations to Adopt Carbon Trading System  	By JAMES KANTER  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 9  	536 words  	The European Commission was preparing an appeal on Friday to wealthy countries -- and to the United States in particular -- to adopt carbon trading as one of the main mechanisms for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaK  The Europeans are drafting their proposal as the United States enters a period of intense debate over the wisdom of adopting such market-based systems following the inauguration of President Obama.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama endorsed a similar system to cap and trade carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, during his election campaign. That system sets a limit on emissions, and those who exceed it must buy or trade permits to meet it.LiNeBrEaK  The main alternative to a cap-and-trade system is a tax on emissions. Many analysts say that would be a more straightforward way of limiting planet-warming gases from industry.LiNeBrEaK  So far, Europe has created the largest single market for trading permits to emit carbon dioxide, while Australia and some groups of American states have begun their own initiatives. But the European system has also come under fire for doing too little to stop pollution and for creating vast windfall profits for some industries, like coal-burning utilities.LiNeBrEaK  European officials have acknowledged that the European Union's emissions trading system has had a rocky start. But they say it has become more effective following a pilot phase, which ran from 2005 to 2007. LiNeBrEaK  European Union governments approved further measures late last year aimed at reducing the scope for lobbying by governments and industry that diluted the effectiveness of the system during the pilot phase.LiNeBrEaK  The commission's proposals could still change before they are officially presented Wednesday by Stavros Dimas, the European Union environment commissioner. They are meant to lay out Europe's stance as nations prepare for international talks in December in Copenhagen to negotiate a successor agreement to the Kyoto climate treaty.LiNeBrEaK  A centerpiece of the commission's proposals is ''strategic bilateral partnerships'' with the United States ''to create a trans-Atlantic carbon market,'' according to the proposals, seen on Friday by The New York Times.LiNeBrEaK  The proposals also seek to encourage the participation of developing nations by helping them finance ways to adapt to climate change and cut emissions.LiNeBrEaK  In the past, efforts at reaching global, coordinated action on climate change have been undermined in large part because the United States insisted on binding emissions limits for countries like India and China. Those countries resisted mandatory rules, saying they had the right to industrialize and improve their citizens' standards of living.LiNeBrEaK  Some of the businesses that regard emissions regulation favorably because it could promote new investment opportunities welcomed the latest proposals. LiNeBrEaK  Adam Nathan, a spokesman for the Carbon Markets and Investors Association, a trade group, praised the central role for the carbon market set out by the commission. But he warned that support from the United States and others would be critical.LiNeBrEaK  ''Cooperation with the Obama administration must focus on leveraging comparable action from the United States and supporting developing countries in their efforts,'' he said.

The New York Times 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   The New York Times on the Web	Europe Wants U.S. to Join Carbon Trading Market  	By JAMES KANTER  	Section ; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg.   	519 words  	The European Commission will  call on the United States to create a trans-Atlantic system of carbon trading to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to press for the establishment of similar markets in developed countries, according to a draft document seen Friday by The International Herald Tribune. LiNeBrEaK  Under President Obama, the United States is entering a period of debate over whether to adopt such market-based systems or use a more straightforward tax to limit planet-warming gases from industry.LiNeBrEaK  Europe created the largest single market for trading carbon permits in 2005. Since then, Australia and some American states have begun initiatives. But the European system has come under fire for doing too little to stop pollution and for creating  windfall profits for some industries that it was intended to target, like coal-burning utilities.LiNeBrEaK  European  officials have insisted that their emissions trading system has become more effective after a pilot phase from 2005 to 2007, and they have put in place measures aimed at preventing lobbying by governments and industry from diluting its effectiveness.LiNeBrEaK  The  document, which was circulating Friday, and which could change over the weekend, describes the stance of European officials as they prepare for talks in Copenhagen in December on a climate treaty to take the place of the Kyoto protocol. The first phase of the Kyoto treaty expires in 2012.LiNeBrEaK  A centerpiece of the commission's proposals is ''strategic bilateral partnerships with the United States, to create a trans-Atlantic carbon market,'' according to the document.LiNeBrEaK  The proposals also envision member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forming a single carbon market by 2015.LiNeBrEaK  Shipping and aviation, industries that were not part of the earlier Kyoto climate treaty, should  be included in any successor treaty, according to the European proposals.LiNeBrEaK  The proposals also seek ways of helping developing nations cut emissions and finance ways of adapting to climate change. One suggestion is that rich nations raise billions of euros each year for the developing world through a levy on air and ship transportation, or by using part of the proceeds from the sales of pollution permits by governments.LiNeBrEaK  Past efforts at coordinated global action on climate change have been halted mostly because the United States has insisted on emissions limits for countries like India and China. Those countries resisted mandatory rules, saying they had the right to industrialize and improve standards of living.LiNeBrEaK  Some businesses that regard climate regulation favorably because it could promote new investment opportunities welcomed the European initiative.LiNeBrEaK  Adam Nathan, a spokesman for the Carbon Markets and Investors Association, praised ''the central role for the carbon market set out by the commission.''

The New York Times 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	More Than Charisma  	By BOB HERBERT  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 21  	763 words  	  On a rainy October night in 2006, I took a cab to the John F. Kennedy library here to conduct a very public interview. As we pulled up, the driver asked, ''Who's on the program?''LiNeBrEaK  ''Barack Obama,'' I said. LiNeBrEaK  ''Oh,'' he replied, ''our next president.''LiNeBrEaK  I mentioned this to then-Senator Obama during the program and he got a good laugh out of it. He hadn't yet announced that he was running. The capacity crowd in the auditorium was clear about what it wanted. It cheered every mention of a possible run. Obama-mania was already well under way, and it would only grow.LiNeBrEaK  I was back at the library this week to interview Gwen Ifill about her new book, ''The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama,'' and I wondered aloud about this continuing love affair with all things Obama  --  the feverish excitement, the widespread joy and pride, and the remarkable surge of hope in an otherwise downbeat, if not depressing, period.LiNeBrEaK  Where was all this coming from? What was it about?LiNeBrEaK  Yes, as everyone agrees, Mr. Obama is handsome, fit, smart, and a great speaker. As Ms. Ifill noted in her book, ''Voters are attracted to youth, vitality and change.''LiNeBrEaK  And Americans tend to get giddy over winners, especially underdogs who take the measure of a foe thought to be impregnable  --  in this case, the mighty forces carefully assembled over several years by the Clintons.LiNeBrEaK  And it's not just the president himself who looks good. Even the shameless purveyors of fantasy at central casting would blush at the thought of crafting a family as picture perfect as the Obamas. So, yes, there is an awful lot to like about the Obama phenomenon.LiNeBrEaK  But I've seen charismatic politicians and pretty families come and go like sunrises and sunsets over the years. There was something more that was making people go ga-ga over Obama. Something deeper.LiNeBrEaK  We've been watching that something this week, and it's called leadership. Mr. Obama has been feeding the almost desperate hunger in this country for mature leadership, for someone who is not reckless and clownish, shortsighted and self-absorbed.LiNeBrEaK  However you feel about his policies, and there are people grumbling on the right and on the left, Mr. Obama has signaled loudly and clearly that the era of irresponsible behavior in public office is over.LiNeBrEaK  No more crazy wars. No more torture, and no more throwing people in prison without even the semblance of due process. No more napping while critical problems like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, global warming, and economic inequality in the United States grow steadily worse.LiNeBrEaK  ''We remain a young nation,'' Mr. Obama said in his Inaugural Address, ''but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.''LiNeBrEaK  On Wednesday, his first full day in office, the president took steps to make the federal government more transparent, signaling immediately that the country would move away from the toxic levels of secrecy that marked the Bush years.LiNeBrEaK  ''Transparency and rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency,'' he said. It was a commitment to responsible behavior, and a challenge to the public to hold the Obama administration accountable. It reminded me of the wonderful line written into a federal appeals court ruling in 2002 by Judge Damon Keith:LiNeBrEaK  ''Democracies die behind closed doors.''LiNeBrEaK  This has been the Obama way, to set a responsible example and then to call on others to follow his mature lead. In Iowa, after his victory in the Democratic caucuses a year ago, he promised to be ''a president who will be honest about the choices and challenges we face, who will listen to you and learn from you, even when we disagree, who won't just tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to know.''LiNeBrEaK  In a cynical age, the inclination is to dismiss this stuff as so much political rhetoric. But Mr. Obama carries himself in a way that suggests he means what he says, which gives him great credibility when he urges Americans to work hard and make sacrifices, not just for themselves and their families but for the common good --  and when he tells black audiences that young men need to hitch up their trousers and behave themselves, and that families need to turn off the TV so the kids can do their homework.LiNeBrEaK  Or when he says of the many serious challenges facing the nation, as he did in his Inaugural Address: ''They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.''LiNeBrEaK  The bond is growing between the nation and its new young leader. Let's hope it's a mature romance that weathers the long haul.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	646 words  	Jan. 24--These Cove eighth-graders know more about robotics than most youths.LiNeBrEaKThey also know how to make a great debut.LiNeBrEaKThe six members of the Cove School District's Ace of Spades robotics team won the Rookie Team award for Day 2 at the Intel Oregon FIRST LEGO League championships in Hillsboro last weekend. Only squads comprised of members who are in their first year of robotics competition were eligible for the Rookie Team award.LiNeBrEaK"They did an excellent job," said Erich Dressen, the team's coach and a Cove middle school teacher. "To come in during your first year and be one of the best rookie robotics teams LiNeBrEaKin the state is quite an accomplishment.''LiNeBrEaKThe Ace of Spades was comprised of eighth-graders Kagan Koehn, Brandon Batty, Micah Parker, Kendra Hackwith, Luke Bundren and Addy Folsom.LiNeBrEaKThe Ace of Spades qualified for state at the regional FIRST LEGO League robotics tournament at EOU Dec. 6.LiNeBrEaKClimate change was the theme of the regional and state tournaments. Students programmed their robots, made in part from LEGOs, to complete 21 climate change-related tasks on an open table. Teams received points when their robots completed simulated tasks such as delivering a polar bear to an ice flow, placing insulation into a house, taking an ice core sample, making a levee higher and 17 other tasks.LiNeBrEaKIn September the Cove students began creating computer programs that directed their robot to complete a portion of the 21 challenges. The objective was to get their robot to complete as many of the tasks as possible in 2 1/2 minutes.LiNeBrEaKAt state, teams ran their robots through 2 1/2-minute rounds. Only the highest scoring round counted in the final score.LiNeBrEaKAfter each of the first two rounds, students adjusted their computer programs to get their robots to operate more efficiently. These changes were critical since once a robot started a run on the course students had no control of it. Each robot was completely reliant on the computer program created for it. No adjustments could be made once a computer started a 2-1/2 minute round.LiNeBrEaKThe Ace of Spades' robot performed better at state than regional. Team members had had an opportunity at regionals to correct glitches in their computer programs.LiNeBrEaK"They got the kinks worked out (at regional). They did twice as well at state,'' Dressen said.LiNeBrEaKTeams also received points for the following:LiNeBrEaK--A presentation of a climate-related research project they conducted. The Ace of Spades team gave a report on the disappearance in the ocean of krill, a major source of food for whales. Krill are a shrimp-like marine invertebrate.LiNeBrEaK--How they fared on a team-work challenge. Teams were presented with a challenge they had no knowledge of before hand. Each team had to respond in a limited amount of time. Teams had to create images of three people with an assortment of items including ping pong balls, nails and clay.LiNeBrEaKDressen and other Cove School District educators believe strongly in the value of having students involved in the robotics program. This is why the FIRST LEGO League robotics program is now part of Cove's eighth- and seventh-grade curriculum. It became part of the seventh-grade curriculum earlier this month.LiNeBrEaKParticipation in FIRST LEGO League competition develops more than students' understanding of computer programming. It also hones their ability to perform as a unit, Dressen said.LiNeBrEaK"They (the members of Cove's Ace of Spades team) learned a lot about robotics, but they learned more about teamwork.''

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   SOONER EDITION	JAPANESE SATELLITE TO GAUGE EMISSIONS;  U.S. ORBITER WILL JOIN IT NEXT MONTH 	Eric Talmadge, The Associated Press  	HEALTH, SCIENCE, MEDICINE and TECHNOLOGY; Pg. A-2  	753 words  	TOKYO -- Japan yesterday launched the first satellite to monitor greenhouse gases worldwide, a tool to help scientists better judge where global warming emissions are coming from, and how much is being absorbed by the oceans and forests.LiNeBrEaKThe orbiter, together with a similar U.S. satellite to be launched next month, will represent an enormous leap in available data on carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, now drawn from scattered ground stations.LiNeBrEaK"I'm saying Christmas is here," said an enthusiastic Inez Fung, an atmospheric scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. "Now, we get about 100 observations every two weeks. With the satellite, we'll get a million." LiNeBrEaKThe satellite -- named "Ibuki," which means "breath" -- was sent into orbit along with seven other piggyback probes on a Japanese H2A rocket. Japan's space agency, JAXA, said the launch was a success, and officials said they were monitoring the satellites to ensure that they entered orbit properly.LiNeBrEaKIbuki, which will circle the globe every 100 minutes, is equipped with optical sensors that measure reflected light from the Earth to determine the density of the two gases.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to global warming, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels by power plants, motor vehicles and other sources. Methane has a variety of sources, including livestock manure and rice cultivation.LiNeBrEaKInternational science agencies report that carbon dioxide emissions rose 3 percent worldwide from 2006 to 2007. If emissions are not reined in, a U.N. scientific panel says, average global temperatures will increase by 4 to 11 degrees Fahrenheit (2. 4 to 6. 3 degrees Celsius) by the year 2100, causing damaging disruptions to the climate.LiNeBrEaK"Global warming is one of the most pressing issues facing the international community, and Japan is fully committed to reducing CO2," said Yasushi Tadami, an official working on the project for Japan's Environment Ministry. "The advantage of Ibuki is that it can monitor the density of CO2 and methane gas anywhere in the world."LiNeBrEaKScientists currently depend on 282 land-based stations -- and scattered instrumented aircraft flights -- to monitor carbon dioxide at low altitudes. Ibuki, orbiting at an altitude of about 415 miles, will be able to check gas levels in entire columns of atmosphere at 56,000 locations.LiNeBrEaKWith the current ground-level network, "due to the relatively small number of locations, only large-scale regional averages could be determined" for greenhouse-gas emissions, said Swiss climatologist Fortunat Joos, of the University of Bern. With satellite readings, he said, "one would perhaps be able to discriminate carbon emissions from different countries."LiNeBrEaKSuch data could help negotiators in ongoing global climate talks to determine more precisely who would need to reduce emissions by how much to protect the climate. "Basically, we're sort of doing detective work," said Dr. Fung. "We may be able to see fossil-fuel emission hotspots."LiNeBrEaKThe scientists said readings from space should also enable them to better understand carbon's movement through the atmosphere, and its inadequately understood absorption by oceans and forests -- crucial to keeping warming from growing even worse than predicted.LiNeBrEaKThe upcoming NASA satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, will have more precise measurements because it will check only one gas, carbon dioxide, said David Crisp, that project's chief scientist. And its smaller observational target area will mean less chance of clouds contaminating sample results. Having two satellites will allow researchers to double-check results, Dr. Crisp said. "We need to understand what processes are controlling the amount of carbon dioxide today, so that we can understand how fast CO2 will build up in the future," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe launch of the piggyback satellites -- from Tanegashima, a remote island about 600 miles southwest of Tokyo -- was also seen as crucial to Japan's efforts to demonstrate that its domestically developed H2A rocket can compete in the global commercial launching business.LiNeBrEaKJapan has long been a leading space-faring nation, having launched its first satellite in 1970, but in recent years, it has struggled to get out from under China's shadow and gain a hold in the global rocket-launching industry, which is dominated by Russia, the United States and Europe's Arianespace.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this month, Japan got its first commercial order, from South Korea, to launch a satellite on an H2A. Liftoff is scheduled after April 2011.

The Pueblo Chieftain (Colorado)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Going solar still good investment  	Juan Espinosa, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	682 words  	Jan. 24--In the 10 months since getting our solar electric system online at our residence, the photovoltaic system has generated more electricity than we used during six of those months.LiNeBrEaKThe only months that I have had to buy electricity from Black Hills Energy (formerly Aquila), have been July, August, December and January. The increased electrical usage in July and August is because we were using our central air-conditioning system.LiNeBrEaKThe increase in late November, December and early January, is largely because my propane furnace went out and we were using a wood stove and an electric baseboard heater to heat the house. The furnace was repaired earlier this month and our electric bill should go down accordingly. LiNeBrEaKHow does that translate to dollars, you might ask? In comparing six months -- from August 2008 to January 2009 -- to the same months in 2007 and 2008, We paid $342 less for electricity. Because the use of electric baseboard heat was temporary, I estimate I easily will save $700 a year with my system.LiNeBrEaKThe system we installed at our home is rated at 4,500 watts and should produce an average of 23 kwh of electricity a day year-round. Black Hills Energy paid a rebate of $4. 50 per watt for the system. To calculate the rebate, multiply 4,500 (watts) times $4. 50 and you get $20,250. The system we had installed cost roughly $33,000.LiNeBrEaKWe received a $2,000 solar tax credit on our 2007 federal income taxes, which means that after the tax credit and rebate, we paid $10,750 for the system. Divide that by the $700 we are saving per year and I calculate it will take about 15 years and a couple of months to recoup our investment.LiNeBrEaKI initially estimated it would take only 10 years to break even on our investment. What I didn't take into calculation is a flat monthly fee of $15. 34. There also was a slight increase in our homeowner's insurance.LiNeBrEaKIf the cost of electricity goes up within those 15 years, the payback period will be shorter.LiNeBrEaKAlthough it's going to take longer to break even, I'm still satisfied that it was a good investment. The way I look at it, I was going to buy electricity anyway. Now I am the proud owner of my own electrical power plant and my home, for the most part, is running on clean energy that comes from the sun. We are not burning fossil fuels, or contributing to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and besides, the collectors give our place a futuristic look.LiNeBrEaKThe best part is that since my system has a 25-year warranty, I should still get at least 10 years of free electricity after we recoup our initial investment.LiNeBrEaKIn the time since we had our system installed, Aquila has been bought by Black Hills Energy. Kenny Romero, who oversaw the solar rebate program for Aquila, said this week that the incentives from Black Hills Energy are identical to Aquila's.LiNeBrEaKHe is encouraging people to go solar while the rebates are available. One change in the federal tax incentive, according to Romero, is that the cap of $2,000 has been raised to 30 percent of the actual out-of-pocket costs to the taxpayer.LiNeBrEaKObviously, I still am convinced going solar is a sound investment while Black Hills Energy and the IRS are offering rebates and tax incentives. Without these incentives, however, people who go solar may never recoup their investment. And saving the planet, alone, is not enough incentive for most.LiNeBrEaKProgram requirements and lists of reputable photovoltaic installers are available on the Black Hills Energy Web site.LiNeBrEaKJuan Espinosa is The Chieftain night city editor.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   All Editions	EPA chief vows to place science over politics;  Jackson pledges transparency 	By JAMES M. O'NEILL, STAFF WRITER, North Jersey Media Group  	NEWS; Pg. A04  	518 words  	Newly confirmed Environmen-tal Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson on Friday reaffirmed her commitment to using hard science as the cornerstone for the agency's policy decisions, something she emphasized during her confirmation hearings before a Senate committee last week. LiNeBrEaKHer comments underlined a significant shift from the EPA under the Bush administration, which was criticized by scientists who said their research had been subjected to political interference.LiNeBrEaK"Science must be the backbone for EPA programs," Jackson said in a memo to EPA employees. "When scientific judgments are suppressed, misrepresented or distorted by political agendas, Americans can lose faith in their government to provide strong public health and environmental protection."LiNeBrEaKJackson, the former head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, recently left as Governor Corzine's chief of staff to take the post at EPA, where she had worked for 16 years.LiNeBrEaK"The American people have gained a tireless public servant and a tenacious guardian of the environment with the confirmation of Lisa Jackson as our nation's EPA administrator," Corzine said Friday in a statement. At the DEP, "Lisa set the highest professional standards ? Her work on the reduction of greenhouse gases and combating global warming will serve as a national model."LiNeBrEaKSome New Jersey environmental groups also praised Jackson's confirmation by the Senate. "Lisa Jackson will be a great part of President Obama's green team. She is part of the change that we need," said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKIn her memo to EPA staff, Jackson said she would make "respect for the EPA workforce a bedrock principle" of her tenure. "EPA should once again be the workplace of choice for veteran public servants and also talented young people beginning careers in environmental protection, just as it was for me when I first joined EPA shortly after graduate school."LiNeBrEaKEchoing a theme of the new Obama administration, Jackson said that "EPA's actions must be transparent." In her memo she also insisted that "policy decisions should not be disguised as scientific findings. I pledge that I will not compromise the integrity of EPA's experts in order to advance a preference for a particular regulatory outcome."LiNeBrEaKJackson was confirmed by the Senate Thursday after Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, lifted a hold he had placed on her nomination. The hold was related more to concerns about the role of White House climate and energy adviser Carol Browner, who does not need Senate confirmation. Barrasso lifted his hold on Jackson after speaking with Browner.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and head of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, cheered the confirmation of Jackson at EPA and of Nancy Sutley to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"I am really pleased that the Senate has taken the first steps toward restoring the EPA and CEQ to their proper role as organizations that fight to protect the health of our families and the safety of our air, our water and our planet," Boxer said.

A07  	590 words  	Missile strike kills 18 in PakistanLiNeBrEaKISLAMABAD, Pakistan ? Suspected U.S. missiles killed 18 people on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border Friday, security officials said, the first attacks on the al-Qaida stronghold since President Obama took office.LiNeBrEaKAt least five foreign militants were among those killed in the strikes by unmanned aircraft in two parts of the frontier region, an intelligence official said without naming them. There was no information on the identities of the others. LiNeBrEaKPakistan's leaders had expressed hope Obama might halt the strikes, but few observers expected he would end a tactic that U.S. officials say has killed several top al-Qaida operatives and is denying the terrorist network a long-held safe haven.LiNeBrEaKThe United States has staged more than 30 missile strikes inside Pakistan since August last year.LiNeBrEaKCongo rebel chief arrested in RwandaLiNeBrEaKKINSHASA, Congo ? In a stunning reversal of alliances, Rwandan troops captured Congo's most powerful rebel leader, a longtime ally who the Congolese government says was at the heart of years of war in the east, officials said Friday.LiNeBrEaKCongo applauded the surprise arrest, hoping it would herald a new era of peace and mark the end of the Central African nation's Tutsi rebellion. But few believe the country's problems are over, and many fear the unprecedented deal with former enemy Rwanda is a risky gamble.LiNeBrEaKRwanda detained Laurent Nkunda apparently as part of an agreement with Congo that opened the way for thousands of Rwandan soldiers to cross the border this week in a joint operation to hunt down Rwandan Hutu militiamen.LiNeBrEaKLawmaker, medic held in Travolta plotLiNeBrEaKNASSAU, Bahamas ? Authorities in the Bahamas have detained an island lawmaker and a paramedic in a plot to extort money from actor John Travolta after the death of his son, police said Friday.LiNeBrEaKOne of the suspects, ambulance driver Tarino Lightbourne, was detained Friday. Earlier, several tabloids quoted him describing efforts to revive the celebrity's chronically ill son, Jett, who died of a seizure this month at their family vacation home on Grand Bahama.LiNeBrEaKAuthorities did not reveal what the alleged extortion involved, and Travolta's publicist Paul Bloch did not comment Friday.LiNeBrEaKTravolta and his wife, Kelly Preston, returned home to Florida with the ashes of their 16-year-old son.LiNeBrEaKJapanese satellite to gauge gasesLiNeBrEaKTOKYO ?

The Reporter (Vacaville, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Robo youth ready to rumble  	Ryan Chalk, The Reporter, Vacaville, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	540 words  	Jan. 24--A group of Vacaville Unified School District GATE students has turned its mutual interest in robotics into a competitive robot-building crew headed for statewide competition. LiNeBrEaKGoing by the name Short Circuit, the group of six students, ranging in age from 10 to 14 and representing no fewer than five different schools, got together at a meeting of GATE students last year. At the time, coordinators floated the idea of starting a FIRST Lego League (FLL). The league is designed to excite kids about science and technology. It requires participants to build and program an autonomous robot using Lego toys.LiNeBrEaKIn December, the district hosted the first FLL Northern California Regional Tournament at Will C. Wood High School. The Short CircuitLiNeBrEaKteam -- Markham Elementary fourth-grader Morgan Vaughn, sixth-grader Wyatt Peters, Cooper Elementary School sixth-grader Tyler Schafer, Independent Study eighth-grader Brandon Kalinowski, Willis Jepson Middle School eighth-grader Erik Polik and Browns Valley Elementary School sixth-grader John Horn -- were among the two teams representing the district.LiNeBrEaKIn all, 12 teams competed including two from the Travis Unified School District, not to mention 10 other regional tournaments going on simultaneously across the state.LiNeBrEaKThe Short Circuit team placed among the top three teams that day and will travel to Newark Memorial High on Sunday for the state event. Vacaville's other team, of Callison and Cooper Elementary School students, wasLiNeBrEaKselected by lottery and also will be competing at the state event.LiNeBrEaKBut the competition is much more than snapping a few Lego toys together. The theme surrounding the event is "climate connections." competitors are required to research a geographic area, explain issues related to weather and provide solutions. The robot is also required to navigate a course in a timed situation, to complete tasks associated with the topic. Students also will be judged on their teamwork.LiNeBrEaKThe Short Circuit team is not overly nervous about the seasoned competitors they'll face at the state competition, mostly because they've tested part of their project in front of some county leaders. They've analyzed the local conditions and taken their climate research to the Vacaville City Council, the Solano County Flood Control Advisory Committee and Agriculture Commission.LiNeBrEaKBut members say the secret to Short Circuit's success lies in Polik's specially designed forklift. It can complete tasks like turning off lights, closing windows and shutting flood gates along the course. The group also pointed to Kalinowski's ability to take each member's robot tasks and make a single program that they could download to the robot.LiNeBrEaKThe ability to work together has been invaluable as well.LiNeBrEaK"To succeed, teamwork is key," said Peters. "If you work together, you do much better."

Richmond Times - Dispatch (Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Two wind projects planned in Va.  	Rex Springston, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	521 words  	Jan. 24--Dominion Virginia Power and a subsidiary of the BP energy company are planning two wind-power projects in far Southwest Virginia.LiNeBrEaKThe two companies are considering sites for the towering turbines in Tazewell and Wise counties. LiNeBrEaKSteve Walz, chief energy adviser to Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, said the projects represent the type of clean power the administration supports.LiNeBrEaK"If these projects can be done well, they would be a good addition to the supply of power in Virginia," Walz said.LiNeBrEaKDominion and BP Wind Energy North America Inc. announced in April they had agreed to pursue wind projects together.LiNeBrEaK"This is a small but important step for Virginia's nascent wind industry," Thomas F. Farrell II, chief executive officer of Dominion Resources Inc., said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKCompany spokesman Ryan Frazier said it typically takes two to five years to get a wind project running. But he said it's too early to provide a timeline for the Virginia projects.LiNeBrEaKHe also declined to disclose the size of the planned projects.LiNeBrEaKFrazier said the companies are studying such issues as wind speeds, wind directions and the possible presence of endangered species.LiNeBrEaKPlans for Virginia's first major wind farm, in Highland County, ran into considerable opposition from people who said the turbines would mar views and kill birds and bats.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   Final Edition	Two wind projects planned in Va.;  Dominion Va. Power, BP unit consider sites in Tazewell, Wise 	REX SPRINGSTON; Times-Dispatch Staff Writer  	AREA/STATE; Pg. A-1  	607 words  	 Dominion Virginia Power and a subsidiary of the BP energy company are planning two wind-power projects in far Southwest Virginia.LiNeBrEaK The two companies are considering sites for the towering turbines in Tazewell and Wise counties.LiNeBrEaK Steve Walz, chief energy adviser to Gov. Timothy M. Kaine, said the projects represent the type of clean power the administration supports.LiNeBrEaK "If these projects can be done well, they would be a good addition to the supply of power in Virginia," Walz said. LiNeBrEaK Dominion and BP Wind Energy North America Inc. announced in April they had agreed to pursue wind projects together.LiNeBrEaK "This is a small but important step for Virginia's nascent wind industry," Thomas F. Farrell II, chief executive officer of Dominion Resources Inc., said in a statement.LiNeBrEaK Company spokesman Ryan Frazier said it typically takes two to five years to get a wind project running. But he said it's too early to provide a timeline for the Virginia projects.LiNeBrEaK He also declined to disclose the size of the planned projects.LiNeBrEaK Frazier said the companies are studying such issues as wind speeds, wind directions and the possible presence of endangered species.LiNeBrEaK Plans for Virginia's first major wind farm, in Highland County, ran into considerable opposition from people who said the turbines would mar views and kill birds and bats. Highland New Wind Development has received permits it needs and plans to break ground in the first half of this year, spokesman Frank Maisano said.LiNeBrEaK Rick Webb, a University of Virginia scientist who opposes the Highland project, says it's wrong to put windmills on scenic mountain ridges.LiNeBrEaK He said he would feel better about the Southwest Virginia projects if they went on sites that had been used for mining: "My real objection is the pointless sacrifice of our remnant wild landscape."LiNeBrEaK Walz, the energy adviser, said the projects do not appear to qualify for clean-energy financial incentives Kaine wants the General Assembly to adopt.LiNeBrEaK However, current state law provides incentives for power companies to obtain more of their energy from renewable sources such as solar and wind.LiNeBrEaK Dominion also is building a $1. 8 billion, 585-megawatt coal-burning power plant in Wise.

San Antonio Express-News 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   STATEandMETRO Edition	Our future should include light rail  	Nelson Wolff  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 8B  	658 words  	Last July, Mayor Phil Hardberger and I convened a group of 12 community members with diverse experience in transportation planning, advocacy and operations. We charged the Transportation Task Force with reviewing our community's transportation challenges and opportunities with the assumption that a more efficient, integrated transportation system will better support sustainable growth and economic development. We asked them to examine where we are now with regard to an integrated transportation system and to think about the kind of transportation system we'll need for the future.LiNeBrEaKThe task force's initial report, to be released this week, lays out a compelling case for change. Rapid growth continues to reshape and expand our region. While that growth is positive for San Antonio and Bexar County, it presents planning, development, transportation and environmental stewardship challenges. We have not kept pace with our peers and competitors that have developed multimodal transportation systems. For example, of the 10 largest cities in the country, only San Antonio lacks any form of public rail transit. LiNeBrEaKAlthough the federal government has signaled that there will be new funding for projects that are "shovel-ready" in 2009, we must readjust our transportation priorities in light of last year's global economic meltdown and wildly fluctuating oil prices. Add to that decreasing state transportation funds (much of which come with significant strings attached), looming stricter air quality standards, a lagging use of existing public transportation and a growing awareness of the impacts of climate change. In sum, the task force found that the roadblocks to an integrated, effective transportation system are substantial, and our current transportation efforts are under-funded, poorly coordinated and simply inadequate.LiNeBrEaKThe task force recommends that we pursue state legislation allowing Bexar County voters to approve local sources of funding for specified local projects, while pursuing new federal funds for high capacity transit (rail and bus rapid transit). To spend this money efficiently, the agencies responsible for environmental and transportation planning should be integrated and the transportation service providers consolidated. Guiding our investments would be a new, more comprehensive plan prepared by the Metropolitan Planning Organization that starts with desired outcomes and then develops cost assumptions and payment strategies to support our vision. As part of this effort, VIA Metropolitan Transit should move forward with the planning, funding and development of an enhanced public transit system that includes light rail.LiNeBrEaKFinally, of the five major metro areas in Texas, we are the only one not engaged in a regional community-based visioning and planning process. What we're missing, in the task force's words, is a "clear, consistent and consensus-based roadmap" regarding our community's development. If we don't know where we're going or we can't agree on our destination, then we certainly can't decide how to get there."LiNeBrEaKThe task force will continue its work in 2009 and issue a second, more detailed set of recommendations later this year. The ultimate outcome of the task force's work should be a comprehensive, economically and environmentally sustainable transportation plan that makes optimal use of a variety of financing tools and includes an extensive civic engagement process. Most importantly, the plan should help us achieve the healthy, sustainable transportation system envisioned by the task force, one that "provide(s) choices in the movement of people and goods and in urban development patterns. Roads, public transit, rail, bicycling and walking should provide safe, efficient, convenient and affordable access whether or not one owns a car. The design of our transportation system at all scales should be a source of community pride and healthy living."LiNeBrEaKThat's a vision we can all get behind.

San Antonio Express-News 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   STATEandMETRO Edition	YOUR TURN  		EDITORIAL; Pg. 8B  	584 words  	Stop the taggersLiNeBrEaKIt upsets me when I drive through an old, prominent neighborhood that has been tagged. The individuals who deface businesses and neighborhoods have no respect for others property, and I am sure no respect for themselves.LiNeBrEaKAre the laws in this city too lenient for this type of action? Perhaps the city and community businesses should pull some monies together and give some kind of reward to people that report taggers who are arrested.LiNeBrEaKThe perpetrators should then be punished and, if underage, the parents should be held accountable. We need to keep our city beautiful and respect each other's property. LiNeBrEaK-- Esther MurilloLiNeBrEaKTurn of the heatLiNeBrEaKAs I read the weather reports in the Express News, I wondered why, if global warming is eminent and will destroy our planet in 35 years as Ted Turner predicted, why do we spend so much money on heating our homes.LiNeBrEaKNancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are willing to spend billions of our tax dollars fighting global warming; perhaps they should consider cutting off the heat in all federal buildings and eliminate subsidies for homeowners' heating bills.LiNeBrEaKIf, as they believe, global warming is absolute, doesn't heating the atmosphere with the extra heat generated from the millions of homes and buildings add to the problem?LiNeBrEaKSounds absurd, just as absurd as throwing away trillions of dollars on a theory that people suffering from one of the coldest winters in history find hard to believe.LiNeBrEaK-- Leo McLainLiNeBrEaKShow those numbersLiNeBrEaKPeople are encouraged to display their house numbers so they can be seen from the street, but what about businesses?LiNeBrEaKI have lived here for many years and know my part of town fairly well, but looking for a building number on Fredericksburg Road recently was a real chore. Most businesses have large signs but no number on them.LiNeBrEaKDriving in traffic and trying to find a certain building is dangerous when nothing is marked, as they should be.LiNeBrEaK-- Carol JohnstonLiNeBrEaKOvercoming illiteracyLiNeBrEaKRe: "Campaign to fight high illiteracy kicks off Saturday," (Metro, Wednesday):LiNeBrEaKI fear that if this campaign focuses mainly on children it will not achieve the desired goal. One reason some children aren't reading well is because their parents and grandparents can't read either.LiNeBrEaKThe last figures I saw indicate some 175,000 adults here are illiterate. Years ago, before the advent of special education in San Antonio public schools children with reading disabilities were either quietly allowed to drop out of school or simply promoted until they became illiterate "graduates."LiNeBrEaKIn my four years as a reading tutor with Project Learn to Read of San Antonio (PLR), I have interviewed or taught a number of these individuals, and they all tell the same story. They were simply pushed aside by the public school system. Most of these people, now middle aged or older, suffer from dyslexia, but there are other reading disabilities as well. The good news is that these reading disabilities can be overcome, but it takes several years of intense, one-on-one teaching to accomplish it.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, there aren't that many options for adult literacy education in San Antonio today. My organization, a community-based, non-profit literacy program established in 1988, is one option, but we get no public funding and are struggling to raise enough money to carry on for another year.LiNeBrEaKI hope that somehow our civic leaders would see fit to at least acknowledge this adult illiteracy problem and devote some resources towards addressing it.LiNeBrEaK-- Robert E.

The Santa Fe New Mexican (New Mexico)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Lobbyist spending reports trickle in  	Steve Terrell, The Santa Fe New Mexican  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	365 words  	Jan. 24--Either the recession is cutting into state legislators' social lives or some lobbyists haven't yet filed their spending reports, which by law are required within 48 hours of the expenditure during a legislative session. LiNeBrEaKAs of late Friday afternoon, only two lobbyists had filed what is known as a "48-hour report." State law requires lobbyists to report any expenditure more than $75.LiNeBrEaKThe two lobbyist reports that had come in Friday were from:LiNeBrEaK--New Energy Economy, which spent a total of $4,573 for meals and beverages Wednesday at a reception for legislators at the Rio Chama Steakhouse, which is close to the Capitol on Old Santa Fe Trail. The report does not say which lawmakers or other officials attended. Ryan Shaening Pokrasso, the group's program director, who signed the report, couldn't be reached for comment Friday.LiNeBrEaKNew Energy is an organization dedicated to creating jobs to fight global warming. Along with Bioneers, the Regional Development Corporation and the state departments of Economic Development and Workforce Solutions, New Energy sponsored a two-day conference that began Wednesday in Santa Fe to talk about how to attract "green" jobs to New Mexico and legislation that would help that effort.LiNeBrEaK--Hilary Dennis, an Austin, Texas-based lobbyist for a Maryland-based pharmaceutical called MedImmune, reported spending $510 on Wednesday for a dinner for "legislators and guests." The report does not say where the dinner was held or which legislators attended.LiNeBrEaKAmong the drugs MedImmune manufactures are FluMist, which, according to the company's Web site, is "the first and only nasal spray flu vaccine approved in the U.S."LiNeBrEaKContact Steve Terrell at 986-3037 or sterrell@sfnewmexican.com Read his political blog at roundhouseroundup.com.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 24, 2009 Saturday 	New York, New York? Cavaliers hope not  	Steve Luhm, The Salt Lake Tribune  	SPORTS  	1192 words  	Jan. 24--LOS ANGELES -- One hour before the Cleveland Cavaliers are scheduled to play the Lakers, reporters crowd four-deep around LeBron James in the cramped visitor's locker room at Staples Center.LiNeBrEaKThey shout questions about James' pending duel with the world's other best basketball player, Kobe Bryant.LiNeBrEaKThey ask about the new-and-improved Cavaliers, who just might be good enough this year to win an NBA championship.LiNeBrEaKThey want to know about the Olympics, winning the gold medal in Beijing and if James might feel like doing it again in 2012. LiNeBrEaKThey want to know James' plan for energizing the economy, fighting terrorism and ending global warming.LiNeBrEaKO.K., so nobody asked about the economy, terrorism or the environment.LiNeBrEaKIf the media session had lasted more than 12 minutes, however, somebody probably would have gotten around to it because -- these days -- James is perhaps the most iconic figure in America, not counting the guy who just moved into the White House.LiNeBrEaKAs James preps for the Cavs' annual visit to Energy Solution Arena Saturday night to play the Jazz, everybody wants to know what he thinks, what he does, where he goes and -- of course -- whether he plans to cure the New York Knicks' lingering ills in 2010, when he becomes a free agent.LiNeBrEaKThere will be other suitors, obviously. But the Knicks are the most high-profile and least subtle because, well, they are the Knicks.LiNeBrEaKIn November, new team president Donnie Walsh cleared $27 million in salary cap space for 2010 by trading Zach Randolph, Jamal Crawford and Mardy Collins.LiNeBrEaKAfter the fire-sale, Walsh said the trades were "just the first step" in rebuilding the Knicks and the deals gave him "a year and half" to "see what our options are when we get to that point."LiNeBrEaKWalsh's preferred option?LiNeBrEaKSign King James for an amount slightly less than the gross national product of Finland and then sit back while the magic returns to Madison Square Garden.LiNeBrEaKJames even did his part to fuel the fervor.LiNeBrEaKA few days after the trades, the Cavaliers played in New York. Following Cleveland's 1191-101 victory, LeBron teased the media.LiNeBrEaK"If you guys want to sleep now and don't wake up until July 1, 2010, then go ahead," James said. "It's going to be a big day."LiNeBrEaKIt was all New Yorkers had to hear.LiNeBrEaKJames' words were taken as a promise that he was coming ... as reassurance that all was well ... as a message to NBA commissioner David Stern that the world headquarters of LeBron, Inc. would soon be located just down the block.LiNeBrEaKTwo months later -- in the locker room before Monday's Cavaliers-Lakers game -- James was asked about his plans in 2010.LiNeBrEaK"The question hasn't come up in a long time," LeBron said earlier this week, teasing again. "... The further and further I get away from New York, the question kind of goes away."LiNeBrEaKGood answer.LiNeBrEaKEverybody laughed, except maybe the Cavaliers, who would have preferred an etched-in-stone declaration of career-long devotion to the franchise James has lifted to unimaginable heights in only six seasons.LiNeBrEaKBut if Cleveland coach Mike Brown is worried about ever losing his mega-star, however, it does not show.LiNeBrEaK"People ask me, 'What's going to happen in 2010?'" Brown said. "[But] we're ... building this organization for the long haul, not just so LeBron James stays here. We're building this organization so everybody wants to be a part of it, from custodial workers to secretaries to the [team] president."LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, Brown insists he is not going to worry about it. "A lot of things can happen before 2010. So there's really nothing, in my mind, to talk about," he said.LiNeBrEaKOnetime Jazz point guard Mo Williams was acquired by the Cavs during the offseason to help make James' life in Cleveland a little easier.LiNeBrEaKA talented scorer, Williams' presence means James does not have to produce 40 points every night for the Cavs to win games and, in the long run, compete for a championship.LiNeBrEaK"To be honest, we don't talk about [2010]," Williams said. "It's not a topic of conversation -- not at all."LiNeBrEaKAs far as James' comments in New York, Williams shrugged. "He has to answer those type of questions and that's just LeBron. He gives honest opinions," he said.LiNeBrEaKOne thing about James that everybody does know: He's playing the best basketball of his life.LiNeBrEaKUnstoppable on offense. A stone wall on defense. The best player on one of the best teams in the world.LiNeBrEaKThe MVP, perhaps.LiNeBrEaKSaid Brown: "Obviously, you have to throw Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade into that conversation. And Tim Duncan into that conversation. And obviously a maturing Dwight Howard. There are some players that a lot of people would argue about. But me personally, I'm a LeBron James fan. I look at him as being the best player in the league. But I might be a little biased."LiNeBrEaKLaker coach Phil Jackson refuses to get into the MVP debate, but he calls James "... one of the top players who has ever played. The way he's going, he'll be ranked up there in the top five or top 10 players ever in this game."LiNeBrEaKWilliams calls James' abilities "overwhelming. More than I thought. I expected the best and I've got the best and then some. So I'm rolling. I rolling with this circus. I'm definitely having the best time of my life as a professional athlete."LiNeBrEaKAnother teammate, Sasha Pavlovic, has spent five seasons with James.LiNeBrEaK"He's a great guy and that's why he's a great player," Pavlovic said. "He is great with everybody -- off the court and on the court -- and that's why the guys love to play with him ..."LiNeBrEaKThe question now is whether James, an Ohio native, loves Cleveland and playing with his teammates enough to stick around and perhaps lead the Cavs to an NBA championship or two.LiNeBrEaKA question that may not be answered for another year, at least.LiNeBrEaKluhm@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKThe LeBron James FileLiNeBrEaKHometown -- Akron, OhioLiNeBrEaKBorn -- Dec. 30, 1984LiNeBrEaKPosition -- ForwardLiNeBrEaKHeight -- 6-8LiNeBrEaKWeight -- 250LiNeBrEaKHigh School -- St. Vincent-St. MaryLiNeBrEaKCollege -- noneLiNeBrEaKCareer Highlights -- National high school player of the year (2003). . . .

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday 	The Globalist Quiz  	TheGlobalist.com  	NEWS; National; World  	510 words  	THE GLOBALIST QUIZLiNeBrEaKCO2 emissions: The magic numberLiNeBrEaKThe weekly quiz is provided by The Globalist, a daily online feature service that covers issues and trends in globalization. The nonpartisan organization provides commercial services and nonprofit educational features. LiNeBrEaKQUESTIONLiNeBrEaKAmid growing public awareness about global warming, people are seeking ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We wonder: What is the current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide?LiNeBrEaKANSWERLiNeBrEaKA. 280 parts per millionLiNeBrEaKB. 385 parts per millionLiNeBrEaKC. 450 parts per millionLiNeBrEaKD. 550 parts per millionLiNeBrEaKA.LiNeBrEaK280 parts per million is not correct.LiNeBrEaKFor a few millennia before 1800, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 280 parts per million. About 200 years ago, the world released about 10 million tons of carbon dioxide per year through burning fossil fuels. A century and a half later, in 1950, annual carbon emissions stood at 1. 6 billion tons   and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide reached 311 parts per million.LiNeBrEaKB.LiNeBrEaK385 parts per million is correct.LiNeBrEaKThe current atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is around 385 parts per million, according to the Earth Policy Institute. Almost all of this 38 percent increase since the preindustrial era is due to human activity, with humans having released nearly 8. 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels in 2006 alone. At present, global carbon dioxide concentration is increasing by about two parts per million per year. Assuming that current trends continue, by 2100 the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases would reach 1,000 parts per million. This would result in a global temperature increase of up to 6 degrees Celsius.LiNeBrEaKC.LiNeBrEaK450 parts per million is not correct.LiNeBrEaKA generally accepted goal of a relatively "safe" level of carbon dioxide concentration (in terms of its likely climate change consequences) is about 440 parts per million. A greenhouse gas concentration of 450 parts per million would increase global temperatures by about 2 degrees Celsius. To achieve this level by 2030, emissions in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries would need to be reduced by almost 40 percent compared with 2006 levels. Other major economies would need to limit their emissions growth to 20 percent. This goal would involve a virtual worldwide turn away from the current approach to electricity generation and mobility. It would require a near zero-emissions power sector by 2050 and a near zero-emissions transport sector in the same time period.LiNeBrEaKD.LiNeBrEaK550 parts per million is not correct.LiNeBrEaKIn the long term, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is on a path to reach well above 550 parts per million. However, limiting carbon dioxide to this level would result in a global temperature increase of 3 degrees Celsius   reducing the probability of dangerous climate change. To limit greenhouse gases to this level, countries would need to invest an additional $4. 1 trillion between 2010 and 2030, equal to 0. 24 percent of annual world GDP.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday 	Cal Thomas: Falling short of those great expectations  		OPINION  	716 words  	`What does change mean?" asked Woodrow Wilson in his inaugural address. That is a question which will soon be answered by President Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKWhat surprised me most about Obama's inaugural speech was its lack of passion. It was lacking in the soaring oratory we have come to expect, especially when compared to other speeches he has delivered, most notably on Election Night. It seemed as cold as the subfreezing weather. Maybe he was trying to lower expectations. He succeeded.LiNeBrEaKStill, there were a number of themes which conservatives can praise. Among them, a message to terrorists that "you will not defeat us" and a pledge to eliminate wasteful government programs. That is easier said than done given that Congress will make those decisions, not the new president. Every government program attracts constituencies that argue how essential they are. LiNeBrEaKI enjoyed his line dismissing "worn-out dogmas" but wonder what he means by it. When a liberal dogma and a conservative dogma face off, which dogma will bite and which will roll over? When liberals talk like this, they usually require the conservative to compromise his principles in order to receive their blessing. During his relatively brief time in elective office, Obama has not been known for seeking common ground. Words ought to mean something. What does he mean by his?LiNeBrEaKObama hinted at what he intends do about embryonic stem cell research and possibly "global warming," saying he wants to "restore science to its rightful place." What place would that be? Above morality and common sense? Above other scientists who disagree? There is no consensus about global warming. In fact, there are growing numbers of scientists and growing amounts of scientific evidence questioning whether this is indeed a dangerously warming planet. Will Obama rely only on those scientists who agree with his political positions?LiNeBrEaKOn stem cell research, new science is showing that adult stem cells may fulfill the objectives originally believed to be achieved only with embryos. Which science will prevail in such cases? Will it be real science, or the "science" that supports the objectives of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party?LiNeBrEaKNo one can deny the significance of Obama's moment. An Inauguration is a demonstration to the world of what makes America unique and great. Inauguration Day was the fun part. Now comes the hard part. The Wall Street Journal published a graph that showed every president but one since Harry Truman left office with a far lower approval rating than when he entered. The exception was Bill Clinton. With his approval numbers higher than any incoming president, Barack Obama cannot help but decline in public favor. LiNeBrEaKPart of this is due to our placing too much faith in politicians who cannot deliver all we want. Let's see how long the public continues to be enamored with him. And let's see how serious he is about finding common ground with conservatives.LiNeBrEaKThe media coverage of the Inauguration gave a preview of how they might cover the Second Coming. It was total worship. No doubts were expressed; no questions about his ability to do anything - from healing the economy to bringing peace to the Middle East. The media have at last found a god in whom they can believe. They are worshipping at the altar of the church of Barack Obama. Journalists and some of their ideological cable TV allies have so much invested in Obama's success that they will be hard-pressed to criticize him for anything and can probably be counted on to explain and justify any mistakes he makes, at least in the first two years.LiNeBrEaKIn his inaugural address, Herbert Hoover spoke of America's "fruits of accomplishment." He added he had "no fears for the future of our country. It is bright with hope." There followed by just a few months the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. Hope can be dangerous if it is misplaced.LiNeBrEaKAlexander Pope wrote, "Hope springs eternal in the human breast; Man never Is, but always To be blest: The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home, Rests and expatiates in a life to come." ("An Essay on Man," 1733)LiNeBrEaKPope's hope was in eternal life. Anyone who invests hope in temporal politicians is almost certain to be disappointed.LiNeBrEaKtmseditors@tribune.comLiNeBrEaKCal Thomas is a syndicated columnist with Tribune Media Services.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Sax giant twice over CDs  		ABODE; Pg. 008  	1221 words  	Tenor Giant liveLiNeBrEaK"In Vienne"LiNeBrEaKSonny RollinsLiNeBrEaK(Doxy Records)LiNeBrEaK"Saxophone Colossus"LiNeBrEaKSonny RollinsLiNeBrEaK(Acorn Media)LiNeBrEaKThese two DVDs capture jazz tenor titan Sonny Rollins at two stages in his later career. "In Vienne" documents a June 29, 2006, performance at Jazz a Vienne, the long-running French jazz festival held in a large, outdoor amphitheater. Here, Rollins, 75 at the time, plays with his then-current working band: trombonist Clifton Anderson, his nephew; guitarist Bobby Broom; bassist Bob Cranshaw; drummer Victor Lewis; and percussionist Kimati Dinizulu. The program is characteristic: a couple of calypsos, a pair of standards, and a funky, driving number. The tenorman's inclusion of funk and other simpler numbers has led to a far-ranging style, from modern and abstract jazz to pulsing RandB. That style is on display in this concert. LiNeBrEaKThe opening "They Say It's Wonderful" showcases a typical Rollins maneuver. He plays the theme with Anderson, then gives the first solo to Broom, who scores with a gleaming tone and some punched bluesbent phrases, all over bustling rhythm. Rollins is sparse in subsequent phrase trades with Lewis, then lets loose a little on the closing theme. The calypso "Global Warming" gives a better idea what the master is capable of. He solos for 11 minutes straight, his grainy, crying tone underpinning smeared abstract bursts, tagged single notes on the beat, rephrases of the theme, bluesy thoughts, and more, all with powerhouse rhythm. The steaming "Sonny, Please" spotlights Anderson's crisp lines and fat sound, and "I See Your Face Before Me" reveals a more song-like Rollins in trades with Dinizulu.LiNeBrEaKEdited by Richard Corsello, "In Vienne" keeps camera movement to a minimum, so that the feeling of actually seeing Rollins in person is essentially preserved. It's also interesting to see the leader in current performance costume: a long-sleeved, dark shirt with tails out, bright red pants, white tennis shoes, and dark glasses, a hipster to the end. "Saxophone Colossus," Robert Mugge's extraordinary 1986 film, mixes performance footage with interviews with the saxophonist, his late wife, Lucille, and others. Rollins plays in two settings: an outdoor concert in Saugerties, N.Y. in August 1986, and a performance with an orchestra in Tokyo the previous May.LiNeBrEaKThe Saugerties concert - with Anderson and Cranshaw, pianist Mark Soskin, and drummer Marvin "Smitty" Smith - is legendary. Rollins is stunning on a 15-minute version of "G Man," another one-chord romp with single notes held out for ages, hard-punched thoughts, and flowing streams. The band members smile at each other in awe.LiNeBrEaKThen the hornman embarks on a long solo intro to "Autumn Nocturne," quoting snippets of "In a Sentimental Mood" and others along with waves of ideas before jumping off the stage, to get closer to the audience. That jump, however, broke his right heel. He lies on his back - but keeps playing, and powerfully. It's amazing footage.LiNeBrEaKThe Tokyo concert documents Rollins' jazz-meetsclassical "Concerto for Tenor Saxophone and Orchestra." This is Rollins' only known performance with strings, and it's quite moving. - Zan StewartLiNeBrEaKGOOD OLD DAZE "Radio Show" Tony DeSare (Telarc)LiNeBrEaKCabaret pop is one of the most conservative of genres, clinging as it does to "the good old days" of jazzy standards delivered with a winking croon and tinkling piano. For his third Telarc album, singer-pianist Tony DeSare aims to stretch beyond such popular finger-snapping, Sinatra-loving smoothies as Michael Bubl&eacute; and Peter Cincotti by delivering a rare bird - the cabaret concept album.LiNeBrEaKLike so many children from the '80s and before, DeSare pines for the universal radio experience. For his "Radio Show," DeSare sings songs from the '30s to the '80s and several of his own, interspersing the tunes with various styles of DJ interjection by Joe Piscopo (the comedian having bonded with DeSare over a love of all things Rat Pack).LiNeBrEaKThe conceit grows wearisome, and DeSare's music-making can make one itch to turn the virtual dial - particularly when he sings such originals as "A Stranger's Eyes" and "Dreaming My Life Away," ballads saccharine enough to give a listener a toothache halfway through.LiNeBrEaKDeSare has a charming way with Hoagy Carmichael's "Lazy River," even if his vocals and keyboard style lack the personality of a Harry Connick Jr. He gets points for reaching beyond the standards bag, though, especially with a zippy makeover of Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode" and a hymn-like take on, of all things, Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are AChangin'." But his version of Ray Charles' "Hallelujah, I Love Her So" is mama's-boy polite. As for DeSare's '80s faves, he personalizes the melody of "Easy Lover" nicely, though the weightless Philip Bailey- Phil Collins hit hardly bears resuscitating. And the bossanova- flavored duet on New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle" with stiff pop-jazz star Jane Monheit elicits only guffaws.LiNeBrEaKDownload this: "Johnny B. Goode" - Bradley BambargerLiNeBrEaKTHE SOUND OF RAGE"XO" Leathermouth (Epitaph)LiNeBrEaKThere is no shortage of rage and angst in the music of My Chemical Romance. But one of the Jerseybased band's guitarists, Belleville native Frank Iero, sounds even angrier and more tortured on the uncompromisingly harsh debut album of his new hard-core punk band, Leathermouth.LiNeBrEaKIero doesn't play guitar in the group, but handles lead vocals. It wouldn't be accurate to call him a singer: he's more of a screamer, venting cathartically - but also unintelligibly - about things like school violence and crooked politicians over the band's pounding rhythms. There is an audience for this type of thing, but Leathermouth doesn't do anything different than hundreds of hard-core bands that have come before. So, ultimately, it's hard to see Leathermouth becoming much of a distraction from Iero's day job.LiNeBrEaKLeathermouth will perform at Vintage Vinyl, 51 Lafayette Road, Fords, at 7 p.m. Tuesday.

The daughter of a diplomat, Traor&eacute; has lived around the world, which has led her to create music that is rooted in Mali, but subtly and effortlessly moves beyond its borders.LiNeBrEaKTraor&eacute; mostly whisper-sings over quiet, hypnotic grooves, with the album's pace building as it goes.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 		January 24, 2009 Saturday   Metro Edition	opinion exchange;  FROM TODAY'S INTERACTIVE ONLINE LOG 	Jill Burcum, Staff Writer  	NEWS; Pg. 10A  	453 words  	EPA FLEXES ITS MUSCLESLiNeBrEaKBig Stone II plan hits a bumpLiNeBrEaKNew EPA objections to the Big Stone II coal plant certainly suggest more scrutiny ahead for coal-fired utility projects under an Obama administration. LiNeBrEaKThursday was one of the very last days that the Environmental Protection Agency could raise objections about the air pollution-permitting process for the controversial Big Stone II coal plant project just across Minnesota's western border. The project has been approved for some time by South Dakota authorities and last week, obtained approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for power lines carrying electricity into Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKThe project has been one of the most embattled environmental issues in the region. The plant's main proponent, Otter Tail Power Co., says Big Stone II is needed to meet regional electrical demand. Environmental advocates are concerned about the plant's carbon emissions on global warming and that it will prove too costly to rate payers, particularly when new carbon emission regulations -- expected under an Obama administration -- are put in place.LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club has long maintained that the air pollution permitting process approved by South Dakota was illegal. The environmental group raised the issue again with the EPA as a new administration took over. On Thursday, at the tail end of a 45-day window for action, the agency objected to the permitting process, raising new regulatory challenges for the project. In a letter sent to South Dakota authorities, EPA officials flag a number of deficiencies in the air pollution permit -- from inadequate analysis of some potential emissions to failure to establish adequate emission monitoring schedules.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups heralded the EPA objections as a significant victory, saying it's unusual for the agency to step in like this, and that it rarely did so under the Bush administration. The Sierra Club's Bruce Nilles said the EPA action will delay Big Stone II for up to a year and potentially prevent it from ever being built. "We think this is probably the end of the project,'' Nilles said.LiNeBrEaKDan Sharp, Big Stone II's communications manager, disagreed vehemently. "That's absolutely not true. Absolutely not true. It's a mischaracterization and they know it. ... there are deficiencies, and they have to be remedied but they're not deal killers. They're not the end of the project.'' An EPA spokesman on Friday confirmed that the objections likely aren't significant enough to halt the project.LiNeBrEaKThe plant remains one of the hardest-fought, longest-running environmental battles in the Midwest, one that shows no sign of coming to an end.LiNeBrEaKJILL BURCUMLiNeBrEaKTo read the full items and to comment, visit startribune.com/opinion.

PEARSON, GLOBAL WARMING, HEARTSPRING: To practice penmanship, hundreds of Wichita elementary school students take part in "Mail to the Chief."  	Lori Yount, The Wichita Eagle, Kan.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1065 words  	Jan. 24--Electricity hike one of many hitsLiNeBrEaKHere we go again. While the nation is foundering and people are losing their jobs, the Kansas Corporation Commission approves a rate increase for our electricity (Jan. 22 Eagle). I understand that Westar Energy had additional costs with the ice storm and other things, but doesn't it have money in reserve for such things? Also, now that our state has a budget shortfall, we could be paying higher taxes locally.LiNeBrEaKI live on a fixed income, and since the first of the year everything seems to have risen in cost by a few dollars here and a few dollars there. It all adds up, and gives people like me less money for medicine and food. When do we get a break? When my budget doesn't balance, I have to do without. Maybe our public officials need to learn how to use what they have, as we have to. Let's lower their salaries and see if they can live on less. They should remember that we pay their salaries. LiNeBrEaKCAROLYN ROSELiNeBrEaKWichitaLiNeBrEaKHail and farewellLiNeBrEaKNo longer can George W. Bush bring shame to our country and the destruction of our economy. This will probably be my last letter to the editor, for I don't have Bush to bash anymore. I will say one good thing for him, though: He served the rich and corporate America well.LiNeBrEaKLEO KARLINLiNeBrEaKWinfieldLiNeBrEaKEliminate negativeLiNeBrEaKA letter writer said that we should accentuate the positive ("Keep looking up," Jan. 15 Reader Views). True. Before we can do that, though, it is necessary to eliminate the negative. Barriers to success must be removed.LiNeBrEaKOne of those barriers is corporate and individual greed. Too many corporate leaders have looted their operations, while some governmental officials have succumbed to offered payoffs.LiNeBrEaKAnother major barrier is the killing of the innocent through abortion and euthanasia. Every society that has embraced these two evils has ceased to be either successful or influential. Voters in two more states recently joined Oregon to allow "dying with dignity" -- pretty words for suicide or mercy killing.LiNeBrEaKThe Freedom of Choice Act, which probably will be on the U.S. agenda in the near future, is nothing more than legalizing abhorrent measures with fancy language.LiNeBrEaKWith these barriers, it is difficult to accentuate the positive. We seem to have forgotten or ignored one of the basic rules of ethics -- the ends do not justify the means.LiNeBrEaKGENE FUHRLiNeBrEaKWichitaLiNeBrEaKGood influenceLiNeBrEaKReading the obituaries in the newspaper awakens memories of public lives that have influenced our family and encouraged broader contacts with people around the world.LiNeBrEaKOne such obituary was that of Sen. James Pearson, R-Kan. ("Senator wasn't bound by party affiliation," Jan. 20 Eagle). In the 1980s, after Pearson retired, he designated unused election money for graduate students to study abroad. Among the students helped was our daughter, Martha Davis, who earned a degree at Oxford in England before attending law school in the United States. Martha also spent a summer in Washington, D.C., as an intern for Sen. Nancy Kassebaum.LiNeBrEaKMartha, who graduated from Wichita North High School in 1979, is now a tenured professor at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston. She edited a three-volume set, published last month, titled "Bringing Human Rights Home." It has received an award from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights in North America for framing issues related to poverty and civil rights around the concept of human rights, a definition that has helped proponents of human rights gain legal ground.LiNeBrEaKThank you to Pearson, Kassebaum and others for encouraging cross-cultural, eye-opening experiences among young people that can benefit all of us.LiNeBrEaKMARIAN DAVISLiNeBrEaKGoddardLiNeBrEaKCore warmingLiNeBrEaKI was puzzled by meteorologist Mike Smith's commentary "Global warming doom, gloom haven't occurred" (Jan. 16 Opinion). Was his correct observation that global temperatures have remained flat in the recent past meant to cast doubt on the whole thesis of man-made global warming? Or was he simply noting that short-term forecast of temperature is complex and difficult? I hope readers don't question the reality of man-made global warming because of his comments.LiNeBrEaKLong-term trends related to increased carbon dioxide levels strongly point to man-made global warming. The Vostok and Law Dome ice core data demonstrate that changing CO2 levels mirror global temperature change. The reality of human impact on CO2 levels is undeniable.LiNeBrEaKShort term, there is much we do not understand. But the long-term trend is undeniable. We are pumping unprecedented amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere that, despite any natural warming or cooling trends, will result in long-term global warming.LiNeBrEaKDENNIS HESSELBARTHLiNeBrEaKWichitaLiNeBrEaKHeartspring rootsLiNeBrEaKI applaud the continued good work of Heartspring and the story on its 75th anniversary (Jan. 19 Local and State). What is being accomplished today would not have been possible without the pioneering work of its founders, Martin F. Palmer and his wife, Mary. Their focus on speech and language rehabilitation through the Institute of Logopedics and Wichita State University were instrumental in the education and experience of outstanding professionals from here and abroad who continue to serve the people of our community.LiNeBrEaKSeveral weeks ago, a group of old friends who had worked at the institute had brunch together. One, at age 95, is assisting a friend in a nursing home with her communication disorders.LiNeBrEaKThe Palmers taught about attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder long before others acknowledged or treated it. In addition, help was given to adults suffering from strokes and other impairments. At one point more than 300 people from more than 30 states and foreign countries were enrolled in the special-education program.LiNeBrEaKThe Eagle should consider doing a story about the Palmers and their founding of the Institute of Logopedics as part of the series "To the stars."LiNeBrEaKROSE MARY MOHRLiNeBrEaKWichitaLiNeBrEaKReach Lori Yount at 316-268-6269 or lyount@wichitaeagle.com	PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); WAGES and SALARIES (90%); LAYOFFS (90%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (89%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (79%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); US POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); DISMISSALS (78%); WEATHER (77%); APPROVALS (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (71%); DEATH and DYING (69%); ABORTION (62%); DEATHS and OBITUARIES (90%); ETHICS (50%); SUICIDE (61%)  		Education  	KANSAS, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 24, 2009  	ENGLISH  	20090124-WI-READER-VIEWS-ON-WESTAR-HIKE-BUSH-NEGATIVE-BARRIERS-SEN-PEARSON-GLOBAL-WARMING-HEARTSPRING-0124  	Newspaper  	WI  	2009 The Wichita Eagle   	KANSAS CORPORATION COMMISSION (84%)  	GEORGE W BUSH (92%)  						LSE:EIT, NYSE:WR  								
Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 		January 24, 2009 Saturday 	O'Malley to support global warming bill  	Pamela Wood, The Capital, Annapolis, Md.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	519 words  	Jan. 24--Gov. Martin O'Malley is throwing his full support behind a plan to cut Maryland's greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020.LiNeBrEaKSimilar bills have failed in the General Assembly the last two years, but the governor's support -- coupled with less opposition from manufacturers and unions -- means the bill has a better chance this year, according to climate change activists. LiNeBrEaK"We expect it to go smoothly," said Brad Heavner, director of the advocacy group Environment Maryland. "The hope is with so much momentum behind it at the beginning of the session, it won't get watered down."LiNeBrEaKIn past years, Mr. O'Malley has dispatched his top aides to testify in favor of the bill. But he didn't put his name on the bill or make it one of his priorities.LiNeBrEaKIt's a slight difference, but an important one in Annapolis, where supporting -- or not supporting -- the governor is noticed.LiNeBrEaKMr. O'Malley said in a statement yesterday that it's urgent to cut greenhouse gases and combat global warming.LiNeBrEaK"For our prosperity, for our current and future generations, and for the health of our state, which is so vulnerable to rising sea levels, we must take action on climate change now -- not later. Maryland can't afford to be left behind. We must commit to taking the actions necessary to protect our environment, our economy and our citizens," he said.LiNeBrEaKIf the bill passes, Maryland would be the seventh state in the nation to put mandatory emissions reductions into law.LiNeBrEaKThe bill, to be called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, doesn't say how Maryland will achieve the reductions in carbon dioxide and other emissions that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKRather, it directs the Maryland Department of the Environment to draw up a plan for the reductions by 2012. That plan must make sure that no jobs will be lost in making the reductions -- a key concession that allowed business and union groups to jump on board.LiNeBrEaKAn independent study of the economic effects of the emission reductions also would be required.LiNeBrEaKThe bill does not include a target of reductions for 2050, which was included in previous versions.LiNeBrEaKState officials say that already, reductions of 12. 5 percent by 2020 are possible through existing state programs. That includes the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which will require carbon reductions at power plants; EmPOWER Maryland, which is an energy efficiency program; and the Clean Cars law that would require more low-emission vehicles to be sold here.LiNeBrEaKSome other ways to reduce greenhouse gases include further energy-use reductions at homes and businesses, using more clean energy instead of coal-based electricity, reducing vehicle miles traveled and planting trees that soak up carbon dioxide.

CRAIG SCHNEIDER; Staff  	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	220 words  	The man responsible for terrorism preparedness at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was named acting director Thursday of the Atlanta-based health agency, officials said. LiNeBrEaKDr. Richard E. Besser confirmed that he will fill the role until the formal congressional approval of Tom Daschle as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The secretary appoints the CDC director.LiNeBrEaKBesser, 49, the agency's director of the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, oversees the CDC office that focuses on threats from biological, chemical, natural, infectious, nuclear and radiological sources.LiNeBrEaKBesser replaces Dr. Julie Gerberding, who was the agency's first female director. During Gerberding's six years at the CDC, critics lambasted her for sacrificing science for politics --- for carrying the Bush agenda on global warming and other issues into the world of scientific research.LiNeBrEaKHer defenders countered that she was an independent leader dedicated to science, and that she expanded the mission of the agency to include bioterrorism research, combating AIDS globally and responding to national health threats.LiNeBrEaKBesser has written and contributed to more than 100 publications, presentations and editorials and has received numerous awards for his work in public health and volunteer service.

The Boston Globe 		January 23, 2009 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Plugging the federal brain drain  	David T. Ellwood and Max Stier  	OP-ED; Pg. A15  	723 words  	AS PRESIDENT OBAMA takes charge, expectations are high. The economic crisis, global warming, healthcare, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict all need to be addressed. But as the nation's challenges are growing, the federal government faces a serious people problem, one that must be tackled if Obama wants to achieve his ambitious policy goals.LiNeBrEaKThe federal government - comprised of 1. 9 million men and women - is expected to lose nearly one-third of its most talented and experienced workers, largely as a result of the baby boomer retirement wave. This brain drain will have serious consequences if left unaddressed. It is time for serious civil service reforms that will allow Washington to recruit the "best and the brightest" into government service. But it won't be easy. LiNeBrEaKA lack of skilled talent is only one of many factors inhibiting government's ability to build the workforce that the times demand. Salaries for high fliers in government pale in comparison to those in the private sector, and must be made more equitable to attract the most talented into public service.LiNeBrEaKBut salary is only part of the problem. Antiquated hiring procedures must also be changed. While private sector firms can hire a qualified candidate quickly, the wheels turn much slower in the federal government. In one case, the application process of a single applicant to a government agency involved 114 steps and 45 people, and lasted months.LiNeBrEaKRecruitment practices also play a part. Private firms visit university campuses to interview soon-to-be graduates no later than the fall of their final year, often making decisions within a few weeks and typically offering much higher salaries. In contrast, government agencies rarely conduct on-campus interviews and can often take six-to-nine months before making hiring decisions.LiNeBrEaKEven when outstanding candidates are recruited into the public sector, they often depart out of career frustration. Upward mobility is frequently constrained in government. Lateral moves between agencies are rare. With the exception of political appointees, movements in and out of government are all too infrequent.LiNeBrEaKThis is a critical time in the nation's history that will require exceptional talent and innovative ideas. Obama's "Renew America Together" initiative is a good first step in calling on Americans to engage in public service and give back to their communities. But more must be done to draw the brightest minds into government.LiNeBrEaKHere are some steps that the new administration and Congress can take to confront the federal brain drain, and to make the federal government a more attractive place to work:LiNeBrEaK- Provide creative financial incentives, expand loan-repayment programs, create "fellowships" for certain jobs, and develop an ROTC-like program in which students receive educational benefits in return for a commitment to serve in government after graduation.LiNeBrEaK- Expand the Presidential Management Fellows program to bring the most talented graduates directly into all federal agencies.LiNeBrEaK- Improve recruiting and hiring systems to reduce red tape to bring qualified candidates on board more quickly.LiNeBrEaK- Recruit mid-career professionals including engineers, IT experts and financial wizards interested in public service after spending time in the private sector.LiNeBrEaK- Create new measurement tools to allow citizens to see how their government is doing in recruiting dedicated and talented people. The new administration should encourage all government agencies to adopt a "Federal Job Applicant's Bill of Rights," which ensures all candidates will be treated fairly, openly and promptly. LiNeBrEaK- Improve management from the top down. Obama will need to signal clearly and often to his political appointees that making long-term improvements to basic government operations is a central part of their jobs.LiNeBrEaKThese are extraordinary times, times in which government is not the problem, but must be part of the solution. With some basic reforms in how the government recruits, hires and retains its people, it can channel that enthusiasm to help rebuild the federal workforce. We must act now.LiNeBrEaKDavid T. Ellwood is dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and formerly served in the Clinton administration.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	County discusses new ways to be 'green"  	By Chris Metinko Oakland Tribune  	MY TOWN; Alameda; News; Local  	441 words  	Elected officials from around Alameda County gathered in San Leandro on Friday to discuss how the county can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions   despite harsh economic times   and create a "greener" future to ward off permanent climate change. LiNeBrEaK"If, in fact, we don't find time to clean up our environments," county Supervisor Keith Carson said, "then we are not handing over to the next generation a place of improvement, but rather a place that has been forecast by many to be a place of doom."LiNeBrEaKCarson was one of the organizers of the Alameda County and Cities Climate Forum, a daylong event that gave more than 150 officials and staff members from the county and 14 of its cities an opportunity to plan collaborative action against global climate change.LiNeBrEaKThose officials joined representatives of regional and state agencies in discussing energy efficiency, land use, transportation, waste reduction and other topics.LiNeBrEaKCoinciding with the forum was the release of countywide estimates of greenhouse gas emission sources. The estimates show that transportation is the largest contributor to the county's carbon footprint, making up more than half of the emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Working with local and state agencies to address transportation issues in this region is vital to the long-term health and economic well being of our residents," said Supervisor Scott Haggerty, who is also vice chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.LiNeBrEaKAlso adding to the county's emissions are energy use at commercial and industrial facilities and residential sites, and emissions from waste sent to area landfills.LiNeBrEaKWhile the county's job is nowhere near complete, it has been on the right track for years, Carson said.LiNeBrEaK"Alameda County has been on this road of sustainability for a while now," he said.LiNeBrEaKCarson pointed to several steps that the county and city governments have taken, such as building large "green" building projects like the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center, committing to solar and fuel-cell energy programs and building fleets of hybrid and biodiesel vehicles.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Alameda County was one of only 12 charter members of the Cool Counties initiative formed in conjunction with the Sierra Club. The program is an effort by counties nationwide to reduce local emissions by 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKCarson said he hoped the San Leandro forum would help local leaders exchange ideas on how to make the county and its cities even more eco-friendly.LiNeBrEaK"We know our current land use is not working," he said. "We know the way we are using our energy is extremely wasteful. But old habits die hard."LiNeBrEaKReach Chris Metinko at 510-763-5418 or cmetinko@bayareanewsgroup.com	EMISSIONS (92%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (79%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (79%); FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); GREEN BUILDING (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); CITIES (75%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (73%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES (68%); WASTE REDUCTION (68%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (66%); JUVENILE JUSTICE (61%); BIOFUELS (61%); LANDFILLS (52%)  			SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (96%) CALIFORNIA, USA (96%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 25, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  																
The Denver Post 		January 23, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Letters To The Editor  		Pg. B-12  	1078 words  	Who will you believe on global warming?LiNeBrEaKRe: "Debate over: It's freezing," Jan. 16 David Harsanyi column.LiNeBrEaKMost of us don't do original scientific research on climate, so when we decide to be "for" or "against" global warming and man's impact on climate, we must rely on the work of others. Those we must trust on this can be broken down into two groups. One group consists of about 98 percent of climate scientists working specifically on climate at universities and government labs, and the other 2 percent, mostly funded by big oil and big coal, are scientists who are generally not working directly on climate, though you can find exceptions.LiNeBrEaKSo, unless you do your own climate research, you have to decide which group to believe, the 98 percent or the 2 percent. David Harsanyi apparently trusts the 2 percent. (He could be doing original scientific research on the subject, but I doubt it.) He also makes the mistake of using unusually cold weather in the Midwest as an argument against global warming. I'm sure he knows better.LiNeBrEaKBob Kropfli, Golden LiNeBrEaKSerious concern over change in climateLiNeBrEaKDavid Harsanyi asks if we should panic because of a 0. 74 degree Celsius (1. 33 degrees F) rise in average global temperature over the last 100 years. Not panic, maybe, but some serious concern is in order, especially when we realize that the major part of that warming (0. 65 degrees C or 1. 15 degrees F) has taken place in just the last 50 years. In fact, the curve of average global warming over the past century looks suspiciously like that of a positive feedback system which leads to exponential increases with time: the upward slope is getting steeper. Loss of snow and ice cover, thawing of permafrost, and decrease in the efficiency of natural processes which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are all possible mechanisms of positive feedback to global warming, not to mention increasing human emissions. Correspondingly, predictions of warming for the next century are considerably more alarming than what we have already seen: 1. 8 to 4 degrees C (3. 2 to 7. 2 degrees F) globally, with larger increases over land masses than over ocean.LiNeBrEaKGary Waldman, AuroraLiNeBrEaKCanceling the paper over opposing viewpoints I get a chuckle every time I read a letter to the editor that announces the writer is canceling his or her subscription to The Denver Post for an opinion they perceive as "offensive." The latest example comes from letter-writer Michael Salardino (Jan. 21), who canceled his subscription because of a Denver Post opinion piece that he perceived was unfair to George W. Bush. (An opinion, by the way, shared by nearly 80 percent of the country).LiNeBrEaKIf I canceled my subscription to The Post every time I disagreed with something I read, I would be canceling it every day. What I enjoy most about The Post is its diversity of opinion. As a liberal, I rarely agree with the conservative columns or comics. But you know what? Sometimes my eyes are opened to a view I had not previously considered and I end up agreeing with that contrary opinion.LiNeBrEaKIf Salardino prefers publications with only his point of view, there are many for him to choose from that will allow him to keep his head in the sand. And if he chooses to stop reading The Post as a result, let me tell him it will be his loss.LiNeBrEaKSteve Feld, Greenwood VillageLiNeBrEaKObama's grandparents instilled great qualitiesLiNeBrEaKAs one born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, I had tears in my eyes as our new president took the oath of office. I am not African-American (full-blooded Lithuanian does not comply), but I could take pride in the fact that our nation had advanced to new heights.LiNeBrEaKFor 35 years, as a teacher of government and history, I stressed that we were not a melting pot, but rather a beautiful mosaic that was in constant evolution. Tuesday, one piece of that mosaic shone brilliantly and was reflected in the mosaic we saw on the National Mall.LiNeBrEaKWhile African-Americans and those in Kenya could feel justifiably proud, there was another group that should have been just as proud.LiNeBrEaKThe grandparents who raised our president did a wonderful job in instilling qualities which are quite evident today. Their contribution should be honored. Similarly honored and proud should be the thousands of grandparents who have had to assume parental responsibility due to death, drugs, violence or other causes. They should take heart and stand tall and realize what a contribution they are making. They have been called upon to sacrifice, but now they can see the magnificent results such sacrifice can bring.LiNeBrEaKJohn Plungy, DenverLiNeBrEaKWhere's the media outrage over inaugural costs?LiNeBrEaKI voted for John McCain, but Barack Obama is now my president. I sincerely hope he will be successful at reviving our economy, keeping us safe and elevating our culture. I will, however, be watching closely to see if his actions match his rhetoric, which brings me to his inauguration.LiNeBrEaKIt is reported that Obama's inauguration cost more than $150 million - in a struggling economy - and there is no outrage. George W. Bush was criticized heavily for spending $40 million on his 2004 inauguration. The disparity between the general media response to the two events is mind-boggling. Even if one says that some of the money was donated, couldn't it have gone to a greater use in so many other places?LiNeBrEaKIf the inauguration is any kind of example, Obama is just like any other politician. So much for "change we can believe in."LiNeBrEaKRoger Cross, Highlands RanchLiNeBrEaKNo worries - dissent is still alive and wellLiNeBrEaKRe: "Is dissent still patriotic?" Jan. 21 David Harsanyi column.LiNeBrEaKDavid Harsanyi worries that President Barack Obama's Kennedy-like inaugural call for an attitude of service and sacrifice constitutes a constriction on "dissent." It seems to me that he can rest easy, however, since, if anything, Mr. Obama bent over backwards to accommodate and include the concerns of conservatives and Republicans, from inviting Rick Warren to give the official inaugural prayer and continuing Robert Gates at the Defense Department to signalling an unwillingness to prosecute torturers and seeking to postpone the repeal of the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest.LiNeBrEaKDissent is - and will remain - alive and well, and no doubt the new administration will provide Messrs.

The Denver Post 		January 23, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Report: Warming cuts trees' life in half The death rate of woods in the West may also contribute to less carbon being trapped.  	Jennifer Brown The Denver Post  	A SECTION; Pg. A-01  	738 words  	The life span of trees in the western United States has been cut in half, and the likely cause is climate change, according to the most extensive research yet on the life span of pines, firs and hemlocks.LiNeBrEaKThe death rate of trees in Colorado, California and the Pacific Northwest has more than doubled since 1955 as warmer temperatures have led to less moisture and severe drought, according to a paper published today in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKResearchers predict the average size and age of trees eventually will decrease by half, forests will become more sparse, and trees will store less carbon than they do now, which is bad news for the planet. Trees trap carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas linked to warming temperatures. LiNeBrEaKThe study "introduces the possibility that western forests could become net sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, further speeding up the pace of global warming," said Phillip van Mantgem, a U.S. Geological Survey ecologist and study co-author.LiNeBrEaKScientists from the USGS and the University of Colorado at Boulder said they were able to isolate regional warming as the most likely cause of increased tree mortality. They excluded air pollution and changes in forest dynamics, such as woodlands becoming more dense.LiNeBrEaKTheir findings suggest that otherwise healthy trees - undisturbed by logging, fire or massive pest outbreaks - are living only half as long as they once did.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists studied what they call "background" mortality, the opposite of the "abrupt" death that occurs when forests are overcome by infestation. Trees in the study died from old age, getting crushed by larger trees and from insects.LiNeBrEaKPests weren't the focus of this study, but forests weakened by warmer temperatures and stressed by drought are likely to succumb faster to beetle infestation, said Thomas Veblen, a CU geography professor and study co-author.LiNeBrEaKIn Colorado, many forests are suffering "abrupt" mortality because of bark beetles, which have killed about 3. 5 million acres of lodgepole pine in the state in the past decade.LiNeBrEaK"What's happening in Colorado in terms of the bark beetle outbreaks may be the future for some of the forests in the western United States that don't have these bark-beetle outbreaks just yet," Veblen said.LiNeBrEaKVeblen and colleagues studied data from 76 forest plots where the trees were at least 200 years old and undisturbed by logging, major bark beetle outbreak or recent wildfire. The stands included two areas in Colorado - near Nederland and Fraser - as well as in the Pacific Northwest and California.LiNeBrEaKThe data stretched 50 years and included 59,000 trees.LiNeBrEaKColorado trees included in the study were last measured in 2004, and since then, many were wiped out by bark beetles, Veblen said.LiNeBrEaKThe temperature in Colorado's subalpine forests - between about 8,500 to 10,000 feet elevation - increased during the past 50 years in all seasons of the year, Veblen said.LiNeBrEaKThat extra heat has led to more evaporation, less moisture and severe drought. Colorado has suffered from drought since the 1990s, with 2002 recording the most severe drought on record in the last 100 years.LiNeBrEaKScientists have learned from studying tree rings that periods of drought lead to higher death rates, but the latest research shows a long-term trend linking climate change to increased tree death, Veblen said.LiNeBrEaK"We see the same pattern through British Columbia, through California and through the Rocky Mountain region," he said. "Ecosystems are being affected by warming. It's a little alarming."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the birth rate of trees remained steady during the 50-year study, meaning there aren't enough new trees to replace the ones dying.LiNeBrEaKPrevious research has linked the bark-beetle epidemic to climate change. Winter's coldest temperatures are not cold enough to kill the beetles, which have attacked forests from Alaska to the southwestern United States.LiNeBrEaKCU's Bill Bowman, an ecology professor who was not part of the tree study, said a particularly alarming fact highlighted in the research paper is that more tree deaths could affect future climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe bigger and older the tree, the more atmosphere-polluting carbon it traps.LiNeBrEaK"Certainly in our lifetime, we haven't seen forests die back like this," Bowman said. "When people drive across the Continental Divide, they see just huge stands of forest dieback. Pretty soon that's going to be seen on the Front Range."LiNeBrEaKJennifer Brown: 303-954-1593LiNeBrEaKor jenbrown@denverpost.com	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); RESEARCH (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); DEATHS and DEATH RATES (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (90%); FORESTRY and LOGGING (89%); LOGGING INDUSTRY (89%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); FOREST FIRES (78%); DROUGHT (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (77%); AIR POLLUTION (74%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (67%)  			COLORADO, USA (96%); WEST USA (94%); NORTHWEST USA (93%); CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  	UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (56%); UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (55%)  															
The Houston Chronicle 		January 23, 2009 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Mexico turns to wind for alternative energy;  Country asks Spanish company to run project 	MARK STEVENSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	A; Pg. 14  	333 words  	LA VENTOSA, Mexico - Mexico inaugurated one of the world's largest wind farm projects Thursday as the nation looks for alternative energy, in part to compensate for falling oil production. LiNeBrEaKMexico is trying to exploit its rich wind and solar potential after relying almost exclusively on petroleum for decades.LiNeBrEaKWith oil production down by 9. 2 percent in 2008, Mexico now is turning to foreign companies, mainly Spanish, to tap its renewable riches.LiNeBrEaK"If we don't do something about this problem of climate change it probably could become - I'm sure it already is - one of the biggest threats to humanity," said President Felipe Calderon at the inaugural ceremony attended by about 1,000 residents.LiNeBrEaKThe $550 million project is in a region so breezy the main town is named La Ventosa, or "Windy."LiNeBrEaKIt's on the narrow isthmus between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, where winds blow at 15 to 22 mph, a near-ideal rate for turbines.LiNeBrEaKSpanish energy company Acciona Energia says the 6,180-acre farm should generate 250 megawatts of electricity with 167 turbines, 25 of which are already operating.LiNeBrEaKThe rest should be on line by the end of the year, making the project the largest of its kind in Latin America.LiNeBrEaKIt will produce enough energy to power a city of 500,000 people while reducing carbon monoxide emissions by 600,000 metric tons each year, according to the company.LiNeBrEaKEsteban Morras, Acciona board member, said the project could be just the start for Mexico.LiNeBrEaKThe project is also a joint venture with Cemex Inc. and will provide 25 percent of the Mexican cement giant's energy needs, fulfilling the company's goal of using alternative fuels.LiNeBrEaKMexico hopes to boost the nation's wind energy capacity, mainly at La Ventosa, to 5,000 megawatts - about 10 times its current output. Wind energy now accounts for less than 2 percent of its electricity production.LiNeBrEaKEnergy Secretary Georgina Kessel said the government is planning a series of wind projects that by 2012 should generate 2,500 megawatts of electricity.

The Janesville Gazette (Wisconsin)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	Winter scheduling frustrates schools  	Frank Schultz, The Janesville Gazette, Wis.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1592 words  	Jan. 23--Today was supposed to be a day off for Janesville schoolchildren. Instead, kids are in school to make up for a snow day.LiNeBrEaKOne down, at least two more makeup days to go.LiNeBrEaKFinding days on the school calendar to make up for days off has become a problem for Wisconsin school administrators over the past two years.LiNeBrEaKJanesville had four days off because of harsh winter weather last year, and four more this year.LiNeBrEaKAnd this winter isn't even over. LiNeBrEaKWhat's a school administrator to do? Build more snow days into the calendar? That's what some districts do.LiNeBrEaKBut consider that Janesville for decades has gotten by with just one built-in snow day. Officials have had to worry about makeup days in only five of the past 30 years, according to Janesville School District records.LiNeBrEaKBut two of those years were this year and last year. And never until last year had the district called off school four times. Now, school has broken that record two years in a row.LiNeBrEaKIs it climate change?LiNeBrEaKImpossible to say, two climatologists said.LiNeBrEaKWhat we do know is that 2007 and 2008 were the two snowiest winters for the Janesville area--ever--since records going back more than 100 years, said Alan Black, climatologist with Midwestern Regional Climate Center in Champaign, Ill.LiNeBrEaKBlack was surprised to see those figures when he checked his databases, but even so he said science doesn't have enough data to make good predictions.LiNeBrEaKEdward Hopkins, assistant state climatologist for Wisconsin, concurred.LiNeBrEaKHopkins noted that weather scientists in the past had relied on water temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean to help predict winter weather in the United States--the so-called el nino and la nina effects. But relying on ocean temperatures in the past two years has led forecasters astray, Hopkins said.LiNeBrEaKSo is the climate changing?LiNeBrEaK"The climate's always changing," Hopkins said.LiNeBrEaKBut that doesn't mean next year will be a harsh winter. And it doesn't mean it'll be a mild winter.LiNeBrEaK"There's no easy answers," Hopkins said.LiNeBrEaKSNOW DAYSLiNeBrEaKTen of the 15 area school districts contacted by The Janesville Gazette have snow days to make up before the end of the school year.LiNeBrEaKOnly the Elkhorn and Evansville school districts have snow days still available to use. Delavan-Darien, Orfordville Parkview and Williams Bay have exhausted their supply.LiNeBrEaKOfficials in many school districts that need to make up snow days still are figuring how to get it done.LiNeBrEaKHere's a rundown:LiNeBrEaKAlbany School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 3LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 5LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 2LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: Not decided yet.

Previous years only had two.LiNeBrEaKBeloit Turner School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 2LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 2LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: Administration is talking to the teachers union about the make-up days, Administrator Dennis McCarthy said. Options include time at the end of the school year in June or in February.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: McCarthy said it's not a simple thing to tack time onto a school year, especially since districts can't start the calendar year until Sept. 1.LiNeBrEaK"If the September 1 start date wasn't there, and we could start in August like we used to, we wouldn't have this problem," McCarthy said.LiNeBrEaKNo matter how you try to build onto the calendar, it usually turns out you're tacking days onto the end of the year, McCarthy said.LiNeBrEaK"All you're doing is extending the calendar," McCarthy said. "You have to understand that you live in Wisconsin and that's what's necessary."LiNeBrEaKBig Foot School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 2LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 3LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 1LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: Thursday, June 11.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: Principal Mike Hinske said although changing the district's snow day policy hasn't been discussed, he doesn't anticipate adding more snow days to the school calendar. "We already have the two that are built in," he said.LiNeBrEaKBrodhead School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: The school district makes up only odd-numbered snow days. For example, if four school days are cancelled for weather, only the first and third are made up.LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 2LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: No dates have been picked, though the two days could be made up on June 8 and 9.LiNeBrEaKClinton School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 2LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 2LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: District administration is working with the teachers union to come up with a creative way to make up snow days, Administrator Pam Kiefert said.LiNeBrEaK"We hope to find a creative solution rather than just tacking on the days at the end," Kiefert said.LiNeBrEaKThe district and teachers are searching for common ground among "varied and unusual proposals", and Kiefert hopes to find a solution in the next few days, she said.LiNeBrEaKDelavan-Darien School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 3LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 3LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: NoneLiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: The district is looking ahead in case classes get cancelled because of snow in February or March, Administrator Wendy Overturf said.LiNeBrEaK"If we would have one more day, we would have to make it up," Overturf said.LiNeBrEaKIf necessary, the district could schedule a make-up day on Feb. 27. If school is cancelled because of bad weather in March, the district could consider having classes on April 13, which is the day after Easter.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: The district scheduled three snow days this year and last year. If officials thought more days needed to be set aside, Overturf said that would be considered during calendar negotiations.LiNeBrEaKEdgerton School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 2LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 2LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: Friday, June 12, and Monday, June 15.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: The Edgerton School District has set its calendar for the next two school years. Superintendent Norm Fjelstad does not recommend building more snow days into the calendar because they'd be superfluous if the district doesn't need them, he said.LiNeBrEaKElkhorn School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 5 for elementary and middle school, 4 for high schoolLiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 3LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 0LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: NoneLiNeBrEaKEvansville School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 5LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 0LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: If at least two more snow days are called, the days would be made up at the end of the year, starting on June 11.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: No changes in makeup day plans, though the administration and school board might discuss and more clearly define which staff members report on cold cancellation days.LiNeBrEaKJanesville School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 1LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 3LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: Friday, Jan. 23.LiNeBrEaKOther makeup dates being considered: Monday, April 13, and Thursday, Feb. 19, for high and middle schools; Thursday, Feb. 26, for elementary schools; and Friday, June 12, for all grade levels.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: Some school board members and residents have asked why the district doesn't build more days into the calendar. The counter argument is that more snow days were not needed for many years. However, the district has now experienced four snow days two years in a row.LiNeBrEaKLake Geneva School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 2LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 3LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 1LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: To be determined.LiNeBrEaKPlans for change: District Administrator Jim Gottinger said the district doesn't plan to build additional snow days into the school calendar.

He expects it to come up for discussion soon.LiNeBrEaKBut adding snow days into the schedule might cause difficulties, he said.LiNeBrEaK"If you build those days in, there's some union-related issues with that too because if you don't have those snow days, that's extra time that staff would be working," he said.LiNeBrEaKOrfordville Parkview School DistrictLiNeBrEaKSnow days built in: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days used so far: 4LiNeBrEaKSnow days to be made up: 0LiNeBrEaKMakeup days scheduled: None.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	McConnell promises to work with Obama, congressional Democrats  	By Halimah Abdullah, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	707 words  	WASHINGTON _ As his party struggles to regain its footing after devastating election losses, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged Friday that the Republican Party will rally and work in a bipartisan manner with Democrats and President Barack Obama's administration.LiNeBrEaK"If someone told you Mitch McConnell was down at the National Press Club hoping for the spirit of bipartisanship, they'd tell you that's like an insurance agent hoping for an earthquake," the Kentucky Republican told a gathering of journalists at the National Press Club. LiNeBrEaKHis address was the first major policy speech by a Republican leader since Obama took office and McConnell's first appearance at the Press Club since 1997, when he staked out his position opposing campaign-finance restructuring. Though Democrats took the White House and expanded their congressional majorities in the November elections, they fell short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate to overcome filibusters.LiNeBrEaKAs the most powerful Republican in Washington, McConnell, along with his Republican colleagues, will continue to play a pivotal role in influencing the legislative plans of the Obama administration and the Democratic-led Congress. McConnell vowed to leverage this power with the new administration but to temper his actions with an eye toward bipartisan cooperation.LiNeBrEaK"For the first time in a while, America has a president who isn't viewed by most people as an overly polarizing figure," McConnell said. "Americans are intrigued by President Obama's promise of post-partisanship.LiNeBrEaK"As others have noted, the president does not govern alone. He can't sign a bill Congress hasn't already passed. He can't spend money Congress hasn't appropriated. If President Obama's promise of post-partisanship is to be realized, he'll first need some cooperation from Congress."LiNeBrEaKMcConnell, who joined fellow Republican and Democratic congressional leaders in a meeting Friday with Obama at the White House, said he'd work to meet a deadline of getting an $825 billion economic-stimulus package to the president by mid-February. McConnell also acknowledged that in order to resolve the nation's economic crisis, lawmakers must move past "protecting narrow interests." Decisions no longer can be based on political calculations, he said.LiNeBrEaKMcConnell acknowledged that his new mantra of bipartisanship may sound strange to those who are familiar with his tenure as the Senate's ranking Republican.LiNeBrEaKIn Washington political circles, McConnell is seen as a shrewd tactician who's used the filibuster to effectively block legislation he opposes over the past decade. Last year, during heated negotiations over a Democratic-backed global-warming measure, McConnell brought the proceedings to a standstill after calling for all 492 pages of the bill to be read aloud.LiNeBrEaK"McConnell is the kind of politician who pokes and prods until he finds a weak spot," said Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.LiNeBrEaKStill, the spirit of bipartisanship shouldn't be interpreted as caving in to Democratic whims, McConnell said.LiNeBrEaKHe stridently disagrees with Obama's plans to close the Guantanamo Bay and CIA prisons, has pledged to fight an expansion of entitlement spending and will buck a push by labor groups to require employers to recognize unions as soon as majorities of employees sign cards declaring their intent to unionize. Republicans also expect to be "a full partner" in health care revisions, he said.LiNeBrEaK"President Obama's campaign reminded many in Washington, including many Republicans, of the aspirations that the American people have about their government," McConnell said. "People want their leaders to work together to solve problems, not to set traps. The challenge now is for both parties to cooperate, not just in word but in deed."

Kyodo News International (Tokyo, Japan)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	Japan launches satellite to study Earth's greenhouse gases  	Kyodo News International, Tokyo  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	393 words  	Jan. 23--TANEGASHIMA -- Japan launched a rocket Friday carrying a satellite that will study the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, as well as seven small satellites, including those developed by university students and small factories. LiNeBrEaKThe domestically built H-2A rocket carrying the Ibuki satellite was launched from the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture shortly before 1 p.m.LiNeBrEaKThe Ibuki satellite successfully separated from the rocket 16 minutes after liftoff. The seven small satellites also separated from the rocket, of which four entered orbit. The remaining three are expected to enter orbit later in the day.LiNeBrEaKUnder the planned operation, the Ibuki satellite will become the first of its kind in the world to observe the concentration of greenhouse gases from space, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and launch operator Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.LiNeBrEaKThe satellite is expected to play an important role in combating global warming as it will allow better understanding of how much carbon dioxide the Earth's ecosystem actually absorbs and emits.LiNeBrEaKThe satellite will orbit the Earth at an altitude of around 666 kilometers and will obtain data once every three days on the levels of carbon dioxide and methane at 56,000 locations around the globe for about five years.LiNeBrEaKOf the seven small satellites, six were developed privately or by universities and one is a technology demonstration satellite developed by the aerospace agency to study new communications functions.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of operating the Ibuki, including the launch, is estimated at 34. 6 billion yen.LiNeBrEaKChief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura stressed the significance of the satellite launch, telling a press conference that not only the public sector but also researchers from the private sector have participated in the project.LiNeBrEaK"I expect the project, which will contribute to addressing global warming, to realize the peaceful use of space," he said.

The New York Times 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Environmental Issues Slide In Poll of Public's Concerns  	By ANDREW C. REVKIN  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13  	760 words  	A new poll suggests that Americans, preoccupied with the economy, are less worried about rising global temperatures than they were a year ago but remain concerned with solving the nation's energy problems. LiNeBrEaK  The findings are somewhat at odds with President Obama, who has put a high priority on staving off global warming and vowed Tuesday in his Inaugural Address to ''roll back the specter of a warming planet.''LiNeBrEaK  In the poll, released Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, global warming came in last among 20 voter concerns; it trailed issues like addressing moral decline and decreasing the influence of lobbyists. Only 30 percent of the voters deemed global warming to be ''a top priority,'' compared with 35 percent in 2008. LiNeBrEaK  ''Protecting the environment,'' which had surged in the rankings from 2006 to 2008, dropped even more precipitously in the poll: only 41 percent of voters called it a top priority, compared with 56 percent last year.LiNeBrEaK  In contrast, dealing with the nation's energy problems ranked sixth in the poll -- just behind education and social security -- with 60 percent of voters endorsing it as a top priority.LiNeBrEaK  The declining interest in global warming and other environmental issues might be unsurprising at a time when Americans face far more imminent threats to their jobs and homes. ''Strengthening the nation's economy'' was the top-ranked concern of voters in the Pew poll. A relatively cool year and a harsh winter in North America and Europe have not helped, inspiring some commentators and a small cluster of scientists to make skeptical remarks about ''global cooling.''LiNeBrEaK  Social scientists say that environmental concerns are often the first to fall off the table when any more immediate threat surfaces. Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Research Center, said a similar pattern was seen in the Pew poll after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when second-tier issues faded in voters' minds. LiNeBrEaK  ''Concern for terrorism overshadowed all else,'' Mr. Kohut said.LiNeBrEaK  The public's waning interest in global warming poses a challenge for Mr. Obama, who  emphasized climate change throughout his campaign and pledged to seek a cap on emissions in the United States of heat-trapping gases, led by carbon dioxide, which come mainly from burning coal and oil. Such a cap, even if it includes various mechanisms intended to ease the cost, would by design raise the price of energy coming from those fossil fuels, which still underpin the American and the global economies.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama's political foes have already seized on the cooling of public concern. LiNeBrEaK  Marc Morano, the communications director for the Republican minority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has been sending out e-mail alerts, sometimes several a day, highlighting stories on winter weather and other surveys suggesting a shift in public attitudes.LiNeBrEaK  But some experts in climate and energy policy say, given Americans' continuing concern about filling their gas tanks and lighting their homes, Mr. Obama might still succeed in shoring up public support by packaging his climate policy as part of a larger push for a safer, cleaner menu of energy choices.LiNeBrEaK  ''Obama can effectively tie conservation, efficiency and renewable energy to jobs, sustainable growth and national security,'' said Riley E. Dunlap, a sociologist at Oklahoma State University who studies public and political discourse on climate. LiNeBrEaK  ''This will be easier with energy efficiency and independence than with climate change,'' Dr. Dunlap said. But, he said, ''I think he can 'legitimate' climate change and the need to act on it to a considerable degree.'' LiNeBrEaK  Richard C. J. Somerville, a climate scientist at the University of California, San Diego, said there was plenty of evidence that a sustained push on improved energy technology and energy efficiency, including public education by scientists and political leaders, could pay off politically and environmentally.LiNeBrEaK  ''France, a country of 60 million people, went from near zero to 80 percent nuclear electricity in about three decades,'' Dr. Somerville said. The shift, he added, ''was done smoothly and effectively, and public education was a big part of it.''LiNeBrEaK  David Goldston, a former chief of staff of the House science committee, noted that no American president had previously made global warming a central issue, ''so we don't know what will happen when that occurs.'' LiNeBrEaK  ''We'll see,'' Mr. Goldston added, ''but I think it's wrong to assume too much about the future based on our current prolonged torpor.''

The New York Times 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Heat and Drought Blamed In Tree Deaths in the West  	By MIREYA NAVARRO  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13  	632 words  	Rising temperatures and the resulting drought are causing trees in the West to die at more than twice the pace they did a few decades ago, a new study has found.LiNeBrEaK  The combination of temperature and drought  has also reduced the ability of the forests to absorb carbon dioxide, which  traps heat and thus contributes to global warming, the authors of the study said, and has made forests sparser and more susceptible to fires and pests. LiNeBrEaK  The scientists, who analyzed tree census data collected in 1955 and in later years, found that the mortality of trees increased in 87 percent of the 76 forest plots studied. In some plots, the die-off rate doubled in as little as 17 years; in others, it  doubled after 29 years, the study found.  LiNeBrEaK  ''Summers are getting longer,'' said Nathan L. Stephenson, of the United States Geological Survey, a leader of the study with Phillip van Mantgem, also of the geological survey. ''Trees are under more drought stress.''LiNeBrEaK  The study will appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science.LiNeBrEaK  The scientists analyzed the effects of higher temperatures on old-growth temperate forests in three regions: the Pacific Northwest (including southwestern British Columbia), California and inland Western states. The average temperature in those regions rose by more than one degree Fahrenheit from the mid-1970s to 2006. LiNeBrEaK  Precipitation and snowpack runoff decreased over the same period. LiNeBrEaK  The higher mortality rates held regardless of tree size or type or elevation at which it grew. The fact that birth rates remained unchanged among the nearly 60,000 pines, firs, hemlocks and other trees in the study indicates that forests are losing trees faster than they are replacing them, the authors noted. LiNeBrEaK  It remains unclear how much of the regional warming is a result of a natural climate cycle and how much results from a global trend toward higher temperatures. But Jerry F. Franklin, a professor of ecosystem analysis at the University of Washington and an author of the study,  blamed global warming. ''We see the regional warming as part of a much larger shift globally,'' Mr. Franklin said.LiNeBrEaK  The study focused on forests more than 200 years old where rapid changes in demographic rates would more likely be caused by environmental changes rather than by internal processes like self-thinning that are more common in young forests. The spike in mortality   cannot be attributed to aging, fires and other events, the researchers saidLiNeBrEaK  Warmer weather makes trees more vulnerable to insects and pathogens that thrive in warmer conditions. LiNeBrEaK  In a report last year, the Department of Agriculture said that climate change had ''very likely'' increased the size and number of fires, insect infestations and overall tree die-offs in forests in the West, the Southwest and Alaska, and that the damage would accelerate in the future. LiNeBrEaK  The authors of the new study said in a teleconference that if tree mortality rates continued to rise, the average size of trees could fall because trees would die at younger ages. Smaller trees cannot store as much carbon dioxide as large ones.LiNeBrEaK  In addition, areas could also become less suitable for some species and more welcoming for others, and existing species might begin to act in peculiar ways. ''Novel behaviors on the part of pests and pathogens are the sort of thing we'll get surprised by,'' Mr. Franklin said.LiNeBrEaK  But Steve Pyne, an environmental historian at the University of Texas who has studied fires in forests, said that how bad things became depended on what replaced  the vegetation that was being lost.LiNeBrEaK  ''Part of the trick here is we don't know,'' Mr. Pyne said. ''It's like the financial meltdown. It's the uncertainty. What's going to replace it?''LiNeBrEaK  He added, ''It may make no difference; it may make a huge difference.''

The New York Times 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Collapse of the Clean Coal Myth  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 26  	460 words  	A month of negative news for the Tennessee Valley Authority could lead to positive changes in national policy, including federal regulation of toxic coal wastes and new legal constraints on coal-fired power plants. More broadly, the authority's recent travails may help persuade the public that coal is nowhere near as ''clean'' as a high-priced industry advertising campaign makes it out to be. LiNeBrEaK  In December, hundreds of acres of Roane County in eastern Tennessee were buried under a billion gallons of toxic coal sludge after the collapse of one of the T.V.A.'s containment ponds. It was an accident waiting to happen and an alarm bell for Congress and federal regulators.LiNeBrEaK  Senator Barbara Boxer of California noted that coal combustion in this country produces 130 million tons of coal ash every year -- enough to fill a train of boxcars stretching from Washington, D.C., to Australia. Amazingly, the task of regulating the more than 600 landfills and impoundments holding this ash is left to the states, which are more often lax than not. Ms. Boxer  will press  the Obama administration to devise  rules for the disposal of coal ash as well as  design and construction standards for the impoundments. LiNeBrEaK  Just as the T.V.A. was dealing with this mess, Lacy Thornburg, a federal district judge in North Carolina, ordered the giant utility to  reduce emissions from four coal-fired power plants that had been sending pollution into North Carolina. LiNeBrEaK  The ruling validated an unusual legal strategy adopted by North Carolina's attorney general, Roy Cooper, who sued the T.V.A. in 2006 on grounds that pollution from its power plants in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky constituted a ''public nuisance'' to the citizens of his state. Mr. Cooper chose this route because the Bush administration had systematically weakened regulations that had been used in the past to force power companies to clean up their emissions. LiNeBrEaK  Taken together, the coal ash disaster and Judge Thornburg's ruling did much to undercut the coal industry's cheery ''clean coal'' campaign, whose ads would have us believe that low-polluting coal is here or just around the corner. LiNeBrEaK  It is neither.    Coal is certainly an  important fuel, providing just over half of the nation's electricity. And progress has been made:   new coal-fired plants are cleaner than old ones, and  older plants that have been required under the Clean Air Act to install pollution controls are cleaner than the many plants that have managed to escape the law's reach. LiNeBrEaK  But coal remains an inherently dirty fuel, and a huge contributor to not only ground-level pollution -- including acid rain and smog -- but also global warming. The sooner the country understands that, the closer it will be to mitigating the damage.

The News and Advance (Lynchburg, Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	EDITORIAL: 'Green Jobs' Important to State's Future  	The News and Advance, Lynchburg, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	694 words  	Jan. 23--In his "green jobs" programs, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has scored at least an extra-base hit with proposals to improve the state economy and the environment. The package of legislation he has offered the General Assembly deserves the lawmakers' support.LiNeBrEaKDespite a nearly $3 billion budget shortfall that will require cuts in virtually every state program, the governor is emphasizing energy and the environment in this final year of his four-year term. LiNeBrEaK"Creating green jobs and a renewable energy sector of the Virginia economy is one way we can create opportunity from our current economic challenges," Kaine said in a presentation at a Virginia Beach company that installs solar panels.LiNeBrEaKGreen jobs, by the way, are jobs related to improving the environment with respect to global warming and creating greater use of renewable sources of energy. Both, in the long run, will stem the rise of global warming and reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKThe legislative proposals include tax credits and incentives for businesses to offer energy efficient goods and services. "With this package of bills," the governor said, "not only will be able to create jobs for hard-working Virginians, but we will be taking proactive steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and improve our environment."LiNeBrEaKKaine has put $2 million in his budget to expand an incentive program for new and expanding businesses that produce goods and equipment for energy efficiency and produce clean energy sources, such as solar, wind, nuclear and biomass.LiNeBrEaKThe governor also wants to modify an incentive program for biofuel makers to provide more money to those who use sources not being used for food. In distinguishing between those who make ethanol from corn, for example, and those who make biofuels from certain non-food grasses, he wants to offer a greater incentive to those who use non-food sources. They would get a 10-cent per gallon produced incentive from the state, while those who produce biofuels from food crops would receive 7. 5 cents per gallon.LiNeBrEaKThe legislative package also calls for income tax credits of up to $8,000 for individuals and $20,000 for corporations who install solar and wind energy systems. A related bill would exempt solar and small wind systems from the 5 percent state sales tax, which Kaine said would reduce the cost of those systems to consumers.LiNeBrEaKIn his Jan. 14 State of the Commonwealth address, Kaine emphasized the importance of attracting new jobs related to the environment to Virginia. The development of new energy sources, he said, "presents dramatic new opportunities for the (state)." He added that the Virginia Economic Development Partnership has completed an "aggressive marketing plan to promote Virginia's business case for new investments in renewable energy production and energy efficiency products."LiNeBrEaKWhat the governor is talking about is attracting more companies to Virginia that make and install solar panels, for example, or equipment related to wind farms that are beginning to take hold across the country. Approval earlier this month of the wind farm project off Cape Cod indicates that wind turbines are becoming a more acceptable way of producing clean energy from a renewable resource.LiNeBrEaKSome of those turbines are made in Ohio, but there's no reason they can't also be made in Virginia. The state has a number of manufacturing facilities sitting idle and ready for new uses. Kaine wants to help new companies in the environmental field find that Virginia is an attractive place to relocate existing green companies.LiNeBrEaKWith his proposals, Gov. Kaine is looking to the state's economic, energy and environmental future. They are all critically important as Virginia moves deeper into the 21st century.

The Oregonian  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	Task force says Oregon land-use system needs tweaking  	Eric Mortenson, The Oregonian, Portland, Ore.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	670 words  	Jan. 23--Oregon's storied land-use system makes the state an environmental pacesetter but it smothers regional differences and is complicated to the point of being "unapproachable," a review concludes.LiNeBrEaKAlso, challenges -- ranging from global warming to the cost of providing development infrastructure -- demand that the land-use system evolve, according to a "Big Look" task force that studied it. The arrival of as many as 2 million new residents in the next 25 years compounds the situation, the group concluded.LiNeBrEaKInstead of whacking the land-use approach, however, the task force appointed by the governor and the 2005 Legislature recommended a series of strategic tweaks. Among them: LiNeBrEaK--Allow counties to find regional solutions, including rezoning farm and forestland for development instead of applying a "one-size-fits-all" philosophy.LiNeBrEaK--Coordinate land-use planning with economic development and transportation policies to ensure orderly expansion of urban areas and protection of rural areas.LiNeBrEaK--Instead of 19 statewide goals, focus on four guiding principles that ensure a healthy environment, prosperous economy, a desirable quality of life, and equity and fairness for all Oregonians.LiNeBrEaK--Simplify the system.LiNeBrEaKThe findings are condensed into a bill beginning its way through the Legislature. The House Land Use Committee is getting up to speed on the issues and probably will meet with Big Look task force members next week, said Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, committee chairwoman.LiNeBrEaK"There's a lot of meat in what the task force has developed," Nolan said.LiNeBrEaKShe acknowledged the land-use bill is heading into a Legislature focused on the state's economic problems, however.LiNeBrEaK"Anything that costs a lot of money, or distracts from the Legislature's ability to focus on the budget, is probably not going to move rapidly this biennium," Nolan said. "I think it's still an effort that will be well received."LiNeBrEaKLand-use and property-rights fights have consumed Oregonians for much of the past five years, and courts continue sorting out land development claims and lawsuits generated by 2004's Measure 37 and its 2007 revision, Measure 49. The task force, made up of 10 members approved by Gov. Ted Kulongoski and legislative leaders, was appointed with the hope of settling the arguments.LiNeBrEaKThe task force concluded that the system has produced "tremendous benefits" by checking urban sprawl and protecting Oregon's farms and forests. But it should be more flexible, simpler to understand and responsive to regional differences.LiNeBrEaKThe group recommended allowing two or more counties to jointly ask the state to rezone farm or forestland that is unproductive or compromised by land-use patterns, water problems or other issues. The counties would be required to show any development wouldn't harm water quality and supply, clog transportation networks, increase energy use or put a service load on nearby cities and government agencies.LiNeBrEaKThe conservation group 1000 Friends of Oregon said allowing more regional control is "a very bad idea." Other groups believe the recommendations don't go far enough.LiNeBrEaK"In an attempt to make it easier to develop (in rural areas), they made it more difficult," said Jon Chandler, spokesman for the Oregon Homebuilders Association.LiNeBrEaK"They've substituted a new set of things you've got to demonstrate, and the old one had 25 to 30 years of case law attached to it," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe Oregon Farm Bureau favors regional control but believes the task force recommendation might simply add another layer of government approval.LiNeBrEaK"The intent is good, but I think it misses the mark," spokesman Shawn Cleave said.

The Oregonian  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	Western tree deaths rise with temperatures  	Scott Learn, The Oregonian, Portland, Ore.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	700 words  	Jan. 23--A small increase in temperatures during the past three decades probably contributed to a doubling of tree death rates in undisturbed old-growth forests across the West, a team of researchers reported in the journal Science today, with the increase in mortality highest in the Pacific Northwest.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers ruled out insect attack, fire suppression, forest overcrowding, air pollution and other potential local causes in the study areas, which include some of the West's most stable and resilient stands. LiNeBrEaKInstead, they pinned the increase in tree deaths on a small -- about 1 degree Fahrenheit -- rise in regional temperatures in the past 30 years.LiNeBrEaKHigher temperatures added more stress to trees by reducing snowpack and prolonging summer dry periods, researchers said.LiNeBrEaKThe change in tree death rates is tiny compared with devastating bark beetle infestations and fires in other forests. It amounts to a thinning of about one extra dead tree an acre each year, said Mark Harmon, one of 11 co-authors of the study and a forest ecology professor at Oregon State University.LiNeBrEaKBut it's unexpectedly widespread, the university and government scientists said, hitting conifers from firs to hemlocks to pines of various sizes at all elevations in forest plots averaging 450 years old.LiNeBrEaKIf the globe warms as projected, the results indicate tree size and age would significantly diminish over time, the researchers said, and forests could become more susceptible to abrupt die-offs.LiNeBrEaKIncreased tree deaths would also diminish the forests' capacity to act as "carbon sinks" that offset global warming by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, which could further increase temperatures. Pacific Northwest forests, with dense stands of huge trees, are among the biggest carbon sinks on the globe.LiNeBrEaKHarmon and another co-author, University of Washington forest resources professor Jerry Franklin, said the study's conclusions aren't 100 percent certain.LiNeBrEaKTree mortality is highly variable, and researchers would like to have had long-term data from more than the 76 research plots included in the study. The net effect on global warming depends on how fast the dead trees decompose and release carbon, which is largely unknown. And though there's a strong correlation between higher temperatures and increased tree deaths, that's still just an inference.LiNeBrEaK"But the level of confidence that there's a shift in tree mortality that's occurred in the last 30 to 40 years is pretty strong," Franklin said. "There's something going on."LiNeBrEaKScientists have documented increased tree death rates in tropical forests, and previous studies have concluded that warming contributes to increased beetle infestations and fires in the American West. But the study is the first large-scale analysis of mortality rates in North America's temperate forests, the researchers said.LiNeBrEaKIn the Pacific Northwest and southern British Columbia, the rate of tree death in the older coniferous forests doubled in 17 years, the fastest rate among the areas studied. Mortality rates doubled in 25 years in California and 29 years in interior Western states, the researchers said. Meantime, the rate of new tree establishment remained the same.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers, led by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, based their findings on long-term tree inventories at 76 undisturbed sites across the West, most with 30 to 50 years of data.LiNeBrEaKThe plots, included several in national parks, contained 58,736 living trees over the study period, of which 11,095 died. Had mortality rates stayed constant, about 5,500 fewer trees would have died, Harmon said.LiNeBrEaKThe increased death rate could be a sign of forests naturally regulating themselves, he said. "The question is whether they can keep up with the rate we're pushing the system."

Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	As old-growth trees die at faster rate, scientists blame climate change  	Tom Knudson, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1022 words  	Jan. 23--Tree mortality rates have doubled in old-growth forests across the Sierra Nevada and western United States because of rising temperatures associated with climate change, a new study has found.LiNeBrEaKThe study, published today in the journal Science, suggests that if the trend continues, the region's majestic conifer forests may become younger, smaller and less healthy -- making them vulnerable to massive die-offs.LiNeBrEaK"Everywhere we looked, we saw mortality rates increasing," said Nathan Stephenson, co-leader of the study and a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Three Rivers near Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. "That to me is a red flag that says there is potentially something pretty big going on." LiNeBrEaKWhile the actual increase may not appear large -- annual mortality rates have risen from less than 1 percent to between 1 percent and 2 percent across the region over a quarter century -- it is nonetheless significant, Stephenson said.LiNeBrEaK"You can imagine if (mortality rates) doubled in the human population," he said. "We'd sure take notice and go, 'Oh, my gosh. What's happening that's causing twice as many people to die every year?"LiNeBrEaKThe study, which builds upon previous research, was based on data gathered from 76 research plots across the western United States and southern British Columbia over the past half century. In California, most of those plots were in the southern Sierra, with a handful in Yosemite National Park and near Lassen Volcanic National Park.LiNeBrEaK"It's almost like giving the forest a physical," Stephenson said. "We return to individual plots and go up to trees and effectively ask: 'Are you alive or dead? And if you're dead, what killed you?' "LiNeBrEaKStephenson and 10 other scientists who worked on the study found that mortality rates have increased across the map -- from damp coastal forests in the Pacific Northwest to windswept high-elevation stands in the Rockies.LiNeBrEaK"What's eerie is it's happening in the major kinds of trees -- it's Douglas firs, hemlocks, pines," Stephenson said. "And it's happening in trees of all sizes, at every elevation."LiNeBrEaKTrees die of multiple causes, of course. But researchers found that common suspects -- such as insect infestations and overcrowding caused by fire suppression -- could not explain the widespread, sustained increase in mortality.LiNeBrEaKBut climate change could, in part because Western forests thrive in cold-adapted landscapes where even small changes in temperature can translate into big differences on the ground.LiNeBrEaK"Average temperature in the West rose by more than one degree over the last few decades," said Phil van Mantgem, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist and co-leader of the study, in a news release. "While this may not sound like much, it has been enough to reduce winter snowpack, cause earlier snowmelt and lengthen the summer drought."LiNeBrEaKThe findings jibe with those of many Sierra residents who say they are seeing more trees die these days, although not in dramatic numbers.LiNeBrEaK"Sometimes the slowness fools you," said Jan van Wagtendonk, a retired fire scientist who has watched ponderosa pines slowly fade from the foothills west of Yosemite.LiNeBrEaK"It doesn't seem to be very different this year than it was last year," van Wagtendonk said. "But if you look at this year vs. 30 years ago, then the change is dramatic."LiNeBrEaKAs they examined their data, the scientists found that past droughts -- often implicated in tree deaths -- didn't fully explain the mortality increase. But today's droughts -- seasoned by temperatures warming through climate change -- may be contributing.LiNeBrEaK"It puts increased evaporative demand on the plants," Stephenson said. "If you're walking through the desert with a bottle of water and (the temperature) goes up 10 degrees, you're more likely to run out of water because you're sweating faster. The same thing happens with plants."LiNeBrEaKAs an example, he pointed to stands of hardy pinyon pine in the American Southwest that have survived previous dry spells but now are dying across vast areas.LiNeBrEaKRising temperatures don't just sap moisture from trees, the scientists found. They also give insects a chance to wreak havoc. In British Columbia, for example, bark beetles once held in check by winter cold snaps have devastated a swath of forest one-third the size of California.LiNeBrEaKSimilar die-offs are occurring across the northern Rockies, the researchers reported.LiNeBrEaK"In any of these cases, there are other (factors) going on," Stephenson said. "But driving them is a climatic change."LiNeBrEaKOverall, scientists found that 1 percent to 2 percent of the trees in old-growth stands die each year, depending on the location -- and that the death rate had doubled over the past 17 to 29 years.LiNeBrEaKSuch stands are natural resource treasure troves. Not only are they home to many rare species, from salamanders to spotted owls, they soak up and store water -- and heat-trapping carbon dioxide -- and provide recreational solace and inspiration to millions.LiNeBrEaKAll that may be in danger.LiNeBrEaK"If a doubling of background mortality rates persists for a couple hundred years, the average age of a tree in the forest would be about cut in half," Stephenson said.LiNeBrEaK"Consequently the average tree would be smaller. -- Even if it just stopped at a doubling, that would pretty drastically change the forest."LiNeBrEaKThe study also found that trees were dying faster than they were being replaced -- another discouraging trend.LiNeBrEaK"I view this as a canary in the coal mine for potentially larger changes in the future," Stephenson said. "It could be an indication that the forests are stressed and, if warming continues, they might get pushed over a tipping point and suddenly you lose vast swaths of forest to die-off."LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Tom Knudson, (530) 582-5336.

San Antonio Express-News 		January 23, 2009 Friday   STATEandMETRO Edition	Global warming policy could drive jobs away  	Anton Caputo, STAFF  	METRO AND STATE NEWS; Pg. 3B  	448 words  	A globetrotting attorney who specializes in climate change hit San Antonio on Thursday with the warning that a poorly constructed global warming policy could drive jobs oversees without reducing greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKThat was the message Tom Mullikin brought to a group of at least 150 at an event organized by the West San Antonio Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaKMullikin's bio sports trips to spots like Antarctica and the Arctic to study climate change alongside scientists.LiNeBrEaKWith the country in the midst of a debate on how to limit the greenhouse gases that most scientists agree contribute to global warming, Mullikin's Charlotte, N.C., law firm of Moore and Van Allen sponsors his trips around the country to talk about potential climate change policy.LiNeBrEaKMullikin argued that it would be folly for the United States to place any mandatory controls on emissions unless China and India do the same.LiNeBrEaKThose countries were given a pass by the international Kyoto Protocol as part of an effort to avoid hampering the economy of developing countries. But China has now surpassed the United States as the world's top emitter of greenhouse gases and India is third. The United States refused to join the protocol, which was an international agreement in 1997 to limit greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKMullikin worries that if China and India are not involved in future efforts to control greenhouse gases, polluting industries will simply move operations there.LiNeBrEaK"If what we do here moves or pushes emissions to another part of the world, then we haven't moved the ball," he said. "At the end of the day, we're talking about global emissions. That's how we get to global climate change."LiNeBrEaKMullikin is also ardently against a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gases, an idea that has emerged as the frontrunner in the national discussion. Such a program, which is used in Europe, sets a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and than allows companies that can't meet their limits to trade or buy allowances from companies that can. But Mullikin argues that this would simply act as a tax and hasten the movement of companies to countries without regulation.LiNeBrEaKInstead of mandating limits, he suggested focusing on technology and energy conservation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKPaul Martin of Seguin's Siempre Sustainable Network challenged Mullikin on some points but said overall he found the presentation valuable.LiNeBrEaK"I agree with him that we need to get everybody globally," he said.LiNeBrEaKChamber President Mary Cruz said that climate change is an issue that local businesses need to become more familiar with.LiNeBrEaK"Economically this is important," she said. "This could have a big impact on economic development and small business."

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	New York, New York? Cavaliers hope not  	Steve Luhm, The Salt Lake Tribune  	SPORTS  	1013 words  	Jan. 23--LOS ANGELES -- One hour before the Cleveland Cavaliers are scheduled to play the Lakers, reporters crowd four-deep around LeBron James in the cramped visitor's locker room at Staples Center.LiNeBrEaKThey shout questions about James' pending duel with the world's other best basketball player, Kobe Bryant.LiNeBrEaKThey ask about the new-and-improved Cavaliers, who just might be good enough this year to win an NBA championship.LiNeBrEaKThey want to know about the Olympics, winning the gold medal in Beijing and if James might feel like doing it again in 2012. LiNeBrEaKThey want to know James' plan for energizing the economy, fighting terrorism and ending global warming.LiNeBrEaKO.K., so nobody asked about the economy, terrorism or the environment.LiNeBrEaKIf the media session had lasted more than 12 minutes, however, somebody probably would have gotten around to it because -- these days -- James is perhaps the most iconic figure in America, not counting the guy who just moved into the White House.LiNeBrEaKAs James preps for the Cavs' annual visit to Energy Solution Arena Saturday night to play the Jazz, everybody wants to know what he thinks, what he does, where he goes and -- of course -- whether he plans to cure the New York Knicks' lingering ills in 2010, when he becomes a free agent.LiNeBrEaKThere will be other suitors, obviously. But the Knicks are the most high-profile and least subtle because, well, they are the Knicks.LiNeBrEaKIn November, new team presidentLiNeBrEaKDonnie Walsh cleared $27 million in salary cap space for 2010 by trading Zach Randolph, Jamal Crawford and Mardy Collins.LiNeBrEaKAfter the fire-sale, Walsh said the trades were "just the first step" in rebuilding the Knicks and the deals gave him "a year and half" to "see what our options are when we get to that point."LiNeBrEaKWalsh's preferred option?LiNeBrEaKSign King James for an amount slightly less than the gross national product of Finland and then sit back while the magic returns to Madison Square Garden.LiNeBrEaKJames even did his part to fuel the fervor.LiNeBrEaKA few days after the trades, the Cavaliers played in New York. Following Cleveland's 1191-101 victory, LeBron teased the media.LiNeBrEaK"If you guys want to sleep now and don't wake up until July 1, 2010, then go ahead," James said. "It's going to be a big day."LiNeBrEaKIt was all New Yorkers had to hear.LiNeBrEaKJames' words were taken as a promise that he was coming ... as reassurance that all was well ... as a message to NBA commissioner David Stern that the world headquarters of LeBron, Inc. would soon be located just down the block.LiNeBrEaKTwo months later -- in the locker room before Monday's Cavaliers-Lakers game -- James was asked about his plans in 2010.LiNeBrEaK"The question hasn't come up in a long time," LeBron said earlier this week, teasing again. "... The further and further I get away from New York, the question kind of goes away."LiNeBrEaKGood answer.LiNeBrEaKEverybody laughed, except maybe the Cavaliers, who would have preferred an etched-in-stone declaration of career-long devotion to the franchise James has lifted to unimaginable heights in only six seasons.LiNeBrEaKBut if Cleveland coach Mike Brown is worried about ever losing his mega-star, however, it does not show.LiNeBrEaK"People ask me, 'What's going to happen in 2010?'" Brown said. "[But] we're ... building this organization for the long haul, not just so LeBron James stays here. We're building this organization so everybody wants to be a part of it, from custodial workers to secretaries to the [team] president."LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, Brown insists he is not going to worry about it. "A lot of things can happen before 2010. So there's really nothing, in my mind, to talk about," he said.LiNeBrEaKOnetime Jazz point guard Mo Williams was acquired by the Cavs during the offseason to help make James' life in Cleveland a little easier.LiNeBrEaKA talented scorer, Williams' presence means James does not have to produce 40 points every night for the Cavs to win games and, in the long run, compete for a championship.LiNeBrEaK"To be honest, we don't talk about [2010]," Williams said. "It's not a topic of conversation -- not at all."LiNeBrEaKAs far as James' comments in New York, Williams shrugged. "He has to answer those type of questions and that's just LeBron. He gives honest opinions," he said.LiNeBrEaKOne thing about James that everybody does know: He's playing the best basketball of his life.LiNeBrEaKUnstoppable on offense. A stone wall on defense. The best player on one of the best teams in the world.LiNeBrEaKThe MVP, perhaps.LiNeBrEaKSaid Brown: "Obviously, you have to throw Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade into that conversation. And Tim Duncan into that conversation. And obviously a maturing Dwight Howard. There are some players that a lot of people would argue about. But me personally, I'm a LeBron James fan. I look at him as being the best player in the league. But I might be a little biased."LiNeBrEaKLaker coach Phil Jackson refuses to get into the MVP debate, but he calls James "... one of the top players who has ever played. The way he's going, he'll be ranked up there in the top five or top 10 players ever in this game."LiNeBrEaKWilliams calls James' abilities "overwhelming. More than I thought. I expected the best and I've got the best and then some. So I'm rolling. I rolling with this circus. I'm definitely having the best time of my life as a professional athlete."LiNeBrEaKAnother teammate, Sasha Pavlovic, has spent five seasons with James.LiNeBrEaK"He's a great guy and that's why he's a great player," Pavlovic said. "He is great with everybody -- off the court and on the court -- and that's why the guys love to play with him ..."LiNeBrEaKThe question now is whether James, an Ohio native, loves Cleveland and playing with his teammates enough to stick around and perhaps lead the Cavs to an NBA championship or two.LiNeBrEaKA question that may not be answered for another year, at least.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 23, 2009 Friday   FINAL Edition	A clean-air choice for Obama  		Op-Ed; EDITORIALS; Pg. B8  	470 words  	Along with closing Guantanamo Bay prison, President Obama has a chance to follow through quickly on another promise that can send shockwaves. He should let California and 18 other states set tough limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.  LiNeBrEaKThe prior White House had eviscerated the clean-air cause by siding with Detroit, which opposed tailpipe controls as expensive. The Bush team ignored staff recommendations from the Environmental Protection Agency about pollution science and spiked California's request to exert state's rights and seek a waiver from federal rules. LiNeBrEaKThe last few years were pretty much a clean sweep for the dirty-air crowd. But the results were so unpopular that nearly every major candidate in both parties pledged to reverse direction. No one was more emphatic than Obama, who co-sponsored a bill written by California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer to overturn an EPA ruling barring California from setting the emission rules. In case anyone missed the point: this nation is heading unmistakably in the direction of cleaner-burning cars and trucks. LiNeBrEaKThat's why both Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the state Air Resources Board, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sent separate appeals to Washington this week. Their goal is to remind the new administration of California's desire for regulations cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2016. The standards have a double whammy effect of also raising mileage, meaning both cleaner air and lower energy bills. LiNeBrEaKThe rules are key for another reason. Some 17 other states, including the nation's biggest, are following Sacramento's lead, and the regulations cover at least half the nation's auto and pickup truck fleet.LiNeBrEaKThe widespread support at the state level undercuts one of the major criticism by the Bush team and car makers: The changeover to cleaner cars will lead to a checkerboard of differing state rules on tailpipe pollution. With the biggest markets demanding cleaner cars, the Detroit and foreign brands are assured of a huge market. LiNeBrEaKThe decision by Obama should come soon. Lisa Jackson, his pick to head the EPA, said she will examine California's request "very, very aggressively very soon" after her confirmation, a process that could mean new rules in place by May. Jackson's home state of New Jersey has embraced the California standards and is waiting alongside Sacramento for permission to enact them. LiNeBrEaKIt can't come too soon. This state's long battle to clean the air and spur new auto technology has taken too long. Obama can remind the country - and the planet - of one of his bedrock promises to conserve energy, encourage new technology and reduce global warming. LiNeBrEaKSign the waiver, Mr. President, and let ambitious states like California get to work. LiNeBrEaK"He should act quickly to free California's climate-change initiative."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		January 23, 2009 Friday   FINAL Edition	Increase in tree deaths blamed on warming  	David Perlman, Chronicle Science Editor  	Main News; Pg. A1  	689 words  	Trees are dying faster than ever in the old-growth forests of California and the mountains of the West, a phenomenon scientists say is linked to rising regional temperatures and the destructive forces of early snowmelt, drought, forest fires and deadly insect infestations brought on by global warming.LiNeBrEaKOver the past 17 years in some regions - and 25 to 37 years in others - the death rates of mature trees have doubled, the scientists said, raising concerns that the problem goes well beyond the death of trees alone. LiNeBrEaK"The ultimate implications for our forests and the environment are huge," said Mark Harmon of Oregon State University, a member of the team that helped write a report that appears today in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaKAs the forests shrink, their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide from industrial lowlands diminishes, which means that more greenhouse gases would be added to the atmosphere, resulting in the acceleration of global warming, the researchers said. LiNeBrEaKWhile no trees are immune from the accelerating death rates, the victims are primarily the conifers whose abundance throughout California's Sierra Nevada makes the mountain forests famed throughout the world. Varied species of pines, firs and hemlocks are most at risk, the scientists said.LiNeBrEaKLeading forest ecologists involvedLiNeBrEaKThe research involved nearly a dozen leading forest ecologists who studied mortality rates of individual trees in 76 plots of unmanaged forests, situated primarily in California, Oregon, Washington and southwestern British Columbia. They also looked at trees in a few interior states: Idaho, Montana, Utah and Arizona.LiNeBrEaKThe increase in death rates for the trees has been "pervasive," said Phillip J. van Mantgem, a forest expert with the U.S. Geological Survey's Western Ecological Research Center in Arcata Humboldt County and a leader of the research team.LiNeBrEaK"If current trends continue, our forests will eventually become sparser, the ages of our trees will decrease by half, and they will be able to sequester less carbon - further speeding up the pace of global warming," van Mantgem said during a teleconference sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.LiNeBrEaKThe most likely cause of the increasing deaths, van Mantgem said, is the widespread rise in average temperatures throughout the study regions over the past three decades - an increase of a full degree Fahrenheit and an amount consistent with the global warming measurements and models reported by the world's experts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. LiNeBrEaKDeath in Yosemite, SequoiaLiNeBrEaKVan Mantgem led his own California team tracking the fates of 20,000 trees in Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks, and found that their death rates had doubled in 25 years. Colleagues did a similar job for the study of old-growth forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. In those forests the deaths were particularly striking among younger and smaller trees, although all ages and sizes were among the dead.LiNeBrEaKA powerful influence on the rising tree mortality rates has been increasingly frequent droughts in the High Sierra, where more rain instead of snow has been recorded in recent years and the snowpack has melted earlier, said Nathan L. Stevenson of the USGS forest ecology center, the co-leader of the research group. LiNeBrEaK"The droughts are lasting longer, and they're helping all those things that like to eat trees," Stevenson said, referring, of course, to all the hungry beetles and their ilk.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists also found that wherever the death rate of the trees has been accelerating, fewer young trees have been replacing them. "Recruitment" is the forest ecologists' term for that succession, and slower recruitment marks another uneasy portent for the future, they warned. LiNeBrEaK "It's like a human population," Stevenson said. "If deaths among older people were doubling fast and fewer young ones were replacing them - well, if you saw this going on in your own family, it's high time you'd be concerned."LiNeBrEaK"The droughts are lasting longer, and they're helping all those things that like to eat trees."LiNeBrEaKNathan L.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	Study: Western forests dying at increasing rate  	By Jeff Barnard Associated Press Writer  	NEWS; National; World; Local  	527 words  	GRANTS PASS, Ore. &raquo; Trees in old growth forests across the West are dying at a small, but increasing rate that scientists conclude is probably caused by longer and hotter summers from a changing climate. LiNeBrEaKWhile not noticeable to someone walking through the forests, the death rate is doubling every 17 to 29 years, according to a 52-year study published in the Friday edition of the journal Science. The trend was apparent in trees of all ages, species, and locations.LiNeBrEaK"If current trends continue, forests will become sparser over time," said lead author Phillip J. van Mantgem of the U.S. Geological Survey's Western Ecological Research Center.LiNeBrEaK"Eventually this will lead to decreasing tree size," he said. "This is important because it indicates future forests might store less carbon than present."LiNeBrEaKOld growth forests, particularly those in the Northwest, store large amounts of carbon, making them a resource in combatting global warming, said Jerry Franklin, a professor of forest ecology at the University of Washington. But as trees die, they decompose and give off carbon dioxide, contributing to the amount of greenhouse gases. Young forests store very little carbon, and it takes hundreds of years to replace old growth, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers considered several other possible causes for the higher death rate -- air pollution, overcrowding of young trees, the effects of logging, large trees falling on small ones, and a lack of forest fires, which keep forests healthy. But the data showed the trend affected trees young and old, in polluted and clean air, in crowded and sparse stands and at different elevations.LiNeBrEaKThe likely cause, they concluded, was warmer average temperature across the West, about 1 degree over the study period, said co-author Nathan L. Stephenson, also of the USGS Western Ecological Research Center. That results in greater stress on the trees from lack of water, leaving them vulnerable to disease and insects.LiNeBrEaKStephenson said the rising death rate could also produce a cascading decline in forests that leads to less habitat for fish and wildlife, an increased risk of wildfires, and a vulnerability to sudden forest die-offs.LiNeBrEaK"If it's a gradual process, we may be fine," said Mark E. Harmon, professor of forest ecology at Oregon State University. "If it is a real sudden process, it could be problematical."LiNeBrEaKBarbara Bond, a professor of forest physiology at Oregon State who was not involved in the study, said it would be wrong to definitively conclude that the rising tree mortality was caused by warmer temperatures.LiNeBrEaK"An enormous amount of additional work would have be done before any rational scientist would draw some cause and effect," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe geological survey paid for the study, which examined data between 1955 and 2007 in 76 research plots in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Colorado and Arizona. The average age of the forests examined was about 450 years, with some as old as 1,000 years. Of the 59,736 trees counted, 11,095 died over the study period.LiNeBrEaKThe death rate increase varied, with the highest in California's Sierras, from about 0. 9 percent in 1980 and rising to about 1. 3 percent.

Cavaliers hope not  	By Steve Luhm The Salt Lake Tribune  	BASKETBALL; Sports; Utah Jazz  	1112 words  	Los Angeles &raquo; One hour before the Cleveland Cavaliers are scheduled to play the Lakers, reporters crowd four-deep around LeBron James in the cramped visitor's locker room at Staples Center.LiNeBrEaKThey shout questions about James' pending duel with the world's other best basketball player, Kobe Bryant.LiNeBrEaKThey ask about the new-and-improved Cavaliers, who just might be good enough this year to win an NBA championship.LiNeBrEaKThey want to know about the Olympics, winning the gold medal in Beijing and if James might feel like doing it again in 2012. LiNeBrEaKThey want to know James' plan for energizing the economy, fighting terrorism and ending global warming.LiNeBrEaKO.K., so nobody asked about the economy, terrorism or the environment.LiNeBrEaKIf the media session had lasted more than 12 minutes, however, somebody probably would have gotten around to it because -- these days -- James is perhaps the most iconic figure in America, not counting the guy who just moved into the White House.LiNeBrEaKAs James preps for the Cavs' annual visit to Energy Solution Arena Saturday night to play the Jazz, everybody wants to know what he thinks, what he does, where he goes and -- of course -- whether he plans to cure the New York Knicks' lingering ills in 2010, when he becomes a free agent.LiNeBrEaKThere will be other suitors, obviously. But the Knicks are the most high-profile and least subtle because, well, they are the Knicks.LiNeBrEaKIn November, new team president Donnie Walsh cleared $27 million in salary cap space for 2010 by trading Zach Randolph, Jamal Crawford and Mardy Collins.LiNeBrEaKAfter the fire-sale, Walsh said the trades were "just the first step" in rebuilding the Knicks and the deals gave him "a year and half" to "see what our options are when we get to that point."LiNeBrEaKWalsh's preferred option?LiNeBrEaKSign King James for an amount slightly less than the gross national product of Finland and then sit back while the magic returns to Madison Square Garden.LiNeBrEaKJames even did his part to fuel the fervor.LiNeBrEaKA few days after the trades, the Cavaliers played in New York. Following Cleveland's 1191-101 victory, LeBron teased the media.LiNeBrEaK"If you guys want to sleep now and don't wake up until July 1, 2010, then go ahead," James said. "It's going to be a big day."LiNeBrEaKIt was all New Yorkers had to hear.LiNeBrEaKJames' words were taken as a promise that he was coming ... as reassurance that all was well ... as a message to NBA commissioner David Stern that the world headquarters of LeBron, Inc. would soon be located just down the block.LiNeBrEaKTwo months later -- in the locker room before Monday's Cavaliers-Lakers game -- James was asked about his plans in 2010.LiNeBrEaK"The question hasn't come up in a long time," LeBron said earlier this week, teasing again. "... The further and further I get away from New York, the question kind of goes away."LiNeBrEaKGood answer.LiNeBrEaKEverybody laughed, except maybe the Cavaliers, who would have preferred an etched-in-stone declaration of career-long devotion to the franchise James has lifted to unimaginable heights in only six seasons.LiNeBrEaKBut if Cleveland coach Mike Brown is worried about ever losing his mega-star, however, it does not show.LiNeBrEaK"People ask me, 'What's going to happen in 2010?'" Brown said. "[But] we're ... building this organization for the long haul, not just so LeBron James stays here. We're building this organization so everybody wants to be a part of it, from custodial workers to secretaries to the [team] president."LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, Brown insists he is not going to worry about it. "A lot of things can happen before 2010. So there's really nothing, in my mind, to talk about," he said.LiNeBrEaKOnetime Jazz point guard Mo Williams was acquired by the Cavs during the offseason to help make James' life in Cleveland a little easier.LiNeBrEaKA talented scorer, Williams' presence means James does not have to produce 40 points every night for the Cavs to win games and, in the long run, compete for a championship.LiNeBrEaK"To be honest, we don't talk about [2010]," Williams said. "It's not a topic of conversation -- not at all."LiNeBrEaKAs far as James' comments in New York, Williams shrugged. "He has to answer those type of questions and that's just LeBron. He gives honest opinions," he said.LiNeBrEaKOne thing about James that everybody does know: He's playing the best basketball of his life.LiNeBrEaKUnstoppable on offense. A stone wall on defense. The best player on one of the best teams in the world.LiNeBrEaKThe MVP, perhaps.LiNeBrEaKSaid Brown: "Obviously, you have to throw Kobe Bryant and Dwyane Wade into that conversation. And Tim Duncan into that conversation. And obviously a maturing Dwight Howard. There are some players that a lot of people would argue about. But me personally, I'm a LeBron James fan. I look at him as being the best player in the league. But I might be a little biased."LiNeBrEaKLaker coach Phil Jackson refuses to get into the MVP debate, but he calls James "... one of the top players who has ever played. The way he's going, he'll be ranked up there in the top five or top 10 players ever in this game."LiNeBrEaKWilliams calls James' abilities "overwhelming. More than I thought. I expected the best and I've got the best and then some. So I'm rolling. I rolling with this circus. I'm definitely having the best time of my life as a professional athlete."LiNeBrEaKAnother teammate, Sasha Pavlovic, has spent five seasons with James.LiNeBrEaK"He's a great guy and that's why he's a great player," Pavlovic said. "He is great with everybody -- off the court and on the court -- and that's why the guys love to play with him ..."LiNeBrEaKThe question now is whether James, an Ohio native, loves Cleveland and playing with his teammates enough to stick around and perhaps lead the Cavs to an NBA championship or two.LiNeBrEaKA question that may not be answered for another year, at least.LiNeBrEaKluhm@sltrib.com The LeBron James FileLiNeBrEaKHometown &raquo; Akron, OhioLiNeBrEaKBorn &raquo; Dec. 30, 1984LiNeBrEaKPosition &raquo; ForwardLiNeBrEaKHeight &raquo; 6-8LiNeBrEaKWeight &raquo; 250LiNeBrEaKHigh School &raquo; St. Vincent-St. MaryLiNeBrEaKCollege &raquo; noneLiNeBrEaKCareer Highlights &raquo; National high school player of the year (2003). . . .

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	Readers' letters  	From Daily News Group readers  	COMMUNITIES; Peninsula; News; Local  	732 words  	Hail big governmentLiNeBrEaKDear Editor: Now more than ever, we need the government to spend some serious money, both to jump-start the economy and to address the many catastrophes left to us by the Bush administration. Two obvious places to start   our national parks need to be refurbished and expanded, and our national network of public transportation, well, we don't have one and we need one if we are ever going to kick our dependence on oil. Both are areas where we have a vital need, and both would create vital jobs right now. And there are very real concrete programs ready to go right now in both areas; all they need is federal dollars.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the lunatic right-wingers in the Republican Party will call this "big government." Well, their opposition to big government was directly responsible for the destruction of New Orleans, and may yet result in the entire coastline being destroyed by global warming. Right now, we need big government more than ever. I just hope President Obama realizes this, and works to fix our federal parks and build our public transportation systems right away. LiNeBrEaKPeter Stone,LiNeBrEaKPalo AltoLiNeBrEaKWake up America, buy AmericanLiNeBrEaKDear Editor: Big business is outsourcing so much that it is hard to find a Made-in-the-U.S.A. label, but some do exist. We should strive to only buy American. Employers should hire Americans first.LiNeBrEaKBill Gates, one of the richest men in America, went to Congress to urge them to allow more B1 visas so he can bring more software engineers into this country at a lower wage than our own software engineers. Those of you who use Microsoft software financially support him while he's laying you off.LiNeBrEaKOur American car companies outsource a lot of the parts they use in their cars while asking for our tax dollars to bail them out of their financial dilemma.LiNeBrEaKEven Hershey candy left Hershey, Pa., and moved to Mexico to make cheaper candy, leaving their faithful employees out of work.LiNeBrEaKA couple of the airlines have all their maintenance and repairs done in foreign companies for cheaper labor.LiNeBrEaKOur state is leading in unemployment, yet our representatives don't approve of e-verify, which has been proven to be 99 percent accurate. Are they afraid that it will show that too many employees are using stolen or fake IDs and employers are not hiring American?LiNeBrEaKWake up America. We are getting what we deserve. See how much money you can save by buying only goods made by American workers.LiNeBrEaKSally Haston,LiNeBrEaKRedwood CityLiNeBrEaKAssessing a home's valueLiNeBrEaKDear Editor: In the Jan. 18 article, "Residents could face new fees for drains," it is mentioned that the prior Burlingame Measure H storm drain tax that failed to pass in 2006 was based on "the age of the building." This is an incorrect definition of assessed value.LiNeBrEaKAssessed value is a function of when a home was acquired by the current owner, not the age of the home. In other words, two homes can have the same age, as well as the same economic market value, but different assessed values depending on when they were purchased by their respective current owners.LiNeBrEaKLorne Abramson,LiNeBrEaKBurlingameLiNeBrEaKNothing to brag aboutLiNeBrEaKDear Editor: I am sick and tired of hearing the outgoing president and his administration boasting about how well they've done in preventing a recurrence of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil since 9/11. Let's face it, one of the basic responsibilities of government is to protect and assure the safety of its citizens. Moreover, the public expects this of their government.LiNeBrEaKWe all know that as members of the work force, we don't go around bragging about how well we're doing in handling our assigned tasks. Real credit or criticism is reserved for job performance that is out of the ordinary, either superlative or deficient.LiNeBrEaKSo when we're repeatedly told what a great job the Republican administration has done in preventing another terrorist attack and keeping America safe, it's time to ask what else have the Republicans done during eight years in the White House. Only braggarts go around telling people what a great job they've done in performing their assigned tasks.LiNeBrEaKTom Wyman,LiNeBrEaKPalo AltoLiNeBrEaKAsk yourselfLiNeBrEaKDear Editor: Three comments on the Gaza war:LiNeBrEaK1) If someone fired a missile a day on us, what would we do?LiNeBrEaK2) Hamas leaders in exile have vowed to fight on to the last civilian and jihadist.LiNeBrEaK3) If your opponent insists on wiping you off the face of the Earth, is there a compromise?LiNeBrEaKGunther Steinberg,LiNeBrEaKPortola Valley	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (91%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (89%); OUTSOURCING (89%); ENGINEERING (87%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); JOB CREATION (75%); RECRUITMENT and HIRING (75%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (74%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (73%); MAINTENANCE and REPAIR (72%); WAGES and SALARIES (70%); COMPUTER ENGINEERING (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (53%); US PRESIDENTS (77%)  	MICROSOFT CORP (53%)  	NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS (53%); SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE (53%)  	PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (55%); BILL GATES (54%)  						MSFT (NASDAQ) (53%)  								
San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	Letters: Littering is a serious issue  	The following letters were written to the Campbell Reporter by Rolling Hills Middle School sixth-graders as a classroom project assigned by their teacher, Dorrie Scamporrino:  	COMMUNITIES; News  	1020 words  	I am going to tell you what I think needs improvement. That would be that people litter too much. For instance, someone could start a car accident when they throw something out the window. It is not safe for the environment either when someone throws trash on the ground when they could just throw it away in the garbage can. If you're thinking, "Well, we are trying to stop it, but people don't follow the rules," here is what you can do to help:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKEnforce the $1,000 fine because if you enforce it may work a little. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKInstead of just making them pay the fine, have them pick up trash on the highway. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWhen someone does litter there is not a police in sight so they think its OK. So you should try to have police looking for that a little better or at least in more places. LiNeBrEaKPlease take this letter into consideration because I know a lot of people do care about this.LiNeBrEaKSarah PalermoLiNeBrEaKConservation can change the worldLiNeBrEaKI am writing to you about conservation of natural resources to help the environment and preserve the Earth for our next generations. As you may know, the planet is slowly losing many of its recourses like the ozone layer. The ozone layer has many deadly holes, which is causing the Earth to warm up faster than ever. As a result, the sun's heat is poking through, hitting areas like the North Pole and Iceland. The polar bears die because they can't even find ice to stand on. They have to swim longer to reach ice. It may not seem like it, but the Earth is slowly dying. I'm sorry if I seem to be taking it out on you because it's not your fault; it's everyone's fault. We drive our cars to places we can easily walk to. Now, I'm not saying we should stop the use of cars, just use them a little less. It may not seem like much, but if everyone tries we can change the world. Here are some of things that can help: recycle, turn off the lights if not needed, drive less, don't waste water, use energy-saving light bulbs, don't hunt endangered animals.LiNeBrEaKParisa KamyabiLiNeBrEaKDrivers should slow down near schoolLiNeBrEaKIn the morning people drive slowly because they know police can make them pay a fine for speeding or crossing a red light. After 1: 30 p.m. they speed and cross the red light. I know this because last week on Monday I was nearly a pancake (or I nearly got ran over by a girl talking on her cell phone with her foot on the dashboard). The same thing happened later that week, only it was Friday. Some guy stopped in the middle of Pollard Road and Quito Road. In fact, he ran a red light!LiNeBrEaKAll I'm trying to say is we need supervision in the afternoon. We need it there before someone really gets hurt. We need cameras or police to supervise that area. I hope you can get this letter because more than 10 people cross there every day, and they can get seriously injured. I know it's rare but it can happen, and the car on Monday that almost ran me over was only stopped about 2 feet away.LiNeBrEaKLoic CiampossinLiNeBrEaKCampbell can be improvedLiNeBrEaKI think Campbell is a great city. Downtown Campbell has many awesome stores, and the Campbell Community Center has fun activities for all ages. However, I think we can improve Campbell.LiNeBrEaKMany middle school students like to earn community service hours. I think it would be great to start a youth community service team. They could easily paint over graffiti, pick up litter and help at downtown festivals, and older students could baby-sit and tutor young kids at the community center.LiNeBrEaKAlso, many kids would love the opportunity to become involved in music. Campbell could start a youth orchestra and chorus. They could perform at the Heritage Theater. This will also build up their music appreciation. This is important because many school music and art programs have been cut.LiNeBrEaKI think these ideas will make Campbell a better city for everyone to live in.LiNeBrEaKIsabella WilcoxLiNeBrEaKCommunity needs to conserveLiNeBrEaKThere are some ideas I have to help make Campbell a better and safer place to live. There should be more people helping students to cross the busy streets in front of the schools. We should plant shrubs and trees that need little water. Communities should get together and discuss how they have been successful in keeping their areas clean and green.LiNeBrEaKPeople should not litter and be more careful in managing the waste. Recycling is very important, and more people should be educated about it.LiNeBrEaKThe entire Campbell community should conserve water and electricity. People should not pollute the air. Campbell should get more parks and recreational centers close to home so people can walk or bike there. That way people don't have to waste gas, and the environment won't get polluted. Everyone should minimize the use of electricity when not required, because it wastes lots of fossil fuel. We should conserve water by taking shorter showers, turning off the water when we brush, and brooming the driveway instead of washing it. We can also take our cars to a car wash instead of washing it by ourselves, because a car wash conserves water. We can save electricity by turning off all the lights before leaving the room and we can install solar panels. People can replace light bulbs with Energy Star lights that save energy. We can stop polluting our environment by walking often or biking to places close by.LiNeBrEaKThese are the things I think that will make Campbell a better and safer city.LiNeBrEaKSneh ChawlaLiNeBrEaKWorking together to solve problemsLiNeBrEaKThe city of Campbell is peaceful but needs help. These issues are the problem, but by working as a community, I believe that we can solve the problems and achieve our goals. The issues are:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKLittering is a problem that takes away the beauty from our city, and when the trash decomposes it lets out toxic gas that hurts the environment. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKSpeeding is very dangerous to the citizens of Campbell (young or old). I believe that police should be patrolling streets like they do on freeways. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWhen high school kids smoke they show a bad example to kids/adults and they cut short their life, and for what? LiNeBrEaKAs I said, I believe we can fix these problems, but will you help bring us back as a community to solve these issues? Please help Campbell achieve these goals.LiNeBrEaKChelsea Elizabeth Skipper	FINES and PENALTIES (90%); TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); MARINE MAMMALS (77%); MAMMALS (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); POLICE FORCES (74%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (66%)  			EARTH (93%) ICELAND (78%)  	January 25, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved  																
San Jose Mercury News (California) 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	Editorial: Obama should reverse Bush on California climate plan andmdash; fast  	Mercury News Editorial  	NEWS; Opinion; Editorials  	265 words  	Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger barely waited until the presidential oath had been given (a second time) before petitioning President Barack Obama to reverse federal opposition to California's monumental effort to combat climate change. Obama, a kindred spirit on the environment, should act quickly on the state's behalf. Indications are he will. LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming deniers in the Bush administration handed California a huge setback last year in rejecting the state's request to restrict carbon dioxide emissions by cars and trucks. Strict emission standards are critical to the state's goal, under AB 32, of rolling back greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level, since motor vehicles are responsible for a sixth of emissions.LiNeBrEaKThat federal action, which the White House forced on the Environmental Protection Agency, contradicted sound science and precedent. EPA staff had unanimously endorsed granting California a waiver to impose stricter emissions than the federal government requires. Six previous administrations had granted states the waivers under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson denied that greenhouse gases posed enough of a threat to trigger action.LiNeBrEaKA new sheriff in Washington should change all of that. Obama and the new EPA head, Lisa Jackson, have said they would consider the waiver, and Obama has proposed emissions reductions similar to California's. He also has reassured governors that he'd view them as partners for clean air.LiNeBrEaKObama has begun rolling back George W. Bush's bad executive decisions. Granting a wavier to California should be high on his list.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	MILITARY ACCUSED OF ATTACK ON 'SAFE ZONE';  30 KILLED 		NEWS; Pg. A2  	598 words  	The Sri Lankan military shelled a hospital and a village inside a government-declared "safe zone" for displaced families Thursday, killing at least 30 civilians, health officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe assault was the deadliest attack on civilians in two years and underscored the rising concern for the hundreds of thousands of war refugees reportedly trapped in the conflict zone as the military closes in on the ethnic Tamil rebels' last stronghold in the northeast. Health officials said at least 67 civilians were killed in shelling since Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe military denied launching the attack on the "safe zone" and accused the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels of carrying out the assault. LiNeBrEaKMEXICOLiNeBrEaKPRESIDENT INAUGURATES MASSIVE WIND FARMLiNeBrEaKMexico inaugurated one of the world's largest wind farm projects - 6,180-acres - Thursday in the town of Ventosa as the nation looks for alternative energy, in part to compensate for falling oil production. Mexico is trying to exploit its rich wind and solar potential after relying almost exclusively on petroleum for decades. With oil production down by 9. 2 percent in 2008, Mexico now is turning to foreign companies to tap its renewable riches.LiNeBrEaK"If we don't do something about this problem of climate change it probably could become - I'm sure it already is - one of the biggest threats to humanity," said President Felipe Calderon at the inaugural ceremony attended by about 1,000 residents.LiNeBrEaK\ WASHINGTON, D.C.LiNeBrEaKCONTRACTOR KBR BLAMED FOR SOLDIER'S DEATH IN IRAQLiNeBrEaKAn Army investigation called the electrocution death of a U.S. soldier in Iraq a "negligent homicide" caused by military contractor KBR Inc. and two of its supervisors, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press. An Army criminal investigator said the manner of death for Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, 24, of Pittsburgh, has been changed from accidental to negligent homicide because the contractor failed to ensure that "qualified electricians and plumbers" worked on the barracks where Maseth died.LiNeBrEaKHeather Browne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based KBR, said in a statement that the company cannot comment on the report because the company has not seen it.LiNeBrEaK\ WASHINGTON, D.C.LiNeBrEaKABORTION OPPONENTS RALLY, MARCH AGAINST ROE V. WADELiNeBrEaKTens of thousands of abortion opponents rallied Thursday on the National Mall to mark the 36th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The rally and march to the Supreme Court came two days after the swearing-in of President Barack Obama, which many demonstrators said emphasized the need to become more vocal with their message.LiNeBrEaKAmong those attending the rally marking the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion was Kirk Kramer of Cottage City, Md. Kramer, a Democrat, supports the president on Iraq but said he was concerned about statements Obama made during the campaign indicating support for the Freedom of Choice Act, which would overrule many state-level restrictions on access to abortion.LiNeBrEaK\ NEW YORKLiNeBrEaKMAN SENTENCED FOR TRYING TO JUMP FROM SKYSCRAPERLiNeBrEaKA former television show host who tried to parachute off the Empire State Building was sentenced Thursday to probation and community service for the stunt.LiNeBrEaKState Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber gave Jeb Corliss three years' probation and 100 hours of community service. He also said Corliss, of Malibu, Calif., could fulfill the probation and community service requirements in his home state.LiNeBrEaKCorliss was arrested when he tried to parachute from the 86th-floor observation deck of the 102-story Manhattan landmark in April 2006.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		January 23, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	A 12-step program to end addiction to phony materialism  	TOM EHRICH  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 019  	597 words  	Like a drunk starting his evening toot, a Chase Bank manager on Park Avenue saw me filling out a deposit slip, offered to help and whisked me into his office.LiNeBrEaKThere, he handed me over to a "business banker" who launched into a practiced pitch for taking out yet another credit card. On the very street where thousands are losing their jobs every day, she apparently figured the lure of more credit would be irresistible.LiNeBrEaKOnce I escaped, I felt the chill of a comparable assault two years ago, when another Chase manager learned that we still owned a house in North Carolina and relentlessly pushed the something-for-nothing virtues of a home equity loan. LiNeBrEaKHow can the financial sector regain public trust as long as their primary business plan is to lure suckers to their own destruction? Predatory lurking around other people's money isn't a plan for growth; it's a moral swamp.LiNeBrEaKIt's the same with other industries. The minute gasoline prices started down, U.S. automakers dusted off ads for gas guzzlers as if global warming, dependence on foreign oil, Japanese hybrids and tanking truck sales were just speed bumps and not fundamental shifts in the automotive universe.LiNeBrEaKYears after Americans lost their appetite for four-bedroom houses in far-flung exurbs, real estate firms kept gambling recklessly on "fields of dreams."LiNeBrEaKNow these industries and others want government bailouts to rescue them from their own bad business decisions. Most will probably get those bailouts because the economy couldn't stand their collapse. But when will their business plans change?LiNeBrEaKDrunks keep cycling downward until they figure out that the nightly path to blotto is insane. So I'd like to propose a new 12-step program called "Deciders Anonymous." It's for the leaders - business, educational, government, religious - who hope that repeating the same old failed plans will work out better next time.LiNeBrEaKThe first step, of course, is to admit we are "powerless" over the very substance that is killing us. In the case of decision-makers, that means easy answers, predatory marketing, greed, subterfuge, and a refusal to accept accountability and to learn from failure.LiNeBrEaKThe next steps entail seeking a "greater power" that can "restore our lives to sanity." Whatever we call that higher power, the point is, we can't save ourselves. The false god we serve needs to be replaced.LiNeBrEaKThen comes a "searching and fearless moral inventory," not impeded by battalions of lawyers throwing smoke. It's followed by admitting the need to make amends and by actually making amends to people we have hurt.LiNeBrEaKThe final steps identify recovery as more than a grand bailout, but rather a determination to live sanely one day at a time, accepting a "spiritual awakening" and not making grandiose plans that won't survive the next temptation.LiNeBrEaKI say this in all sincerity. Many of our leaders are sick. They are addicted to wealth and power and lavish lifestyles. They are lost in a thicket of easy money, non-accountability, entitlement-based education and people-pleasing religion, and enablers whose own business plan is to seek crumbs from the wealthy and powerful.LiNeBrEaKAddiction has made them stupid, and they don't know it. They won't know it until they leave their gated cushions of mutual-affirmation and sit in a circle with other addicts, in an atmosphere of brutal honesty, admit their failings, seek the courage to make amends, and resolve to live sanely in the company of other sanity-seekers.LiNeBrEaKTom Ehrich is a writer, church consultant and Episcopal priest based in New York.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	EPA finds fault with planned coal-fired power plant  	Pioneer Press  	BUSINESS  	250 words  	The Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a permit for the proposed $1. 6 billion Big Stone II coal-fired power plant in South Dakota, and that could spell higher rates for Minnesota customers. LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists who have fought the plant for three years hailed the EPA decision. Coal-fired emissions like carbon dioxide are believed to speed up global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut whether the EPA decision kills the controversial plant was unclear Friday. The EPA told the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources its air quality permit for the Big Stone II plant near Milbank, S.D., was deficient and needed to be resubmitted within 90 days.LiNeBrEaKA three-month delay is insignificant, but if a resubmitted application requires more pollution control equipment, the price tag of the plant could rise and take rates with it, Big Stone II spokesman Dan Sharp said.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA decision means more hearings and testimony for "six to 12 months, minimum," said Bruce Nilles, director of the Washington-based Sierra Club's campaign against all coal plants.LiNeBrEaKThat delay could allow the EPA to enforce new regulations on carbon dioxide, which the Bush Administration did not want but the Obama Administration is promising.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide regulations will raise the cost of coal power but how it will affect Minnesota ratepayers depends on how high they go. About half of Big Stone II's power is slated for use in Minnesota, primarily by customers of Otter Tail Power Co. of Fergus Falls.LiNeBrEaK-- Leslie Brooks Suzukamo	COAL FIRED PLANTS (93%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (92%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (91%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); EMISSIONS (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); COAL INDUSTRY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); AIR QUALITY (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (65%)  	OTTER TAIL CORP (66%)  		MINNESOTA, USA (94%); SOUTH DAKOTA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 25, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (91%); SIERRA CLUB (55%)  	BARACK OBAMA (55%)  						OTTR (NASDAQ) (66%)  								
The Telegraph (Alton, Illinios)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 23, 2009 Friday 	Playing it cool: Edwardsville signs on to Cool Cities campaign  	Jill Moon, The Telegraph, Alton, Ill.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	503 words  	Jan. 23--EDWARDSVILLE -- Mayor Gary Niebur became the second Metro East mayor to sign the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKDave Gocken, a member of the Executive Committee of the Alton-based Piasa Palisades Group of the Sierra Club, thanked Niebur for his continued efforts in Edwardsville to combat global warming and make the city sustainable. Niebur became the 911th U.S. mayor to sign the agreement through the Sierra Club's Cool Cities campaign. Alton Mayor Don Sandidge was the first Metro East mayor to sign the agreement last year. LiNeBrEaK"Until the federal government acts, mayors are spearheading local efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming," Gocken said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Edwardsville is the second Metro East city on board with the campaign, Christine Favilla of the Piasa Palisades Group said Edwardsville is truly the only Metro East city that is substantially growing with new and revived developments.LiNeBrEaKEdwardsville already has done several things to decrease its global footprint, including upgrading traffic signals to highly efficient LED lights; purchasing Energy Star high-efficiency HVAC for renovation of the new public works building; preserving green space and planting trees; purchasing a hybrid vehicle for the Parks Department; and replacing City Hall lighting with more efficient lighting.LiNeBrEaKNiebur already is appointing a Citizens Committee to oversee sustainability and carbon emission reduction efforts.LiNeBrEaKCitizens Committee and Sierra Club member Rachel Tompkins and Carol Gerdt, both with the League of Women Voters, also personally thanked Niebur for signing the Cool Cities agreement.LiNeBrEaK"It's better than being the one-thousandth (to sign)," Niebur joked. "But this is more than signing a piece of paper; it's a renewed commitment."LiNeBrEaKNiebur pointed out that Edwardsville already was a sustainability leader in being the first in the Metro East to have a weekly recycling program and the first to ban open burning and leaf burning.LiNeBrEaK"Those measures were met with resistance but were the right thing to do for the future," he said. "This is a pledge to the public to play an appropriate and positive role in this campaign."LiNeBrEaKNiebur also acknowledged Edwardsville High School student and president of its Environmental Club, Yanyi Luo. Niebur received communication from Luo about the city's goal to become a Cool City.LiNeBrEaK"Dave (Gocken) met with the Edwardsville High School Environmental Club president at the high school, and she wants to be on the committee," Niebur said.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Final Edition	Mexico turns toward alternative energy  	MARK STEVENSON Associated Press  	News; Pg. A6  	274 words  	 CUTLINES Mexico inaugurated one of the world's largest wind farm projects Thursday as the nation looks for alternative energy, in part to compensate for falling oil production. Mexico is trying to exploit its rich wind and solar potential after relying almost exclusively on petroleum for decades. With oil production down by 9. 2 percent in 2008, Mexico now is turning to foreign companies, mainly Spanish, to tap its renewable riches.  LiNeBrEaK"If we don't do something about this problem of climate change it probably could become I'm sure it already is one of the biggest threats to humanity," said President Felipe Calderon at the inaugural ceremony attended by about 1,000 residents, many of whom held on to their cowboy hats on this wind-swept day. The new, $550 million project is in a region so breezy that the main town is named La Ventosa, or "Windy." It's on the narrow isthmus between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, where winds blow at 15 mph to 22 mph, a near-ideal rate for turbines. Spanish energy company Acciona Energia says the 6,180-acre farm should generate 250 megawatts of electricity with 167 turbines, 25 of which are already operating. The rest should be on line by the end of the year, making the project the largest of its kind in Latin America. It will produce enough energy to power a city of 500,000 people, while reducing carbon monoxide emissions by 600,000 metric tons each year, according to the company. But the project hasn't been welcomed by local residents, who say they see few benefits and aren't being paid enough for use of their lands. Several hundred protesters blocked a road leading to the site.

USA TODAY 		January 23, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Tree deaths soar in western USA;  Climate change may be culprit 	Dan Vergano  	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	386 words  	Tree deaths, spurred by global warming, have more than doubled in older forests across Western states, federal scientists reported Thursday.LiNeBrEaKDroughts and pests brought on by warmer temperatures have killed firs, hemlocks, pines and other large trees in particular over the past 30 years without allowing replacements to sprout, the study published in the journal Science finds. LiNeBrEaK"Very likely the mortality rate will continue to rise," says lead author Phillip van Mantgem of the U.S. Geological Survey.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found it "very likely" that average temperatures have increased more than 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past century and probably will rise 3 to 7 degrees in this one. In the American West, temperature increases have led to longer summers, drought and the survival of tree-killing beetles at higher elevations. These beetles are widespread in outbreaks reaching to Alaska.LiNeBrEaKA research team analyzed unmanaged, old-growth forest records at 76 sites across Western states from 1955 to 2006. Tree death rates increased at 87% of the sites. Pacific Northwest forests were hit particularly hard, with death rates doubling in the past 17 years. Forest fires played no role, the study found;  rates were similar across fire-prone and fire-resistant locales.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is not just affecting the ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, it's closer to home," says climate scientist Raymond Bradley of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, who was not part of the study. "Climate changes in mountain regions of the world are occurring at a much faster pace than has generally been recognized."LiNeBrEaKThough some people blame inadequate thinning of older trees by state forest managers, the study makes a "convincing case" that drought and pests are responsible, says entomologist Kenneth Raffa of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.LiNeBrEaKBecause the data do not include recent bark beetle outbreaks in the Rockies, it may understate tree death rates, says study co-author Thomas Veblen of the University of Colorado-Boulder.LiNeBrEaK"Our society needs to discuss policies that will help us adapt to changes well underway," he says, particularly stopping  residential construction near forests decimated by drought and pests. "With continued warming, fire risk is going to continue."

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		January 23, 2009 Friday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Moran says he'd block coal plant if elected  	SCOTT HARPER  	LOCAL; Pg. B3  	521 words  	By Scott Harper and Julian WalkerLiNeBrEaKThe Virginian-PilotLiNeBrEaKGubernatorial candidate Brian Moran said Thursday that, if elected in November, he would block a proposed $6 billion coal-fired power plant in Surry County, citing environmental and health concerns. LiNeBrEaKIt was the second time in as many weeks that the former Alexandria delegate has taken a tough environmental stand. Moran, a Democrat, last week said he would work to stop any oil and gas drilling off the Virginia coast.LiNeBrEaKThe other candidates for governor are taking less strident positions on offshore drilling and on the large power plant proposed by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative near the town of Dendron in Surry County, about an hour west of Norfolk.LiNeBrEaKThe presumptive Republican candidate, Attorney General Bob McDonnell, said he favors construction of the Surry County plant, which would be one of the largest coal-fired stations in Virginia.LiNeBrEaK"It is incredibly irresponsible in this economy to put partisan politics ahead of smart energy policy that creates jobs and provides much needed expansion of electricity generation," McDonnell said in a statement Thursday.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath County, said he believes in a balanced energy portfolio for Virginia and "in keeping all options on the table."LiNeBrEaKTerry McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he would rather see Virginia invest in clean and renewable energies and favors changing state rules to require any new coal-fired plant "to be as clean as possible."LiNeBrEaKJeb Hockman, a spokesman for Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, said he was surprised by Moran's announcement Thursday and wondered whether a Virginia governor could legally block a power plant.LiNeBrEaK"We just wish he would have at least met with us first so we could discuss the project with him," Hockman said.LiNeBrEaKThe cooperative , a nonprofit utility based in Richmond, has filed the first part of its application for a state air-quality permit.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the application, the plant would emit 10,446 tons of carbon monoxide each year, 3,085 tons of nitrogen oxide and 3,685 tons of sulfur dioxide, as well as significant levels of soot, sulfuric-acid mist, mercury and volatile organic compounds - all air pollutants.LiNeBrEaKFly ash, a powdery and potentially toxic residue, would be sold for alternative purposes or buried in a special landfill planned near the power plant, the application says.LiNeBrEaKThe document does not estimate how much carbon dioxide would be produced. Environmentalists said emissions of the greenhouse gas would certainly be much greater than what Virginia Dominion Power projects at its coal-fired plant in Wise County, which is under construction.LiNeBrEaKThat plant also is the subject of legal action from environmental groups. They argue that at a time when the state is grappling with global warming, it should not also approve new projects that exacerbate the problem.LiNeBrEaKScott Harper, (757) 446-2340, scott.harper@pilotonline.comLiNeBrEaKJulian Walker, (804) 697-1564, julian.walker@pilotonline.comLiNeBrEaKanother viewLiNeBrEaKThe presumptive Republican candidate, Attorney General Bob McDonnell, said he favors construction of the energy plant.

The Washington Times 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	America's Arctic responsibility  	By Lisa Murkowski, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	COMMENTARY; A20  	948 words  	It didn't garner a lot of public attention, but the White House recently released an important new policy statement dealing with an area of the world starting to gain the high level attention it deserves - the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKIn a joint National Security Council-Homeland Security Presidential Directive, President Bush called for enhanced security, increased environmental protection, sustainable energy development, international scientific cooperation and greater involvement of indigenous people in the Arctic. Our Arctic Policy was last updated in 1994, but the Arctic is vastly different today than it was 15 years ago. The administration's updated Arctic policy recognizes the United States as an Arctic nation and details new objectives, directives and implementation for this region. LiNeBrEaKWhy all the fuss about a frigid, remote region known to most Americans for Eskimos, polar bears and shifting ice floes? The answer lies in climate change and the fact environmental changes are occurring at an unprecedented rate in this region. The polar ice cap is melting and areas that have never been accessible to energy development and shipping have been opening up during the summer months, leading some to predict that one summer soon the fabled Northwest Passage, connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean, might be a regular shipping route.LiNeBrEaKA more accessible Arctic Ocean will require enhanced environmental protection, navigational and marine safety measures. We must find the balance to allow for reasonable development of the vast natural resources while maintaining strong protections for the environment.LiNeBrEaKMaritime activities relating to the transportation of goods, oil and gas, tourism and research will surely increase as marine access to the Arctic Ocean increases. Marine transportation through an ice-diminished Arctic has the potential to reduce shipping routes by thousands of miles.LiNeBrEaKThe distance through the Northern Sea Route reduces the Hamburg to Yokahama voyage by almost 5,000 miles. Recognizing there will be increased activity in this area represents perhaps the greatest challenge and need for international cooperation. This is action that needs to be taken now, not after a major maritime disaster occurs.LiNeBrEaKThe Arctic, however, isn't just about responsibility - it offers opportunity as well. America's Arctic may hold the key to bringing down the cost of energy in this country and reducing our dependence on unstable foreign sources of energy. Recently, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the Alaskan Arctic might contain more than 30 billion barrels of oil and 221 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in its undiscovered reserves.LiNeBrEaKWhile energy production in the Arctic is vital, we also must not forget about the indigenous people of the Arctic - the Inuit, Inupiat, Athabaskan, Yupik and Saami. The dramatic changes now occurring may have a profound impact on their environment and traditional way of life. Preserving their culture, languages and subsistence lifestyle while Western civilization knocks on their door will be extremely challenging. That is why they must be involved in the political, legal and scientific decisionmaking to ensure that their voice, as the residents of the Arctic, will be heard.LiNeBrEaKWhen Russia planted a flag on the sea floor beneath the North Pole in 2007, thus seeking to claim almost half of the Arctic, it sent a resounding message to the rest of the world. While the United States is working to map our own extended Continental Shelf, we cannot lay claim to our rightful area in the Arctic until we ratify the Convention on the Law of the Sea. Nor can we dispute other claims, such as Russia's or Canada's, that will likely overlap with ours.LiNeBrEaKThis intense interest in claiming Arctic territory is primarily driven by the quest for Arctic resources. Until recently, the resources of the Arctic were deemed too difficult and expensive to develop, but the region is now being explored and developed at an unprecedented rate.LiNeBrEaKThere are some who do not see the point in joining the rest of the world in ratifying the Law of the Sea treaty. But I believe it is important for the United States to be a party to this treaty and be a player in the process, rather than an outsider hoping our interests are not damaged. We are the only maritime nation in the world that has not signed the treaty. Joining the Convention would also give current and future administrations both enhanced credibility and leverage in calling upon other nations to meet Convention responsibilities.LiNeBrEaKThe new Presidential Decision Directive not only significantly improves and updates the U.S. Arctic policy, but sends the right message to the world that the Arctic is important to this nation and we stand ready to work cooperatively with the international community in this region.LiNeBrEaKWhile the race to claim the Arctic continues, the United States must prepare for a melting Arctic and the international implications that brings. Our northern neighbors, Canada and Russia, are continuing to move forward with their claims and development of their offshore energy resources and shipping routes.LiNeBrEaKIf the United States is to be a participant and a leader in this region, it is time to step up to the plate and engage. The updated U.S. Arctic policy gives us a good road map. Congress and the executive branch need to work together to implement this policy and give the Arctic the attention it deserves.LiNeBrEaKLisa Murkowski is a Republican member of the U.S. Senate from Alaska. She is a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and hosted the eighth Conference of Arctic Parliamentarians in Fairbanks, Alaska, in August.

The Washington Times 		January 23, 2009 Friday 	A bad energy 'solution'  	THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	EDITORIALS; A22  	652 words  	The U.S. Climate Action Partnership's recent testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee is proof-positive that the energy companies have turned away from the market-based solutions for which they fought so strenuously the past eight years, and instead now fully embrace government-backed, cap-and-trade solutions. Cap-and-trade is an approach whereby a government or other authority sets a cap on the amount of pollutants that companies or other groups can emit, for which they get credits. If the companies need to exceed the cap and credits they have, they must buy credits from those who pollute less, constituting a trade. LiNeBrEaKDemocrats brought in 13 witnesses from environmental groups and energy companies, all bent on selling their vision for legislation. What they described was a bill that would potentially allow the energy companies to receive billions in taxpayer dollars to research and develop cleaner energy technologies and possibly allow environmental groups to enrich themselves with their involvement in the cap-and-trade system through offsets. This would leave the American taxpayer with higher energy costs passed on to them by the energy industry in the short term - short meaning 10 to 20 years - and receiving virtually nothing in return during that period. "If the United States truly wants to be a world leader, we need real, market-based solutions, not self-serving, window-dressing attempts to get federal expenditures with no real steps forward in environmental reform and sacrifice," noted Sen. Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican.LiNeBrEaKThis latest proposal from the newly formed special-interest cabal also would have Congress establish a system in which greenhouse-gas-emitting companies can also rely on an international system of offsets for their pollutants - like getting away with a little more polluting in exchange for planting trees in South America. This is great for South America but, again, gives nothing to the American taxpayer. The ultimate goal of USCAP, according to the proposal on its Web site, is to form an international greenhouse-gas emissions market for "the post-2012 global framework." International emissions-trading markets have always been problematic for the United States because it costs vastly more to decrease pollution here than it does in most other countries. For instance, if it cost China $2 to eliminate a ton of carbon-dioxide emissions from its energy production, it would likely cost the U.S. or other developed countries almost 10 times that much. Such markets were designed and created to exploit this fact, and it is the principal reason that President Bush rejected the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKEven President Obama has been hesitant on Kyoto. During his campaign, Mr. Obama's position was that he "will build on our domestic commitments by creating a negotiating process that involves a smaller number of countries than the nearly 200 countries in the current Kyoto system." (It is worth recalling that the U.S. Senate, by a 95-0 vote in 1997, passed the Byrd-Hagel Resolution stating the sense of the Senate was that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and timetables for developing nations as well as industrialized nations or "would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States." The Clinton administration never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification.) While it is in one sense admirable that the energy business and environmental groups have shown a willingness to unite on creating Mr. Obama's "green economy," this proposal sounds a lot like giving American taxpayer's' money away, and Congress should slow this process down rather than pass a bill that sounds good: Hey, if energy companies and environmental groups are both for it, it must be good, right? Wrong. It gives away even more of the nation's ever-dwindling store.

The Washington Post 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Met 2 Edition	Moran Vows to Oppose Coal-Fired Power Plant  	Tim Craig; Washington Post Staff Writer  	METRO; Pg. B05  	639 words  	 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Brian Moran vowed Thursday to fight a proposal to build a coal-fired power plant in southern Virginia, breaking with political leaders who have tried to shore up the once-powerful mining industry.LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference near the state Capitol, Moran said the proposed plant in Surry County would contribute to global warming, worsen air quality in Richmond and Hampton Roads, and contribute to nitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake Bay.LiNeBrEaK"The approval of this plant will occur under the watch of Virginia's next governor. I think it is important for Virginians to know where their governor stands on this issue," Moran said. "We should be investing and developing clean sources of energy. We need to harness the energy of wind and solar." LiNeBrEaKWith dozens of coal mines in southwest Virginia, the industry has been a mainstay of the state's economy for generations. Moran said that as governor, he would be reluctant to support coal-fired power plants unless they were equipped with scrubbing technology that is better than what is now available.LiNeBrEaKMoran's announcement suggests that he intends to reach out aggressively to environmentalists. And it comes as he tries to retool his campaign in response to the entry into the race of Terry McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman and a prolific fundraiser. State Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (Bath) is also running in the June 9 Democratic primary.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Moran's campaign finance report showed that he was spending money faster then he was raising it during the July 1 to Dec. 31 reporting period. Meanwhile, McAuliffe reported collecting nearly $1 million.LiNeBrEaKMoran initially was viewed as the establishment Democratic candidate, picking up endorsements from an array of elected officials and business leaders. Now, Moran is positioning himself as an insurgent to appeal to the party's liberal flank.LiNeBrEaKIn the past two weeks, Moran has also come out against drilling for oil off Virginia's coast, and he proposed a mandate that 25 percent of the state's energy needs be met with renewable resources by 2025.LiNeBrEaK"His campaign is starting to take on a definable shape. He spent the last week saying he's the greenest of them all," said longtime Virginia political analyst Robert D. Holsworth. "He is trying to position himself as the grass-roots, progressive alternative to the big-money status quo guy."LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, Moran hired Joe Trippi as a top adviser. Trippi worked on the presidential campaigns of Howard Dean and John Edwards, harnessing the Internet to court liberal activists.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic strategist Dave "Mudcat" Saunders said he considers the three-way Democratic contest in Virginia "anybody's race." He said there is "starting to be a big, big breath of animosity between the supporters" of the three candidates.LiNeBrEaKMoran's position on the Surry plant appears to run contrary to his stand on a coal-fired plant scheduled to be built in Wise County. As a member of the House in 2004, Moran voted to authorize the Wise project. Last year, when environmentalists tried unsuccessfully to derail the Wise plant, Moran was quoted on the blog Raising Kaine as supporting it, remarking that Virginia was the "Saudi Arabia of coal."LiNeBrEaKSome other leading Virginia Democrats -- including Gov. Timothy M. Kaine and U.S. Sens. James Webb and Mark R. Warner -- have said that although it's important to find cleaner ways of burning coal, the state should continue to support its coal industry.LiNeBrEaKDelacey Skinner, a McAuliffe spokeswoman, said McAuliffe, too, wants to invest in renewable energy sources. But Skinner added, "Before we go around shutting down coal plants and losing that economic development opportunity, we need to make sure we have a replacement."LiNeBrEaKPeter Jackson, a Deeds spokesman, said Deeds wants to keep "all options on the table" about future coal plants.

The Washington Post 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Met 2 Edition	CONTINUOUS NEWS UPDATES: VOICES.WASHINGTONPOST.COM/ANNAPOLIS  	Annapolis Digest  	METRO; Pg. B02  	658 words  	 O'Malley to Propose Controls on Greenhouse Gases LiNeBrEaK Gov. Martin O'Malley (D) will call for legislation today to mandate controls on carbon dioxide emissions in Maryland that are believed to contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act of 2009 would require carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced statewide by 25 percent by 2020. About half of the targets could be met through existing environmental laws, including regulations for power-plant emissions and for cleaner-burning cars.LiNeBrEaKThe legislation is weaker than a global warming bill that was proposed last year by advocates and rejected by the legislature. That bill would have mandated a 90 percent reduction by 2050 and included caps on emissions by manufacturers and other industries. LiNeBrEaKTo address the concerns of manufacturing and labor interests, who killed the bill, the governor's legislation will exempt manufacturers until 2016 or later.LiNeBrEaKSupporters hope that by 2016, manufacturers will have come under federal regulation or have joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a consortium of states, including Maryland, working to reduce carbon emissions from power plants and allow them to trade emissions permits.LiNeBrEaK-- Lisa Rein LiNeBrEaKState Police Classified Gay Rights Group as 'Threat' LiNeBrEaKEquality Maryland, the state's largest gay rights group, was among the peaceful protest groups to be classified as terrorists in a Maryland State Police database.LiNeBrEaKThe group was designated a "security threat" by the Homeland Security and Intelligence Division, which also kept dossiers on dozens of activists and at least a dozen groups. Police kept files on Equality Maryland's plans to hold rallies outside the State House in Annapolis to press for legislation reversing the state's ban on same-sex marriage. Police plan to purge the files.LiNeBrEaKThe files were revealed yesterday at a news conference, where a dozen Democratic lawmakers announced plans to introduce legislation to prevent future surveillance of nonviolent groups.LiNeBrEaKPolice would need "reasonable articulated suspicion of actual criminal activity" before they could conduct surveillance, the legislation's sponsors said.LiNeBrEaKGov. Martin O'Malley (D) also plans to call for a similar bill. The measure also would prevent police from keeping files on citizens, unless the information is part of a legitimate criminal investigation.LiNeBrEaK-- Lisa Rein LiNeBrEaKMedevac System Needs No Overhaul, Police Say LiNeBrEaKTop Maryland State Police officials told a Senate committee yesterday that the state's medical evacuation helicopter system does not need comprehensive reform, and formally opposed separating the police fleet's medical mission from its police and homeland security functions.LiNeBrEaKDividing the missions is at the core of proposals to overhaul the system that have been advanced by Sens. John C. Astle (D-Anne Arundel) and E.J. Pipkin (R-Queen Anne's).LiNeBrEaKThe state police operate the country's only public air ambulance system, a fleet of 11 helicopters that are also used in surveillance, air rescue and other homeland security missions. A 12th helicopter crashed in September, killing three rescue workers and a teenage car accident victim being flown to a hospital.LiNeBrEaKThe General Assembly has agreed to replace the fleet's aging helicopters, replacing two aircraft a year for up to $20 million each.LiNeBrEaKMajor A.J. McAndrew, commander of the State Police Aviation Command, told the Senate's budget committee that he supports some proposals by Pipkin and Astle, including seeking a national accreditation that would require increasing the number of medics on helicopters from one to two, and a suggestion to add a second pilot.LiNeBrEaKBut he said new helicopters are needed to upgrade the fleet.LiNeBrEaKHe also cited examples of times when the state police's ability to use their helicopters for multiple missions have saved lives, including a recent rescue of three motorists stranded on River Road in Montgomery after a water main burst and flooded the roadway.LiNeBrEaK-- Rosalind S.

The Washington Post 		January 23, 2009 Friday   Suburban Edition	Study Ties Tree Deaths To Change in Climate  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A08  	752 words  	The death rates of trees in Western U.S. forests have doubled over the past two to three decades, according to a new study spearheaded by the U.S. Geological Survey, driven in large part by higher temperatures and water scarcity linked to climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe findings, being published today in the online journal Science, examined changes in 76 long-term forest plots in three broad regions across the West, and found similar shifts regardless of the areas' elevations, fire histories, dominant species and tree sizes. It is the largest research project ever done on old-growth forests in North America. LiNeBrEaKNathan L. Stephenson, one of the lead authors, said summers are getting longer and hotter in the West, subjecting trees to greater stress from droughts and attacks by insect infestations, factors that contribute to tree die-offs.LiNeBrEaK"It's very likely that mortality rates will continue to rise," said Stephenson, a scientist at the Geological Survey's Western Ecological Research Center, adding that the death of older trees is rapidly exceeding the growth of new ones, akin to a town where the deaths of old people are outpacing the number of babies being born. "If you saw that going on in your home town, you'd be concerned."LiNeBrEaKThe study was conducted by a team of 11 researchers from institutions including the USGS and the Forest Service, the University of British Columbia, the University of Washington, Northern Arizona University, Oregon State University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Pennsylvania State University.LiNeBrEaKThey examined a variety of tree types including pine, fir and hemlock, documenting major die-offs in Northern California, Oregon, Washington and southern British Columbia along with interior Western states such as Colorado and Arizona. In the Pacific Northwest, the researchers found that tree death rates had doubled in just 17 years, compared with 29 years for interior Western forests, but they cautioned against making too much of these differences.LiNeBrEaKThe recent warming in the West "has contributed to widespread hydrologic changes, such as a declining fraction of precipitation falling as snow, declining water snow pack content, earlier spring snowmelt and runoff, and a consequent lengthening of the summer drought," they wrote.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists said it was hard to predict how the changes would transform the Western landscape, although they anticipated that in the future the West will boast sparser forests that cannot store as much carbon as they do now, which could contribute to further warming.LiNeBrEaK"In the end, the forest will tend to equilibrate at a lower level of stored carbon," said Jerry F. Franklin, at the University of Washington's College of Forest Resources, noting that this will occur "over a very long time period."LiNeBrEaKFranklin added that some of the West's most imperiled animal species, such as the marbled murrelet and the northern spotted owl, depend on old-growth trees for critical habitat. "There's a large array of organisms that depend on large trees," he said.LiNeBrEaKThomas T. Veblen, a geography professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said the combination of increased wildfires, drought and bark beetles has devastated some of that state's forests. Temperatures in Colorado's sub-alpine forests, which are 8,500 to 10,000 feet in altitude, have risen markedly over the past 50 years during all seasons, he said.LiNeBrEaKMountain pine bark beetles have killed about 3. 5 million acres of lodgepole pine forests in northwestern Colorado over the past decade, wiping out 90 percent of pine forests in that area, Veblen said. During the same time period, spruce bark beetles also killed large areas of spruce forest in northern and southwestern Colorado.LiNeBrEaK"Our society needs to devise policies that will help us to adapt to the changes that are underway," Veblen said. "This is further evidence that we're seeing continued effects of the warming in increased fire risk."LiNeBrEaKIf current tree mortality rates continue and even accelerate, the paper's authors warned, there is a chance that U.S. forests could shift from being a carbon sink that takes greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to becoming a net emitter of carbon dioxide. Franklin said policymakers should keep that in mind when negotiating a new international climate pact.LiNeBrEaK"One of the things that should absolutely be on the table in terms of any global agreement is the notion of avoided carbon releases," he said, adding that when older trees in a forest are lost, "there's no way you can make up for that."

Beaver County Times (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Solid investments  	Beaver County Times, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	477 words  	Jan. 22--Americans need to start investing in the future, not squandering it.LiNeBrEaKAt the start of a new presidency and, let's hope, a new problem-solving attitude to governance by politicians and the public, the United States is that moment in time. LiNeBrEaKTwo examples that could come before Congress in the coming year illustrate the benefits that short-term sacrifices could have long term on seemingly intractable problems.LiNeBrEaKOne way to reduce health-care costs and improve care is to digitalize Americans' medical records. Five years ago, President Bush announced plans to do that. However, as was so often the case with the Bush White House, the follow-up was weak. The result is that only one in five doctors has converted from paper to electronic record keeping.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama wants to speed up the process. The Associated Press reported his economic stimulus package is expected to contain two year's worth of funding, or about $20 billion.LiNeBrEaKAnother area that would require spending money to save money is energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKThe AP reported a study released by the utility-supported Electric Power Research Institute concluded that improvements in energy efficiency could slow the growth of electricity demand over the next two decades by up to 22 percent.LiNeBrEaKThat would translate into the United States using 5 to 8 percent less electricity by 2030.LiNeBrEaKThe impact of energy efficiency cannot be underestimated. By significantly easing growing demand for electricity, it would reduce the need to build more power plants, especially coal-fired ones. That would help combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe solution won't come cheap, at least in the short term. The news service reported investments in efficiency to get the power savings are expected to cost between $19 billion and $47 billion between now and 2030.LiNeBrEaKMost of the savings would be achieved by new building codes, tougher appliance and lighting standards and a phase-out of less efficient equipment to heat and cool buildings, all of which would require government action.LiNeBrEaKThe same approach needs to be taken for the development of green, renewable sources of energy. The billions that are spent in the next few years could pay enormous monetary and environmental dividends decades from now.LiNeBrEaKAs these three examples show, sometimes you have to spend money to save money. Know this, though. The minor sacrifices we make today will benefit future generations of Americans. It would be worth the investment.

The Boston Globe 		January 22, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	There are more affordable drug options for seniors  		LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. A14  	387 words  	AS A pharmacist and as a senior citizen, I read with interest "Drug costs soar for seniors" (Page A1, Jan. 14).LiNeBrEaKThe article notes that tens of thousands of Massachusetts seniors are facing steep increases in the cost of their prescription drug copayments as a result of an $11 million cut in the state-funded Prescription Advantage program. LiNeBrEaKThese seniors could take advantage of prescription programs offered by a variety of companies. Both Wal-Mart and Target, for example, are selling a month's supply of generic drugs for $4 and a three-month supply for $10. Hannaford supermarket is offering a month's supply for $4 as well, and a three-month supply for $10. 99.LiNeBrEaKCVS and Walgreens, both of which are more accessible, have similar drug programs, although they come with modest annual fees.LiNeBrEaKAll of these companies have a long list of generic drugs that are covered.LiNeBrEaKEven though I have drug coverage as part of my Medicare program, it is cheaper for me to get my generic prescriptions filled at one of these stores and pay out of my own pocket than to use my Medicare coverage.LiNeBrEaKColman M. HermanLiNeBrEaKDorchesterLiNeBrEaKImmigration challenges in a changing worldLiNeBrEaKYOUR JAN. 12 editorial "The rights of jailed immigrants" was excellent except for two things.LiNeBrEaKFirst, you argue that to guard against future abuses, "Congress should pass comprehensive immigration reform." This is, of course, a euphemism for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Are you aware that, because of chain migration and other policies that encourage mass immigration, this would lead to adding an estimated 108 million to the US population over the next 40 years, in addition to the 30 million the country will gain through native increase? And have you thought about the implications for environmental sustainability and quality of life of growing the population by nearly 50 percent?LiNeBrEaKThat brings up your editorial's second problem. You repeat the mantra about a nation "built by and for immigrants," as if tradition should rule policy. However, changing conditions often render tradition obsolete. Our nation's frontier disappeared around 100 years ago, and we haven't figured out how we will obtain sufficient energy for the current population as global warming and geopolitics force us to switch from fossil fuels to renewable resources.LiNeBrEaKDavid C.

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: A step toward a livestock tax?  	Chattanooga Times Free Press, Tenn.  	COMMENTARY  	398 words  	Jan. 22--THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK -- and lots of jokes -- about the prospect of the federal government taxing the "greenhouse gas emissions" of cattle and hogs. The Environmental Protection Agency caused the stir when it mentioned the raising of livestock in a report on regulating emissions that some claim are causing disastrous "global warming." LiNeBrEaKThe EPA soon backpedaled, saying it was not actually proposing a tax on livestock emissions. But a federal rule that went into effect the day that President Barack Obama took office leaves us wondering -- and has some farmers really worried.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA is now requiring livestock farmers to turn in both oral and written estimates of the emissions put out by their animals. Any farmer who fails to comply can be slapped with a fine of up to $25,000 per day.LiNeBrEaKNeedless to say, a few days of such a steep penalty could bankrupt many a small hog or cattle operation. The National Pork Producers Council is so troubled by the rule that it has filed suit in federal court in Washington, D.C. It wants the court to block enforcement of the burdensome new regulation.LiNeBrEaKWe can see why farmers would be upset about this new government encroachment: They undoubtedly want to head off an expensive new livestock emission tax. The American Farm Bureau Federation, using Agriculture Department numbers, determined that if annual greenhouse gas fees were imposed on livestock, they could run $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 for each head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog. The Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation estimated that even modest livestock operations could face fees of $30,000 to $40,000 per year. That would bankrupt some farmers outright.LiNeBrEaKAnd for what purpose? To head off highly questionable predictions about environmental disaster from global warming?LiNeBrEaKThere are far more immediate, verifiable threats to public safety -- such as possible attack by terrorists -- on which the federal government ought to focus.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Climate change is killing Western forests, scientists say  	By Douglas Fischer, Daily Climate  	NEWS  	1076 words  	The death rate of the most stable and resilient forests in western North America has doubled during the past few decades as the climate has warmed, according to new research to be published Friday.LiNeBrEaKThe increased mortality suggests future landscapes will be thinner, sparser and far more susceptible to widespread diebacks.LiNeBrEaKThe new data from a team of 11 scientists provide more evidence that climate change is having a broad and significant impact, independent of other human activities such as logging and development. And while the study focused on Western North America, scientists say the global temperature rise is likely affecting all the world's forests - from the Northern boreal to the Eastern hardwoods to the tropics - to some degree. LiNeBrEaKIn North America, scientists say, the trend is clear: Western forests are becoming more susceptible to wildfire, disease and invaders such as bark beetles. Average tree size is shrinking; creatures dependent on large, old-growth trees will increasingly find themselves out of a home.LiNeBrEaKAnd as temperature and mortality climb, these forests will store less and less carbon - and could potentially flip from being carbon sinks to carbon sources, further speeding global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The important message here is that wherever we looked, mortality rates are increasing," said Nathan Stephenson, a scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Western Ecological Research Center in California and a co-author on the study, published in the journal Science.LiNeBrEaK"It's very likely that mortality rates will continue to rise."LiNeBrEaKThe research tracked growth rates and tree mortality from 1955 to the present in 76 plots of old-growth forest across the West.LiNeBrEaKTree death increased in every plot and every region, at every elevation, in trees of every size and every type, scientists said. And the change is happening fast, with estimated doubling periods ranging from 17 years in the Pacific Northwest to 29 years in the Rocky Mountains. The birth rate for new trees remained unchanged.LiNeBrEaKTemperature alone is driving this decline, researchers found. From the 1970s to 2006, temperatures increased 0. 3 C to 0. 4 C per decade across the region, drying out the snowpack, triggering an earlier spring melt and lengthening the summer dry season.LiNeBrEaK"We do see clear evidence that climate change is resulting in an increase in stand replacement," said Jerry Franklin, a professor of forest resources at the University of Washington and another co-author. "These are what we consider to be our most stable, most resilient stands."LiNeBrEaKThe study's scale allowed researchers to discount other factors: Spreading disease has increasingly afflicted vast swathes of North America's pine and fir forests, but when scientists excluded afflicted patches, the remaining healthy stands saw the same increasing mortality rates.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, another blight for forest health, smog, could be discounted after researchers found the death rate for trees growing in the relatively pure air of Washington's Olympic Peninsula no different from those of trees growing in California's smog-afflicted Sierra Nevada.LiNeBrEaKThe findings, researchers said, have broad implications for land managers and policy makers. For starters, Franklin said, it underscores the need to preserve the remaining stands of old growth forests throughout the West.Old growth stands are "extraordinary carbon stores," Franklin said, sequestering a large mass of carbon in very stable conditions.LiNeBrEaKGreenhouse gas emissions--to say nothing of habitat loss--associated with logging old growth cannot be mitigated by new growth, Franklin said.LiNeBrEaK"One lesson in it for me is ... we probably do not want to get into these forests and mess around. Because we aren't going to help. If anything, we could potentially mess it up," he said.LiNeBrEaKNew regulations will likely be needed, to both help the forest and keep people safe, particularly as fire risk rises, said Thomas Veblen, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado and another co-author.LiNeBrEaK"This is further evidence that we're really seeing continental-scale effects of the warming," he said. "We have to start thinking outside the box in terms of how as a society we adapt to the change that's under way."Land managers say they are getting that message.LiNeBrEaKIn California the Nature Conservancy is calling for the establishment of large protected areas that permit species migration, promoting more resilient ecosystems and sponsoring legislation in Sacramento requiring wildlife corridors as condition for highway development, said Louis Blumberg, director of the organization's California climate change team.LiNeBrEaK"And we're doing science," he said. "We're trying to figure it out, too."LiNeBrEaKBut it is likely this latest data, from one of the largest-ever surveys of North American forests, underestimates the true impact of climate change on forest health.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers did not include any Western forest stands hit by massive trauma that is at least partially linked to climate, such as wildfires or the bark beetle epidemic. LiNeBrEaKBritish Columbia has lost 40 million acres of forest to the bark beetle; Colorado is approaching 2 million acres of dead forest; Wyoming just recently crested the 1-million-acre mark, said Mary Ann Chambers, spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service's Bark Beetle Incident Management Team for the Rocky Mountain region.LiNeBrEaKLast summer the Forest Service closed a quarter of its 120 campgrounds to remove dead trees, and more are dying: The beetle epidemic has recently crested the continental divide, jumping from the predominantly lodgepole pine forest on the Western Slope to a forest of mixed conifers to the east. "The research says if the beetle is in lodgepole, it pretty much stays in lodgepole," Chambers said. "But that isn't the case any more."LiNeBrEaKAll this has an impact, said Kyle Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park, where a popular camping spot will be closed this spring so crews can essentially clear cut the dead trees.LiNeBrEaK"We held on for as long as we could," Patterson said. "There are a lot of people who have been going to that campground for years. They saw the (hills) getting redder and redder. They knew it was coming. It's still very hard to take."The forest is changing," she added. "It's very upsetting to those of us who won't see it regenerate in our lifetimes."LiNeBrEaKDouglas Fischer is editor of DailyClimate.org.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Letters to the Editor  	Montclair letters  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	857 words  	Blame society for Oakland's violenceLiNeBrEaKMost sensible people want downtown Oakland to turn around and become a destination place for everyone who wants to shop, eat out or be entertained. We also want it to become a desirable place in which to reside. Last week an odd and very sad juxtaposition of events illustrated why this remains more fantasy than reality. Thugs with nothing but destruction and mayhem on their minds rioted and destroyed private property in downtown Oakland under the absurd, callous and irredeemably dumb pretext that they were protesting the death of Oscar Grant. And in the same context we see that another condo project downtown is bankrupt. One doesn't need to be particularly clever to connect the two. People with discretion and income are not attracted to downtown, precisely because of the thugs who predominate. The culture of Oakland is so peculiar and sick that what is ordinarily deemed contemptible and savage is somehow countenanced and rationalized by the society as understandable "outrage." Savage deviance is overwhelming the civilized society.LiNeBrEaKAnd you can bet that few people reading this will live long enough to witness the renaissance of downtown Oakland unless a radically different, sensible and courageous leadership emerges from the swamp of ineptitude pervading this place. LiNeBrEaKJonathan C. BreaultLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKState cuts funding to CaldecottLiNeBrEaKWhat reason could not stop, the budget crisis has stopped. A reprieve has been granted from the ridiculous fourth Bore Caldecott Tunnel project that is ill-conceived.LiNeBrEaKFortunately for the Contra Costa County commuters, the project will not affect commute direction traffic with or without the new bore. That is right. A new bore provides no commute improvement   ask Caltrans if you have doubts. The new tunnel will only improve the reverse commute, but it may free up some Caltrans personnel from popping up the cones.LiNeBrEaKMaybe the Contra Costa County citizens who voted to spend money on the Caldecott now have time to reconsider their position. We could take the time to devise a solution that actually improves commuting without increased pollution and global warming, and decreased pedestrian/bicycle safety.LiNeBrEaKTime and thought can be beneficial. If there is to be a fourth bore, then Caltrans should take the time to do it the best they can instead of jamming it through with a poor plan. Let's consider pedestrians and bicyclist, especially the children on their way to and from school. A non-motorized connection to Orinda from College Avenue could be a welcome commute and recreational benefit if done right.LiNeBrEaKRon Bishop, architectLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKBus fare too high for those who need itLiNeBrEaKThe economy is in scrambles around the country, and still, the Alameda-Contra Costa Transportation District has the price of a monthly bus pass for seniors and the disabled at $20. That is too much for both of these groups. They have to make the choice whether to buy a bus pass for a month or food.LiNeBrEaKBoth seniors and the disabled are loyal bus passengers. They use the bus as their only way to go somewhere. Because they are using the bus instead of cars, they are doing their part in fighting global warming in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. So I urge the Alameda-Contra Costa Transportation District to not balance the budget on the backs of these groups.LiNeBrEaKInstead, they should demand that politicians in Washington, D.C., give them more funding so that they can lower the price of the bus pass for seniors and the disabled.LiNeBrEaKBilly TriceLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKVisiting mayor not helping cityLiNeBrEaKIt just gets worse the longer Ron Dellums is our visiting mayor.LiNeBrEaKPolice Chief Wayne Tucker (who prepared so well for the recent riot, and handled the Bailey case and public information with such transparency, to name but two failures) claims, as does police union President Bob Valladon, there's no quid pro quo in the promotion deal.LiNeBrEaKWhat amazing circumstantial timing. And a flock of cows just flew over my house. And just how could those responsible do much worse in handling the tragic BART shooting?LiNeBrEaKThe mayor has brought quite a "model city"   his battle cry ad nauseam   to the citizenry: rich, poor and in between. Add to the equation a city counsel so much more interested in their own little fiefdoms and the slush funds used to maintain their positions and we've got little promise of improvement.LiNeBrEaKNo wonder it's getting easier to find long-time residents abandoning this sinking ship.LiNeBrEaKDavid HornLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKProtests are not the answerLiNeBrEaKI want to address those folks who think it's OK to tear up Oakland, although I doubt many of them read the news.LiNeBrEaKThey wonder why no one wants to hire them, why our city looks like trash in some spots, and why there is nothing to do in the 'Town.LiNeBrEaKThey wonder why people look at us with fear as we walk down the streets, and why some say, "There's no there there" when talking about Oakland.LiNeBrEaKThey accomplished nothing. For all of the peaceful protest and demonstrations, they tore it all down with a brick through the Dress Barn. Why?LiNeBrEaKI wager many of them can't even spell social justice.LiNeBrEaKYeah, I'm mad. I'm mad at the shooting and I'm mad at how they acted in response.LiNeBrEaKAnthony MooreLiNeBrEaKOakland	LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); RIOTS (73%); CONDOMINIUMS (71%); BRIDGES and TUNNELS (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (61%); CYCLING (61%); RESIDENTIAL CO-OWNERSHIP (55%); BUDGET (50%)  			SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  																
Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Scientists say global warming may be killing trees in West twice as fast as usual  	By Hadley Leggett Mercury News  	SCIENCE; Environment; News; National  	500 words  	Trees in old-growth forests of the western United States are dying at twice the usual rate, and scientists say climate change may be to blame.LiNeBrEaKIn one of the largest-ever surveys of U.S. forests, ecologists analyzed data on nearly 60,000 trees in 76 old-growth forests. Set to be published todayin the journal Science, the study reported a startling increase in the past few decades: regardless of type, size or elevation, twice as many trees are dying each year. LiNeBrEaKAnd while death rates have increased, birth rates for new trees have remained stable   meaning there are not enough new trees to replace the old ones. LiNeBrEaKFor now, the percentage of trees dying each year is small, so doubling the rate means an increase of only 1 or 2 percent per year. But over time, small increases can add up, said Dr. Phillip van Mantgem, U.S. Geological Survey researcher and co-leader of the research team.LiNeBrEaK"If current trends continue, forests will become sparser over time," van Mantgem said. "Simple projections of forest stand structure indicate that average tree age will eventually decrease by half, and this will potentially lead to decreasing average tree size."LiNeBrEaKSparser forests provide fewer places for animals to live, van Mantgem said, and also put trees at-risk for sudden die-off from catastrophic incidents such as fire, drought and bark beetle attack. In addition, because large trees absorb significant amounts of carbon dioxide, death of old-growth forests could further exacerbate climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe study analyzed data collected since 1955, from forests across California, the Pacific Northwest and several Rocky Mountain states.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers considered a number of possible causes for rising death rates, including changes in forest density and increased air pollution. But because rising mortality rates were so widespread   found even in areas free of logging and air pollution, for instance   these causes seemed unlikely. Instead, regional climate change emerged as the most likely culprit. In the past few decades, average temperatures rose by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit, which researchers said could have a major affect on tree health.LiNeBrEaK"Rising temperatures have resulted in more of each year's precipitation coming as rain rather than snow," said Nathan Stephenson, a USGS ecologist and co-leader of the study.LiNeBrEaKWith earlier spring melts and less run-off, trees are suffering from longer summer droughts, Stephenson said. In addition, warmer temperatures help insects flourish, such as the bark beetles that feed on trees.LiNeBrEaKTemperatures are indeed in flux. According to a separate study, published this week in Nature by UC Berkeley and other scientists, the hottest day of the year has shifted nearly two days earlier.LiNeBrEaK"This is further evidence that we're really seeing continental-scale effects of the warming," said Thomas Veblen, professor of geography at the University of Colorado. "We have to start thinking outside the box in terms of how as a society we adapt to the change that's under way."

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 22, 2009 Thursday 	VIEWPOINTS: RON MULLIN  	By Ron Mullin  	MY TOWN; Central Contra Costa; Contra Costa; News; Local  	738 words  	It's the Sunday morning before the inauguration of Barack Hussein Obama, and my grandchildren are visiting this weekend.LiNeBrEaKMy 5 month-old granddaughter is lying quietly, even if only for the moment, on our bed. Stretching and yawning she is awakening to the poetic reporting of Charles Osgood on "Sunday Morning."LiNeBrEaKMy 10-year-old granddaughter and her friend, with whom she attended the Chinese Circus in Berkeley the night before, are playing video games. And my almost 3-year-old grandson, sporting his first haircut and wearing nothing else, is racing around the living room pushing his firetruck. LiNeBrEaKAlthough they don't know it, this Tuesday's inauguration marks a turning point in our history which will affect them for the rest of their lives.LiNeBrEaKAmid all the pomp and circumstance, bunting and banners something of much greater substance endures. Besides the obvious historical impact of the election of America's first black president, people are converging in Washington, D.C., to catch a glimpse of the man who represents hope.LiNeBrEaKThere is so little good news anymore   11 million Americans out of work, 46 million Americans without health insurance, the slide of the stock market which has caused the retirement accounts and dreams of millions to evaporate, a huge deficit, two wars and global warming. And that is just the short list.LiNeBrEaKAmerica is in the throes of a tumultuous crisis. On Saturday, as he made his way from Philadelphia to the nation's capital on a historical whistle-stop journey with Joe Biden, Obama noted, "Only a handful of times in our history has a generation been confronted with challenges so vast."LiNeBrEaKOffering the American people a lifeline of hopeful refrain, Obama went on, "While our problems may be new," he assured, "what is required to overcome them is not."LiNeBrEaKLike Abraham Lincoln, he pledges to unify the country and bring government of the people, back to the people. His youthful demeanor and beautiful family inspire a renewed confidence in the American dream.LiNeBrEaKIn his radio address to the nation on the Saturday before his much-anticipated inaugural address, Obama reviewed the themes of what surely will be key points of his address. He emphasized the peaceful transition of power from one administration to another and how it was a model for the world.LiNeBrEaK"All Americans hold within our hands the promise of a new beginning," he said. "Our challenges can be met if we summon the spirit that has sustained our democracy since George Washington took the first oath of office."LiNeBrEaKAnd while that spirit may be of historical importance, the way that it is engendered is clearly very new. Obama and his team have utilized YouTube, the Internet and cell phone text messages in a way never before considered, or even available.LiNeBrEaKI get e-mails from Michelle Obama and messages from the president-elect about inaugural activities and invitations to participate by watching at home. I realize that this is a mass-marketing campaign, but nevertheless, it still makes me feel included.LiNeBrEaKAfter the crowds leave Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, and after the last prayer has been offered, the work of the president and the new administration will begin in earnest. Certainly in my lifetime, never has one man been expected to do so much.LiNeBrEaKI can't help but wonder why anyone would ever want the job, and yet there he is, cool, calm, focused and energetic. If Obama can truly bring the one thing which he promised in his campaign   change   the hope that he has inspired will come to fruition.LiNeBrEaKIn 1961, I was in grammar school and John F. Kennedy in his inaugural address boldly pronounced that, "The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans." I have always remembered his now-famous words, "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." Obama was born that same year, and is of that new generation of Americans.LiNeBrEaKI hope that when my grandchildren are older, that they will be able to look back to this time in history, to Obama and to his legacy and point to the changes in America that contributed to its ongoing greatness.LiNeBrEaKAs the barriers of race, age and gender begin to crumble, President Obama stands in the position of leading this nation and our government to a new place.LiNeBrEaKWhether you voted for him or not   all of us would do well to wish him success.LiNeBrEaKRon Mullin is a Concord resident, and former mayor and member of the Concord City Council.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Nanotech Expert Takes Helm At Berkeley Lab  	By Suzanne Bohan Contra Costa Times  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; Education; News; Local  	429 words  	A scientist renowned for developing a new generation of solar cells with nanotechnology was named Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's interim director on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKPaul Alivisatos, a 21-year lab veteran, takes the spot vacated by Steven Chu, who was sworn in Wednesday as the U.S. Secretary of Energy. LiNeBrEaKWhile a permanent director is sought, Alivisatos pledged to carry on the vision of Chu, who focused the lab's work on energy security and global climate change after he became lab director in 2004. Under Chu's direction, the lab launched programs in biofuels, solar energy, carbon management and battery technology.LiNeBrEaK"Like many others, I have been inspired by Steve Chu's vision of how the work done at Berkeley Lab could overcome some of the most difficult challenges of our time," Alivisatos said in a prepared statement. "I share that vision and welcome the opportunity to lead this great national laboratory at such a historic moment."LiNeBrEaKAlivisatos is in Sweden and was unavailable on Thursday for comment.LiNeBrEaKAlivisatos earned renown as the first to create rod-shaped semiconductor "nanocrystals" which could be stacked to create infinitesimally-small electronic devices of varying shapes. Before that, nanocrystals could only be shaped into spheres. The breakthrough led to the development of a new generation of solar cells, among other advances. Nanotechnology is a branch of engineering dealing with components that measure 1 to 100 nanometers, or a billionth of a meter.LiNeBrEaKAlivisatos was also instrumental in developing the lab's Helios Project for converting solar energy into renewable fuel.LiNeBrEaKUC President Mark Yudof praised Alivisatos' management and organizational skills.LiNeBrEaK"Paul Alivisatos is a pre-eminent scientist with superb leadership and management experience," Yudof said. UC manages the Department of Energy national laboratory, which conducts unclassified research.LiNeBrEaKAlivisatos, who was acting deputy director for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is proposed to receive $406,980 in annual salary, a 14 percent increase above his current salary of $357,000.LiNeBrEaKHe's subject to official confirmation by the UC Board of Regents in early February, although the appointment takes effect immediately.LiNeBrEaKAlivisatos began working at the Berkeley lab in 1988 and is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the E.O. Lawrence Award, the highest scientific prize awarded by the DOE. He holds a Ph.D. in chemical physics from UC Berkeley and a bachelor's in chemistry from the University of Chicago.LiNeBrEaKReach Suzanne Bohan at sbohan@bayareanewsgroup.com or (510) 262-2789.

LiNeBrEaKSalazar was sworn in as interior secretary at a White House ceremony Wednesday morning after resigning as Colorado's senior senator at 5 p.m. Tuesday. He spent his first day meeting with assistant secretaries and senior staff members.LiNeBrEaKHe has promised to assemble a team of marquee names to help him run a department that lords over millions of acres of public lands in the West. And in Strickland, the new interior secretary has picked a wily political operator who knows how to navigate the corridors of Washington.LiNeBrEaKStrickland cited the historic nature of Barack Obama's presidency and the chance to guide major policy shifts in energy and global warming as factors that persuaded him to leave a lucrative private-sector job.LiNeBrEaK"They all play into the decision to switch gears and be part of the team," said Strickland, who is vice president of UnitedHealth Group, a health care conglomerate based in Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKA two-time candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, Strickland oversaw the creation of Great Outdoors Colorado, which distributes state lottery funds for wildlife programs and open space.LiNeBrEaKOnce a partner for one of Denver's most powerful law firms, Strickland said that he didn't represent clients in dealings with the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't have anything to do with the department for years," and the last time he had any direct contact was as a U.S. attorney, Strickland said.LiNeBrEaKStrickland served as U.S. attorney for Colorado from 1999 to 2001.LiNeBrEaKAmong Strickland's duties in his new job will be helping Salazar fulfill his pledge to beef up the ethics of a department plagued by scandals.LiNeBrEaKAn inspector general report last year outlined problems at the Minerals Management Service that included sexual misconduct and illicit gifts from energy companies to Interior employees.LiNeBrEaKIn taking the job, Strickland gives up a multimillion-dollar salary, but it also puts him back in a high-LiNeBrEaKprofile public role, one that will shape the direction of a department on crucial issues, observers sayLiNeBrEaK"The chief of staff really is your bodyguard, your gatekeeper, your eyes and ears across the Interior Department and the administration," said John Howard, the federal environmental executive under former President George W. Bush.LiNeBrEaK"It's a sign that you name someone of this stature to this particular job that you want the office to function well given the challenges ahead," Howard said.LiNeBrEaKSalazar's replacement in the Senate, former Denver Public Schools Superintendent Michael Bennet, will be sworn in as Colorado's junior senator in Washington today.LiNeBrEaKGov.

LiNeBrEaKTheir school, El Paso Harmony Science Academy, is trying to make sure they make it there by raising the money for the May 1-3 trip through donations and sponsorships.LiNeBrEaK"It was too expensive to send everyone, so we selected four students to represent the school team," said Arif Kacanzi, their robotics coach.LiNeBrEaK"This year's theme is 'Climate Connection,' and has to do with global warming."LiNeBrEaKThe students are Janette Mendoza, 13, Andrew Ma drid, 13, Gerardo Garza, 12, and Ariana Castanon Leos, 12.LiNeBrEaK"It is awesome that we are going to Denmark. I can't wait for the competition," Madrid said.LiNeBrEaKMendoza, who also looks forward to the upcoming trip, said "I am really excited to have the opportunity to go to another country to show other people what El Paso can do."LiNeBrEaKLast year, 70 teams from 34 countries qualified to compete for the top prize in the European Open Robotics. Each year, nearly 8,000 robotics teams from around the world compete in the event.LiNeBrEaKBefore qualifying for the meet in Europe, students from Harmony Science Academy competed in other robotics tournaments, including the FLL Robotics Qualifiers Tournament in New Mexico and theLiNeBrEaK2008-2009 Tri-State Championship title in Amarillo, said Guvanch Atamy radov, the school's assistant principal.LiNeBrEaK"The students have been tirelessly pursuing achieve ment in the FLL Robotics arena, and have been highly successful thus far," Atamyradov said.LiNeBrEaKHarmony Science Academy, a state exemplary school, was established as a charter school in 2006, and has about 600 students enrolled in kindergarten through the 10th grade.&Atilde;[#x160]LiNeBrEaKDiana Washington Valdez may be reached at dvaldez@elpasotimes.com; 546-6140.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		January 22, 2009 Thursday   ALL S EDITION	He stays pretty busy being Larry;  Cable Guy brings blue-collar humor to DeVos Hall 		WEEKEND; Pg. 18  	404 words  	GRAND RAPIDS -- To the delight of his fans and the chagrin of his critics, the Larry the Cable Guy juggernaut shows no signs of slowing down.LiNeBrEaKLast year was another big'n for the sleeveless-shirt-wearin', "git 'er done"-sayin' blue-collar comedy icon. Larry, real name Dan Whitney, had a high-rated Christmas special, remained a top-grossing touring comic and scored another modest success with his latest low-budget comedy film, "Witless Protection." LiNeBrEaKThe Oscar nominations are announced today, and Whitney was expecting to be shut out again.LiNeBrEaK"We did it wrong. We should have released 'Witless Protection' to just six or seven theaters and then started the hype on it. Then, once it's got the hype, re-release it in the big cities," he joked. "We didn't do that."LiNeBrEaKThe first half of this year will find Whitney hitting the road -- starting with the questionable logic of touring the Midwest in the dead of winter, requiring him to leave his home in Florida. (When he called for an interview, it was unusually cold there, which Whitney took as sufficient evidence global warming is a hoax.)LiNeBrEaK"That's the best time of year to tour, because nobody likes going to the Midwest in January and February," he said. "So I'll do it. I'll fall on the knife and I'll take it."LiNeBrEaKAfter that, Whitney will take his aw-shucks, good-ol'-boy act across the pond for the first time, where he'll perform in England, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.LiNeBrEaKLater this year, he'll be the subject of a Comedy Central roast, one of the spectacles that are wildly popular when broadcast in all their offensive glory and that acknowledge a comedian has reached the highest levels of success in the business.LiNeBrEaK"It's an honor, first of all, to do it, because you're actually getting accolades for your accomplishments, and everybody likes that, to be recognized by their peers," Whitney said.LiNeBrEaK"I kind of hesitated at first, only in the fact that some of the roasts are just way too dirty for me. I'm not a prude or nothin', but if you're gonna start dropping f-bombs, at least make 'em clever."LiNeBrEaKWhitney said his live show hasn't changed much over the years, and the title of his tour, "Eat, Drink and Be Larry," is pretty arbitrary. Fans know what to expect, and that's what he delivers.LiNeBrEaK"My fans know my show. It's all one-liner-type comedy," he said. "From the minute I get on stage, I don't shut up until I get done. You're laughing at one joke, you're missing another."

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	High-yielding rice crop to be reality soon  	Zia Haq, Hindustan Times, New Delhi  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	393 words  	Jan. 22--NEW DELHI -- India has kicked off an ambitious project to genetically increase the carbohydrate content of rice, thereby increasing its yield -- an initiative being described by scientists as "agriculture's equivalent of the moon mission". LiNeBrEaKThis is a long-term project of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). "It's agriculture's equivalent of putting man on the moon," senior scientist and coordinator of the Rice-Wheat Consortium J.K. Ladha said on Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKRice, by its very nature, belongs to the so-called 'C3 photosynthesis' category that determines its carbohydrate/ biomass content. The aim is to take this up to 'C4', which will increase its grain yield and make it equivalent to maize.LiNeBrEaKIndia has 44 million hectares under rice cultivation. According to government figures, the country produced about 96 million tonnes of rice during 2007-08.  According to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation, rice is the staple for 65 per cent of Indians.LiNeBrEaKThe ICAR on Tuesday signed a landmark agreement with the IRRI, which will support and facilitate India's rice research for the next 3 years, boosting the country's rice production at a time of unprecedented price volatility.LiNeBrEaKClimate solutionsLiNeBrEaKThe collaboration, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will also focus on climate-change solutions for India's rice farmers. Every degree increase in ambient night temperature can reduce rice yields by 10 per cent.LiNeBrEaKLadha said the IRRI has helped put a new gene in the Swarna variety of rice -- extensively grown in eastern India -- to help make it flood-resistant. Climate change results in weather extremes, like drought and floods.The new Swarna variety is being tested in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. "The results are promising," Ladha said. Different rice varieties are also being screened for drought tolerance, he said.

The Houston Chronicle 		January 22, 2009 Thursday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Antarctica is warming, new research asserts;  Earlier studies failed to indicate climate change 	SETH BORENSTEIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	A; Pg. 8  	469 words  	WASHINGTON - Antarctica, the only place that had oddly seemed immune from climate change, is warming after all, according to a new study.LiNeBrEaKFor years, Antarctica was an enigma to scientists who track global warming's effects. Temperatures on much of the continent at the bottom of the world were staying the same or slightly cooling, previous research indicated. LiNeBrEaKThe new study went back further than earlier work and filled in a gap in data with satellite information to find that Antarctica is getting warmer, too, as are other continents.LiNeBrEaKThe findings were published in today's issue of the journal Nature.LiNeBrEaK"Contrarians have sometime grabbed on to this idea that the entire continent of Antarctica is cooling, so how could we be talking about global warming," said study co-author Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. "Now we can say: no, it's not true ... It is not bucking the trend."LiNeBrEaKThe study does not point to man-made climate change as the cause of the Antarctic warming, but a different and smaller study last year did make that connection.LiNeBrEaK"We can't pin it down, but it certainly is consistent with the influence of greenhouse gases," said NASA scientist Drew Shindell, another study co-author. Some of the effects also could be natural variability, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe study showed that Antarctica remains a complicated weather picture, especially with few monitoring stations in its vast interior.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers used satellite data and mathematical formulas to fill in missing information. That made outside scientists queasy about making large conclusions with such sparse information.LiNeBrEaK"This looks like a pretty good analysis, but I have to say I remain somewhat skeptical," Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an e-mail. "It is hard to make data where none exist."LiNeBrEaKStudy lead author Eric Steig, of the University of Washington, said a different and independent study using ice cores drilled in west Antarctica found the same thing as his paper.LiNeBrEaKOther researchers skeptical about the magnitude of global warming overall said the new study didn't match their measurements from satellites and that there appears to be no warming in Antarctica since 1980.LiNeBrEaK"It overstates what they have obtained from their analysis," said Roger Pielke Sr., a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado.LiNeBrEaKA CLOSER LOOKLiNeBrEaKThe research found that since 1957, the annual temperature for the entire continent of Antarctica has warmed by about 1 degree Fahrenheit, but still is 50 degrees below zero:LiNeBrEaKWest Antarctica, which is about 20 degrees warmer than the east, has warmed twice as fast.LiNeBrEaKEast Antarctica, which scientists had long thought to be cooling, is warming slightly when yearly averages are looked at over the past 50 years.

Japan Times (Tokyo)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Congratulatory Aso requests early meeting  	Jun Hongo, Japan Times, Tokyo  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	472 words  	Jan. 22--The government congratulated new U.S. President Barack Obama Wednesday and was quick to request an early meeting with him.LiNeBrEaK"I believe President Obama will exercise outstanding leadership and achieve great success," Prime Minister Taro Aso said in a statement released after the inauguration ceremony, expressing optimism that Obama will address the world's many challenges. LiNeBrEaK"I intend to work hand in hand with President Obama to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance," Aso said.LiNeBrEaKJapan is eager to become one of the first nations, or at least the first Asian country, to meet with the new U.S. administration as a sign that Washington prioritizes bilateral ties with Tokyo.LiNeBrEaKAso may also be eager to become one of the first to meet him in hopes of boosting his slumping approval rate, experts said. But Obama is going to have his hands full dealing with domestic issues, most notably the ailing economy.LiNeBrEaKA Foreign Ministry official in charge of North American affairs said Aso will hopefully be able to meet with Obama before an economic summit scheduled for April in London.LiNeBrEaK"Obama's team is very well commanded and composed. Japan is probably in the first group" of countries Obama will agree to meet with, the Foreign Ministry official said, adding the meeting may take place in Washington before the London conference.LiNeBrEaKObama met with Mexican President Felipe Calderon before his inauguration and has revealed he will soon visit Canada for his first summit with Prime Minister Stephen Harper.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official described Obama's inauguration speech as "unique," telling reporters that Obama is both modest and at the same time able to illustrate his administration's political priorities.LiNeBrEaK"The speech says that the weakened economy is due not only to the greed and irresponsibility of some, but also due to a collective failure to make hard choices. That is a very modest comment," he said.LiNeBrEaKInaugural addressLiNeBrEaKFull text of President Barack Obama's inaugural addressLiNeBrEaKOther highlights of Obama's speech were his pledge to bring peace to Afghanistan and his commitment to harness clean energy, including solar and wind power, to fight global warming, the official said.LiNeBrEaKVice Foreign Minister Mitoji Yabunaka also stated in a news conference earlier this week that deepening ties with Washington is the foundation of Japan's diplomacy, and that it is vital for the two leaders to meet at an early stage.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Non-native lionfish reaches Keys, and industries brace for this 'perfect predator'  	By Cammy Clark, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	881 words  	KEY LARGO, Fla. _ Becky Fowler was shipwreck-diving 66 feet below the surface, exploring a watery paradise, when she came face to face with a 4-inch-long, zebra-striped Cujo of the deep.LiNeBrEaKYes, the dreaded lionfish has made its way to the Florida Keys. Fowler's discovery, confirmed a few days later by divers who captured and dissected the creature, has sent shivers through the Keys' fishing and tourism industries.LiNeBrEaKJust as pythons have disturbed the natural ecosystem of the Everglades, the lionfish could someday become a scourge of the Keys. A Bluto Blutarsky of the water kingdom, it will eat anything it can cram into its mouth _ sea horses, crustaceans and all manner of native fish _ and is a breeding machine. LiNeBrEaKAlso, it stings divers, painfully.LiNeBrEaK"We knew this 'perfect predator' was coming," said Lisa Mitchell, executive director of the Key Largo-based Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF), which responded to Fowler's discovery. "We just didn't know when."LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish is a native of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but was introduced to Atlantic waters 16 years ago. Some blame the ballast of sea-going vessels. Others cite selfish aquarium owners, who dump the fish when they outgrow their tanks.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of the culprit, the lionfish has since caused ecological havoc on fragile Atlantic ecosystems already burdened by overfishing, pollution and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's another huge challenge for the tropical marine ecosystem, on par with habitat degradation and overfishing," said Dave Score, superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. "Lionfish are altering the diversity of an area that has taken hundreds of thousands of years to adapt and evolve."LiNeBrEaKAnd, of course, with the Keys heavily dependent on tourism, diving and recreational and commercial fishing, it is an economic threat as well as an environmental one.LiNeBrEaKTrue, only one fish has been found thus far. But the plague of Everglades Burmese pythons likely began with a single snake. Then a second. Then, a bacchanal of breeding and _ voila _ snakes are devouring alligators whole.LiNeBrEaK"Lionfish are eating their way through the (Atlantic) reefs like a plague of locusts," said Mark Hixon, a coral reef ecology expert at Oregon State University. "This may well become the most devastating marine invasion in history."LiNeBrEaKLong before the South Carolina accountant made her discovery while diving the Benwood shipwreck off Key Largo's Atlantic Coast, the Keys had been bracing for this day. It had created an official response plan and held workshops to educate the public.LiNeBrEaKNow that the fish has arrived, Keys officials will be taking the matter "very seriously," said Scott Zimmerman, executive director of the Florida Keys Commercial Fishermen's Association. The public is asked to report sightings to the REEF office at 305-852-0030.LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish hardly looks like the menace it is. It grows to a maximum of 20 inches long. Because of its exotic features _ the zebra striping and a feathery mane of fins _ it is a favorite for aquarium keepers.LiNeBrEaK"Lionfish are the No. 2 aquarium fish in the U.S., behind clownfish," said Bruce Purdy, owner of Davie, Fla.-based Blackbeard's Cruises, which hosts Bahamas diving excursions.LiNeBrEaKBut the beauty is a beast.LiNeBrEaKThe first documented Atlantic sightings came days after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when six lionfish were spotted in Biscayne Bay and traced to a private aquarium swept away from a Miami waterfront home.LiNeBrEaKIt is believed that lionfish hitched a ride north on the Gulf Stream, up the East Coast, as far as Rhode Island. Other currents and eddies led the lionfish to Bermuda, then to the Bahamas and farther south to the Caribbean as well as Belize. The lionfish was "completing a loop" by reaching the Keys, said Lad Akins, REEF's director of special projects.LiNeBrEaKThey are fearless fish, their bravado bolstered by the poison released by their sharp spines. Cold water appears to be their only real enemy. Otherwise, they thrive at depths ranging from a few inches to 500 feet.LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish's coloring allows it to strike its prey from the protective camouflage of a coral reef.LiNeBrEaKLionfish eat like no other fish in the Atlantic, using their fanned-out fins to block escape by prey. They devour commercial fish, such as grouper and snapper juveniles, as well as those species' food supplies.LiNeBrEaKJust how voracious are they?LiNeBrEaKIn a 2008 University of Oregon State study, the first to quantify the severity of the situation, research teams observed one lionfish gorging on 20 small fish in less than 30 minutes.LiNeBrEaKScientists fear the lionfish will kill off helpful species, such as algae-eating parrotfish, allowing seaweed to overtake reefs.LiNeBrEaKIf the lionfish multiply, Mitchell of REEF offers one possible remedy: Fishermen could start to catch them for commercial sale.LiNeBrEaK"They are delicious," she said. "Kind of like hogfish, but not quite as mild."

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Castro looks well, visiting leader says  	Frances Robles, The Miami Herald  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	567 words  	Jan. 22--The ailing Fidel Castro is looking well and keenly interested in the Barack Obama presidency, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirschner told reporters Wednesday after a surprise visit with a man who had been widely speculated to be on his deathbed.LiNeBrEaKThe Argentine leader, who was on a three-day visit to Cuba, said she met with Castro on Wednesday for about an hour. He was in his trademark jogging suit and said he had watched Obama's inauguration all day Tuesday. LiNeBrEaK"I thought he looked very well," Fernandez told reporters gathered at the Havana airport where she was boarding a flight for Caracas.LiNeBrEaKShe said Castro was impressed with Obama's inauguration ceremony and said he thought the new U.S. president was a "sincere man" with "good ideas."LiNeBrEaKNo new pictures or video of the meeting with Castro were made public. But the announced meeting is significant because it followed more than a week of unconfirmed reports that Castro's health had taken a serious turn for the worse.LiNeBrEaKThe retired dictator stopped writing his regular newspaper column in mid-December, and only one sentence with his signature was published for the Jan. 1 50th anniversary of the triumph of his leftist revolution. Two Latin American presidents came and left the island without meeting with him, and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez stirred speculation further by making bleak comments about Castro being out of public view forever.LiNeBrEaKIt has been months since any new photos of Castro were released.LiNeBrEaKCastro's younger brother, Raul, who took over the island's leadership nearly a year ago, also said the ailing leader is doing fine.LiNeBrEaK"Do you think if he were really gravely ill that I'd be smiling here?" Raul Castro told reporters, according to The Associated Press. "Soon, I'm going to take a trip to Europe. You guys think I could leave here if Fidel were really in grave condition? He is doing his exercises, thinking a lot, reading a lot and helping me," Raul Castro said.LiNeBrEaKFernandez said she and Castro talked about global warming and other international events.LiNeBrEaK"He thinks Obama is sincere in what he is saying and doing," Fernandez told reporters. "He told me he had followed the inauguration of Barack Obama very closely, that he had watched the inauguration on television all day. He had a very good perception of President Obama."LiNeBrEaKRaul Castro also said the new U.S. president "seemed like a good man" and wished him luck.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Protecting our most valuable joint asset -- Earth  	By Peter A. Seligmann  	COMMENTARY  	860 words  	Barack Obama became the 44th U.S. president in a world that is a tinderbox of ever more complex looming threats linked to unprecedented ecological challenges. This makes one of his toughest challenges also his greatest opportunity.LiNeBrEaKThe Earth is being altered so dramatically that it cannot sustain much of the life that has thrived for millennia. Species extinctions today are estimated to be 1,000 times the norm. When our land, rivers and coral reefs can no longer support plants, animals and fish, we humans are also in trouble. People depend on healthy ecosystems for the very fundamentals of survival _ clean air, fresh water, soil regeneration, crop pollination and other resources we often take for granted until they are scarce or gone.LiNeBrEaKJust as the current financial crisis reveals how the world's economies are interconnected, we also must recognize the connections between human well-being and our ecosystems. The global environment, much like our global economy, requires a bold change in how we account for and protect our assets. When we abuse and degrade the natural world, it affects our health, our social stability and our pocketbooks. LiNeBrEaKThe implications are enormous: Some 25 percent of wild marine fisheries are over-exploited, and 50 percent are highly degraded. Tropical deforestation contributes more global greenhouse gas emissions than all the world's cars, trucks, planes and trains combined. An area of rainforest larger than England is destroyed each year. More than a billion people lack access to safe drinking water. In the poorest countries, one in five children dies of a preventable water-related disease. Violent conflict in many countries such as Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo is fueled by mismanagement and corruption tied to natural resource exploitation. Climate change exacerbates the threats that over-consumption, pollution and habitat destruction pose. Recent studies show half of the world's population is headed toward a climate-induced food crisis by the end of this century.LiNeBrEaKYet as daunting as the global environmental crisis has become, it offers tremendous opportunities. President Obama has garnered goodwill among nations that we have not experienced for many years. Now is the time when the United States can help the world, as a global community, harness the clear connections between conservation of nature and international development. They cannot be separated. Too often, the unintended consequence of development projects is the depletion or degradation of natural systems and the multi-generational benefits they provide (food, water, barriers from storms). On an international scale, we must recognize the value of nature and invest to protect it.LiNeBrEaKEcosystem destruction costs our global economy at least $2 trillion every year. That is the value forests provide by storing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, cleansing fresh water supplies, and preventing soil erosion. It includes the value oceans and coral reefs provide in food security for millions who rely on fisheries as their primary source of protein. Overall, global ecosystems services are estimated to be worth as much as $33 trillion a year.LiNeBrEaKIn many developing countries, ecosystem restoration will require careful planning and investment. The results will be jobs and opportunity, pride and community success, more abundant food, clean water, and improved health. By helping restore and protect the natural heritage of developing nations throughout the world, the United States will strengthen the bonds of friendship and trust through collaborations that are by their very nature sustainable.LiNeBrEaKInitiatives to advance natural resource conservation in other countries have typically lacked strong political support and received only a small fraction of total resources dedicated to international engagement. The Obama administration can bring these issues into the mainstream during this critical time of reorienting our national priorities. Obama and his team should fully integrate and fund ecosystem conservation priorities within national security considerations and U.S. foreign policy and development assistance.LiNeBrEaKBringing ecosystem conservation to the forefront of our foreign policy will put our nation and the world on a course of positive change that will benefit all generations to come.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKPeter A.

The New York Times 		January 22, 2009 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Scientists Welcome Administration's Words but Must Wait for Action  	By GARDINER HARRIS and WILLIAM J. BROAD  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; NEWS ANALYSIS; Pg. 23  	1177 words  	When he vowed in his Inaugural Address to ''restore science to its rightful place,'' President Obama signaled an end to eight years of stark tension between science and government. LiNeBrEaK  But many of the Bush administration's restrictions on science, like those governing stem cell research, will take time to be removed. And whether the Obama administration entirely reverses its predecessor's strict controls over the government's main scientific agencies remains to be seen.LiNeBrEaK  Still, many scientists were exuberant. Staff members throughout the government's scientific agencies held inaugural parties on Tuesday, and many reported being teary-eyed with joy. LiNeBrEaK  ''If you look at the science world, you see a lot of happy faces,'' said Frank Press, a former president of the National Academy of Sciences and former science adviser to President Jimmy Carter. ''It's not just getting money. It's his recognition of what science can do to bring this country back in an innovative way.''LiNeBrEaK  On issues like stem cells, climate change, sex education and contraceptives, the Bush administration sought to tame and, in some cases, suppress the findings of many of the government's scientific agencies. Besides discouraging scientific pronouncements that contradicted administration policies, officials insisted on tight control over even routine functions of key agencies. LiNeBrEaK  In early 2004, more than 60 influential scientists, including 20 Nobel laureates, issued a statement claiming that the Bush administration had systematically distorted scientific fact in the service of policy goals on the environment, health, biomedical research and nuclear weaponry.LiNeBrEaK  The administration, it said, had ''misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implications of its policies.''LiNeBrEaK  Just last month, the inspector general of the Interior Department determined that agency officials often interfered with scientific work in order to limit protections for species in danger of extinction.LiNeBrEaK  These are the sort of wounds to scientific integrity that President Obama promised to heal in his Inaugural Address. The quickest-acting balm was the change of tone, delivered instantly in the speech. LiNeBrEaK  ''We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together,'' he said. ''We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.''LiNeBrEaK  It will take more time to do what officials in the Obama administration's transition teams have also promised, to reverse many of the policies scientists found objectionable. Next week, for instance, Mr. Obama is expected to announce an end to President Bush's restrictions on human embryonic stem cell research. But until new rules are written and formalized, laboratories that have received grants to investigate human embryonic stem cells will still have to confine research to lines created before Mr. Bush's order in 2001.LiNeBrEaK  ''In the area of stem cell policy, there was a fair degree of discussion and one might even say tension between the views of the agency and the Bush administration,'' said Dr. Raynard S. Kington, acting director of the National Institutes of Health. LiNeBrEaK  Even though the institutes are ''prepared to respond quickly in how to implement that planned change'' in stem cell policy, Dr. Kington acknowledged that the process was likely to take months.LiNeBrEaK  Obama transition officials said that the new administration would also loosen the  oversight that the Bush administration imposed over federal scientific agencies.LiNeBrEaK  During the Bush administration, for instance, officials at the Food and Drug Administration could not issue even routine press releases without specific approval from supervisors at the Department of Health and Human Services. The result was a backlog that caused some announcements to be issued days after the events in question had already occurred. Some documents advising industry about how to follow some agency rules were never issued. Warning letters to pharmaceutical companies required additional review by agency lawyers, with the result that the number of such letters plunged.LiNeBrEaK  William Hubbard, an associate F.D.A. commissioner who retired in 2005, said top Bush administration officials were so reflexively opposed to nearly all regulations that even when consumer groups, industry associations, scientists and drug agency  officials all agreed that new rules were needed, top officials rejected them. With less stringent oversight, agency  officials will most likely soon issue new rules to prevent contamination of eggs and produce and to tighten the oversight of imports, Mr. Hubbard said.LiNeBrEaK  At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, former Director Julie L. Gerberding e-mailed to agency staff members a 1,600-word farewell on Wednesday afternoon defending her reorganization efforts, which many critics said vastly weakened the agency. LiNeBrEaK  The Obama administration must decide whether unwinding Dr. Gerberding's administrative changes would cause more harm than good. Whatever the answer, the tumult of the multiyear  reorganization will linger for a long time.LiNeBrEaK  At the end of her e-mail message, Dr. Gerberding wrote that she had ''one small request'':  that staff members answer questions like ''What part of your work accomplishments have inspired you the most?'' In a reply copied to the entire staff, William H. Gimson, appointed by Dr. Gerberding to serve as the disease center's chief operating officer, wrote, ''Nicely done -- I will answer your four questions.''LiNeBrEaK  Analysts say the hardest changes will involve new financing priorities, especially in an age of spiraling deficits. But Kei Koizumi, a senior budget analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the stimulus bill going through Congress already bore hopeful signs of an Obama uplift, with new money slated for several science agencies.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's an early indication,'' Mr. Koizumi said, ''that the administration will go for more science funding in priority areas, even at a time of big deficits.''LiNeBrEaK  But with expectations so high, and promises of progress in stubborn areas like alternative energy, Mr. Obama is bound to disappoint. For example, his promise to ''wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its costs'' probably refers to the hopes that electronic medical records will somehow transform health care for the better,  a hope expressed repeatedly by Bush administration officials but which many observers say may be overblown. LiNeBrEaK  And even though Mr. Obama and his staff members have promised to use science to drive policy, scientists say they need to stay vigilant against efforts to allow politics to drive science.LiNeBrEaK  ''Just because we have well-meaning smart people in there now doesn't mean this can't happen again,'' said Francesca Grifo, director of the scientific integrity program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
