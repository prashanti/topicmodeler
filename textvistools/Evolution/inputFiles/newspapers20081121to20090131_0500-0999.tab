He has to decide quickly, before Hamas solidifies itself by taking any credit for Gaza's reconstruction. But how to support a unified government in a place so divided?

Lebedev made millions after the Soviet Union collapsed and the newly born Russia embraced capitalism. He owns a major bank, large chunks of an airline and a newspaper in Moscow. Now he heads to London with a new identity: media baron. Mr. Lebedev is buying a majority stake in The Evening Standard.

While they have yet to determine if the warming is caused by natural climate swings or by the effects of greenhouse gases, they believe that an increase in those gases would lead to a warmer Antarctica.

The chemical is typically used to obscure battlefields, but when used on people it leaves severe burns, above. Under international convention, its intentional use against civilians is banned. The Israeli Army said it had opened an investigation into whether its use of the chemical was proper.

The new memorial is made of concrete and glass and is adjacent to the grave for more than 70,000 people, a legacy of the land's former use. The memorial's function is to offer a view of the Holocaust uncontaminated by sentiment, a hard look at an even harder period of history.

They forgo alcohol, caffeine, sugar, fats, oils and more in an effort to rid the gastrointestinal system of unsavory substances that proponents believe build up and can cause allergies, exhaustion and certain cancers. But many doctors question the legitimacy of the regimens and contend that detoxification does little good and may be harmful.

Barring any new disclosures, we heard nothing disqualifying. He is an intelligent man, and President Obama is entitled to pick his own team. Wall Street is also comfortable with the choice. That is an endorsement that cuts both ways -- but one that could advance the cause of renewed regulation if Mr. Obama lives up to his promises and is a strong champion for reform.

The New York Times 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	How Green Is My Orange?  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1  	976 words  	How much does your morning glass of orange juice contribute to global warming?LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo, which owns the Tropicana brand, decided to try to answer that question. It figured that as public concern grows about the fate of the planet, companies will find themselves under pressure to perform such calculations. Orange juice seemed like a good case study.LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo hired experts to do the math, measuring the emissions from such energy-intensive tasks as running a factory and transporting heavy juice cartons. But it turned out that the biggest single source of emissions was simply growing oranges. Citrus groves use a lot of nitrogen fertilizer, which requires natural gas to make and can turn into a potent greenhouse gas when it is spread on fields. LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo finally came up with a number: the equivalent of 3. 75 pounds of carbon dioxide are emitted to the atmosphere for each half-gallon carton of orange juice. But the company is still debating how to use that information. Should it cite the number in its marketing, and would consumers have a clue what to make of it? LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo's experience is a harbinger of the complexities other companies may face as they come under pressure to calculate their emission of carbon dioxide, a number known as a carbon footprint, and eventually to lower it.LiNeBrEaK  ''The main thing is helping us figure out where the carbon is in the chain,'' said Neil Campbell, president of Tropicana North America, a division of PepsiCo. While acknowledging that protocols for measuring greenhouse emissions are far from perfect, Mr. Campbell said, ''you can end up doing nothing if you let that stop you.''LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo, a manufacturer of soda, salty snacks and cereal based in Purchase, N.Y., is among a growing number of companies that hope to get ahead of potential government mandates and curb their energy use as prices and long-term supply grow less certain. LiNeBrEaK  They also want to promote supposedly low-carbon products to consumers anxious about rising global temperatures; such labeling has already appeared in Europe.LiNeBrEaK  The list of companies that have taken steps to reduce carbon emissions includes I.B.M., Nike, Coca-Cola and BP, the oil giant. Google, Yahoo and Dell are among the companies that have vowed to become ''carbon neutral.''LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo is among the first that will provide consumers with an absolute number for a product's carbon footprint, which many expect to be a  trend. The information will be posted on Tropicana's Web site. The company has not yet decided if it will eventually put it on the package. LiNeBrEaK  While carbon reduction efforts are generally welcomed by environmentalists, some complain that the marketing claims are backed by fuzzy numbers and dubious assumptions.LiNeBrEaK  Standards exist for determining a carbon footprint, but companies can apply them in different ways. They can decide how rigorous they want to be in counting emissions in the supply chain, and what data sources  they should use in the process. LiNeBrEaK  ''Any time people are making a legitimate effort to reduce emissions directly or indirectly with their product and services, most of us would think that is a good thing,'' said Michael Gillenwater, dean of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, a nonprofit organization that teaches greenhouse gas management and accounting.LiNeBrEaK  ''The trick is when you try to put a strict label that has implications for comparing your product to another product, or implying that you have no climate change impact,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Nancy Hirshberg, vice president for natural resources at the yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm, said measuring a carbon footprint is a ''fabulous tool'' for pinpointing areas to reduce emissions. For instance, her company was surprised to learn that milk production was a far bigger contributor to greenhouse gas emissions than its factory.LiNeBrEaK  But she said there were so many variables in determining a carbon footprint that an absolute number was meaningless as a marketing tool.LiNeBrEaK  ''I'm thrilled that people are thinking about their carbon footprint, but to put a number on a package is misleading at best,'' she said.LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo's interest in determining the carbon footprint of its products began in England, where carbon anxiety is further advanced than in the United States. In 2007, Walkers, a PepsiCo brand, published the carbon footprint of its potato chips on its Web site and on the package.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Campbell, who ran the Walkers brand, championed the idea when he came to Tropicana at the beginning of 2008. As was the case with Walkers, Tropicana hired an outside auditor, the Carbon Trust, to review its calculations and certify its footprint. The Carbon Trust was set up by the British government to accelerate progress toward a low-carbon economy.LiNeBrEaK  Making orange juice is relatively straightforward: the oranges are picked by hand, trucked to the plant, squeezed, pasteurized and packed into cartons and shipped by train to distribution points around the country. Early on, company officials roughed out the carbon footprint of Tropicana juice. But when the Carbon Trust came back with its own calculations, that initial estimate was off by more than 20 percent.LiNeBrEaK  Growing the oranges accounted for a larger share -- about a third -- than PepsiCo had expected, almost entirely because of the production and application of fertilizer.LiNeBrEaK  Now, PepsiCo managers said they planned to work with their growers and with researchers at the University of Florida to find ways to grow oranges using less carbon. And they are starting to grapple with ways to teach the public how to interpret the carbon footprint of a product. LiNeBrEaK  PepsiCo is scheduled to announce its Tropicana results on Thursday, and will publish carbon-footprint numbers for products including Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Gatorade. Said Bryan Lembke, a PepsiCo manager on the project: ''If you don't measure it, you can't improve it.''	http://www.nytimes.com  	EMISSIONS (90%); FRUIT and JUICE DRINKS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); ORANGE GROVES (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); TRENDS (77%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (77%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (76%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); CITRUS GROVES (72%); CASE STUDIES (71%); FERTILIZERS (55%)  	PEPSICO INC (90%); COCA-COLA CO (58%); GOOGLE INC (55%)  			FLORIDA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); EUROPE (73%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTOS: Above, oranges are processed at a Tropicana plant in Bradenton, Fla.

The New York Times 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Study Finds New Evidence Of Warming in Antarctica  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 12  	728 words  	Antarctica is warming.LiNeBrEaK  That is the conclusion of scientists analyzing half a century of temperatures on the continent, and the findings may help resolve a climate enigma at the bottom of the planet. LiNeBrEaK  Some regions of Antarctica, particularly the peninsula that stretches toward South America, have warmed rapidly in recent years, contributing to the disintegration of ice shelves and accelerating the sliding of glaciers. But weather stations in other locations, including the one at the South Pole, have recorded a cooling trend. That ran counter to the forecasts of computer climate models, and global warming skeptics have pointed to Antarctica in questioning the reliability of the models.LiNeBrEaK  In the new study, scientists took into account satellite measurements to interpolate temperatures in the vast areas between the sparse weather stations. LiNeBrEaK  ''We now see warming is taking place on all seven of the earth's continents in accord with what models predict as a response to greenhouse gases,'' said Eric J. Steig, a professor of earth and space sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, who is the lead author of a paper to be published Thursday in the journal Nature.LiNeBrEaK  Because the climate record is still short, more work needs to be done to determine how much of the warming results from natural climate swings and how much from the warming effects of carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels, Dr. Steig said.LiNeBrEaK  But Drew T. Shindell of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, who is another author of the paper, said, ''It's extremely difficult to think of any physical way that you could have increasing greenhouse gases not lead to warming at the Antarctic continent.''LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Steig and Dr. Shindell presented the findings at a news conference on Wednesday. They found that from 1957 through 2006, temperatures across Antarctica rose an average of 0. 2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade, comparable to the warming that has been measured globally.LiNeBrEaK  In West Antarctica, where the base of some large ice sheets lies below sea level, the warming was even more pronounced, at 0. 3 degrees  Fahrenheit, though temperatures in this area are still well below freezing and the warming will not have an immediate effect on sea level.LiNeBrEaK  In East Antarctica, where temperatures had been thought to be falling, the researchers found a slight warming over the 50-year period. With the uncertainties, East Antarctica may have indeed been cooling, but the rise in temperatures in the west more than offset the cooling. The average temperature for Antarctica is about minus 58 degrees.LiNeBrEaK  ''There is very convincing evidence in this work of warming over West Antarctica,'' said Andrew Monaghan, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved with the research.LiNeBrEaK  As with earlier studies, the scientists found that more recently, since the late 1970s, temperatures had actually cooled in East Antarctica, a phenomenon that many atmospheric scientists attribute to emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, a family of chemicals used as coolants that destroyed high-altitude ozone. Because those chemicals have since been phased out, the ozone hole is expected to heal, and the cooling trend may reverse.LiNeBrEaK  The region of East Antarctica, which includes the South Pole, is at a much higher elevation and extends farther north than West Antarctica. While the scientists said the ozone hole most likely had a significant influence on Antarctic temperatures, other factors, including sea ice and greenhouse gases, may play a larger role.LiNeBrEaK  ''Obviously the situation is complex, resulting from a combination of man-made factors and natural variability,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences at Princeton, who was not involved in the research. ''But the idea of a long-term cooling is pretty clearly debunked.''LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Monaghan, who had not detected the rapid warming of West Antarctica in an earlier study, said the new study had ''spurred me to take another look at ours -- I've since gone back and included additional records.'' LiNeBrEaK  That reanalysis, which used somewhat different techniques and assumptions, has not yet been published, but he presented his revised findings last month at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.LiNeBrEaK  ''The results I get are very similar to his,'' Dr. Monaghan said.	http://www.nytimes.com  	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); RESEARCH (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (78%); METEOROLOGY (78%); WEATHER (78%); MODELING and SIMULATION (78%); TRENDS (75%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (67%)  		UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (55%)  		SEATTLE, WA, USA (79%) COLORADO, USA (79%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); NEW YORK, USA (79%) ANTARCTICA (94%); SOUTH AMERICA (90%); UNITED STATES (79%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By KENNETH CHANG; Andrew C.

News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Report identifies states most at risk to rising seas  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	839 words  	RALEIGH, N.C. _ A new federal report concludes that Florida and Louisiana are the states most vulnerable to sea-level rise, followed by North Carolina and Texas.LiNeBrEaKThe new report focuses on the coastal states from North Carolina to New York where the rates of sea-level rise are moderately high. The region has extensive coastal development, a high population and is likely to be at increased risk.LiNeBrEaK"You're vulnerable," said Jim Titus, project manager for sea-level rise for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and lead author of the report, "Coastal Sensitivity to Sea Level Rise: A Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region." "The people whose land could be permanently submerged aren't even flooded today." LiNeBrEaKA rise in sea level increases the vulnerability of development in coastal floodplains and diminishes the rate at which low-lying areas drain. It will result in a loss of wetlands in the mid-Atlantic.LiNeBrEaKRising temperatures cause ocean waters to warm and expand, like water heated in a tea kettle. In addition, rising temperatures near the poles cause massive ice sheets to melt, adding to the volume of water.LiNeBrEaKThe report predicts that coastal erosion will occur at higher rates as sea level rises. Particularly in the sandy shore of the mid-Atlantic coast, the report says, it is nearly certain that barrier islands, spits and coastal headlands will erode faster due to sea-level rise. The Outer Banks are particularly vulnerable.LiNeBrEaKThe report, produced by a collaboration among agencies including the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Transportation, offers three scenarios for sea-level rise by 2100: A rise of about 16 inches; of about 2 feet, and of about 3 feet.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, an international scientific panel projected that sea level would likely rise between 7 inches and 2 feet by 2100. Those estimates do not take into account any contribution from rapid changes in ice flow from Antarctica or Greenland.LiNeBrEaKRising sea levels might be especially disastrous to North Carolina, as some sections of the coast are slowly sinking, magnifying the effects of rising seas.LiNeBrEaKTide-gauge readings in the mid-Atlantic indicate that relative sea level rise (the combination of rising waters and sinking land) was generally higher _ by about a foot _ than the global average during the 20th century.LiNeBrEaKIf sea level should rise more than three feet during the 21st century, the report says, "it is likely that some barrier islands in this region will cross a threshold" destabilizing and breaking apart.LiNeBrEaKRob Young, director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University, said the report underscored that sea-level rise is a real management concern.LiNeBrEaK"There is some very important stuff in here that North Carolinians should take seriously," said Young, who said state policymakers and coastal communities should use a 3-foot sea-level rise by 2100 as a target.LiNeBrEaK"Whether sea level is rising is not something scientists argue about it," Young said. "It is. It's different than an argument about whether humans are causing global warming. We have directly measured an acceleration ... over the last two decades."LiNeBrEaKAs sea level rises, the most basic decision that states and beach communities must wrestle with is whether to try to hold back the sea or let nature take its course. Both have costs. Replenishing sand on eroding beaches allows houses and businesses to remain in place for a period of time, but is expensive to maintain. Retreating from the rising sea avoids the costs but concedes a loss of land and, in a worse case, entire communities, the report notes.LiNeBrEaKGreg Rudolph, shore protection officer for Carteret County, N.C., said people generally accept that sea level is rising. But planning for something that is occurring over decades is difficult.LiNeBrEaK"Let's face it, we live on four-year cycles when people are elected," Rudolph said. "Not many people are going to plan out 14 years or 21 years in advance."LiNeBrEaKBeach towns representing about a third of the North Carolina's 325 miles of coastline are seeking to replenish the sand on their beaches. But holding the beach may be an increasingly expensive response if erosion rates increase. "One size does not fit all," Rudolph said.LiNeBrEaKTitus, of EPA, said the report shows it is rational to take into consideration the risk of accelerated sea-level rise.LiNeBrEaK"A reasonable hope is people making decisions will start factoring it in, rather than continuing to assume that sea level is stable," Titus said. "Anyone who is making an investment, a regulation or a policy, has good reason to ask: how does sea level change the outcome of my decision?"LiNeBrEaKVisit The News and Observer online at http://www.newsobserver.com/		COASTAL AREAS (93%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); OCEANS (89%); ISLANDS and REEFS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); FLOOD ZONES (78%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); EROSION (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); WETLANDS (77%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (73%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (55%)  				RALEIGH, NC, USA (91%) NORTH CAROLINA, USA (94%); TEXAS, USA (92%); ATLANTIC OCEAN (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); ANTARCTICA (79%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 News and Observer   	By Wade Rawlins, McClatchy Newspapers  	RALEIGH, N.C.

Omaha World - Herald (Nebraska)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Hold your nose: Sarpy landfill odor solution a year away  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	506 words  	Jan. 22--There's good and bad news for Sarpy County residents suffering the obnoxious stink from their landfill.LiNeBrEaKThree companies submitted proposals to the county this month offering ways to capture the offending gases at little or no cost to taxpayers. However, the solutions would take at least a year to employ, a long time to hold one's nose. LiNeBrEaKOne company would sell the gas to Black Hills Energy, an area provider of natural gas. Another would burn it to make electricity for Omaha Public Power District. The third offered several options, including burning it off, fueling industry or generating power.LiNeBrEaKIn each case, the companies say they would finance the project themselves and make money by earning carbon and renewable energy credits and from selling energy. The county might even share in the revenue, they said.LiNeBrEaKIn asking for the proposals, Sarpy County officials made odor elimination their top priority.LiNeBrEaKCounty Administrator Mark Wayne said a key step will be measuring the quantity and quality of the gas spewing from the landfill. Stinky gas is not necessarily a good fuel to drive an electrical generator or fuel furnaces and water heaters. But finding significant amounts of highly combustible methane would make the projects feasible.LiNeBrEaKFor nearly a year and a half, Sarpy County residents have complained of a rotten-egg smell from the landfill at 156th Street and Platteview Road, aggravating nearby Springfield residents and drifting as far north as Nebraska Highway 370. Such distinctive odor usually is attributed to hydrogen sulfide gas.LiNeBrEaKSarpy County Board member Joni Jones said the county must eliminate the odor if it hopes to create an entertainment district and build a new Triple A baseball stadium near Interstate 80.LiNeBrEaK"We've got to take care of the issues we have before we invite someone into our home," Jones said.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency reports that decomposing garbage is a reliable and renewable fuel option that remains largely untapped at many landfills across the United States.LiNeBrEaKMethane is a very potent greenhouse gas that is a key contributor to global climate change, the agency says.LiNeBrEaKAs of December 2007, the EPA reported approximately 445 landfill gas energy projects in operation across the country.LiNeBrEaKCompanies that destroy methane or generate electricity cleanly can receive carbon and renewable energy credits, which can be used or sold to other businesses to help them meet emission targets.LiNeBrEaKThe companies submitting proposals were SCC Americas of Houston, U.S. Energy Services Inc. of Plymouth, Minn., and Ingenco of Richmond, Va.LiNeBrEaK--Contact the writer: 444-1077, joe.dejka@owh.com		LANDFILLS (93%); COUNTIES (91%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); METHANE (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (88%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (85%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (77%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (76%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (76%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); BIOFUELS (70%); STADIUMS and ARENAS (63%); BASEBALL (63%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%); OMAHA PUBLIC POWER DISTRICT (57%); OMAHA WORLD-HERALD CO (50%)  			RICHMOND, VA, USA (51%) NEBRASKA, USA (92%); MINNESOTA, USA (79%); VIRGINIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Omaha World - Herald   	Joe Dejka, Omaha World-Herald, Neb.

The Oregonian  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Tree death rates up across the West, study says  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	497 words  	Jan. 22--Tree death rates in undisturbed old-growth stands across the West have more than doubled in recent decades, with the highest rate of increase in the Pacific Northwest, a team of researchers will report in the journal Science on Friday. LiNeBrEaKThe report pins increased tree mortality rates on higher temperatures and related increases in drought and summer dry periods.LiNeBrEaKThe change is tiny compared with devastating forest failures in recent years from bark beetles and fires. It amounts to roughly an extra dead tree an acre each year, said Mark Harmon, a co-author of the study and a forest ecology professor at Oregon State University.LiNeBrEaKBut it's unexpectedly widespread, the researchers from Oregon, Washington and other Western states said, hitting conifers from firs to hemlocks to pines of various sizes at all elevations.LiNeBrEaKIt's showing up in pristine stands in national parks and other areas where logging and forest fires have had no effect. And it's not being offset by increased tree establishment, the researchers said, meaning tree size and age could gradually diminish over time if the trend continues.LiNeBrEaKForests could also become more susceptible to abrupt die-backs, the researchers said, diminishing the forests' capacity to act as "carbon sinks" that could offset global warming. Western forests are among the biggest carbon sinks on the globe.LiNeBrEaKScientists have documented increased tree death rates in tropical forests. But the study is the first large-scale analysis of mortality rates in North America's temperate forests, the researchers said.LiNeBrEaKIn the Pacific Northwest and southern British Columbia, the rate of tree death in the older coniferous forests doubled in 17 years, the fastest rate among the areas studied. Mortality rates doubled in 25 years in California and 29 years in interior Western states, the researchers said.LiNeBrEaKThey based their findings on long-term tree inventories at 76 undisturbed sites across the West featuring forests with an average age of about 450 years. The plots contained 58,736 living trees over the study period, of which 11,095 died. Had mortality rates stayed constant, about 5,500 fewer trees would have died, Harmon said.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers ruled out insect attack, fire suppression, overcrowding of forests, air pollution and other potential local causes, instead attributing the increase in tree deaths on a small -- about 1 degree Fahrenheit -- increase in temperatures in the last 30 years.LiNeBrEaKThe temperature increase has reduced snow pack, they said, prolonged summer dry periods and helped insects and tree diseases flourish.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	A more subtle leadership  	COMMENTARY  	836 words  	Barack Obama's inaugural speech answered a nagging question that much of the world has been debating: Is America too washed up to lead?LiNeBrEaKAfter years of Bush unilateralism, and with the U.S. economy in deep trouble, many claim the decline in American influence is unstoppable.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama begs to differ. Yet the vision of U.S. leadership he laid out differs starkly from the style and substance of George W. Bush. LiNeBrEaKThe new president grasps that there is still a hunger abroad for American leadership. That's evident from a 17-nation poll for the BBC World Service released last week, which found 67 percent expressing hope that Obama's election would lead to improved relations with the rest of the world.LiNeBrEaKBut the world wants U.S. leadership that differs from that of the Bush years. Thus the key tenet of Obama's new foreign-policy doctrine is this: We must lead not just with military might, but also with diplomatic alliances and by living up to our democratic values.LiNeBrEaK"Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions," Obama said in his address. "They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.LiNeBrEaK"Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint."LiNeBrEaKOne of Obama's first acts will be to announce the planned closure of the Guantanamo military prison. "We reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals," he said, "... and we will not give them up for expedience's sake."LiNeBrEaKWhat was striking in his address was the absence of any grandiose promises, such as those Bush made in his second inaugural to expand freedom and "end tyranny in our world."LiNeBrEaKObama's approach seems more Kennedy-esque _ a promise to befriend any nation seeking "a future of peace and dignity." He talked of aid to the poor. He promised to work "with old friends and former foes" to lessen the nuclear threat and combat global warming. His pledge to "responsibly leave Iraq" and forge peace in Afghanistan took up only one line.LiNeBrEaKObama also refused to view every foreign problem through the prism of a "war on terrorism." He made a hard-edged pledge to fight those "who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents," and promised, "You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you."LiNeBrEaKBut he specified that the "war" we are fighting is against "a network of violence and hatred." In other words, this struggle is against particular groups, not Islamic civilization.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, he added: "To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect." However, he warned that those leaders who "blame their societies' ills on the West" are "on the wrong side of history." Even after this warning, however, he added "we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist."LiNeBrEaKMany say Obama can't possibly live up to the world's high expectations. Skeptics predict his hopes for smart diplomacy will run into the recalcitrance of Iran.LiNeBrEaKBut his address showed a man in tune with the times. We live today not in the unipolar world of the 1990s, but in a non-polar world. The United States has been bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan, and unwilling to lead on key issues such as global warming. Washington has seemed incapable of leading the way out of the global recession as its own financial crisis worsens and infects others.LiNeBrEaKYet rising powers such as India and China aren't ready to lead on international problems. Europe, united in its economy, is too divided politically to take up that role.LiNeBrEaKThe world seems adrift. In such a power vacuum, extremist groups flourish. People everywhere, including here, feel they have lost control of their future.LiNeBrEaKObama recognizes that the world wants him to lead. He knows that his personal story _ and what it says about America _ give him and his country a new image. He grasps that publics abroad are hoping, even as they doubt, that he can fashion some rescue for the global economy.LiNeBrEaKSo when Obama said "we are ready to lead once more," he was emphasizing leadership with a difference. His global honeymoon may last longer than many expect.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKTrudy Rubin is a columnist and editorial-board member for the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: The Thursday wrap  	COMMENTARY  	297 words  	Jan. 22--No chickens' fools: A plurality of Americans -- 44 percent -- ascribe any climate changes to long-term planetary changes, a new Rasmussen poll finds. That continues a trend toward this commonsensical view. And that means the American people are waking up to the ruse that the liberal (if not socialist) social re-engineering complex is pushing, despite the growing body of evidence debunking its Chicken Little squawkings. LiNeBrEaKIn other news: Perhaps lost in the transition of presidential administrations is word that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review has affirmed the government's constitutional authority to use wiretaps to collect national-security intelligence from foreign sources. And we'll bet -- and we pray -- that President Obama will employ this fully legal tool in pursuit of protecting us.LiNeBrEaKGood grief: Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell is hoping that the Obama administration will bring America an "activist" government that will provide universal health care and a plan to attack global warming. But after the country is bankrupted because of these programs, who does Mr. Rendell think will pay for everything?LiNeBrEaKQuote of the day: From the New York Post -- "Maybe (actor Sean Penn would) ask tougher questions of (Fidel) Castro and (Hugo) Chavez if he didn't have red stars in his eyes."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   SOONER EDITION	IRAN PRESIDENT AILING AGAIN  	WORLD; WORLD BRIEFS; Pg. A-4  	522 words  	CAIRO, Egypt -- Iran's president has canceled all official business for four days because of a cold, Iranian media reported yesterday, raising questions about the hard-line leader's health a few months after he said he was suffering from exhaustion. LiNeBrEaKMahmoud Ahmadinejad scrubbed all official appointments from Tuesday until the end of tomorrow, the newspaper Etemad said. It said a speech the president planned to give Tuesday at Tehran University was delivered by a top adviser, Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi, who said Mr. Ahmadinejad has a cold.LiNeBrEaKThe 53-year-old president said in October that he was suffering from exhaustion, an apparent attempt to combat rumors that he was seriously ill and might not be able to compete for re-election in June. Mr. Ahmadinejad's allies said at the time that the strain of his job had worn him down.LiNeBrEaKCastro likes ObamaLiNeBrEaKHAVANA -- Fidel Castro watched the U.S. inauguration on television and said yesterday that Barack Obama seems "like a man who is absolutely sincere," Argentina's president said after meeting with the ailing Cuban icon.LiNeBrEaK"Fidel believes in Obama," Cristina Fernandez said.LiNeBrEaKThe meeting with Ms. Fernandez, just before she ended a four-day visit to Cuba, dispelled persistent rumors that Mr. Castro, 82, had suffered a stroke or lapsed into a coma in recent days. Ms. Fernandez said Mr. Castro "looked good."LiNeBrEaK"I was with Fidel about an hour or more," she told reporters at the airport as she left. "We were chatting, conversing. He looked good."LiNeBrEaKCivilian deaths claimedLiNeBrEaKKABUL, Afghanistan -- The U.S. military said yesterday it was investigating claims an operation killed two dozen Afghan civilians -- an announcement that seemed aimed at appeasing President Hamid Karzai.LiNeBrEaKBut Afghan officials said a government inquiry found only militants were killed in the Tuesday raid in the Tagab Valley, a region just 30 miles north of the Afghan capital, Kabul where insurgents have a strong presence.LiNeBrEaKActivists target ZimbabweLiNeBrEaKJOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- Activists launched a hunger strike yesterday to demand faster political change in Zimbabwe and urge African leaders to isolate the country's president, Robert Mugabe, who is accused of overseeing its political and economic collapse.LiNeBrEaKMr. Mugabe and opposition factions ended 12 hours of talks Tuesday with no progress on a power-sharing deal signed last year.LiNeBrEaKAntarctica is warmingLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Antarctica, the only place that had oddly seemed immune from climate change, is warming after all, according to a new study.LiNeBrEaKThe study went back further than earlier work and filled in a massive gap in data with satellite information to find that Antarctica, too, is getting warmer, like the Earth's other six continents.LiNeBrEaKThe findings were published in today's issue of the journal Nature.LiNeBrEaKAlso in the worldLiNeBrEaKRussia won't be sending tourists to the international space station after this year because of plans to double the station's crew from three to six people, the head of Russia's space agency said in an interview published yesterday. ?

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   SOUTH EDITION	STUDENTS ASK OBAMA TO FIX ECONOMY, END WAR -- AND MANDATE FEWER TESTS  	METRO; Pg. S-1  	494 words  	"Dear Mr. President, do you think you could find a way to stop the war in Iraq, repair the economy, save the environment and provide more food for poor people?" LiNeBrEaKThose were just a few of the requests made by students in the Mt. Lebanon School District whose comments are part of a video letter to the president that will be posted on the district's Web site and, they hope, forwarded to Mr. Obama, who took office Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe students, from Lincoln Elementary, Jefferson Middle School and Mt. Lebanon High School, recently had their comments recorded by the district's multimedia staffers, Brad May and Mona Rice.LiNeBrEaKThe project was the brainchild of Superintendent John Allison, who thought it would be interesting to hear what was on the students' minds as the new president took office. Mr. Allison also hoped the project would inspire some students who might not otherwise think about national issues.LiNeBrEaKIn the 15-minute video, it's apparent the war in Iraq was on the minds of students from elementary grades through high school.LiNeBrEaKThird-grader James Wang, who said he was concerned about the war and the environment, told Mr. Obama, "Stopping the war and planting more trees would put a smile on my face."LiNeBrEaKSeveral students, including John Linderfjeld, a sophomore, talked about the poor economy and how it has affected their family and friends who have suffered job losses.LiNeBrEaKAlong with the economy, the escalating price of college was a big concern for the high school and middle school students who voiced opinions.LiNeBrEaKHigh school student Albert Li asked Mr. Obama for "a reduction in college fees." His classmates talked about working hard to get into good schools only to find that their families may not be able to afford them.LiNeBrEaK"The price of college is getting to the point where it is way too high for most families," said Danielle Nathanson, a high school student and editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, The Devil's Advocate.LiNeBrEaKDanielle also told Mr. Obama it's her hope that the Environmental Protection Agency will be strengthened under his tenure. Third-grader James Wang chimed in on this sentiment saying he was concerned about the number of cars on the road and how that contributed to global warming.LiNeBrEaKTo which James' buddy, Tesoro Fedel, a second-grader, responded: "Global warming is hurting our polar bears and penguins."LiNeBrEaKA student who didn't give his name told Mr. Obama that he was once a foster child, but was adopted at age 5. It's his hope that the president will give some attention to the issue of adoption of foster children.LiNeBrEaKOn the lighter side, Jefferson Middle School student Patrick Quirk asked Mr. Obama to consider education reform that called for fewer tests, and James Wang asked the president to make the Chinese New Year a national holiday.LiNeBrEaKAnd, high school student Anthony Kuzma asked the new president if in between handling big issues like the economy and the war in Iraq, he could find a way to create a championship series for college football.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Hope for change we can look at  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	846 words  	BARACK OBAMA spilled the beans at a campaign rally last March 21, in Salem, Ore.:  I can tell you that when I was young I wanted to be an architect, but, um, I . . . [shout from offstage] . . . That was good! Architect of change! I like that! LiNeBrEaKIf only Obama had not been interrupted by that blockhead, we might know what sort of architect he would have been. Maybe, if we are really lucky and Obama really is smart, we can have not only change we can believe in but change we can see. LiNeBrEaKToday, many Americans are dissatisfied with their built environment. Obama must try to change architecture from the modernism of the past half a century to a new traditionalism for the future. Is he likely to do so? The tea leaves give us few clues.LiNeBrEaKOn the one hand, given the chance to frame the backdrop of his acceptance speech in Denver last August, Obama chose a classical stage set. He took some ribbing for its supposed pomposity, and classicists furrowed their brows at the colonnade s prefab clunkiness. But the set contributed to the exaltation of what was then the apogee of his career.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, in 2004, when the Obamas wanted to upgrade from a condo to a house, he and Michelle bought a Georgian Revival built in 1910. It was located by his wife, who was a member of the board of the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, Obama once attended a lecture (or so claims the lecturer) by Daniel Libeskind, a modernist known for buildings that look like they are about to fall down. If Obama did attend a Libeskind lecture, maybe it was just for laughs.LiNeBrEaKLet us hope so. Since Thomas Jefferson designed Monticello, the Virginia State Capitol at Richmond and the original buildings of the University of Virginia, no president but Franklin Roosevelt has shown much interest in architecture aside from the occasional monument or federal building. FDR designed a modest hideaway on his Hyde Park estate called Top Cottage in 1939, and several buildings in Dutchess County, N.Y., and Warm Springs, Ga. Other than Jefferson, FDR is the only U.S. president known to have designed a house of his own.LiNeBrEaKOne of FDR s most enduring legacies has to do with architecture. Among the more notable of his New Deal agencies, the Works Progress Administration, or WPA, designed thousands of post offices, bridges and other structures in traditional styles that ignored the emerging craze for the International Style (early modernism). Many of them survive today because of the intrinsic structural and aesthetic merits of traditional over modern architecture. Its merits represent a sustainability whose resurrection would be much more effective at addressing climate change than the high-tech  gizmo green  fad that is favored by the architecture profession.LiNeBrEaKThe federal government was the last major institution of American society to shift from traditional to modern architecture. Corporate, collegiate and institutional America went first. While the classicism of the Lincoln Memorial (1922) was uncontroversial, that of the Jefferson Memorial (1941) was attacked by modernists then on the rise in the profession. The last major federal buildings of classical style were erected by FDR during the 1930s. Tuesday s inaugural parade passed them on the way up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.LiNeBrEaKThe presidential motorcade also passed the first major federal building built in a classical style since then: the Ronald Reagan Building (1998). In fact, the grace of Pennsylvania Avenue arises from the City Beautiful movement, launched by the 1893 World s Columbian Exposition in Obama s own Chicago.LiNeBrEaKThe worst building on Pennsylvania is the J. Edgar Hoover Building, FBI headquarters, designed in a Brutalist style similar to that of Boston City Hall. If Obama has the eye of an aesthete, as anyone who claims he originally wanted to be an architect surely must, he probably turned his eye from the FBI building to the Department of Justice (1935), a classical building right across the street. If Obama wants to doff his cap to FDR, let him revive New Deal classicism. That would not only create many thousands of jobs, but a physical symbol of the Obama administration to which the public could easily relate.LiNeBrEaKThree blocks north of the White House is K Street, Lobbyists Row, the worst concentration of modern architecture in the nation s capital. Part of Obama s agenda is to push America s body politic away from K Street toward Pennsylvania Avenue. Using architecture to tell the good guys from the bad guys might help him surmount the predictable resistance.LiNeBrEaKIt is possible that change of great magnitude will want an aesthetic component. It might need a symbolism capable of representing its spirit to the public. Jefferson understood the importance of having an architecture that reflects the nation s aspirations. Obama should embrace his inner architect by initiating a national conversation about architecture. If he does, he will do far more for his country than he could ever have done as an architect.LiNeBrEaKDavid Brussat is a member of The Journal s editorial board ( dbrussat@projo.com).

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	March of the happy feet  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 6  	221 words  	You d think that penguinologists would be dancing after President Bush s decision, before leaving office, to list seven penguin species as threatened or endangered. But because three other species did not make the list, the news has not pleased some from the coldest branch of ornithology or the warmest branch of climatology. LiNeBrEaKAs great fans of penguins, we are happy to see greater protection for the seven species selected. We are not overly concerned for those left out in the cold   including the emperor, the largest of the species, and the star of the movies March of the Penguins and Happy Feet.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the Endangered Species Act, contends that data, including climate data regarding penguins  icy habitat (read: the effects of global warming) do not support their listing.LiNeBrEaKSome seek to expand the list of endangered species primarily because a longer list lengthens the regulatory odds against U.S. industry and development, not only in America but elsewhere. There are, of course, no penguins native to the U.S., but the list is international.LiNeBrEaKTo the extent that some penguins are not as endangered as Hollywood and others contend, all the better for them, and for the species that too often puts them in jeopardy.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the penguinological data will be rechecked this year.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   All Editions	A different kind of presidency  	OPINION; Pg. A11  	732 words  	PRESIDENT Obama's inauguration speech was not all that lyrical or rousing. That wasn't his purpose. The historic ceremony itself was emotional and moving enough, bringing people all over the world to tears.LiNeBrEaKWhat Obama wanted to do in his first act as president, when he had the undivided, rapt attention of the nation and the world, was to distance himself as completely as he could from his predecessor. Obviously, because George W. Bush was sitting only a few feet away, the new president had to be polite and diplomatic.LiNeBrEaKBut he wanted to make it as clear as he could that his presidency will be different, that this nation's relationship to its own people and to the people of all other nations will be dramatically different. LiNeBrEaKObama had only about 20 minutes to send that message. He spoke rather quickly, and it was easy to miss the meaning of a lot of what he said.LiNeBrEaKBut if you take the time to read the speech slowly, you will see what a powerful and precise piece of work it is. It isn't eloquent the way poetry is when read aloud, and it isn't eloquent in the way some of Obama's earlier campaign speeches have been.LiNeBrEaKInstead, the wording is economical, almost shorthand. But it speaks volumes about the Bush presidency and its signature policies, and dismisses them, in the blink of an eye.LiNeBrEaKHere are just three examples.LiNeBrEaK"We will restore science to its rightful place..."LiNeBrEaKThe phrase consists of only eight words, but it conjures up a whole host of references to Bush policies, from the rejection of the Kyoto Protocol and the long refusal to acknowledge the threat of global warming to the rewriting of findings by respected scientists to play down the effects of greenhouse gases and the hostility toward more fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKIt brings back memories of the controversy over evolution and Bush's endorsement of the teaching of intelligent design in the nation's classrooms ? which is just another way of trying to teach religion, not science, in the public schools.LiNeBrEaK"?a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous."LiNeBrEaKA book could be written about this statement alone. Bush's eight years in office included the further decline of some of our most troubled cities, an increase in poverty in the United States and in the ranks of the uninsured, a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, tax cuts that favored the rich, stagnation of the middle class, disdain for government programs such as Head Start and children's health insurance ? and of course, the response to Hurricane Katrina and the poor of New Orleans.LiNeBrEaKThe most vulnerable among us became even more invisible during the Bush years. Now they have been reassured that the new president hears their concerns.LiNeBrEaK"... our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please."LiNeBrEaKThis can only be a direct reference to the visage that the Bush administration has generally presented to the rest of the world, one of arrogance, suspicion and isolation, at times almost indifference. It was that attitude that governed the run-up to the Iraq war, the rejection of treaties that the United States had been committed to and our overall relationship with the United Nations.LiNeBrEaKCooperation with other nations, including our allies, and taking our place at the world's table was often seen as weakness, not strength. Saber-rattling was often preferred to diplomacy.LiNeBrEaKBut that cowboy image vanished instantly with Obama's speech, which reiterated our strength and leadership in the world but also spoke of the power of "sturdy alliances and enduring convictions."LiNeBrEaKIn his speech, the new president extended his hand and the hand of America to our allies, to poor nations, to Muslim nations, even to those leaders who "cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent," if only they are willing "to unclench [their] fist."LiNeBrEaKAs the world grows smaller, Obama said, "our common humanity shall reveal itself..." and America will work to usher in "a new era of peace."LiNeBrEaKThe world is growing smaller. But in his first message, in the first minutes of his presidency, Barack Obama opened this nation's arms, expanded our horizons beyond narrow self-interest and announced that we would once again join the global community, not just as a leader but also as a partner and a friend.LiNeBrEaKMary Ellen Schoonmaker is an editorial writer and columnist for The Record.

Richmond Times - Dispatch (Virginia)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	BRIEF: Moran says he would block coal-fired plant in Surry  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	229 words  	Jan. 22--Democratic gubernatorial candidate Brian J. Moran of Alexandria said today he is opposed to a proposed coal-fired power plant in Surry County. LiNeBrEaKThe plant is "dangerously close to the Chesapeake Bay watershed," Moran said at a news conference in front of the Department of Environmental quality headquarters in downtown Richmond.LiNeBrEaKHe also is worried that the plant is too close to the major population centers of Richmond and Hampton Roads and that it will increase global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Old Dominion Electric Cooperative wants to build a $6 billion plant in Surry to produce up to 1,500 megawatts of electricity.LiNeBrEaKMoran said he came out against the plant because the next governor will have to decide whether to give it the go ahead.LiNeBrEaKMoran, State Sen. R. Creigh Deeds of Bath County and former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe are seeking the nomination to run for governor. The nominee will be chosen in a primary on June 9.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   Metro Edition	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B8  	1239 words  	Forced attendance in school has eroded educationLiNeBrEaKAmelia Roberson evokes unintended irony when she brings up "Socratic dialogue" in her call for respect and support for teachers from parents, administrators and school boards ("Put teachers back in charge of their classrooms," Jan. 17 commentary).LiNeBrEaKSocrates was enraged when he was once falsely accused of accepting money for teaching. He believed the professionalization of teachers would result in an institution that existed to benefit the interests of teachers rather than students. I believe his prediction has come to pass.LiNeBrEaKIn making her argument, Roberson contends that parents should consider their children's education a privilege rather than a deserved activity. Our schools are neither. As of the early 20th century, every state in the union has adopted compulsory education laws. Failure to comply results in criminal charges, loss of custody or both. LiNeBrEaKThus, the lack of discipline in schools is an inevitable outcome of a system that mandates participation and assumes that learning must be forced. Our schools have more to do with social engineering than with education.LiNeBrEaKFred JonesLiNeBrEaKPilotLiNeBrEaKTime to rein in the anti-Bush invectiveLiNeBrEaKThis is to the Bush-haters who have constantly peppered this column with their stupid messages over the past eight years and are still doing it: Enough, already! I'm sick and tired of your foul invective about this good man, and I know a lot of others in this region are, too.LiNeBrEaKGod forbid that Al Gore should have been president during this time. We not only would have been attacked on our soil again, but we'd be worshipping at the altar of the global warming fairy tale.LiNeBrEaKCharles S. WertalikLiNeBrEaKRoanokeLiNeBrEaKWe each stand on shoulders of othersLiNeBrEaKInaugural addresses can be memorable and inspiring or simply forgotten. President John F. Kennedy's often quoted line, "Ask not what your country can do for you . . . ," is certainly memorable. This was a powerful and succinctly stated idea.LiNeBrEaKWe may never know if the message of this famous line was original with Kennedy and his speech writers. Nevertheless, we do know the same idea was penned much earlier by Kahlil Gibran. In 1925, Gibran wrote in "The New Frontier": "Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what you can do for your country? If you are the first, then you are a parasite; if the second, then you are an oasis in a desert."LiNeBrEaKThis quotation is only one of many gems penned by Gibran, a philosopher and writer worthy of extensive study. Many leaders owe much to others for their ideas and inspiration. Let us not forget that each of us owe much to those who went before us, who taught us, or who care for and support us today.LiNeBrEaKGene CarsonLiNeBrEaKBlacksburgLiNeBrEaKGiles County can't afford a disasterLiNeBrEaKI would like to respond to the article in The Roanoke Times' Jan. 1 Current "Recent dam break highlights Narrows project." Joe Ryder, Giles County Partnership for Excellence board member and AEP environmental compliance officer, remarked that the Narrows project is never in a slurry-like state and the earthen berm is steel reinforced. I challenge him to prove this because I have hundreds of pictures and hours of video showing the progress of this project.LiNeBrEaKThe article stated that "the part of the Cumberland Park Project where the ash is already highway high has a liner under it." There is no liner, just a non-woven filter fabric that covers a layer of large rock and gravel approximately 8 feet thick and could have the potential of thousands of gallons of water under it.LiNeBrEaKThe Giles County Partnership for Excellence should release to the public the results of monitoring wells on site. Results from the two wells that the Concerned Citizens of Giles County have drilled will be published in the local newspaper and on the Web site www.concernedgilescitizens.org.LiNeBrEaKCan Giles County afford a catastrophe like the one in Harriman, Tenn., or Stevenson, Ala.?LiNeBrEaKCarleena S. BlankenshipLiNeBrEaKNarrowSLiNeBrEaKPilot's experience saved livesLiNeBrEaKRe: "All 155 on board are safe," Jan. 16 front page:LiNeBrEaKConsidering the tragic accident and the miracle that occurred on the Hudson, the miracle is due to God, the rescuers, and the experience of pilot Chesley Sullenberger. When industries such as aviation and healthcare downsize and replace experienced people with less experienced employees or hire inexperienced people due to cost-cutting measures, public safety is at risk. The Hudson incident is a prime example of why experienced workers are needed.LiNeBrEaKNext time you hear of cuts that will affect your safety and the safety of the public, make your voice heard, contact your representative. There is no replacement for experience. Experience in this case saved countless lives, those on the plane and on the ground. Can we put a price on this?LiNeBrEaKDebra ShipmanLiNeBrEaKBlacksburgLiNeBrEaKCircuses shouldn't use animal actsLiNeBrEaKIt saddens me to see that we in Roanoke are welcoming the Shrine Circus to town. With all the organizations promoting animal safety and animal welfare, it still surprises me that circuses continue to feature wild animals as entertainment for people.LiNeBrEaKIf you have seen even a picture of a majestic elephant in the wild and then compared it to the elephant dressed in a fancy headdress and doing silly tricks for people's amusement, you would realize that holding wild animals in captivity is wrong. From center stage to life in a trailer and back to center stage is abusive and degrading.LiNeBrEaKBy supporting these circuses, we support these actions. Imagine a circus with just the clowns and the high-wire acts and the trapeze artists. These acts should be enough to amuse and entertain humane people. These acts display true human talent and do not depend on the degradation of animals for their success.LiNeBrEaKNancy H. SpilbergLiNeBrEaKVintonLiNeBrEaKRoanoke council needs to take chargeLiNeBrEaKAfter reading the article in The Roanoke Times "Nonprofit group may owe Roanoke more than $333,000" (Jan. 17), I question just who is at the steering wheel here in Roanoke. It surely doesn't appear that our elected city council has been informed and included in all decisions that affect our tax dollars and how they are spent.LiNeBrEaKIt would appear that City Manager Darlene Burcham is easily able to maneuver around council members on decisions that should require their oversight. If it were not for The Times requesting information using the Freedom of Information Act, the general public and city council would still be in the dark on this issue and potentially many more that have not been brought into the light yet.LiNeBrEaKWhen are we, the citizens, and our elected officials who should speak for us going to wake up and say enough is enough?LiNeBrEaKJ.C. O'NeilLiNeBrEaKRoanokeLiNeBrEaKPilot's safe landing was a miracleLiNeBrEaKRe: "All 155 on board are safe," Jan. 16 front page:LiNeBrEaKWe've been reading about the pilot and his clear thinking and how he was able to save more than 100 people in landing on the Hudson River. While he is definitely a hero, so were those on the plane who kept a clear head and exited the plane in an orderly manner.LiNeBrEaKThe real hero in all of this was God, who was riding with the pilot to steady his hand for landing. He steered the plane away from buildings, thus avoiding hundreds of deaths. It was daylight; all the rescue ships were close by, but the plane didn't hit any of them. The crew stayed calm; the passengers looked like they were walking on water on the wings. All of this was planned and executed by God for us to witness a true miracle.LiNeBrEaKJanice WhitenackLiNeBrEaKDaleville		TEACHING and TEACHERS (91%); EDUCATION (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (78%); CHILDREN (78%); PARENTING (78%); EDUCATION LAW (78%); SCHOOL ATTENDANCE (78%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (75%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (72%); US PRESIDENTS (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			AL GORE (54%); JOHN F KENNEDY (53%)  	VIRGINIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  		LETTERS  	Newspaper  	2009 The Roanoke Times All Rights Reserved  																
Sacramento Bee (California)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Global warming blamed for tree death in West  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	292 words  	Jan. 22--Tree mortality rates have doubled in old-growth forests across the Sierra Nevada and western United States because of rising temperatures associated with climate change, a new study has found. LiNeBrEaKThe study, which will be published Friday in the journal Science, suggests that if the trend continues, the region's majestic conifer forests may become younger, smaller and far more sickly -- making them vulnerable to massive die-offs from insect attacks and other causes.LiNeBrEaK"Effectively, everywhere we looked we saw mortality rates increasing," said Nathan Stephenson, co-leader of the study and a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Three Rivers near Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. "That to me is a red flag that says there is potentially something pretty big going on."LiNeBrEaKWhile the actual increase may not appear large -- mortality rates have risen from about 1 to 2 percent across the region over the past quarter-century -- it is significant, Stephenson said.LiNeBrEaK"You can imagine if they doubled in the human population," he said. "We'd sure take notice and go, 'Oh my gosh. What's happening that's causing twice as many people to die every year?' "LiNeBrEaKRead more about this story Friday in The Bee and at sacbee.com, and read coverage of indications of global warming's effect on the Sierra Nevada at sacbee.com/sierra.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Eco-friendly seniors pitch in;  They hope to protect resources for offspring 	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1120 words  	The idea of conserving resources is nothing new to 80-somethings who lived through the Great Depression. But now they're doing it not just to pinch pennies. They also want to save the Earth.LiNeBrEaKWorried about global warming, regional water shortages, too much reliance on foreign oil and other environmental problems, these retirees are finding big and small ways to go green.LiNeBrEaKFrom La Jolla and Rancho Bernardo to Hamden, Conn., and Lower Merion, Pa., older Americans are launching recycling programs, serving on committees that develop ways to save water and electricity, and encouraging managers of retirement homes to install solar panels and forgo golf courses. LiNeBrEaK"We are trying every way we know how to teach people who will be dead in a few years about environmental stewardship -- so they can teach their grandchildren," said Robert Lane, a professor emeritus at Yale University who co-founded the National Senior Conservation Corps in Hamden last year.LiNeBrEaKThe nonprofit group shares tips for green living with retirement communities -- including one in Lower Merion -- through brochures, multimedia reports and public exhibits. It helps connect seniors with environmental organizations and posts other related information on its Web site, grayisgreen.org.LiNeBrEaKAfter watching Al Gore's 2006 documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," Lane and a few friends created an environmental council to boost recycling and other eco-friendly practices at their senior-living community. That effort expanded into a conservation corps.LiNeBrEaKThe group's pledge proclaims, in part, that each member will "conserve for the future the resources whose abundance, now waning, has made my life possible."LiNeBrEaKStatistics are scarce on the trend of Depression-era seniors making environmentally friendly lifestyle changes.LiNeBrEaKBut in a December 2007 survey of 30,000 baby boomers and Depression-era seniors, the research company Focalyst and AARP found that while both age groups are increasingly buying green products, octogenarians did so more often.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, retirees are putting more emphasis on living in homes that blend into the surrounding ecosystem, said Phyllis Isley, business manager for the Georgia-based American Association of Retirement Communities.LiNeBrEaK"For many years, the template was to build a retirement community around a golf course," she said. "The No. 1 amenities in most developments now are things like nature trails."LiNeBrEaKEcological awareness is indeed evident at retirement centers, said Maria Dwight, president and founder of Gerontological Services Inc., a market research firm in Santa Monica.LiNeBrEaK"Almost every campus I have been on, it's been the residents who have started the newspaper recycling and the glass recycling long before management catches on," she said. "They have formed committees, and they go through every department doing environmental inventories. It's really exciting to see."LiNeBrEaKAbout eight years ago, Dwight started giving presentations on environmental awareness at an annual national convention for retirees, senior-living managers and others. Sixteen people attended the first session. In 2008, the crowd numbered about 400.LiNeBrEaKAt the Classic Residence by Hyatt at La Jolla Village, resident John Werner said his neighbors "eat up" the message of conservation. He said more residents there have started turning off unnecessary lights, using low-wattage fluorescent bulbs and taking showers instead of baths to conserve water.LiNeBrEaKTwo months ago, Werner installed a shut-off valve on his shower head so he could easily turn off the water while he's scrubbing. A lower water bill would have been his only reason for doing so five years ago, he said, but today he's also concerned about California's prolonged drought.LiNeBrEaKWerner, 86, said retirement gave him time to think more about environmental issues. "This wasn't my top priority in life. As I get older, I think about it more," he said. "I want us to conserve and maintain the resources of our country."LiNeBrEaKHe has decided to spread his environmental ethic to fellow residents.LiNeBrEaKLast year, as chairman of the buildings and grounds committee, Werner worked with other seniors in urging people to wash only full loads of laundry and keep lamps away from thermostats. Heat produced from light bulbs can trigger air conditioners to run more than needed.LiNeBrEaKAt the La Costa Glen retirement community in Carlsbad, Janie Howell said her peers have recently become more receptive to tips on recycling and saving water.LiNeBrEaKHowell, 83, showers every other day and washes her hair only once a week -- in the sink instead of the shower. She also shops for gently used clothes at consignment stores and religiously reuses items such as twist-ties and plastic bags.LiNeBrEaK"I don't want all of this junk filling up our canyons," she said.LiNeBrEaKHowell said her environmental awareness has grown in the past few years because of widespread media coverage of glaciers melting, the sea level rising and water becoming more scarce.LiNeBrEaKShe pointed to the initiatives taken by La Costa Glen's residents, including their recycling programs for batteries from hearing aids and TV remote controls. These neighbors also have supported management's decisions to trim expenses and help the environment by:LiNeBrEaK* Using fewer plastic foam coffee cups.LiNeBrEaK* Posting dining-room menus online, cutting the number of printed copies from 600 to 65.LiNeBrEaK* Switching to ecologically friendly cleaning agents.LiNeBrEaK* Installing a synthetic pitch-and-putt golf course so the community wouldn't have to irrigate the grass with more than 1 million gallons of water a year.LiNeBrEaK"Many (residents) remember tricks their parents used during the lean times of the 1930s," said Darcie Gorman, accounting director and Green Team leader at La Costa Glen. "They are especially good with ideas on how to cut down on water and lighting, and some of them are even composting."LiNeBrEaKBorn near the end of the Depression era, Nancy Linton of Rancho Bernardo said she is tapping into the growing hunger for eco-based activities that don't cost much -- like washing windows with vinegar and water instead of a chemical-heavy cleaning product.LiNeBrEaKShe's planning a going-green luncheon in April for the 60- to 90-year-olds in her chapter of the American Association of University Women.LiNeBrEaK"The importance of (being environmentally friendly) has reached most of us so that it's not just an esoteric subject," said Linton, 70. "It has become a fundamental need to start doing this, but most people don't know where to start."LiNeBrEaKShe doesn't expect the changes to benefit her generation.LiNeBrEaK"Our lives are lived," Linton said, "but this group is interested in seeing a better future."LiNeBrEaKONLINE: To participate in a survey on how people often buy less and use fewer natural resources during a recession, visit uniontrib.com/more/footprint		ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (92%); RETIREMENT and RETIREES (90%); MATERIALS RECOVERY and RECYCLING (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); GOLF and COUNTRY CLUBS (89%); GREAT DEPRESSION (89%); AGING (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (77%); TRENDS (76%); LIFESTYLE TRENDS (75%); CHILDREN (75%); BABY BOOMERS (75%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (74%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (77%); GERONTOLOGY (72%); SOLAR ENERGY (70%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (70%); MARKET RESEARCH and ANALYSIS (68%); POLLS and SURVEYS (65%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (65%); MARKET RESEARCH (63%); MARKET RESEARCH FIRMS (63%); GLOBAL WARMING (57%); WEB SITES (51%); SENIOR CITIZENS (90%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (66%) ELDERLY; ENVIRONMENT; SAN DIEGO;   		YALE UNIVERSITY (56%)  	ROBERT W LANE (70%); AL GORE (55%)  	SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (93%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); EARTH (92%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 24, 2009  	ENGLISH  	4 PICS; PHOTOBY: 1-4.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Trees dying at an increased rate  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	571 words  	SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Trees in old-growth forests of the western United States are dying at twice the usual rate, and scientists say climate change may be to blame.LiNeBrEaKIn one of the largest-ever surveys of U.S. forests, ecologists analyzed data on nearly 60,000 trees in 76 old-growth forests. Published Friday in the journal Science, the study reported a startling jump over the past few decades: Regardless of type, size or elevation, twice as many trees are dying each year.LiNeBrEaKAnd while death rates have increased, birth rates for new trees have remained stable _ meaning there aren't enough new trees to replace the old ones.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Four-day workweek doesn't save as much as predicted  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	556 words  	Jan. 22--After the Legislature suggested cutting $3 million from an energy-efficiency fund, state officials acknowledged savings from the four-day workweek experiment probably won't save the $3 million originally predicted.LiNeBrEaKKim Hood, executive director of the Department of Administrative Services, now says the estimated savings from Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s Working4Utah initiative is a longer-term target goal.LiNeBrEaK"It's like me saying I'll lose 30 pounds in a year, it's a goal," Hood told lawmakers Wednesday. "At this point, I think the $3 million should be considered a stretch. I think we need the full year of a pilot program to determine what the savings are going to be." LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 12, legislative staff suggested cutting $3 million from the revolving fund that pays for projects to make buildings more energy efficient, and repaying the fund with savings from the Working4Utah initiative. That fund has become less restrictive over time, but that money can only be used for energy-related projects approved by the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaK"Energy efficiency is not a cut you want to make. It's an investment that brings money back to the state," said John Harrington, state buildings energy manager. He said the $3. 65 million in the fund had the potential 10-year energy savings of $12. 5 million.LiNeBrEaKHood agreed the fund was essential.LiNeBrEaK"Our target goal of reducing energy use by 20 percent may happen in the first year, or second or third year," saidLiNeBrEaKHood, adding that Huntsman's goal is 20 percent of energy use cutting by 2015. "But our biggest challenge is getting those buildings efficient."LiNeBrEaKShe said shuttering state government offices on Fridays hasn't generated as much cost savings as first predicted.LiNeBrEaKSeveral unforeseen issues, such as extreme temperatures, employee habits and workers coming in on the occasional Friday, made such a large amount of savings an impossibility this year, she said.LiNeBrEaKMichael Hansen, strategic planning manager for the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget, calls the lower savings "lessons learned."LiNeBrEaK"We made all these estimates and assumptions, and it looks like we were optimistic," he said. "We thought it would be easier, but there were all these weird little things."LiNeBrEaKHe said he has a draft report prepared with actual figures showing how much the state has saved thus far, but it has not yet been approved for release.LiNeBrEaKThe initiative was implemented with little to no input from state employees, lawmakers or residents, but Huntsman has worked to make the environment a top priority, even though many in the Legislature look at global warming as a farce.LiNeBrEaKThe initiative moved 17,000 of the state's 24,000 employees from working five, eight-hour days to four, 10-hour days.LiNeBrEaKHood said that while cost savings were not as high as predicted for this first year, the one-year pilot program has allowed the state to identify which buildings need to be more energy-efficient and how best to make them so.

San Bernardino County Sun (California)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Pomona's Cal Spas creates new line of products  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	489 words  	Jan. 22--The nation's economic downturn has chiseled away at the profits of many manufacturing firms while others have been forced to close their doors.LiNeBrEaKBut some companies, including Cal Spas in Pomona, have taken pro-active steps to adapt to a changing climate in which many consumers no longer have as much money to spend. LiNeBrEaKCal Spas is producing a new Genesis line of spas using a "geoforming" process. This allows the shell and cabinet to be molded from a single sheet of acrylic, an alternative to the more traditional roto-molded hot tubs that are usually made with polyethylene, a plastic used in the manufacture of items like garbage cans and milk bottles.LiNeBrEaKThe geoforming method produces a product with a smooth exterior that is highly durable. More importantly, it lowers the production cost and allows Cal Spas to sell the units for much less than traditional spas.LiNeBrEaK"All of our spas are built with the same quality but this creates a lower price point," said Shiva Noble, Cal Spas' executive vice president. "The average price for a spa is $7,999, but these will go for $2,999 to $3,499. They still give you hydrotherapy and warm water therapy, but they are much more affordable to purchase."LiNeBrEaKNoble said consumers who typically buy hot tubs have not been as adversely affected by the economic downturn because most of them are middle to upper middle-class buyers and above.LiNeBrEaK"The economy has really not affected them so much, but at the same timeLiNeBrEaKthey are being a little more conservative and they're not letting go of their dollars as easily as before," she said. "They want to pay a lower price for the same product."LiNeBrEaKRichard Giss, a retail analyst with Deloitte and Touche, said businesses across the spectrum are rethinking marketing strategies and in many cases are revamping their product lines to keep consumers coming back.LiNeBrEaK"You don't need to look any further than the auto industry, which has suffered 20, 30 and 40percent decreases in sales," he said. "And the housing market has suffered a big downturn in sales."LiNeBrEaKMany Americans who couldn't keep pace with their rising mortgage payments lost their homes to foreclosure, impacting sales of such items as furniture, appliances, carpeting, paint, wood and a variety of other products.LiNeBrEaKCal Spas was founded in 1979. The company has evolved to become the world's No. 1 manufacturer of home resort products, including hydrotherapy hot tubs, swim spas, gazebos, indoor/outdoor saunas, barbecue islands/carts/drop-in grills, outdoor fireplaces and fire pits.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Unhealthy air  	COMMENTARY  	467 words  	Jan. 22--Well, Utahns, we're back in the soup. The stinking, eye-watering, throat-burning, lung-damaging, cough-inducing air pollution that collects in Utah's valleys during a temperature inversion. Relief may be in sight from a weekend storm, but there's no guarantee. LiNeBrEaKSo what do we do? In the short term, the prescription is simple. Drive your car or truck as little as possible. Ride mass transit. Carpool. Consolidate your errands, and if you can postpone them until the inversion lifts, do it. And don't burn your fireplace or wood stove. You know the drill.LiNeBrEaKIf you want more suggestions, visit www.cleanair.utah.gov. The air-quality folks have got a list of 50 things you can do to make it possible for all of us to breathe easier. Things like not idling your car and keeping it and your furnace well maintained.LiNeBrEaKBut, really, if we only act during the inversions, the problem is not going to get much better.LiNeBrEaKWhich brings us to the long term. Did you happen to watch NOVA on KUED Channel 7 on Tuesday night? That PBS science program explored the pros and cons of California's aggressive efforts to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to global warming. The program was titled "The Big Energy Gamble."LiNeBrEaKMost industrial carbon dioxide is the byproduct of burning fossil fuels. So, if you eliminate coal-fired power plants in favor of renewable energy sources like solar andLiNeBrEaKwind power, and if you drastically reduce the burning of gasoline and diesel fuel in cars and trucks by requiring hybrid and electric vehicles, in order to produce less carbon dioxide, you also will produce fewer other air pollutants as well.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. "The Big Energy Gamble" examines whether these goals are achievable, and, if they are, whether they will hamstring the California economy.LiNeBrEaKOf course, Utah can do nothing and simply piggyback on California's efforts. The low-emission vehicles that will be produced for the huge market in the Golden State will be available in Utah, too. But that won't solve Utah's dependence on coal-fired electric generating plants for the vast majority of the Beehive State's power. Nor will it regulate other local industrial polluters.LiNeBrEaKWhen you take a breath on a day like today, doing too little does not feel like a good option. It sort of sticks in your throat.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (West Covina, California)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Green innovations require sacrifices  	COMMENTARY  	688 words  	Jan. 22--Changing from gasoline- and diesel-powered automobiles to ones powered by batteries, compressed natural gas or hydrogen will take more than the unveiling of a prototype. It will take billions of dollars in further research and development, in new fueling stations and, most importantly, a commitment to doing things differently.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, changing from filling up our local canyons with trash to relying on a remote, modern landfill system will take extra dollars to transport waste by train over many more miles. And it will take a commitment from the cities of Los Angeles County that proposed the changeover more than 20 years ago: an agreement to send their trash. LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to be in theoretical support of green innovations -- but it often amounts to mere lip service to the goals of breathing cleaner air and slowing global warming. It's much harder to commit to a green lifestyle. That usually requires sacrifice.LiNeBrEaKJust as Congress demanded the Big Three automakers re-tool by producing hybrids and alternatively fueled cars, we would like to see the same measure of green commitment from San Gabriel Valley-area cities for a new solid waste system.LiNeBrEaKOne way to really be green is to support the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's changeover to waste-by-rail that will take trash by railcars to a new landfill in Imperial County. This removes a source of air pollution and methane -- a greenhouse gas -- from our Valley.LiNeBrEaKInstead of piling the trashLiNeBrEaKhigher and higher above Hacienda Heights and the Pomona (60) Freeway, the county is committed to closing the Puente Hills Landfill by Oct. 31, 2013. But the trash brought to Puente Hills -- about 4 million tons a year, one-third of all the trash produced in the county -- has to go somewhere.LiNeBrEaKThe Sanitation Districts have invested $500 million in buying and developing the Mesquite Regional Landfill. Just this year, it received final approvals from the Imperial County Public Health Department and the Colorado River Regional Water Quality Control Board. A rail yard will be built at the site to receive trash from L.A. County by 2011 or 2012.LiNeBrEaKThe districts also began subsidizing the extra transportation costs through supplemental dumping fees. Eventually, trash rates charged residents by private waste haulers will go up by $2 to $3 a month.LiNeBrEaKWhile no one wants to pay more for trash pickup, this additional cost is worth it. One only has to look at the history of the San Gabriel Valley to understand. We used to be called "Valley of the Dumps" because the city of Los Angeles thought it was the ideal place to bury its trash. But one by one, after a commitment from San Gabriel Valley mayors and the Sanitation Districts, the local eyesores began to close: BKK Corp. Landfill in West Covina, the Azusa Landfill and the Spadra Landfill in Walnut (the latter is now part of the Center for Regenerative Studies at Cal Poly Pomona). BKK is now a new sports park and hosts a Target store.LiNeBrEaKWhile the Puente Hills Landfill is well-run and bears no comparison to BKK, it still must close in 4 1/2 years due to contractual agreement.LiNeBrEaKLocal cities, through the San Gabriel Valley Association of Cities (now the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments), defeated plans for garbage incinerators in 1987. Instead, they offered waste-by-rail as one alternative.LiNeBrEaKAt a recent SGVCOG meeting in Irwindale, the new leaders of these cities were reminded of the foresight and leadership shown by 33 Valley cities and communities back in the 1980s. While Claremont began sending its waste to Orange County recently, we think that was a mistake. All the cities should support the new waste-by-rail project -- and finish what they started.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Scientists: Global warming may be killing trees in West twice as fast  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	588 words  	Jan. 22--Trees in old-growth forests of the western United States are dying at twice the usual rate, and scientists say climate change may be to blame.LiNeBrEaKIn one of the largest-ever surveys of U.S. forests, ecologists analyzed data on nearly 60,000 trees in 76 old-growth forests. Set to be published Friday in the journal Science, the study reported a startling jump over the past few decades: regardless of type, size or elevation, twice as many trees are dying each year.LiNeBrEaKAnd while death rates have increased, birth rates for new trees have remained stable -- meaning there aren't enough new trees to replace the old ones. LiNeBrEaKFor now, the percentage of trees dying each year is small, so doubling the rate means an increase of only 1 or 2 percent per year. But over time, small increases can add up, said Dr. Phillip van Mantgem, U.S. Geological Survey researcher and co-leader of the research team.LiNeBrEaK"If current trends continue, forests will become sparser over time," van Mantgem said. "Simple projections of forest stand structure indicate that average tree age will eventually decrease by half, and this will potentially lead to decreasing average tree size."LiNeBrEaKSparser forests provide fewer places for animals to live, van Mantgem said, and also put trees at-risk for sudden die-off from catastrophic incidents such as fire, drought and bark beetle attack.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, because large trees absorb significant amounts of carbon dioxide, death ofLiNeBrEaKold-growth forests could further exacerbate climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe study analyzed data collected since 1955, from forests across California, the Pacific Northwest and several Rocky Mountain states.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers considered a number of possible causes for rising death rates, including changes in forest density and increased air pollution. But because rising mortality rates were so widespread -- found even in areas free of logging and air pollution, for instance -- these causes seemed unlikely.LiNeBrEaKInstead, regional climate change emerged as the most likely culprit. Over the past few decades, average temperatures rose by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit, which researchers said could have a major affect on tree health.LiNeBrEaK"Rising temperatures have resulted in more of each year's precipitation coming as rain rather than snow," said Nathan Stephenson, a USGS ecologist and co-leader of the study.LiNeBrEaKWith earlier spring melts and less run-off, trees are suffering from longer summer droughts, Stephenson said. In addition, warmer temperatures help insects flourish, such as the bark beetles that feed on trees.LiNeBrEaKTemperatures are indeed in flux. According to a separate study, published this week in Nature by University of California-Berkeley and other scientists, the hottest day of the year has shifted nearly two days earlier.LiNeBrEaK"This is further evidence that we're really seeing continental-scale effects of the warming," said Thomas Veblen, professor of geography at the University of Colorado.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   FINAL Edition	Winters are warmer and spring is earlier, UC study finds  	Main News; Pg. A10  	672 words  	Earth's coldest days of the year are getting warmer, and scientists have seen winter temperatures rising at a much faster pace than summer temperatures. Now UC Berkeley researchers have figured out exactly how much.LiNeBrEaKOutside of the tropics, summer temperatures have risen 1. 7 degrees over the last 50 years compared with winters, which have jumped by 3. 2 degrees, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers have also identified a shift in the seasons: The hottest day of the year is occurring nearly two days earlier than it was a half-century ago.  LiNeBrEaK"The highest temperature is hotter, and the lowest temperature is also hotter. But you're getting to both temperatures earlier in the year," said lead author Alexander Stine, a graduate student in UC Berkeley's Department of Earth and Planetary Science.LiNeBrEaKThe changes reported in the study might seem small, "but they have huge economic and other societal implications," said climate expert Gretchen Daily, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaK"In California, the changes are likely to reduce snowpack and water storage and supply, increase wildfires and lengthen and intensify heat waves," Daily said.LiNeBrEaKFor 100 years, the arrival of spring showed up within the bounds of natural variability. But as global temperatures have risen in the last 50 years, researchers saw the advance of an earlier spring. When looking at temperatures over time, they found that summer tended to remain stable while winter temperatures jump up and down from year to year. LiNeBrEaK"You have to see a lot of winters before you see a slow, steady signal," said Stine.LiNeBrEaKStine worked on the study with UC Berkeley Professor Inez Fung, co-director of the Berkeley Institute of the Environment, and Harvard's Peter Huybers to compare surface temperature measurements compiled in a database by the University of East Anglia in England. The researchers examined two time periods - 1850-1953 and 1954-2007.LiNeBrEaK"The glaciers are melting faster than predicted," Fung said Wednesday. "The capacity of the land and ocean to absorb carbon dioxide is decreasing with warming. And now here is more evidence that climate change is happening in more dimensions than we have predicted."LiNeBrEaKThe researchers hypothesize that shifting wind patterns, particularly the Northern Annular Mode, or Arctic Oscillation, are contributing to the timing of the debut of the year's hottest day. Such winds tend to circulate west to east around the globe, mostly influencing whether a winter is cold from year to year in the Northern Hemisphere.LiNeBrEaKThe wind stirs up the atmosphere and moves from one part of Earth to another, bringing heat and moisture. Its strength year to year might be affected by the difference between the pressure in the high Arctic and the tropics, Stine said.LiNeBrEaKOne explanation for earlier seasons is the drying of the soils as warmer temperatures cause evaporation. With smaller snowpacks, there is less to melt to supply water in the spring. An earlier spring could warn of a dryer summer, said Fung, who is studying moisture in relation to climate.LiNeBrEaKA decade ago, mathematician David Thomson, now at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, examined how carbon dioxide affected the timing of seasons. In a letter appearing in Nature about the new study, Thomson wrote, "observational evidence for human influence on the climate system is overwhelming."LiNeBrEaKThe new paper adds to that evidence, he said. "If we do not stop polluting Earth's atmosphere, we may not have enough time left to develop models sophisticated enough to show what is obvious in the data now."LiNeBrEaKOver the last 50 years, biologists, birders and backyard gardeners have reported signs of changing nature.LiNeBrEaKIn recent years, more researchers are measuring decade-long trends in a field of study called phenology, the investigation of the seasonal timing of plant and animal life-cycle events such as migrations of birds, fish and mammals, emergence from hibernation and the leafing, blooming and fruiting of plants.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday  Correction Appended  	All of Antarctica appears to be warming;  Review of 50 years of data shows that the east side of the continent is also heating up, scientists say 	Main News; Pg. A10  	770 words  	FINAL EditionLiNeBrEaKThe climate trend that is raising temperatures across most of the world is warming all of Antarctica despite earlier signs that most of the ice-covered continent has cooled during the past 50 years, researchers are reporting today. LiNeBrEaKThe scientists stop short of claiming with certainty that wind-borne greenhouse gases from global industries on other continents are responsible for Antarctica's warming, but they say their evidence makes them "almost certain" that human activity carries at least some of the blame.LiNeBrEaKFor years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose scientists track global warming year by year, has reported that greenhouse gases and global warming have clearly hit six of the world's seven continents, but that the evidence from Antarctica is still unclear. West Antarctica is known to be warming strongly, but the climate of the much larger eastern area was said to be cooling, some scientists have argued. LiNeBrEaKNow the issue has apparently been resolved.LiNeBrEaKIn a report published today in the journal Nature, climatologists Eric Geist of the University of Washington and Drew Shindell of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies say that for the first time they combined satellite observations over the entire continent with evidence from more than 100 manned and unmanned weather stations both inland and along the continent's coasts to determine climate trends for the past 50 years.LiNeBrEaKDuring an hour-long teleconference Wednesday, the scientists said their data clearly shows that on average the entire Antarctic continent has been gradually warming at least since 1957.LiNeBrEaKWest Antarctica, separated from the far larger eastern part by the towering Transantarctic mountain range, has long evidenced a strong warming trend. And the Antarctic Peninsula, warmer than everywhere else in the western region, is where massive ice shelves have collapsed into the sea as springtime temperatures rise above the melting point there.LiNeBrEaKBut East Antarctica has been a very different story. Here, many scientists have contended that the huge region has been cooling over the past half-century.LiNeBrEaKA leading scientist who has long collected data supporting that cooling argument conceded, in an e-mail to The Chronicle on Wednesday, that the evidence in the new report "lends confidence" that the new findings on Antarctic temperature trends "are robust."LiNeBrEaKAndrew Monaghan of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., also was impressed by the new findings and said he's convinced that greenhouse gases - known as "anthropogenic" influences - have played a role in warming Antarctica's climate.LiNeBrEaK"My opinion is that anthropogenic impacts - through both greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone - are having a discernible impact on Antarctic climate variability and will continue to do so," Monaghan said. LiNeBrEaKDuring Wednesday's teleconference, Shindell said wind patterns across Antarctica make it difficult to pin down the role of greenhouse gases in warming the continent, but human activity in the world's other continents should be added in as an influence pushing Antarctic temperatures up.LiNeBrEaK"We're almost certain that increases in greenhouse gases on other continents are contributing to this warming in Antarctica," Shindell said.LiNeBrEaKScientists have been severely hindered in studying the icy continent's climate trends because most manned weather stations are located along the accessible coasts. But Geist said his team was able to gather valuable satellite data covering the past 25 years. They then combined that data with records from unmanned stations located inland and left by visiting scientists over the years since the International Geophysical Year of 1957-58.LiNeBrEaKThe result, Geist said, was a combined record clearly showing that East Antarctica, too has been warming over the past 50 years - although warming on the continent's western side has been twice as rapid.LiNeBrEaKWhile the numbers are complicated, the team's evidence indicates that over the entire Antarctic continent - where year-round temperatures average nearly 50 degrees below zero - the average temperature increase for the past 50 years has been half a degree Celsius, or just under one full degree Fahrenheit, Geist said.LiNeBrEaKOne degree may not seem like much, but a two-degree global increase - universally forecast before the end of this century - would pose major threats to world stability. Scientists predict that food crops would die in some regions and increase in others, and rising sea levels, caused by melting ice, would drown many low-lying coasts and islands, particularly in developing nations where poverty is already endemic.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Unhealthy air  	OPINION; Editorials  	397 words  	Well, Utahns, we're back in the soup. The stinking, eye-watering, throat-burning, lung-damaging, cough-inducing air pollution that collects in Utah's valleys during a temperature inversion. Relief may be in sight from a weekend storm, but there's no guarantee. LiNeBrEaKSo what do we do? In the short term, the prescription is simple. Drive your car or truck as little as possible. Ride mass transit. Carpool. Consolidate your errands, and if you can postpone them until the inversion lifts, do it. And don't burn your fireplace or wood stove. You know the drill.LiNeBrEaKIf you want more suggestions, visit www.cleanair.utah.gov . The air-quality folks have got a list of 50 things you can do to make it possible for all of us to breathe easier. Things like not idling your car and keeping it and your furnace well maintained.LiNeBrEaKBut, really, if we only act during the inversions, the problem is not going to get much better.LiNeBrEaKWhich brings us to the long term. Did you happen to watch NOVA on KUED Channel 7 on Tuesday night? That PBS science program explored the pros and cons of California's aggressive efforts to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to global warming. The program was titled "The Big Energy Gamble."LiNeBrEaKMost industrial carbon dioxide is the byproduct of burning fossil fuels. So, if you eliminate coal-fired power plants in favor of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and if you drastically reduce the burning of gasoline and diesel fuel in cars and trucks by requiring hybrid and electric vehicles, in order to produce less carbon dioxide, you also will produce fewer other air pollutants as well.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. "The Big Energy Gamble" examines whether these goals are achievable, and, if they are, whether they will hamstring the California economy.LiNeBrEaKOf course, Utah can do nothing and simply piggyback on California's efforts. The low-emission vehicles that will be produced for the huge market in the Golden State will be available in Utah, too. But that won't solve Utah's dependence on coal-fired electric generating plants for the vast majority of the Beehive State's power. Nor will it regulate other local industrial polluters.LiNeBrEaKWhen you take a breath on a day like today, doing too little does not feel like a good option. It sort of sticks in your throat.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Scientists: Global warming may be killing trees in West twice as fast as usual  	BREAKING; Communities; San Jose - Valley; Science; News; Local; Science and Tech  	509 words  	Trees in old-growth forests of the western United States are dying at twice the usual rate, and scientists say climate change may be to blame.LiNeBrEaKIn one of the largest surveys of U.S. forests, ecologists analyzed data on nearly 60,000 trees in 76 old-growth forests. Published today in the journal Science, the study reported a startling jump over the past few decades: Regardless of type, size or elevation, twice as many trees are dying each year. LiNeBrEaKAnd while death rates have increased, birth rates for new trees have remained stable   meaning there aren't enough new trees to replace the old ones.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the percentage of trees dying each year is small, so doubling the rate means an increase of only 1 or 2 percent per year. But over time, small increases can add up, said Dr. Phillip van Mantgem, U.S. Geological Survey researcher and co-leader of the research team.LiNeBrEaK"If current trends continue, forests will become sparser over time," van Mantgem said. "Simple projections of forest stand structure indicate that average tree age will eventually decrease by half, and this will potentially lead to decreasing average tree size."LiNeBrEaKSparser forests provide fewer places for animals to live, van Mantgem said, and also put trees at risk for sudden die-off from catastrophic incidents, such as fire, drought and bark beetle attack.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, because large trees absorb significant amounts of carbon dioxide, death of old-growth forests could further exacerbate climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe study analyzed data collected since 1955 from forests across California, the Pacific Northwest and several Rocky Mountain states.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers considered a number of possible causes for rising death rates, including changes in forest density and increased air pollution. But because rising mortality rates were so widespread   found even in areas free of logging and air pollution, for instance   these causes seemed unlikely.LiNeBrEaKInstead, regional climate change emerged as the most likely culprit. Over the past few decades, average temperatures rose by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit, which researchers said could have a major effect on tree health.LiNeBrEaK"Rising temperatures have resulted in more of each year's precipitation coming as rain rather than snow," said Nathan Stephenson, a USGS ecologist and co-leader of the study.LiNeBrEaKWith earlier spring melts and less runoff, trees are suffering from longer summer droughts, Stephenson said. In addition, warmer temperatures help insects flourish, such as the bark beetles that feed on trees.LiNeBrEaKTemperatures are indeed in flux. According to a separate study, published this week in Nature by the University of California-Berkeley, the hottest day of the year has shifted nearly two days earlier.LiNeBrEaK"This is further evidence that we're really seeing continental-scale effects of the warming," said Thomas Veblen, professor of geography at the University of Colorado. "We have to start thinking outside the box in terms of how as a society we adapt to the change that's under way."LiNeBrEaKContact Hadley Leggett at hleggett@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5064.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Our View: Green innovations require sacrifices  	OPINION  	611 words  	Changing from gasoline- and diesel-powered automobiles to ones powered by batteries, compressed natural gas or hydrogen will take more than the unveiling of a prototype. It will take billions of dollars in further research and development, in new fueling stations and, most importantly, a commitment to doing things differently.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, changing from filling up our local canyons with trash to relying on a remote, modern landfill system will take extra dollars to transport waste by train over many more miles. And it will take a commitment from the cities of Los Angeles County that proposed the changeover more than 20 years ago: an agreement to send their trash. LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to be in theoretical support of green innovations - but it often amounts to mere lip service to the goals of breathing cleaner air and slowing global warming. It's much harder to commit to a green lifestyle. That usually requires sacrifice.LiNeBrEaKJust as Congress demanded the Big Three automakers re-tool by producing hybrids and alternatively fueled cars, we would like to see the same measure of green commitment from San Gabriel Valley-area cities for a new solid waste system.LiNeBrEaKOne way to really be green is to support the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's changeover to waste-by-rail that will take trash by railcars to a new landfill in Imperial County. This removes a source of air pollution and methane - a greenhouse gas - from our Valley. LiNeBrEaKInstead of piling the trash higher and higher above Hacienda Heights and the Pomona (60) Freeway, the county is committed to closing the Puente Hills Landfill by Oct. 31, 2013. But the trash brought to Puente Hills - about 4 million tons a year, one-third of all the trash produced in the county - has to go somewhere.LiNeBrEaKThe Sanitation Districts have invested $500 million in buying and developing the Mesquite Regional Landfill. Just this year, it received final approvals from the Imperial County Public Health Department and the Colorado River Regional Water Quality Control Board. A rail yard will be built at the site to receive trash from L.A. County by 2011 or 2012.LiNeBrEaKThe districts also began subsidizing the extra transportation costs through supplemental dumping fees. Eventually, trash rates charged residents by private waste haulers will go up by $2 to $3 a month.LiNeBrEaKWhile no one wants to pay more for trash pickup, this additional cost is worth it. One only has to look at the history of the San Gabriel Valley to understand. We used to be called "Valley of the Dumps" because the city of Los Angeles thought it was the ideal place to bury its trash. But one by one, after a commitment from San Gabriel Valley mayors and the Sanitation Districts, the local eyesores began to close: BKK Corp. Landfill in West Covina, the Azusa Landfill and the Spadra Landfill in Walnut (the latter is now part of the Center for Regenerative Studies at Cal Poly Pomona). BKK is now a new sports park and hosts a Target store.LiNeBrEaKWhile the Puente Hills Landfill is well-run and bears no comparison to BKK, it still must close in 4 1/2 years due to contractual agreement.LiNeBrEaKLocal cities, through the San Gabriel Valley Association of Cities (now the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments), defeated plans for garbage incinerators in 1987. Instead, they offered waste-by-rail as one alternative.LiNeBrEaKAt a recent SGVCOG meeting in Irwindale, the new leaders of these cities were reminded of the foresight and leadership shown by 33 Valley cities and communities back in the 1980s. While Claremont began sending its waste to Orange County recently, we think that was a mistake. All the cities should support the new waste-by-rail project - and finish what they started.

Seattle Times (Washington)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	UW study says Antarctica now feeling the heat, too  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	889 words  	Jan. 22--While average temperatures have been rising on all other continents, Antarctica has remained a paradox.LiNeBrEaKThe Antarctic Peninsula, an arm of land that reaches toward South America, is one of the planet's most rapidly warming spots and the site of spectacular ice-sheet collapses in recent years. But temperatures across the bulk of the ice-covered continent have appeared unchanged or dropping in places.LiNeBrEaKNow, a team led by a University of Washington scientist has combined satellite data and temperature measurements to find that, on average, Antarctica has gotten a little bit warmer over the past 50 years. LiNeBrEaK"That means all of the continents are warming, not just six out of seven," said geochemist Eric Steig, who leads the UW's Quaternary Research Center.LiNeBrEaKThe effect is particularly strong in West Antarctica, which is lower in elevation and more moderate in climate than the high, frigid plateau of East Antarctica. "West Antarctica is more like Seattle and East Antarctica is more like central North Dakota," Steig said.LiNeBrEaKA recent cooling trend that scientists believe is caused by a thinning of the ozone layer continues during some parts of the year in East Antarctica, where sea ice also is expanding, the researchers say. But warming elsewhere on the continent was strong enough to yield a net temperature gain.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is a likely factor, though the study published today in the journal Nature says it's impossible yet to sort greenhouse effects from natural patterns and the role of human-caused ozone depletion.LiNeBrEaK"The greenhouse effect is almost certainly contributing to these warming trends, but we can't say how much," said co-author Drew Shindell, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.LiNeBrEaKThe continentwide warming trend is modest -- slightly more than 1 degree Fahrenheit, which is roughly on a par with worldwide trends. The scientists caution that Antarctic records only go back five decades, a much shorter period than on other continents. But the finding does raise concerns about the future of Antarctica's glaciers and ice sheets, which hold 90 percent of Earth's frozen water.LiNeBrEaK"The reason most people worry about Antarctica is its potential contribution to long-term sea-level rise, and I would say this study is moderately worrisome in that respect," Shindell said.LiNeBrEaKMelting of the ice in West Antarctica alone could raise global sea level by 20 feet, but that would take centuries or even millennia, he said.LiNeBrEaKClimate studies in Antarctica are hampered by remoteness, punishing weather and the lack of data. The land mass -- the size of the continental United States and Mexico combined -- has only 42 permanent weather stations, most of them along the coast.LiNeBrEaK"It's a really tough job, and that's why this picture keeps changing," said Antarctic researcher David Bromwich, of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center.LiNeBrEaKSteig and his colleagues compared all the data from the weather stations with 25 years' worth of satellite measurements of surface temperatures. Then they used the relationship between the two data sets to fill in gaps in temperature trends across the continent.LiNeBrEaK"It makes a lot of sense to me," said Andrew Carleton, professor of climatology at Penn State University. "One of the main advances in this [study] is their use of the satellite data ... to show trends."LiNeBrEaKBy bringing Antarctica in from the cold, the new study could undermine the small cadre of global-warming skeptics who still argue that the planet is not getting hotter, or that humans are not to blame. Many have used the apparent cooling in Antarctica to attack global climate models and point out perceived weaknesses in the scientific consensus that emissions from automobiles and factories are beginning to change global climate.LiNeBrEaK"The skeptics apparently have one less leg to stand on," Bromwich said.LiNeBrEaKBut he doesn't agree completely with the new study. In a new analysis of his own, as yet unpublished, Bromwich also finds evidence of significant warming in West Antarctica. But it's not enough to cancel out the cooling in East Antarctica for a continentwide temperature increase.LiNeBrEaKThe cooling in East Antarctica started in the late 1970s, Steig said, coinciding with a seasonal hole in the ozone layer caused by aerosol chemicals.LiNeBrEaKLower ozone concentrations cause the atmosphere to cool, and the effects are most pronounced over East Antarctica.LiNeBrEaKTemperature gradients due to the cooling in turn strengthen westerly winds, which at least partly explain the rapid warming on the Antarctic Peninsula -- though the new study suggests that global warming or other factors may have overtaken the ozone hole in shaping Antarctic climate.LiNeBrEaKThe culprit chemicals were phased out years ago, and the ozone hole is expected to heal by the middle of the century.LiNeBrEaK"If that happens, all of Antarctica could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world," Steig said.LiNeBrEaKSandi Doughton: 206-464-2491 or sdoughton@seattletimes.com		RESEARCH REPORTS (91%); RESEARCH (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); WEATHER (89%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (89%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (89%); TRENDS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); OZONE DEPLETION (71%); COASTAL AREAS (66%); AIR POLLUTION (66%)  		UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (57%)  		SEATTLE, WA, USA (93%) WASHINGTON, USA (93%); NORTH DAKOTA, USA (79%); EARTH (79%) ANTARCTICA (96%); UNITED STATES (93%); SOUTH AMERICA (90%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); MEXICO (79%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Seattle Times   	Sandi Doughton, Seattle Times  			Environment/Recycling/Waste  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090122-SE-UW-study-says-Antarctica-now-feeling-the-heat-too-0122  	SE  									
South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Everglades research center to be built at Florida Atlantic University in Davie: Center to be built on site donated by UF  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	430 words  	Jan. 22--DAVIE -- Florida Atlantic University will soon house a new state-of-the art hub for Everglades research.LiNeBrEaKOfficials from Florida Atlantic University and the University of Florida broke ground Wednesday on a 75,000-square-foot facility on FAU's Davie campus. LiNeBrEaKThe $30 million building, which is expected to open in fall 2010, will be constructed on 25 acres that UF is donating to FAU.LiNeBrEaKThe facility will be across the street from most FAU buildings on College Avenue, next to an existing UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences building.LiNeBrEaKFAU's biology department and UF's institute will use the building to conduct both independent and joint research on Everglades restoration, conservation, sustainability, climate change and other environmental issues, said Gary Perry, dean of FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science.LiNeBrEaKThis research is already going on, but FAU officials hope the new building will give the program room to grow, Perry said. FAU is asking the board of governors next week to give final approval to a new geoscience, or earth science, doctorate degree.LiNeBrEaK"This is a place where vitally important knowledge about the Everglades and the entirety of South Florida's very sensitive and complex ecosystem will be discovered, analyzed, understood and passed along to future generations," FAU President Frank Brogan said.LiNeBrEaKResearchers in FAU's environmental science program are studying invasive ferns, tree islands and nesting patterns of wading birds, among other Everglades projects.LiNeBrEaKUF's Davie research center works to develop technology to manage and maintain landscapes and reduce the impact of invasive plants and animals.LiNeBrEaKThe project also expands classroom space for FAU's Davie campus.LiNeBrEaK"Right now, we are totally booked for classrooms," said Joyanne Stephens, vice president for FAU's Broward campuses.LiNeBrEaKThe building is being paid for with state money designated for building projects.LiNeBrEaKThe building will be designed to meet silver certification, the third highest rating, from the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Antarctica is warming after all, study says  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	480 words  	WASHINGTON - Antarctica, the only place that had oddly seemed immune from climate change, is warming after all, according to a new study.LiNeBrEaKFor years, Antarctica was an enigma to scientists who track the effects of global warming. Temperatures on much of the continent were staying the same or slightly cooling, previous research indicated. LiNeBrEaKThe new study went back further than earlier work and filled in a massive gap in data with satellite information to find that Antarctica too is getting warmer, like the Earth's other six continents.LiNeBrEaKThe findings are in today's issue of the journal Nature.LiNeBrEaK"Contrarians have sometimes grabbed on to this idea that the entire continent of Antarctica is cooling, so how could we be talking about global warming?" said study co-author Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University. "Now we can say: No, it's not true. ... It is not bucking the trend."LiNeBrEaKThe study does not point to man-made climate change as the cause of the Antarctic warming - doing so is a highly intricate scientific process - but a different and smaller study out late last year did make that connection.LiNeBrEaK"We can't pin it down, but it certainly is consistent with the influence of greenhouse gases," said NASA scientist Drew Shindell, another study co-author. Some of the effects also could be natural variability, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe study showed that Antarctica - about one-and-a-half times bigger than the United States - remains a complicated weather picture, especially with only a handful of monitoring stations in its vast interior.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers used satellite data and mathematical formulas to fill in missing information. That made outside scientists queasy about making large conclusions with such sparse information.LiNeBrEaK"This looks like a pretty good analysis, but I have to say I remain somewhat skeptical," Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKShindell said it was more comprehensive than past studies and jibed with computer models.LiNeBrEaKThe research found that since 1957, the annual temperature for the entire continent has warmed by about 1 degree Fahrenheit, but still is 50 degrees below zero. West Antarctica, which is about 20 degrees warmer than the east, has warmed nearly twice as fast, said study lead author Eric Steig of the University of Washington.LiNeBrEaKEast Antarctica, which scientists had long thought to be cooling, is warming slightly when yearly averages are looked at over the past 50 years, said Steig.LiNeBrEaKHowever, autumn temperatures in east Antarctica are cooling over the long term. And east Antarctica from the late 1970s through the 1990s, cooled slightly, Steig said.LiNeBrEaKSome researchers skeptical about the magnitude of global warming overall said that the new study didn't match their measurements and that there appears to be no warming in Antarctica since 1980.

Police said they were unaware of the threat, but transportation officials said they didn't report it. "What can the police do? It involves the lives of hundreds of passengers, and we do not want to put them in danger," said Walid Mir of the town's transport union.LiNeBrEaKRussia getting out of space tourist bizLiNeBrEaKWith a plan to double the resident crew of the international space station from three to six, Russia will have to eliminate something else: space tourists. Since 2001, the lucrative Russian space tourism program has flown six "private spaceflight participants" who paid at least $20-million each for flights aboard Russian-built Soyuz crafts brokered by a U.S.-based company. U.S. software designer Charles Simonyi - who has already flown to the station - will be the last private tourist when he blasts off in March. The resident crew is being expanded to accommodate astronauts from Canada, Europe and Japan, countries that have contributed to the station.LiNeBrEaKTreasure found in Ike's debris pathLiNeBrEaKA contractor helping clear debris from Hurricane Ike is looking for the owner of an ammunition box he found buried in sand that contained keepsakes, including an 1863 Confederate $50 bill, war medals and diamond earrings. The green steel Army ammunition canister was found Jan. 7 by Michael Pate, who was working on a tractor equipped with a grappling arm, snatching storm debris from the sand at Galveston Island State Park. "I thought it would be an encouraging story for the community," Pate said. "We've seen so much destruction."LiNeBrEaKWe need a cute kitty mural...STAT!LiNeBrEaKThere is a new doctor on staff at Hau Sheng Hospital in Taiwan. Dr. Hello Kitty. In fact, the iconic Japanese cartoon now blankets the maternity hospital in an effort to calm anxious mothers.LiNeBrEaK"When new moms feel anxious and lost about how to deal with their new babies, Hello Kitty can make them more relaxed and reduce their sense of discomfort while giving birth," said Tsai Tsung-ji, who owns the hospital and not, surprisingly, a Hello Kitty franchise.LiNeBrEaKSome have suggested that the omnipresent cartoon motif could make the facility seem like a theme park, but Tsai said the hospital has delivered about 2,000 babies since it underwent its Hello Kitty makeover in 2006.LiNeBrEaKLabrador returns to its spot as top dogLiNeBrEaKIf there was any doubt, the Labrador retriever is the people's choice among purebred pooches for the 18th straight year.

Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Washington)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	New cars to show emissions ratings  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	304 words  	Jan. 22--Consumers preparing to buy a new car soon may know how much their vehicle contributes to environment pollution.LiNeBrEaKBeginning in mid-February, new cars, light-duty truck and SUVs sold in Washington will need a label that shows new vehicles' emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases and smog-forming pollutants. The label, designed by the state Department of Ecology, was adopted last week. LiNeBrEaKThe emission rating will be another tool to help educate consumers and inform their buying decisions, said Stuart Clark, air quality program manager at the state Department of Ecology. A low rating wouldn't make the vehicle illegal.LiNeBrEaKThe new label is part of efforts to update the state's "clean cars" standards. And that also means a 2009 model vehicle bought outside the state will need to conform to Washington standards, otherwise it won't be licensed in the state.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, the state Legislature adopted California's auto emission standards, which are more stringent than federal requirements. The new standards are expected to reduce air toxins and improve air quality in the state.LiNeBrEaKFor more information, visit www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/cleancars.htmLiNeBrEaK--Pratik Joshi: 582-1541; pjoshi@tricityherald.com; Business Beat blog at www.tricityherald.comLiNeBrEaKStay updated with the latest news from the Tri-City Herald with an RSS feed: http://www.tri-cityherald.com/1309/story/97842.htmlLiNeBrEaKFill out my Wufoo form!

USA TODAY 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Cleaner air may be adding five months to your life;  Study not definitive, but it's 'good news' 	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	444 words  	Americans are living nearly three years longer than they were only two decades ago, and they owe up to five months of that longevity to cleaner skies, a study shows. LiNeBrEaK"It is a good-news story," says Brigham Young University's C. Arden Pope, author of the study in today's New England Journal of Medicine, which included 51 metropolitan areas in the USA and more than 200 countries.  "Our efforts to clean up our air appear to be worth it."LiNeBrEaKAll cities got a boost from cleaner air, including areas where air was relatively clean at the beginning of the study, the results show.LiNeBrEaKOn average, cities reduced their pollution levels by one-third, cutting the level of small particles from 21 micrograms per cubic meter to 14 micrograms per cubic meter, the study says. At the same time, life expectancy increased by an average of 2. 7 years.LiNeBrEaKResidents of Pittsburgh and Buffalo, which made the biggest gains against pollution, also increased their life spans the most. People there gained almost 3 1/2 extra years, although life expectancy in both cities remains slightly below average.LiNeBrEaKPope says those results were "stunning," considering that he included other factors that could explain the longer life expectancies, including changes in smoking habits.LiNeBrEaKThe results also are in line with earlier findings about the damage caused by air pollution, the University of Ottawa's Daniel Krewski wrote in an accompanying editorial in the medical journal. The World Health Organization estimates that 1. 4% of all deaths are a result of air pollution.LiNeBrEaKYet the findings may be seen as "provocative rather than conclusive," says the American Cancer Society's Michael Thun.LiNeBrEaKOther factors -- such as new medical practices or laws that protect people from secondhand smoke -- also could have helped people live longer, he says.LiNeBrEaKHe notes that earlier studies by Pope and his colleagues have withstood rigorous scrutiny in the past.LiNeBrEaKAlthough this kind of study can't prove that cleaner air adds five months of life, it provides strong scientific reasons to continue cleaning the air -- even if those efforts are expensive, says Norman Edelman, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.LiNeBrEaKThun notes that the same pollution that causes heart attacks and lung disease contributes to global warming -- providing additional reasons to clear the air.LiNeBrEaK"The solutions to one problem may help to address the other," Thun says. LiNeBrEaKFrom 74. 3 up to 77LiNeBrEaKLife expectancy has increased by nearly three years in recent decades, according to a study. About five months of that increase may come from cleaner air.LiNeBrEaKLife expectancyLiNeBrEaK1978-82: 74. 3 yearsLiNeBrEaK1997-2001: 77 yearsLiNeBrEaKSource: The New England Journal of Medicine 		RESEARCH REPORTS (92%); AIR QUALITY (90%); AIR POLLUTION (89%); LIFE EXPECTANCY (89%); RESPIRATORY DISEASE (77%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL ILLNESS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (71%); CITIES (71%); SMOKING (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (51%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (50%) LIFE EXPECTANCY; LONGEVITY; POLLUTION  	BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY (58%)  	BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY (58%); NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE (57%); WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (54%)  		NORTHEAST USA (93%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			NEWSPAPER  	2009 Gannett Company, Inc.

Walla Walla Union-Bulletin (Washington)  	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	Carbon sequestration drilling begins  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1128 words  	Jan. 22--WALLULA -- For the next several months the sensory experience of a drive past Boise Inc. will include sound: the rumbling of a giant drill boring into the ground.LiNeBrEaKDrilling has commenced on a scientific test at the property to determine whether the area's unique geography can play a role in the reduction of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"What you see behind us is the culmination of about five years of effort," said Peter McGrail, the Battelle scientist leading the project, during a visit to Boise's pulp and paper mill Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKOver the growling of the drill &not;--- a towering piece of equipment sandwiched between Boise's mill and the overpass on U.S. Highway 12 -- McGrail explained how a "germ of an idea" funded with a small lab endowment has grown into a more than $10 million study. LiNeBrEaKThe Wallula Basalt Field Study Pilot will test to see if the deep basalt that lies 3,000 to 4,000 feet underground -- far below any potable water -- can be used to store and mineralize carbon dioxide, the gas most associated with climate change.LiNeBrEaKHere's how McGrail, Boise and teams of scientists and partners expect plans to unfold: Over the next few months, the drilling will continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week. McGrail said officials will know when they've reached the right injection spot based on two key factors: sufficient permeability for the liquid carbon dioxide to move laterally and react with water already trapped in the rock, and a hard layer of basalt to serve as a cap rock and prevent the carbon dioxide from traveling toward the surface.LiNeBrEaKIf the site characterization shows that testing is safe and permitting is approved by the Department of Ecology, Battelle will then inject 1,000 tons of liquid carbon dioxide into the well. The injection phase is expected sometime late spring or early summer. After that would begin a 12- to 15-month monitoring phase. Scientists would collect water samples to track the change in the chemistry of the carbon dioxide as it reacts with the basalt.LiNeBrEaKMcGrail believes it will eventually convert to calcium carbonate, the substance that makes up limestone.LiNeBrEaKHe said if Battelle can verify the conversion is taking place -- as it has done in lab tests -- partners will have the confidence to move on to the next phase, which is commercial-scale testing of 1 million tons of liquid carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThat test, part of the Bozeman, Mont.,-based Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership, is slated for land in southwestern Wyoming, said Lindsey Waggoner, Big Sky's outreach coordinator. She said a project of that scale would require eight to 10 years of study.LiNeBrEaKThe project in Walla Walla County has been contentious at times. The pilot study was originally slated for Port of Walla Walla land in 2007, but was met with outcry in the community because proponents of a coal-fueled power plant simultaneously planned to pursue an operation here based on the results of the study.LiNeBrEaKLocal residents wanted the Port to deny Battelle, a global and science technology agency, access to its land so the power plant couldn't move forward. Though the plant expected to use the carbon sequestration technology, citizens said it would introduce other pollutants in the community at a time when more alternative energy sources could be pursued.LiNeBrEaKBattelle was able to complete a $700,000 seismic test on the Port property before the project stalled. The results of that test also applied to the Boise property, which is just across the highway from where the project was originally proposed.LiNeBrEaKWaggoner said eyes and ears across the globe will be on this project because it is one of the only study sites in the U.S. involving basalt formations. Other studies are largely focused on saline or sandstone formations, Waggoner added.LiNeBrEaK"This one has worldwide implications and international attention," she said.LiNeBrEaKMcGrail said the project could also have local applications. He said every 70,000 cases of wine produced generates about 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide. A company could feasibly form to collect the carbon dioxide from wineries around the region for the injection process.LiNeBrEaKFor the sake of the Wallula pilot test, McGrail said the liquid carbon dioxide will likely not be local. He said the test requires pure carbon dioxide, which will probably come from a refinery in Blaine, Wash. The carbon dioxide can be brought in by rail.LiNeBrEaKAs fate would have it, the Boise property has an active rail spur just near the well. McGrail said a hose would be connected to the rail car and the liquid carbon dioxide could be easily injected.LiNeBrEaK"There is no place else with the opportunity to do that," he marveled.LiNeBrEaKFor its part, Boise will benefit from site characterization work at its own property. Rob Roxburgh, communications manager for the plant, said the science may be used to help Boise determine its own options for managing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThough the plant has allowed Battelle access to its land, he said it has no relationship with proponents of a power plant.LiNeBrEaKHe said Battelle's work will also save the company the cost of testing the basalt that lies underground.LiNeBrEaKTest samples from the basalt layers, created by lava flows over millions of years, are taken roughly every 10 feet, said Charlotte Sullivan, a geologist for Battelle. She said everything is recorded for permanent record. Samples are furnished to the state Department of Ecology and also kept for other organizations to study, including universities and colleges.LiNeBrEaKOne of the more interesting samples was taken from about 205 feet deep. Believed to be about 8 million years old, the sample includes seed pods and twisty wood pieces that can be seen under a microscope.LiNeBrEaKSullivan, reportedly the first geologist to complete a successful basalt seismic study for carbon sequestration, said the results of the Wallula study won't automatically pave the way for commercial application.LiNeBrEaK"In 12 to 18 months, we will be able to say whether the process works," she said. "But commercial application would be at least three years away."LiNeBrEaKSullivan said anyone who wanted to site an operation would need "a lot more characterization and a lot more study."LiNeBrEaKStill, Battelle scientists are thrilled to be testing what they've been studying in their labs on a much smaller scale.LiNeBrEaK"It's been a long road coming," McGrail said.

The Washington Post 	January 22, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	Legislators Consider Ban on Plastic Shopping Bags  	METRO; Pg. B04  	536 words  	Virginia might once and for all put an end to that nagging question: Paper or plastic?LiNeBrEaKLegislators are considering banning plastic bags at grocery stores and chain retailers such as Target and Wal-Mart because of their potential harm to the environment. LiNeBrEaKThe ubiquitous bags are blamed for choking birds and fish, floating into trees, rooftops and streets and sticking around years longer than paper.LiNeBrEaK"We're wasting energy. We're polluting," said Del. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria).LiNeBrEaKVirginia is not known for progressive environmental policy, but some lawmakers want to help the state find a place in the green movement.LiNeBrEaKOne proposal would force stores to ban thin, single-use bags and allow only sturdy, reusable bags. Others would require stores to recycle plastic bags or charge customers a nickel for every bag the customers receive, and the money would go toward cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay.LiNeBrEaK"It's one smart thing we can do," said Glen Besa, director of the Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed ban did not originate with environmental groups. The discussion started last year, when cotton farmers in eastern Virginia discovered that bags floated into their equipment, damaging machines and diminishing the cotton's quality. They formed the Virginia Plastic Bag Coalition to look into the issue.LiNeBrEaK"It's mushroomed into a real strong movement," said Del. William K. Barlow (D-Isle of Wight), whose district includes cotton farms.LiNeBrEaKState and local governments across the nation have been focusing on plastic bags for years as they search for ways to protect the environment, curb global warming and reform a disposable-minded society. Americans use more than 90 billion plastic bags a year, and only a fraction get recycled.LiNeBrEaKMore than 100 proposals were debated across the country last year, filling the pages of the industry newspaper Plastics News.LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco banned plastic bags in 2007, and a few smaller cities followed. But bans have failed in dozens of other places, many of which instead mandated bag recycling at stores and malls.LiNeBrEaKAnnapolis and Maryland considered bans in 2007, but the proposals died. The District has not considered a ban but has recently started allowing plastic bags to be recycled.LiNeBrEaKThe plastic bag industry association has been lobbying against bans and taxes across the nation.LiNeBrEaKProgressive Bag Affiliates say that plastic bags require less energy to make, transport and recycle than paper bags; that they take up less space at landfills; and that they can be recycled into construction materials, decking and bags.LiNeBrEaK"There is a lot of misinformation out there," said Keith Christman, who heads up Progressive Bag Affiliates for the American Chemistry Council. "The challenge is to get the correct information out there."LiNeBrEaKPlastic bag manufacturers, along with groups representing stores, are encouraging recycling instead of restrictions.LiNeBrEaKMargaret Ballard of the Virginia Retail Federation said that stores would prefer to start recycling programs before laws are passed.LiNeBrEaK"It's very costly for retailers to wipe out plastic bags," she said. "And consumers are not educated about recycling. They don't know what their other options are."LiNeBrEaKStaff researcher Meg Smith contributed to this report.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 22, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: January 22 Editorial  	COMMENTARY  	397 words  	Jan. 22--Respect for life goes for an animal's life, tooLiNeBrEaKThe plight of the polar bear has been well documented and publicized recently. As grim as that situation is, climate change and environmental pollution also affect other animals. Just look off our coastline for evidence. LiNeBrEaKThe Pacific gray whale's southbound migration to its Baja California winter breeding and calving grounds has become more lengthy, according to Michele Sousa, the senior marine mammal biologist at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach.LiNeBrEaK"What we're seeing is that a lot of the animals are having to go further north to get their food ... [and they] go up further because it's not in their normal places," Sousa told the News during a recent interview. "Then, when they make the trip back, that's why we think we're seeing some increases in births en route, instead of waiting to get to Baja."LiNeBrEaKAnd, fin whales, the second largest mammal, are feeding longer off of our coast.LiNeBrEaK"Something has definitely changed here with the ocean current and the climate for these whales to stay so late ... For some reason, there's quite a bit of food here," said Dan Salas, a Rancho Palos Verdes resident and captain of Harbor Breeze Cruises.LiNeBrEaKFeeding here may not be all that beneficial for them though. Marine life -- great and small -- suffer at the hands of humans through ocean pollution.LiNeBrEaKToxins, trash and an unbelievable amount of plastic end up in our ocean.LiNeBrEaKSome marine life mistake plastic for food. For example, a plastic bag under water resembles a jellyfish.LiNeBrEaKOther aquatic life, like whales, are filter feeders and trash can lodge in their baleens (furry plates on either side of their mouth that trap the food source, while allowing water to leave).LiNeBrEaKThe injury to one species affects another species. Being that humans are at top of the animal kingdom, it is up to us to rule with conscience. It is up to us to protect and preserve our environment and the wildlife that lives in it.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	2009 LEGISLATIVE SESSION: ?Year of Fiscal Restraint'  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	651 words  	Jan. 21--SANTA FE -- Gov. Bill Richardson said it should be the "year of fiscal restraint," but also called for action on issues ranging from alternative energy to domestic partnerships as a 60-day session of the New Mexico Legislature convened Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKRichardson said New Mexico faces a new challenge in 2009 -- "the biggest global financial crisis of our lifetime." New Mexico is faring better than other states, he said, but "pessimism will not solve this crisis." LiNeBrEaKThe Democratic governor laid out an extensive agenda for the state's 112 part-time lawmakers in his State of the State address to a joint House and Senate session at the Capitol.LiNeBrEaKHe said he'll push to expand tax incentives to lure jobs to New Mexico and vowed not to let a slumping economy damage the state's education and health care systems.LiNeBrEaK"Our task must be to keep building a vibrant, optimistic New Mexico that looks over the horizon with hope and anticipation," Richardson said during his 38-minute speech.LiNeBrEaKThe first concern of some legislative leaders, however, is dealing with declining revenues and state budget deficits -- for the current and coming year -- and some expressed skepticism after hearing Richardson's speech.LiNeBrEaK"What he confuses pessimism with is fiscal prudence," said Sen. John Arthur Smith, D-Deming, the chairman of the Legislative Finance Committee. "The governor is fantastic on creating new initiatives ... and short on how they're going to be funded."LiNeBrEaKRepublicans said previous spending levels likely won't be sustainable.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be very easy to say no on a lot of these programs," said House Minority Leader Tom Taylor, R-Farmington.LiNeBrEaK"I think (Richardson) recognizes we've got a problem with the dollars," added Senate Minority Leader Stuart Ingle, R-Portales.LiNeBrEaKHouse Majority Leader Ken Martinez, D-Grants, complimented Richardson's speech and called his agenda comprehensive, but said the new initiatives need to be scrutinized.LiNeBrEaK"My summary of it is we should be cautiously optimistic," Martinez said. Richardson's call for action on a widerange of issues included:LiNeBrEaKn Bolstering the economy by creating new jobs; constructing a "Green Grid" to capitalize on renewable technologies; and forming a task force to bridge gender and racial wage gaps.LiNeBrEaKn Pass a "New Mexico Global Warming Solutions Act."LiNeBrEaKn Hire new State Police officers and increasing drunken driving penalties. Driving while under the influence of drugs also would be targeted.LiNeBrEaKn Enacting new ethics laws.LiNeBrEaKn Revising the state's public school funding formula.LiNeBrEaKn Fully extend domestic partnership rights.LiNeBrEaKn Consolidate management of public employee and retiree insurance programs; require insurance companies to cover everyone regardless of health status; mandate that 85 percent of insurance premiums be spent on medical services.LiNeBrEaKR ich a r d s on , who h ad planned to join President Barack Obama's Cabinet as commerce secretary before withdrawing his nomination Jan. 4 because of a federal grand jury investigation involving his administration, was greeted by a standing ovation Tuesday. But applause seemed tepid during and after his address.LiNeBrEaKRichardson alluded only briefly to the Cabinet developments, joking at the outset of his speech that, "I know there are some legislators who were looking forward to my departure, and not having to deal with me this session.

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: President Obama: Inaugural speech points the country in right direction  	COMMENTARY  	399 words  	Jan. 21--President Obama's inaugural speech didn't offer the most stirring rhetoric and his delivery was more somber than inspiring, but he did what a leader must do -- point the country in the right direction. He made clear we're going to get to work fixing the economy. Not just by dumping money out of the government treasury but with investments that pay long-term dividends. LiNeBrEaKWe're going to leave Iraq on responsible terms and shift our security focus where it belongs -- Afghanistan. He rejected the notion that we must sacrifice our ideals to be safe as a nation.LiNeBrEaKWith President Obama, we're going to take global warming seriously and we're going to stop sending so many petrodollars to renegade regimes that stoke hatred of the west.LiNeBrEaKThe hands-off approach to the excesses of the Marketplace will end. His government will be more open and accountable. The nation's education will improve. Health care will be more affordable.LiNeBrEaKThe question, he said, "is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works."LiNeBrEaKPrecisely.LiNeBrEaKHe reminded us that the nation "cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous." But he's offering a hand up, not a handout. We'll extend opportunity, not guarantee results, he said.LiNeBrEaKWe will rebuild alliances and lead the world again by our example, by living out our values. We'll do right by poor nations and accept an olive branch from potential adversaries, but woe unto those who induce terror and slaughter innocents: "We will defeat you," he warned.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama made history just by being the first African-American to take the oath of office. He made only brief reference to the occasion though. Instead he let the force of his example make the point.LiNeBrEaKIn acknowledging the grim times while lighting the path forward, President Obama outlined the right vision for the country. Now let's hope he, and we, are up to the challenge of seeing it through.LiNeBrEaKBOTTOM LINE: President Obama knows what needs to be done. Let's get started.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   Main Edition	Barack Hussein Obama: 44th president of the United States;  INAUGURATION 2009: 'A new era of responsibility';  Obama's historic inauguration lifts crowd, looks to challenges	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	231 words  	Washington --- With the eyes of the world upon him and a sea of Americans before him, Barack Obama took the oath of office as the nation's 44th president Tuesday, shattering the country's history of racial inequality and promising it hope for a national and economic revival. LiNeBrEaKUnder a sunny sky on a cold day in the nation's capital, he pledged to lead the U.S. out of the worst economic times since the Great Depression.LiNeBrEaK"Today, I say to you that the challenges we face are real," Obama said in an inaugural speech that touched on equality and tolerance as well as the threats of terrorism and global warming. "They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America --- they will be met."LiNeBrEaKA crowd of more than 1 million packed the National Mall to hear the new president, hanging on his words of optimism and his calls for "a new era of responsibility," growing silent on his warnings of tough times ahead, chanting his name in anticipation and cheering "yes, we can" as he spoke.LiNeBrEaKThe historic inauguration came with a Georgia flavor. Atlanta's the Rev. Joseph Lowery, an icon of the civil rights movement who marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gave the benediction. He quoted from an African-American anthem on equality and prayed for the protection of the new president and his family and for "the joy of a new beginning."

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	In troubled times, Obama strikes a somber tone  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A18  	653 words  	President Barack Obama's inaugural speech on Tuesday had all the flourishes of inspiration we would expect on such an occasion and from such a powerful orator who touted the arrival of a new generation of Americans. Listen closely, though, and you also heard a strong undercurrent of warning - even admonishment - to the American people.LiNeBrEaKOn a cold but brilliantly lighted day, the new president summed up well the dangers and dissatisfaction facing the nation as he took office, citing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and an economy in recession. And, he said, "our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet." LiNeBrEaKJust as worrisome, Obama said, was "a sapping of confidence across our land - a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights."LiNeBrEaKOf course, Obama, as any new president would, promised that the challenges would be conquered by hard work, wise policies and faith in the future - that better days are to come.LiNeBrEaKBut there was also a more subtle message of admonishment, perhaps even rebuke. The United States is a young nation, he said, but "in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things." Just what those are he didn't say.LiNeBrEaKObama also said that "our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed."LiNeBrEaKAgain, he didn't say what "unpleasant decisions" he had in mind.LiNeBrEaKWe suspect, we hope, that this was not a partisan rebuke to Obama's predecessor, but a warning that his administration will take on such enormous problems as future funding of Social Security and Medicare, global warming and providing and paying for health care to Americans without health insurance. (President George W. Bush, to be sure, took on Social Security, but his approach was rejected by the American people.)LiNeBrEaKIn part, Obama's speech certainly was a direct rebuke to the Republican Party's decades of anti-government rhetoric and Bush's administration of that government over the past eight years. , Obama said that the question asked today "is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works."LiNeBrEaKThe November election results showed that a majority of Americans didn't think it was working.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, Obama took a practical, does-it-work-for-the-people stance toward the free market ideology that has governed economic policy for the past several decades. While the free market remains unparalleled in its ability to produce wealth and broaden freedom, he said, "this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control - and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous."LiNeBrEaKAnd while the economy was damaged "by greed and irresponsibility on the part of some," Obama said, it was also damaged by "our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age." Once more, he did not say what those hard choices were.LiNeBrEaKWe are glad to hear Obama's assurance that America need not compromise its commitment to human rights and common decency to fight terrorists. This, too, was a rebuke to the past eight years, when he said that "our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please."LiNeBrEaKObama said this would be a "new era of responsibility," a phrase not likely to ring through American history like New Deal or New Frontier, though many Americans will welcome his emphasis on the duties, as well as the privileges and rights, of citizenship.LiNeBrEaKThe speech is over, though, and the first real test of Obama's leadership will come not when he tries to deliver something more for the American people but calls for giving up something, and tax cuts don't count as sacrifice. What hard choices and unpleasant decisions will he bring to the American people?

Birmingham News (Alabama) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	RINGS AND WEATHER Mountain Brook students study climate through trees  	COMMUNITY NEWS; Pg. 1S Vol. 121 No. 314  	567 words  	A Mountain Brook High School science class is studying climate change, one tree at a time.LiNeBrEaKScience teacher Tony Derriso is using an $8,500 grant from Toyota's Tapestry Program to get 11th- and 12th-graders looking for centuries-old weather information.LiNeBrEaKThe study is simple. A tree's age can be counted by its rings, with each ring indicating one year of life. Some rings are wider that others, meaning the tree probably got better water and climate during that particular year. By examining a tree's rings, any observer with the right know-how can see how old the tree is and trace its development over decades. LiNeBrEaKTo study climate change, however, means looking at climate - long-term weather conditions over several centuries, not year-byyear temperatures. The problem is that, for Alabama at least, daily consistent temperature records exist only back to about 1895, Derriso said.LiNeBrEaKTo get an idea of actual climate change, scientists have to use paleoclimatology - studying tree rings, ice cores, lake sedimentation and coral reefs to get an idea of what conditions were like before temperatures were recorded.LiNeBrEaK''These are natural archives,'' Derriso said. ''And to my knowledge, this sort of thing has never been done in the Birmingham area.''LiNeBrEaKAbout 70 students are taking part in the study, which is using loblolly pines that grow in abundance on the high school campus. Students bore into trees using a tool and extracted a piece of wood about the size of a pencil, which shows the individual rings inside the trees. Derriso said the process takes only a few minutes and does not harm the trees.LiNeBrEaK''It's a standard forestry procedure that's generally used to check the health of a forest,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKThe ring samples are then sanded down and examined under a stereo microscope with a camera. Using a computer program, students canLiNeBrEaKmeasure the rings down to 1/ 10,000th of an inch. Then, using the ring measurements and comparing them with existing temperature records, students can build a weather chronology, Derriso said.LiNeBrEaK''If the tree ring was a particular width for a year that we have temperature measurements on, then we can guess pretty reliably what the weather was like for a year we don't have records on,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKThe first time Preston Ratliff, 17, attempted to get a tree sample, he wasn't sure it was going to work.LiNeBrEaK''You may realize you're going in at an angle instead of getting a straight, good sample,'' he said. ''Then you get used to it.''LiNeBrEaKAs the class gathers its information, students will publish their findings on a Web site being assembled by Stephanie Browdy, 17. The site is still in its basic stages, but Derriso hopes to link it with the International Tree Ring Data Bank, a project of the World Center for Paleoclimatology. The data bank gathers tree ring information from all over the world to compare climate patterns.LiNeBrEaK Browdy said the class will try to make their findings accessible and easy to understand.LiNeBrEaK''What we hope is that there will be interaction with other teachers so they can share and exchange their tree information,'' she said.LiNeBrEaKDerriso said the best part of the project is that students are not doing an exercise to show how science works, but actual scientific research.LiNeBrEaK''This will be publishable data, and we don't know what the outcome will be,'' he said.

The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	President Obama issues a nationwide call to duty: Inaugural speech cites past sacrifices, ?work to be done'  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1607 words  	Jan. 21--WASHINGTON -- Barack Hussein Obama II, sworn in yesterday as the 44th president of the United States and the first black to hold the nation's highest office, told Americans they had "chosen hope over fear" and said now would begin the task of "remaking America."LiNeBrEaK"What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly," Mr. Obama, 47, said after taking the Constitutional oath of office on the Bible used by President Abraham Lincoln in 1861.LiNeBrEaKHe took the oath on the West steps of the Capitol on a sunny but cold day with highs in the 20s before a crowd estimated at more than a million people. LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama thanked Republican George W. Bush for a graceful transition. After the ceremony, Mr. Bush and his family left for Texas, while Mr. Obama went into the Capitol for a luncheon before the inaugural parade.LiNeBrEaKIn the evening, the festivities were to continue with 10 regional balls. Ohio would be represented in the Midwestern States Ball.LiNeBrEaKYesterday morning, Mr. Obama and his family attended a private service at St. John's Episcopal Church, then went to the White House for coffee with outgoing President Bush and his wife.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama set a tone of service in his speech, promising to carry on the nation's dream of freedom and opportunity.LiNeBrEaKHe indicated that the nation's economic recovery would be difficult, that he would pursue it while trying to set aside "worn-out dogmas," but would also pursue those issues that got him elected: health care, global warming, and better schools.LiNeBrEaKHe promised to reach out to foes, Muslim nations, and people of poor nations, while also warning potential aggressors of America's resolve. In his 18-minute inaugural speech, Mr. Obama said America is as productive and inventive as ever.LiNeBrEaK"But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions -- that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America," Mr. Obama said.LiNeBrEaKHe summed up the state of the nation in a paragraph:LiNeBrEaK"That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many, and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet."LiNeBrEaKThe new President also laid out the major indicators by which success would be measured:LiNeBrEaK"The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works -- whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end," he said.LiNeBrEaKCiting the words of Gen. George Washington during the American Revolution, Mr. Obama said, "With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come.''LiNeBrEaKHe continued, "Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations."LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama also warned America's enemies.LiNeBrEaK"We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you," Mr. Obama said.LiNeBrEaKHe acknowledged his status as the first black to be elected president.LiNeBrEaK"This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath," he said.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama takes office with the United States at war against insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq, and with the economy in a severe recession.LiNeBrEaKHis road to the White House involved primary battles against John Edwards, Dennis Kucinich, Bill Richardson, Joe Biden, and Hillary Clinton, the favorite for the nomination, with a combination of a disciplined organization, a charismatic style, and a message of hope and change.LiNeBrEaKIn the general election, he defeated Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, carrying Ohio and Michigan.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama is the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas.LiNeBrEaKHis parents divorced when he was young, and Mr. Obama grew up with his mother and grandparents, mostly in Hawaii but also in Indonesia.LiNeBrEaKHe was elected to the Illinois Senate from Chicago in 1997 and to the U.S. Senate in 2004.LiNeBrEaKSince his election in November, Mr. Obama has largely stayed out of commenting on international affairs, especially the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.LiNeBrEaKBut in recent weeks he sought to set the tone for an economic recovery, working on a proposed $825 billion stimulus package.LiNeBrEaKA swarm on the mallLiNeBrEaKBefore dawn, people began swarming streets outside the protected National Mall area. Many could not get close enough even to watch the proceedings on the jumbo TV screens, leaving the possibility of a glimpse of the parade as it proceeded from the Capitol to the White House.LiNeBrEaKThose who stuck to their plan of leaving early were the most successful in getting to the National Mall.LiNeBrEaKDavid Young, director of the University of Toledo's Toledo Excel high school scholarship program, said his group was out of its Maryland hotel by 4: 30 a.m., and all 44 students and adult chaperones found a place on the mall.LiNeBrEaK"There's some Jumbotrons around us so we've got a pretty good spot," he said.LiNeBrEaKAnn Studer, who arrived with her husband, Mike, and three children, reported in a texted message to The Blade, "We made it into the Capitol grounds to our spot. What an awesome place to be at this place in time."LiNeBrEaKKyle Stanley, 17, of Waterville, who was on the Mall with 46 other students and adults from St. Francis de Sales High School, said being among so many people "was definitely inspiring and uplifting."LiNeBrEaKHe said he and some of his classmates were surprised by the booing and singing of good-bye that accompanied Mr. Bush's departure.LiNeBrEaK"I thought there might be some short of display, but I didn't think to the level that was shown," young Stanley said.LiNeBrEaKToledoan in paradeLiNeBrEaKAt least one Toledoan was in the inaugural parade.LiNeBrEaKWalter Isom, a chief petty officer in the Coast Guard, led the Coast Guard honor guard, the last of the four military branch honor guards that preceded the motorcade.LiNeBrEaK"This is a big part of American history right now with Obama being the president. It's a great opportunity for myself; it's a great opportunity for America to see history go down," said Mr. Isom, 34, a graduate of Start High School stationed at Fort Belvoir, Va.LiNeBrEaKToledoan Bob Moore, 71, who is black, said he had to come to the inauguration because "the fact that Barack Obama became President and the campaign was so unbelievable that I figured it was the right time to come down and be a part of history.LiNeBrEaK"It was nice to see. It was something I never thought I'd see in my lifetime," said Mr. Moore. He said the wait to get into the ticketed area was "like a can of sardines." People were packed so close it kept them warm, but he said they showed camaraderie.LiNeBrEaKHe got downtown about 8: 45 a.m., but didn't reach his spot on the Capitol grounds until nearly 11: 30 a.m.LiNeBrEaK'Organized chaos'LiNeBrEaKWilliAnn Moore, president of the Toledo branch of the NAACP, who is unrelated to Bob Moore, said the crowd was "mad, organized chaos," but there was no cursing or discourtesy.LiNeBrEaK"Everyone was here because they want this world to change," Mrs. Moore said. "Being the great-granddaughter of a slave I am truly, truly elated. You don't know the feeling I have at this moment. I am here today to witness a black child that looks like my child and is my child's age accept the presidency of the United States of America."LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Teresa Fedor (D., Toledo) said Mr. Obama's speech was "inspiring and spoke to people in ways that said we have a lot of challenges and we're going to face those challenges and rebuild America."LiNeBrEaK"I feel as though there's a spirit of the people taking back the country," she said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Rep. Bob Latta (R., Bowling Green) said Mr. Obama lived up to his reputation as a great speaker, but said he's concerned about the details of what's to come.LiNeBrEaK"I think that he laid out a broad vision for the country so I think that in the next several weeks we're going to see what the details are," said Mr. Latta, who watched the ceremony with his wife, Marcia.LiNeBrEaKContact Tom Troy at:tomtroy@theblade.comor 419-724-6058.

The Boston Herald 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   ALL EDITIONS	C's get it together  	SPORTS; Pg. 048  	586 words  	They still don't have that same air of invincibility as during that 19-game winning streak. Like the rest of the NBA, the Celtics are caught somewhere between heaven and Secaucus.LiNeBrEaKBut with five straight wins, the last a total eclipse of the Suns, there's been a global warming of the Shamrock planet.LiNeBrEaK``Yeah. I mean, we're obviously not where we want to be, but we're starting to trend in the right direction,'' said coach Doc Rivers, whose lads take on the Heat tonight in the start of a two-game Florida swing. ``You could see it even in that last loss to Cleveland. I said then I liked where we were going. Now we've won a few and this is a great week for us. We've got some tough games, Miami and then Orlando and Dallas. We got off the track for a little while and gave some people a little hope. Now we have to keep improving and try to dash that hope.'' LiNeBrEaKIf anything, the 104-87 decision against Phoenix helped dash the notion the league has found the blueprint to ground the Green. The theory was based on guarding Rajon Rondo with a bigger player and smothering his drives (and kick-outs to shooters). But Rondo and the Celts have found the best, and perhaps only, way to combat that is to fight fire with speed. And experience.LiNeBrEaK``There is no blueprint,'' Rivers said. ``Different guys will guard him, and they're going to help different ways off of him. He's got to figure that out and he will. He just went through a tough stretch, but he's figured the quicker he is in games, the less they can help off of him. But when the game gets down to the last four minutes and they slow it down, that's where he still is working on trying to be a threat.''LiNeBrEaKAll agree, however, the threat begins at the other end of the floor.LiNeBrEaK``We have to run to be effective, especially Rajon,'' Rivers said. ``And to do that we have to get stops. We're killing Rondo if we don't get multiple stops, consecutive stops.''LiNeBrEaKAfter scoring 23 points and orchestrating an up-tempo symphony against the Suns, the little guy is looking much healthier.LiNeBrEaK``With the way some teams are playing me, it makes stops more important,'' Rondo said, ``because if you don't get stops then they get to set their defense up and they get to use their game plan. I think transition is where we can really get things done if we do it right. I've just got to pick and choose when I can be aggressive.LiNeBrEaK``It's the same as when we were on our long winning streak. I was trying to get everyone the ball and make everyone happy, but at times I have to be aggressive in the offensive end and keep the defenses honest. So it's something that goes back and forth.LiNeBrEaK``Hopefully I can get it together on a more consistent basis.''LiNeBrEaKDuring the span of seven losses in nine games, Rondo willingly stepped up to take the heat.LiNeBrEaK``I don't consider it pressure, but I take a lot of the blame when things don't go well,'' he said. ``I just look myself in the mirror and try to get better. That's how it should be. I think it's fair. I'm the point guard. I'm the leader of the team, you know, whether I like it or not. People may consider (Kevin Garnett), Paul (Pierce) and Ray (Allen) the leaders, but I'm the point guard of the team. When things aren't going well, I've got to make the adjustments and make the right decisions.''LiNeBrEaKAnd he's fine with whatever defense gets thrown his way. ``Teams are putting a bigger guy on me, but that's really nothing new,'' Rondo said. ``The Lakers put Kobe (Bryant) on me in The Finals.''LiNeBrEaKAnd that seemed to work out all right.LiNeBrEaK- sbulpett@bostonherald.com		BASKETBALL (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%)  		BOSTON CELTICS (84%); PHOENIX SUNS (58%); DALLAS MAVERICKS (56%)  		MIAMI, FL, USA (72%) FLORIDA, USA (72%) UNITED STATES (72%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Boston Herald Inc.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Spring arriving almost 2 days earlier than it did 50 years ago, scientists find  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	563 words  	CHICAGO _ In the throes of a severe winter, an earlier spring may seem welcome. But be careful what you wish for.LiNeBrEaKThough researchers reported Wednesday that spring indeed has inched earlier by almost two days over the past 50 years, scientists warn that such seasonal drift could have catastrophic ecological consequences.LiNeBrEaKTo measure the seasons, the study looked at temperatures in locations around the world and compared them to the distance between the sun and the Earth at different times of the year. LiNeBrEaKHow close the Earth comes to the sun as it travels on its orbit mediates the planet's cyclical warming and cooling. Though that pattern never changes, the timing of seasons has moved forward 1. 7 days since 1957, the authors calculated.LiNeBrEaKWhy? Alexander Stine, a University of California-Berkeley graduate student who led the study, suspects the sun's distance from the Earth now affects the planet more quickly, leading to earlier springs and falls.LiNeBrEaKNormally, changes in the Earth's surface temperature take about a month to kick in _ for example, the hottest day of the year occurs about 30 days following the summer equinox, when the planet is closest to the sun.LiNeBrEaKBut various factors may have shortened that lag time, Stine said. Reduced moisture levels in the soil, for instance, could mean faster changes in temperature because drier soil heats and cools faster, as seen in the desert. More man-made aerosols in the atmosphere may also have an effect by altering how much of the sun's energy reaches Earth.LiNeBrEaKStine said the seasonal change appears to be accelerating, noting that the majority of the drift has occurred since 1981. "Really the last 27 years stand out as being different from anywhere previous in the record," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe team's analysis also found a decrease in the difference between average temperatures in summer and winter, predominantly because of higher temperatures during winter.LiNeBrEaKWhile warmer winters and earlier springs may sound nice in January, scientists have already observed that changing seasonal patterns are affecting Earth's plant and animal populations.LiNeBrEaKSome think the seasons are shifting even more rapidly than the new study suggests.LiNeBrEaKMark Schwartz, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee climatologist, said his own research on the blooming of lilacs indicates spring is moving earlier by slightly more than a day each decade.LiNeBrEaK"When these kind of changes are happening, you start to create a ripple effect," Schwartz said. "That begins to have ecological implications from the point of view of survival of species."LiNeBrEaKStine said he hopes his study will lead researchers to examine the effect of climate change on various temperature patterns around the world, as well as overall changes in temperature.LiNeBrEaK"If we're trying to make projections for how the planet will respond as it warms, one of the things we're all concerned about is whether there are some surprises that will change the Earth in unexpected ways," Stine said.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Two new studies find shift in Earth's temperatures over past 50 years  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	493 words  	CHICAGO _ The news might seem welcome in the middle of a long, cold winter: Scientists have shown that the start of spring has moved almost two days earlier in the past 50 years. LiNeBrEaKBut scientists say the finding, one of two papers released Wednesday on climate change, is actually a warning sign. Together, the studies bolster the argument that the planet's temperatures have shifted significantly in the last half-century, with many of the potential consequences likely to be negative.LiNeBrEaKReporting in the scientific journal Nature, two teams of scientists presented evidence that all seasons are occurring earlier worldwide and that more of Antarctica is showing signs of warming than had been thought.LiNeBrEaKThe seasonal study, from the University of California-Berkeley and Harvard University, compared temperature data in regions around the world to the distance between the sun and Earth at various points in time.LiNeBrEaKThe information showed that warming temperatures associated with spring, as well as autumnal cooling, have moved forward by 1. 7 days from 1954 to 2007. Such a shift is not seen anywhere else in temperature records stretching back to the 19th century, and much of the change appears to have occurred since 1981, said the lead author, Berkeley graduate student Alexander Stine.LiNeBrEaK"Really, the last 27 years stand out as being different from anywhere previous in the record," Stine said.LiNeBrEaKThe other report, led by University of Washington climatologist Eric Steig, addresses previous observations that only the northwestern peninsula of Antarctica has shown significant warming over the past 40 years, while the bulk of the continent appeared to be cooling.LiNeBrEaKThose measurements were fixed on by climate change skeptics who are unconvinced that the planet is undergoing a universal warming trend.LiNeBrEaKBut by adding satellite data to temperatures collected from weather stations in Antarctica from 1957 to 2006, Steig's team found that a large portion of western Antarctica has been warming at a rate of 0. 17 degrees Celsius per decade, roughly double the global warming rate in the past century.LiNeBrEaKSteig cautioned that the limitations of the data make it hard to predict future temperature changes in the region. But if warming is occurring across a wider area than previously observed, that could increase the possibility of large ice shelves melting off the continent and changing sea levels around the world.LiNeBrEaK"This study showing warming means we can't be complacent about thinking the West Antarctica ice sheet is invulnerable," Steig said. "It will eventually melt if warming like this continues."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Warming extends to eastern Antarctica  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	532 words  	For a decade, climate researchers have argued about temperature change in Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth.LiNeBrEaKThe thin peninsula stretching from the northwest corner of the continent is one of the fastest-warming locations in the world. But scientists also found that the rest of the continent had cooled during the 20th century, a fact seized upon by climate-change skeptics. LiNeBrEaKNow new research has clarified the picture, showing that western Antarctica has warmed at a rapid rate over the last 50 years and eastern Antarctica has also warmed, but more slowly. The study, published Thursday, used satellites to expand upon temperature information measured at Antarctic weather stations.LiNeBrEaKIn western Antarctica, temperatures are rising at a rate of 0. 17 degrees Celsius each decade, almost double the average warming rate around the globe for the last century, the study found. Most of the warming was found to occur in winter and spring.LiNeBrEaKShould the warming continue, the millions of miles of ice covering Antarctica could begin to melt, causing sea levels around the world to rise in the long term, said lead author Eric Steig, a climatologist at the University of Washington.LiNeBrEaK"This warming means we can't be complacent about thinking the West Antarctica ice sheet is invulnerable," Steig said. "It will eventually melt if warming like this continues."LiNeBrEaKScientists who had previously documented cooling across Antarctica's interior applauded the research as providing valuable data that could help predict the impact of further Antarctic warming on the Earth's climate.LiNeBrEaKAmong them is Peter Doran, a climatologist at the University of Illinois-Chicago who said his research has been falsely distorted by those who doubt climate change is happening.LiNeBrEaKThe key issue, he said, is not whether Antarctica as a whole is warming or cooling, because even partial warming is enough to cause alarm.LiNeBrEaK"Really what's important is how does this feed into models as far as sea level rise," Doran said. "The parts that are warming are contributing to sea rise regardless of what's happening on the rest of the continent."LiNeBrEaKDoran said he hopes the new research will help convince the public of the scientific consensus on climate change.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a survey of Earth scientists he conducted with fellow UIC researcher Maggie Kendall Zimmerman, 90 percent believe that mean global temperatures have risen since 1800 and 82 percent say human activity has been a significant contributing factor.LiNeBrEaKThe survey went to more than 10,000 scientists, and more than 3,000 responded. The results appeared this week in the science newspaper EOS.LiNeBrEaK"There are a handful of doubters you see on the news all the time that keep saying it's not real, but really, the vast majority of the climate scientists say it's real," Doran said. "I think that's a powerful conclusion."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	For California, new clout in Obama's tech-friendly administration  	NEWS  	1011 words  	and Mary Anne OstromLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON   Barbara Boxer remembers the "dark days" when California and its issues were dismissed by official Washington with disdain and hostility.LiNeBrEaK"Dianne Feinstein and I joked that it was ABC   anything but California, anyone but California," Boxer said, recalling when the two Democrats joined the Senate in 1993.LiNeBrEaKNow, as California Democrats fill Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration, the state can claim a surge of influence in the new, tech-friendly administration. Congress, too, is looking westward, with Californians taking key positions of power. LiNeBrEaKTwo Californians were named to Obama's Cabinet   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu at the Energy Department and Rep. Hilda Solis at the Labor Department   and Leon Panetta, former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, has been appointed to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.LiNeBrEaKObama also named a pair of Golden Staters to key White House posts: Christina Romer, a Berkeley economist, will chair the Council of Economic Advisers, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, will bring her experience as a state environmental regulator to the job of chairing the Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"These are superstar choices. California is in right now, and we can remember when California was out," Boxer said. "There is a lot more respect for the state, especially on energy issues."LiNeBrEaKShift on tech, energyLiNeBrEaKOn a policy level, it's a shift from oil drilling to renewable energy, from sidestepping the issue of global warming to dealing with it aggressively, from a pro-industry stance to greater sympathy for organized labor.LiNeBrEaKRep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat, measured the change this way: "I remember Gov. Jerry Brown coming to Washington talking about windmills, and people made fun of him. Now everybody is talking about wind energy and solar."LiNeBrEaKCalifornians with deep experience in tech and energy issues, particularly clean technology, have Obama's ear. That includes Eric Schmidt,  chief executive of Google, venture capitalist John Doerr, who is close to Al Gore, and John Thompson, the former Symantec CEO who may be a contender for commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKThat influence can be seen in major ingredients in the $825 billion stimulus package prepared by the House with the Obama team's input. Doerr, for example, lobbied for the $11 billion that would go toward modernizing the electricity grid. Tech groups pushed hard for $6 billion in grants to speed up broadband deployment. Wind-energy advocates secured a long-term extension of the production tax credit.LiNeBrEaKAnd California renewable-energy companies and investors, struggling with the frozen credit market, cheered when Obama announced his goal of doubling the production of renewable energy over the next three years.LiNeBrEaK"I think what the Obama administration intends to do is move the technology that has been pioneered in California across the country," said Cathy Zoi, CEO of Palo Alto-based Alliance for Climate Protection.LiNeBrEaKThe state's new clout should not be viewed in the traditional sense of more "pork" for California, said Norm Ornstein, an author and longtime analyst of government for the American Enterprise Institute. But it will play out in other ways.LiNeBrEaK"There will be a greater sensibility on issues that matter to California and drive the California economy," Ornstein said. "It helps that Obama puts a high priority about keeping the nation's edge on technology, and is listening to Silicon Valley on that."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia-friendlyLiNeBrEaKSome appointees are not from California but tend to view key issues in California-friendly ways. Carol Browner, a top Obama adviser on energy and the environment, supported the state's pioneering regulations as Environmental Protection Agency chief. And Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a graduate of Santa Clara University who has worked on border-state issues, has been named to head the Homeland Security Department.LiNeBrEaKObama is unlikely to cultivate as cozy a relationship with the state as Bill Clinton did, predicted Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College who worked for Republicans during the Reagan and first Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKBut he agrees that just as Reagan-style California conservatism was adopted in Washington in the 1980s, Obama is likely to embrace California-style progressivism.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the 1990s, when Clinton had to deal with a Republican majority in Congress, Democrats now control both branches, with state leaders well-represented   starting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKLofgren, who chairs the immigration subcommittee in the House, knows she can get Napolitano on the phone if there's a problem with the immigration bureaucracy, or she can contact Solis on a labor issue.LiNeBrEaKLofgren chairs the delegation of 34 California Democrats in the House, which met last week and bid farewell to Solis.LiNeBrEaK"There in the room were the chairmen of the Energy Committee (Henry Waxman,) Education and Labor (George Miller), Foreign Affairs (Howard Berman), and Veterans Affairs (Bob Filner)," Lofgren said. "I thought, if you wanted to get something done, come to this room."LiNeBrEaKState labor leaders expect that with Solis in the Cabinet, they will have a friendly ear on minimum-wage and family-leave issues, and other concerns of an increasingly immigrant work force. Solis, from Los Angeles, is the daughter of immigrants and her father was a union worker.LiNeBrEaK"She is very well-connected and can help bridge the gap and the tensions between immigrant workers and other sectors of the community, including some unions," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.LiNeBrEaKBut Pitney, a veteran observer of Washington, warned that Californians looking for rapid change on energy, labor and other issues from Obama and other leaders they just elected may be disappointed.LiNeBrEaK"Electing officials is a lot like shopping online," Pitney said. "Everything looks better when you log on than when the package arrives at the door."LiNeBrEaKReach Frank Davies at mostrom@mercurynews.com or 415-477-3794.

Daily Camera (Boulder, Colorado)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Boulder, Colo., OKs global warming lawsuit settlement  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	507 words  	Jan. 21--BOULDER, Colo. -- Boulder's elected leaders Tuesday night unanimously agreed to settle a lawsuit against two federal agencies that the city, along with other cities and an environmental group, took to court. LiNeBrEaKThe case was an attempt to get the agencies to follow environmental regulations even for projects they fund overseas.LiNeBrEaKMayor Shaun McGrath said the case shows how much the debate over global warming has changed since 2002, when the City Council decided to join the legal fight. For one thing, a new presidential administration much friendlier to the idea of limiting greenhouse gas emissions has just taken office.LiNeBrEaK"I think the wins that we did achieve here were significant," he said. "I also think that it's appropriate for us to settle, given the many changes that have happened. ... I'm confident that the United States is back in the game."LiNeBrEaKBoulder was one of several cities to join the lawsuit, brought by the environmental activist group Friends of the Earth against the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the Export-Import Bank of the United States in 2002.LiNeBrEaKThose two agencies fund billions of dollars' worth of projects -- many of them for exploration for oil and gas -- overseas.LiNeBrEaKThe nonprofit group, along with the cities of Boulder, Arcata, Oakland and Santa Monica, Calif., sued the two agencies to force them to abide by federal regulations -- and to assess the contribution their projects would make to climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, Boulder and the other plaintiffs won a major victory when a federal court judge agreed that they had standing -- that is, the legal right to bring a suit -- on the grounds that the cities could be affected by global warming.LiNeBrEaK"This was the first court opinion that said greenhouse gas emissions in Chad and Saudi Arabia could have an effect on the environment of the United States" and that U.S.-funded projects could therefore be subject to U.S. regulations, assistant city attorney Sue Ellen Harrison said.LiNeBrEaKUnder the terms of the settlement, which still needs a judge's approval, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. agrees to subject all "Category A" projects -- those that would result in the emission of more than 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide -- to federal regulations; report the greenhouse gas emissions of those projects; reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of Category A projects by 20 percent over the next decade; and spend millions annually on renewable-energy projects.LiNeBrEaKThe Export-Import Bank's officials would take similar steps to start addressing the impact of greenhouse gases, and to find ways to reduce them in bank-funded projects, according to the city.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Clean coal a good goal for this session  	COMMENTARY  	398 words  	Jan. 21--Coal became a consuming controversy during the 2007 legislative session. The specter of 16 coal-fired power plants spewing pollutants spawned a slew of bills and had opponents lining up at the Capitol. LiNeBrEaKTwo years later, coal is back and ready for battle.LiNeBrEaKBut this time, lawmakers are touting a cleaner, greener version of the fossil fuel. An assortment of legislators is backing a promising bill that would give tax breaks to companies building clean-coal plants that capture greenhouse gases. Even former Dallas Mayor Laura Miller, the pied piper of coal opponents, stands foursquare behind this proposal.LiNeBrEaKOthers who were on opposite sides two years ago also have found common ground, agreeing that constructing gasification power plants is an important opportunity for Texas.LiNeBrEaKUnlike traditional coal facilities, integrated gasification combined cycle power plants capture and store most of their carbon dioxide emissions. The state, which emits more carbon than most countries, has a chance to be an early adopter and to show that coal done right can be part of the clean-energy mix.LiNeBrEaKBut unless legislators sign off on tax breaks and other incentives, utilities will be hesitant to take on the risks associated with a new technology. Gasification remains relatively untested in the United States and is significantly more expensive than old-fashioned, pollution-intensive plants.LiNeBrEaKMore worrisome should be those traditional coal plants; it's a question of when -- not if -- Congress will regulate greenhouse gases. So, Texas, the carbon king, must begin to consider a new approach to energy.LiNeBrEaKThus far, Austin has balked at making tough decisions to further restrict pollution. More should be done to strengthen environmental regulations and spur renewable energy production.LiNeBrEaKBut it's encouraging that incentives for clean energy have begun to get traction. Lawmakers should pass this gasification legislation, recognizing that it is just one piece of Texas' energy puzzle.

El Paso Times (Texas)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Juarez leaders feel optimistic about Obama  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	517 words  	Jan. 21--Juarez political leaders and residents said Tuesday they have high hopes that the Barack Obama presidency will lead to a positive relationship between the United States and Mexico. LiNeBrEaKMayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Obama has generated a contagious hope in the American people that has spread to Mexico because of the closeness of the two countries.LiNeBrEaKHe said the border has embraced Obama's vision because he and his team understand how to solve the nations' mutual problems. As an example, he cited Obama's appointment of Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as secretary of homeland security.LiNeBrEaK"The appointment of someone who is familiar with the border, and with our trade agreement and other issues, was a wise one, a departure from the past appointment of someone who rarely visited the border and much less understood it," said Reyes Ferriz.LiNeBrEaKJaime Flores Castaneda, president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in Juarez, said the entire PRI committee watched Obama's inauguration on television.LiNeBrEaK"It bodes well for us that Obama met with Mexico's president (Felipe Calderon) before he even took the oath of office," Flores said. "He has aroused a great hope in a nation in economic and financial crisis, and the people there are our neighbors."LiNeBrEaKJuarez resident Normando Sagarnaga, a state board officer of the National Action Party, or PAN, of Chihuahua, said he listened to Obama's speech and believes the United States and Mexico will have a better working relationship than in theLiNeBrEaKpast.LiNeBrEaK"Obama came across as honest and willing to do what he promised," Sagarnaga said. "I hope his administration will be mindful of the labor Mexican immigrants have invested in the United States, and sees to it that people of Mexico are treated fairly and with respect."LiNeBrEaKLorena Edna Fuerte, a political activist in Juarez who is trying to start a new political party, said Obama faces a "titanic" job as a new world leader.LiNeBrEaK"He ought to eliminate war as a policy tool, deal with global warming, and also address the world's food crisis and environmental problems," she said, "as well as work toward generating an international synergy, which will lead to more equal standards of living for everyone."LiNeBrEaKDaniel Rocha, a Juarez labor activist who worked in the maquiladora industry for 20 years, said he believes the direction of the U.S. government will change under Obama.LiNeBrEaK"He has sought a closer relationship with Latinos, and that is great," Rocha said. "We are looking for a U.S.-Mexico relationship that will produce benefits for employees of the maquiladoras, braceros and other workers, and for Mexico and Latin America in general."LiNeBrEaKDiana Washington Valdez may be reached at dvaldez@elpasotimes.com; 546-6140.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	THE OBAMA INAUGURATION;  Regulations put on hold by new chief 	A; Pg. 19  	200 words  	WASHINGTON - One of President Barack Obama's first acts Tuesday was to put the brakes on all pending regulations that the Bush administration tried to push through in its waning days. LiNeBrEaKThe order went out shortly after Obama was inaugurated, in a memorandum signed by new White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.LiNeBrEaKFormer President George W. Bush's administration moved into overdrive in the last year or so on a host of new regulatory proposals. Now the Obama administration will review everything that is still pending.LiNeBrEaKIn some cases, however, the Bush administration moved too fast for the incoming administration. For example, just six weeks ago, the Bush administration issued revised endangered species regulations to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration worked diligently to get the change in place before Obama took over, corralling 15 experts in Washington in October to sort through 250,000 written comments from the public on the revisions in 32 hours. Obama has said he would work to reverse the changes. But because the rule took effect before he was sworn in, he would have to restart the rulemaking process.

The Idaho Statesman (Boise)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Obama reaches out to supporters, skeptics: OUR VIEW OBAMA'S INAUGURATION  	COMMENTARY  	594 words  	Jan. 21--In 19 minutes Tuesday morning, President Obama spoke candidly about our challenges, spoke forcefully to our foes, and spoke stirringly to our ideals.LiNeBrEaKAmerica's new president demonstrated the focus demanded by the times. It was an auspicious beginning -- one designed to inspire supporters and to include skeptics in the hard work ahead.LiNeBrEaKAddressing America for the first time as president, Obama spoke with the moving oratory that marked his campaign, and also with startling bluntness. LiNeBrEaKAmerica faces a crisis, said Obama, not once but twice. Our nation is at war. Our health care system is broken, our schools need repair. Our economy is "badly weakened," our national confidence flagging.LiNeBrEaKYet Obama managed to artfully balance the harsh reality against the promise of a better future. "(Our challenges) will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America -- they will be met."LiNeBrEaKObama's critics from an exhausting two-year campaign -- those who suggested the Illinois Democrat would be soft on defense or lavish with public spending -- can also find some common ground with the new president.LiNeBrEaKHe vowed to restore America's position of global leadership: "To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist."LiNeBrEaKHe also reframed the debate over the role of government to a proper focus on outcomes and accountability: "The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works."LiNeBrEaKObviously, Americans will disagree over the details of a government that works. Obama gently touched on the debates to come. He made a general case for a far-reaching -- and expensive -- public works and economic stimulus plan that has drawn early, bipartisan skepticism from the Idaho congressional delegation. He spoke of confronting "the specter of a warming planet" and advocated tighter market regulations. To his credit, Obama expressed no desire for ideological social battles that consume valuable focus and precious political capital.LiNeBrEaKAnd Obama spoke eloquently about the need to work together. After a campaign predicated on change, Obama urged Americans to embrace time-honored values and a renewed sense of responsibility. "This is the price and the promise of citizenship."LiNeBrEaKToday, that promise seems brighter. Our pride, as Americans, feels more profound.LiNeBrEaKThis of course reflects the nature of Obama's election as the nation's first black president. In a time when the description "historic" is tossed about like word candy, the term applies today.LiNeBrEaKObama didn't skirt history, talking about a nation that has tasted "the bitter swill of civil war and discrimination," and emerged stronger. Obama also made us look unflinchingly at the challenges we now face together -- signaling leadership that is both disciplined and inspiring.LiNeBrEaK"Our View" is the editorial position of the Idaho Statesman.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Pomona`s Cal Spas creates new line of products  	BUSINESS  	416 words  	The nation's economic downturn has chiseled away at the profits of many manufacturing firms while others have been forced to close their doors.LiNeBrEaKBut some companies, including Cal Spas in Pomona, have taken pro-active steps to adapt to a changing climate in which many consumers no longer have as much money to spend. LiNeBrEaKCal Spas is producing a new Genesis line of spas using a "geoforming" process. This allows the shell and cabinet to be molded from a single sheet of acrylic, an alternative to the more traditional roto-molded hot tubs that are usually made with polyethylene, a plastic used in the manufacture of items like garbage cans and milk bottles.LiNeBrEaKThe geoforming method produces a product with a smooth exterior that is highly durable. More importantly, it lowers the production cost and allows Cal Spas to sell the units for much less than traditional spas.LiNeBrEaK"All of our spas are built with the same quality but this creates a lower price point," said Shiva Noble, Cal Spas' executive vice president. "The average price for a spa is $7,999, but these will go for $2,999 to $3,499. They still give you hydrotherapy and warm water therapy, but they are much more affordable to purchase."LiNeBrEaKNoble said consumers who typically buy hot tubs have not been as adversely affected by the economic downturn because most of them are middle to upper middle-class buyers and above.LiNeBrEaK"The economy has really not affected them so much, but at the same time they are being a little more conservative and they're not letting go of their dollars as easily as before," she said. "They want to pay a lower price for the same product."LiNeBrEaKRichard Giss, a retail analyst with Deloitte and Touche, said businesses across the spectrum are rethinking marketing strategies and in many cases are revamping their product lines to keep consumers coming back.LiNeBrEaK"You don't need to look any further than the auto industry, which has suffered 20, 30 and 40percent decreases in sales," he said. "And the housing market has suffered a big downturn in sales."LiNeBrEaKMany Americans who couldn't keep pace with their rising mortgage payments lost their homes to foreclosure, impacting sales of such items as furniture, appliances, carpeting, paint, wood and a variety of other products.LiNeBrEaKCal Spas was founded in 1979. The company has evolved to become the world's No. 1 manufacturer of home resort products, including hydrotherapy hot tubs, swim spas, gazebos, indoor/outdoor saunas, barbecue islands/carts/drop-in grills, outdoor fireplaces and fire pits.

Khaleej Times (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Coastal Areas Management Vital  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	696 words  	Jan. 21--ABU DHABI -- Better management of coastal areas was the key message sent by the Minister of Environment and Water, Dr. Rashid Ahmed bin Fahad, during his welcome speech at the Environment 2009 conference on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe event is being held alongside the World Future Energy Summit, which opened in the capital on Monday. LiNeBrEaK"Around 40 per cent of the population lives in coastal areas, so there are much more activities happening on the coast than inland, which creates challenges, puts a lot of pressure and, eventually, affects the environment," stressed the minister.LiNeBrEaKAccording to him, much of the pressures come from urban development, but at the same time, UAE is on the verge of creating concrete plans for combating climate change and other environmental crises.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is world's priority. It is our priority, too. At the federal level we are now working closely with Masdar initiative for promoting and using more renewable sources of energy," Dr. Fahad told Khaleej Times.LiNeBrEaKHe added that another environmental priority for UAE is water. "We are looking for ways to reduce the water consumption per capita, while creating more sustainable water plants," said Dr. Fahad.LiNeBrEaKSince the two-day  conference concentrates on the issues of sustainable management for coastal zones, Dr. Habib El Harb, director and regional representative of United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), warned against some of the most devastating consequences that climate change could have on seaside inhabitants. "As a result of development, we are using and often misusing the coastal zones, which have undergone great physical change," said Dr. Harb.LiNeBrEaK"We don't know what impact those changes will have on the coast yet, nor do we know how these coastal zones will respond to the rise in sea levels due to climate change," stressed Dr. Harb, adding that UNEP is now working on these issues. Environmental scientists have warned time and time again that the now inevitable melting of the glaciers will lead to worldwide rise in sea levels of up to four metres in 30 years' time, creating catastrophic coastal deterioration and flooding.LiNeBrEaKMohammed Raouf, programme manager at Gulf Research Centre, used even tougher tone to warn of the devastating impact urban development has on coastal areas.LiNeBrEaK"The Gulf region is now facing new environmental challenges related to urban development and population growth, which include water scarcity, pollution and waste management," said Raouf. "The GCC coast, which stretches over 15,000 kilometres, is very rich, but urban and tourism projects create too much stress, resulting in degradation of the coast," he pointed out, adding that more protected areas are needed.LiNeBrEaK"The critical problem that we are facing now is that economy comes first and environmental protection comes second. Some developers have the habit of destroying an area, then doing some kind of compensation. We don't want compensation. Do your environmental study and public consultation first, then go ahead with the plan, if it's okay. If it will harm the environment, move your project somewhere else," urged Raouf.LiNeBrEaKHe also expressed concerned for the waste of valuable water resources, especially in the UAE, where up to 80 per cent of the annual water consumption is dedicated to agriculture, mostly greening projects, which are no longer sustainable. "This was not a problem 10-15 years ago, but nowadays urban development and population growth changed the situation, so we need to conserve water and shift consumption towards more urgent and important policies such as food," explained Raouf.LiNeBrEaKToday, it will be the turn of business and industry leaders to explain their solutions for an eco-friendly coastal development.LiNeBrEaKsilvia@khaleejtimes.com		COASTAL AREAS (91%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); TALKS and MEETINGS (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); CITIES (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (88%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); POPULATION GROWTH (76%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS and DISASTERS (74%); WASTE MANAGEMENT and REMEDIATION SERVICES (73%); RESEARCH (69%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (69%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (65%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (62%); WATER QUALITY (51%)  		UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME (54%)  		ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (91%) DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (92%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (95%); GULF STATES (78%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009    	Silvia Radan, Khaleej Times, Dubai, United Arab Emirates  			General  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090121-KJ-Coastal-Areas-Management-Vital-0121  	KJ  									
Khaleej Times (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	In 30 Years, We'll See Many Cities Under Water, Warns Expert  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	526 words  	Jan. 21--ABU DHABI -- Combating climate change and environmentally responsible urban development are a necessity as they can trigger economic growth in societies.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview with Khaleej Times, Dr. Habib El Harb, director and regional representative of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), explained the dangers of allowing climate change escalate in the Gulf region, especially in the UAE. LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is here and it can no longer be ignored. I don't want to give an alarming message, but if we continue at this rate by sending carbon dioxide and gas emissions into the sea, there will definitely be a negative impact," warned El Harb.LiNeBrEaKAccording to him, in three to four decades sea levels will rise apparently and if no measures are taken now, the consequences could be drastic.LiNeBrEaK"One to two centimetres per year of rise in sea levels may not seem like much and putting taking measures off may be easy, but major effects will be felt in 30 years' time," he stressed.LiNeBrEaKThese effects will generally involve the sinking of islands and coastal areas that are under or at sea level.LiNeBrEaK"Small islands and coastal areas around the world, including UAE, would suffer most," pointed out the UNEP representative.LiNeBrEaKClimate change and rising of sea levels may not be fully reversible, but by taking actions now it is still possible to slow down and reduce the negative impacts.LiNeBrEaK"People and governments alike will have to react, stop releasing harmful gases, and stop their consumption patterns. If we don't do this now, in 30 years we'll see cities under water," said El Harb.LiNeBrEaKIn the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa), UNEP works with 22 Arab countries, trying to resolve such environmental problems.LiNeBrEaK"The signs of climate change are already visible here. Hurricanes that hit Oman twice are something that I never thought I would see in this region. Also, the rise in temperatures in the last 2-3 years is another wary and yet no studies have been done on this issue so far," El Harb stated.LiNeBrEaKWorldwide, UNEP has been working at mobilising and re-focusing the global economy towards investments in clean technologies and natural infrastructure such as forests and soils, which will not only combat climate change, but it will also create real growth and trigger an employment boom in the 21st century, as new "green" jobs are expected to be created.LiNeBrEaKA concrete plan for fighting climate change will be discussed during an environmental conference that will take place in Denmark towards the end of 2009.LiNeBrEaK"This major international conference, which will have the participation of UAE, will conclude with an agreement signed by all participant countries on how to combat climate change," revealed El Harb.LiNeBrEaKsilvia@khaleejtimes.com		ISLANDS and REEFS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); INTERVIEWS (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (89%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (89%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (78%); JOB CREATION (78%); CITIES (78%); EMISSIONS (77%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (77%); COASTAL AREAS (75%); CONSUMPTION (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); HURRICANES (71%); GLOBALIZATION (60%)  		UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME (58%)  		ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (92%) DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (92%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (97%); GULF STATES (88%); MIDDLE EAST (79%); OMAN (79%); NORTH AFRICA (79%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009    	Silvia Radan, Khaleej Times, Dubai, United Arab Emirates  			Disasters  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090121-KJ-In-30-Years-We-ll-See-Many-Cities-Under-Water-Warns-Expert-0121  	KJ  									
The Oregonian  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Portland, Ore., Metro's wish list ranks desired transportation projects  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1036 words  	Jan. 21--Motorists stuck in the molasses merger of Interstates 5 and 205, or crawling across the I-5 bridge at quitting time, no doubt have their own lists of transportation projects the federal government ought to help pay for. The same goes for people trying to bike, bus or MAX to work, the mall or school.LiNeBrEaKMetro has come up with its own version of what needs to be done, though it's more than a list of gripes. LiNeBrEaKMetro and its partner cities and counties are hoping the federal government will help pay for millions of dollars' worth of transportation improvements during the next six years. Here's a sampling of the 78 projects listed by local officials and the requested federal funding amount:LiNeBrEaK--Columbia River Crossing, a new I-5 bridge: $1. 15 billion for engineering, design, right-of-way acquisition and constructionLiNeBrEaK--Sellwood Bridge: $100 million for constructionLiNeBrEaK--TriMet: $92. 4 million for new busesLiNeBrEaK--I-5 at I-205 interchange: $14. 4 million for constructionLiNeBrEaK--Portland-to-Milwaukie light rail: $850 million for final design and constructionLiNeBrEaK--Gresham Civic Neighborhood: $5 million for a transit center parking structureLiNeBrEaK--Drive Less-Save More: $4. 5 million for a Metro marketing programLiNeBrEaK--French Prairie Bridge: $12. 6 million for a bicycle, pedestrian and emergency bridge over the Willamette River at WilsonvilleLiNeBrEaKThe regional government, in a priority list officials will vote on Thursday, is asking for federal money for more than six dozen projects, ranging from the Columbia River Crossing to new TriMet buses. Also included are a new Sellwood Bridge, a parking structure at a Gresham transit center, a Columbia River dredging project, multiple bike trails, and fixes for snarled traffic at the juncture of I-205 and I-5, Tualatin-Sherwood Road and many other spots.LiNeBrEaKNothing guarantees Congress will fund projects on the list when it appropriates 2010 transportation money and authorizes the six-year federal transportation bill later this year.LiNeBrEaKBut Metro and its partners are using the funding process to not only push local projects but also to influence federal transportation priorities. The Portland region now judges transportation improvements as involving much more than how quickly we commute from Point A to Point B, and its leaders believe the rest of the country ought to do the same.LiNeBrEaKTo that end, each project on the local list -- beyond the gripe factor -- is associated with a value, issue or concept, ranging from the economic importance of "metropolitan mobility" to the greenhouse gas reduction targets associated with climate change.LiNeBrEaKMetro Councilor Rex Burkholder said the projects list will be presented to Oregon's congressional delegation as a "list of outcomes" the region wants to accomplish with money appropriated under what used to be called the federal highway bill.LiNeBrEaK"This is what we want to achieve with this investment," he said.LiNeBrEaKIt is an ambitious statement and part of a continuing regional movement to link land-use and transportation policies. Development, the thinking goes, shouldn't happen in a way that requires major new transportation networks. That's led to Metro policies favoring transit-oriented development, compact urban centers and density goals. Officials often talk about the need for transportation options, especially ones that don't strain resources.LiNeBrEaKThe project list describes the "radically different path" with which the Portland area accommodates growth and trumpets a remark by Minnesota Rep. James Oberstar, who said the region is the "template for America."LiNeBrEaKThe remark is significant because Oberstar, a Democrat, is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and has called for passing the biggest transportation investment package since the federal highway system was created in the 1950s. Local officials count another funding friend in Rep. Peter DeFazio, an Oregon 4th District Democrat who is chairman of the House Highways and Transit Subcommittee. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Portland is on the House Ways and Means Committee, which decides how things get paid for.LiNeBrEaKWith the Obama administration saying infrastructure repair and investment are crucial and with a congressional delegation in position to pull strings, Portland-area officials are optimistic that federal money may be available to help pay for dozens of road, rail, trail and bridge projects.LiNeBrEaKThe list of projects was endorsed last week by Metro's Joint Policy Advisory Committee on Transportation, made up of officials representing cities, counties, Metro and key state departments.LiNeBrEaKA report accompanying the list describes the Portland area's regional strategy as an example to the rest of the nation. Since the 1970s, the metro area has chosen to stop sprawl by enforcing a tight urban growth boundary, canceled the Mount Hood freeway in favor of a light-rail train system and aligned its land-use plans to support urban centers, according to the report.LiNeBrEaKIt cites the recession, energy costs, deteriorating infrastructure, climate change and increased global economic competition as elements that call for a similar approach at the federal level.LiNeBrEaKTo that end, local transportation projects are bunched under factors that contribute to a livable community. Among them are metropolitan mobility, freight movement, system maintenance and help with "mega projects" such as the Columbia River Crossing. In addition, projects throughout the region must be held accountable to meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets.LiNeBrEaKBurkholder, who was chairman of the Metro advisory committee, said he is optimistic about influencing a "major shift" nationally in how regional transportation and land-use policies are examined, linked and funded.LiNeBrEaK"We're one of the few regions that sits down, has this discussion and comes up with a regional agenda," he said.

In addition, projects throughout the region must be held accountable to meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets.LiNeBrEaKBurkholder, who was chairman of the Metro advisory committee, said he is optimistic about influencing a "major shift" nationally in how regional transportation and land-use policies are examined, linked and funded.LiNeBrEaK"We're one of the few regions that sits down, has this discussion and comes up with a regional agenda," he said.LiNeBrEaKEric Mortenson; 503-294-7636; ericmortenson@news.oregonian.comLiNeBrEaKFor environment news, go to: oregonlive.com/environment		APPROPRIATIONS (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); CITY LIFE (78%); TRANSPORTATION REGULATION (78%); HIGHWAY FUNDING (78%); LEGISLATORS (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (77%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (76%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (75%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (75%); PUBLIC POLICY (75%); CYCLING (69%); CLIMATE CHANGE (66%)  				PORTLAND, OR, USA (92%) OREGON, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	ERIC MORTENSON, The Oregonian  															
Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	OBAMA SETS THE BAR HIGH FOR HIMSELF AND THE NATION  	OPINION; Pg. 8A  	1032 words  	Barack Obama told supporters how his 10-year-old daughter, Malia, summed up the expectations for Tuesday's inaugural address: "First African-American president; better be good." The speech was very good. Now, Mr. Obama has to match his presidency to his words.LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, Mr. Obama talked of change. As president, he did the same -- with a twist. Change, he said, depends on a return to old ideals: sacrifice, duty, responsibility. Directly and indirectly, echoing Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt at other times of crisis in earlier centuries, Mr. Obama explained how he wants to change American policy here and abroad. But he cautioned that the change to restore our economy and our standing in the world won't happen unless it rises from Main Street, Wall Street and Capitol Hill. LiNeBrEaK"Our challenges may be new," Mr. Obama said. "The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends -- hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism -- those things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history."LiNeBrEaKStill, President Obama made clear that when it comes to change, he will set the example, starting here. After eight years of the country investing in the Iraq war and tax cuts for the wealthy and winding up with an intensive-care economy, Mr. Obama wants to "build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together."LiNeBrEaKThat is change.LiNeBrEaKMore pointedly, Mr. Obama vowed to "restore science to its rightful place." Former President Bush politicized science in everything from abstinence-only sex education to global warming. Former Vice President Dick Cheney drew up energy policy based on what the country's largest polluters wanted. In contrast, the new president stated that "... each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet." In the Obama administration, "We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories."LiNeBrEaKThat is change.LiNeBrEaKIn the larger sense, Mr. Obama's election marks the final, overdue end of the anti-government era that began when Ronald Reagan proclaimed in 1981 that "government is not the solution to the problem; government is the problem." His election caused an overreaction to the New Deal and Great Society that drained Washington and the Congress of people who understood government and filled the capital with lawmakers who denigrated government. Here, again, Mr. Obama staked out the sensible middle ground: "...the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works."LiNeBrEaKThat is change.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, President Obama noted that while the country is not about to jettison the free market, it cannot tolerate the financial deregulation market that has helped to cause the economic crisis: "Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control -- and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous."LiNeBrEaKThat is change.LiNeBrEaKMoving to national security, Mr. Obama sounded much like George Bush when he told the world that the United States "will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense. And for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you." That, correctly, is not change.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama departed from Mr. Bush, though, when he said, "As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals ... Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake ... know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more."LiNeBrEaKThat is change.LiNeBrEaKAs stated, though, America cannot lead the world if we are divided within. Mr. Obama's toughest task will be to end the Mafia politics that began during the Clinton administration with the battle over impeachment and continued into the Bush administration with the disputed election of 2000 and the invasion of Iraq in 2003.LiNeBrEaKBut Washington got sidetracked over the past decade by more than the big stuff. While Democrats and Republicans argued over social issues, the economy ran off the rails. So it matters that Mr. Obama referred to America as "a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers." It matters that he called for "an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics."LiNeBrEaKThat would be change.LiNeBrEaKTuesday was a wonderful day for America. Merely by taking the oath that was fumbled by Chief Justice John Roberts, Barack Hussein Obama made this country look good to the world. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., brought home the moment with an eloquent benediction. The Obamas were dreams come true for record crowds.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, though, the banking news got worse, and the markets dropped sharply again. Today, history gives way to urgent work. President taking office at the most critical time in more than 50 years; better be good.LiNeBrEaKExcerpts from the inaugural addressLiNeBrEaK'Our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant actions -- that time has surely passed.'LiNeBrEaK'A nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.'LiNeBrEaK'The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works.'LiNeBrEaK'As for our common defense, we reject the choice between our safety and our ideals.'LiNeBrEaK'To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict ... know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy.'

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	VEGGIE FARMS BRACE FOR DIP  	LOCAL and BUSINESS; Pg. 1B  	624 words  	At Palm City Palms and Tropicals Tuesday afternoon, Rick and Susan Frostrom and their eight employees were powering up a contraption that looks like a helicopter, runs on a 454 cubic inch Chevy engine, and keeps the wind rushing over plants to prevent frost from settling.LiNeBrEaK"If you are standing 100 feet from it, it will take your hat off," Rick Frostrom said. LiNeBrEaKWith temperatures forecast to reach the low 30s in the Treasure Coast and in western Palm Beach County, Florida agricultural producers were preparing for a two-night chill, with Thursday morning expected to be the coldest.LiNeBrEaKHardier crops like citrus are expected to come through largely unharmed, but ornamental plants such as ferns and tender vegetables such as green beans are at risk.LiNeBrEaK"We are mostly worried about the beans that we are harvesting and the young sweet corn," said Rick Roth, president of Roth Farms east of Belle Glade.LiNeBrEaKPalm Beach County, a major source of the nation's winter vegetables, has an estimated 40,000 acres of vegetables planted, including bell peppers, tomatoes, celery, Chinese vegetables, radishes, and lettuces. This regional "salad bowl" is valued at more than $200 million a year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.LiNeBrEaKCorn and green bean growers in the Glades can't do much to protect their crops, beyond raising water levels in canals to warm the air.LiNeBrEaK"Most of the big farms have pumped the water in to raise the water table higher; that is the first line of defense," said David Sui, an agent with the Palm Beach County cooperative extension service.LiNeBrEaKWhile Glades vegetable farmers sometimes hire helicopters to fly above their crops and push the warm air down, Tuesday night winds were expected to keep blowing throughout the night.LiNeBrEaKAs for tonight, "I think tomorrow night we will see some upper 20-degree temperatures in the colder areas," said John S. Hundley, vice president of Hundley Farms, east of Belle Glade. Lake Okeechobee's water level is higher, which will bring a warming effect in certain areas, he said. "We will see how we fare. We are expecting some losses. We have losses every year."LiNeBrEaKCitrus growers aren't worried about the cold. It typically takes temperatures of 28 degrees or lower for four to five hours to damage a citrus tree. "The lowest temperature forecast in the Indian River district is 31," said Doug Bournique, executive vice president of the Indian River Citrus League. "This is not going to be a killer freeze for citrus at all."LiNeBrEaKIn fact, if the chill kills psyllids, which spread citrus greening disease, "It could end up being semi-beneficial," Bournique said.LiNeBrEaKTemperatures are still forecast to be the coldest this year, although they won't come close to the freeze of Jan. 19-20 of 1977. Exactly 32 years ago this week, Palm Beach County was shocked with a low of 27 degrees and a dusting of snowflakes.LiNeBrEaKHundley says this cold snap is more like the Christmas Eve freeze of 1989.LiNeBrEaK"I remember all of them," he said. "When you get hammered, you remember those dates."LiNeBrEaK~susan_salisbury@pbpost.comLiNeBrEaKCold snapLiNeBrEaKCold weather shelters opened overnight Tuesday, and officials plan to open them tonight as the frigid weather lingers:LiNeBrEaKPalm Beach County:LiNeBrEaKCapacity 75 each.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Words to inspire and unite, not divide  	COMMENTARY  	738 words  	Finally, after a campaign that claimed two years of national attention, after a transition that seemed almost as long, Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th, and the first African American, president of the United States.LiNeBrEaKOn a clear January morning drenched in sunlight, it was possible to be overwhelmed by the panoply of ceremony and symbols, by the jubilant gathering of citizens, and the massive weight of history.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama delivered an inaugural address in his customary measured calm that, in part, belied the sheer fierceness of his language in a striking rebuke of President Bush's policies. LiNeBrEaKIt took but four paragraphs for the new president to begin methodically yet insistently hammering away at the legacy of the man sitting several feet away at the Capitol. "Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age," Obama intoned.LiNeBrEaKHe called for "an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our policies."LiNeBrEaKTime and again, with deliberate purpose, Obama refuted the practices of the last eight years. "A nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous," he said.LiNeBrEaKOf course, now even the prosperous are less so.LiNeBrEaKHe follows a president who questioned human contribution to global warming and continued, even in his waning weeks, to champion business interests over the environment. Instead, Obama said, "We will restore science to its rightful place."LiNeBrEaKHe spoke of making America more self-reliant: "Each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet." For the Department of Energy, where Bush first installed as secretary a former legislator who once wanted the department abolished, and followed that with a chemical executive, Obama tapped Nobel physicist Steven Chu.LiNeBrEaK"The question we ask today is not whether our government is too large or too small, but whether it works," Obama said.LiNeBrEaK"As our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals," he said.LiNeBrEaKIndirectly, Obama condemned the use of torture, honoring "the rule of law and the rights of man" and that "we will not give them up for expedience's sake." Instead, the president noted "that power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please."LiNeBrEaKEven in a democracy, a president stands alone. So it's telling that one of the most commonly used words in Obama's speech was the inclusive we, uttered 62 times. Wisely, Obama was restrained in his use of the campaign mantra hope, giving it only three mentions should it risk becoming a hollow platitude.LiNeBrEaKThe president's sole reference to race _ the word mentioned once in 20 minutes _ and his lineage arrived in the final moments of his speech.LiNeBrEaK"This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed_why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall," he said, "and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath."LiNeBrEaKIf the address failed to astonish _ as did his historic "A More Perfect Union" speech on race in Philadelphia _ perhaps it's because the nation has become accustomed to a man who was an accomplished writer before he became a legislator, and whose impressive oratorical skills have become an accepted part of our political landscape.LiNeBrEaKThe pageantry and assembled crowd created the electricity. It was left to the rest of us to be overwhelmed by the moment while Obama, once again, exhibited his notable restraint and resolve.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKKaren Heller is a columnist for Philadelphia Inquirer.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition; All Editions	Attempting to harness the energy of the stars Fusion reactor's plasma to be hotter than sun  	NATIONAL; Pg. A1  	1207 words  	Provence, France - In June 1889, six months after he had slashed off his earlobe in a maniacal frenzy, Vincent van Gogh sat in his tiny sanitarium room and painted what became his most famous work.LiNeBrEaK"The Starry Night" depicts the landscape the troubled impressionist saw from his asylum window. Its swirling indigo sky is filled with luminous stars, orbs so large and close to the ground they almost seem to scrape the church steeple of the village of Saint-R&eacute;my-de-Provence.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps van Gogh saw the future. More than a century later, on a Provence hillside barely 50 miles from where the artist produced his masterpiece, scientists are building a giant machine to bring the stars to Earth.LiNeBrEaKLike van Gogh's visionary canvas, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, blends creativity, boldness and a dash of lunacy. LiNeBrEaKThe $7 billion fusion device, arguably the most complex gadget humans have ever tried to construct, will attempt to re-create - in a controlled way - the violent process that powers the stars. It may be the best hope to break the world's oil dependence and restrict climate-change damage.LiNeBrEaKHarnessing fusion's immense energy has been science's long elusive obsession. Researchers have tried for 50 years to bottle the sun. Although the technology has vastly improved, none of the several dozen test facilities around the world has kept the fusion reaction going for more than a couple of seconds, and none has made more energy than it has consumed.LiNeBrEaKITER's designers aim to change that. By leveraging the expertise and bankrolls of the project's seven partners - a sometimes prickly alliance of the United States, the European Union, Russia, China, India, South Korea and Japan - the ITER organization intends to construct a fusion reactor much bigger and more advanced than its predecessors.LiNeBrEaK21st century research in old-world settingLiNeBrEaKWithin site of a medieval French chateau, workers are clearing land and raising buildings where hundreds of ITER researchers will work. They're reinforcing bridges to accommodate the heavy reactor components that will be trucked in from the Mediterranean port.LiNeBrEaKThe fusion machine is so complicated it will take a decade to build, and engineers must overcome profound technical challenges. ITER's ultracold magnets, only a whisper above absolute zero, will have to corral a super-hot plasma that's more than 10 times the temperature of the sun's core - making the hilltop facility simultaneously the hottest and coldest place in the universe.LiNeBrEaKITER will help scientists determine whether sustained fusion is achievable, or too difficult for current human knowledge. "This is a go [or] no-go proof, from my point of view," said physicist Norbert Holtkamp, the project's principal deputy director-general.LiNeBrEaKBut even if the experimental reactor works, that will not yet prove fusion is a reliable, economical power source. That will require a commercial-scale demonstration plant, envisioned for no earlier than 2040.LiNeBrEaKWhile fusion may sound like a lengthy, expensive gamble, proponents say its possible payoffs - virtually unlimited power, readily available fuel, no greenhouse-gas emissions and relatively manageable radioactive waste - make it worth the chase.LiNeBrEaK"Fusion is one of very few options for large-scale, environmentally responsible power generation," said ITER governing council chair Chris Llewellyn-Smith.LiNeBrEaKScientists reach for the starsLiNeBrEaKThe key to tapping a star's power is finding a way to replicate what happens in its hellishly hot, dense core. There, extreme conditions create a fourth state of matter called a plasma, whose energy is far higher than solids, liquids or gases.LiNeBrEaKPinging around in this chaotic atomic stew are positively charged hydrogen nuclei (hydrogen, the lightest element, is the main component of stars) and negatively charged electrons that have gained enough energy to rip free from their orbits around the hydrogen nuclei.LiNeBrEaKUsually, particles with the same electric charge repel each other like the feuding housemates on TV's "The Bad Girls Club." But hydrogen nuclei in the stellar plasma collide so hard they overcome resistance and fuse, releasing energy that keeps the reaction going.LiNeBrEaKBy 1952, government scientists had mastered fusion's rudiments well enough to turn it into a weapon - the hydrogen bomb.LiNeBrEaKBut sustaining and controlling the fusion reaction has proved maddeningly difficult. At its heart: How do you contain a plasma so energetic it threatens to rip itself apart, and so hot it melts anything?LiNeBrEaKStars, which don't have to worry about melting, use their huge mass to squeeze the plasma's components and keep fusion going.LiNeBrEaKSuch gravitational confinement isn't possible on Earth. But scientists came up with another approach, one that takes advantage of the plasma's own properties. Its charged particles - the hydrogen nuclei and electrons - can be wrangled by a magnetic field.LiNeBrEaKTo make the plasma, scientists heat up the reactor's fuel, a gas composed of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium.LiNeBrEaKSurrounding the plasma with powerful magnets in the right configuration traps it, like a balloon caught between two facing electric fans. The magnetic bottle keeps the multimillion-degree plasma away from the reactor vessel's walls to prevent melting.LiNeBrEaKThe doughnut-shaped bottle, called a tokamak, retains the highly energetic, positively charged helium atoms produced by the fusion reaction, keeping the plasma hot enough to "burn" without a lot of outside energy. (At the ITER reactor, the maximum 17-minute fusion burn is expected to use about 50 megawatts of electricity to heat the plasma, while producing 500 megawatts of energy.)LiNeBrEaKThe other fusion product - streams of neutrons with no charge - sail unhindered through the magnetic bottle and strike a swath of metal "blankets," which capture their energy. If ITER were a real power plant, the superheated blankets would flash water to steam to turn a turbine and make electricity.LiNeBrEaKThat's the principle, at least. Researchers have spent decades wrestling with fusion's technical problems. Among them: The edges of the turbulent plasma blob tend to bulge against the containment walls, which can cause damage as well as stifle the reaction.LiNeBrEaKThe most successful tokamak to date, Britain's JET facility, has sustained fusion for only about two seconds at a time, and its power output is only 16 megawatts - about 1 percent the capacity of a commercial nuclear reactor.LiNeBrEaK"We've made tremendous progress in the last 30 years, and we realize there's still a significant distance to go," said Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Earl Marmar, who runs the university's experimental fusion reactor. "I think there's no question fusion will be a viable energy source. The time scale - that's a tricky question."LiNeBrEaKThe joke among fusion's critics is that, for the last 50 years, commercial fusion has always remained 30 years in the future. Fusion researchers contend that's been a result of inadequate funding.LiNeBrEaK"After ITER, that excuse is gone," Holtkamp said. "Either there is a big step and this thing works and it's clear there is a path to magnetic fusion or . . . it's pretty clear that fusion based on tokamaks is over."LiNeBrEaKTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter: jmangels@plaind.com, 216-999-4842		NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); ART and ARTISTS (77%); ARTISTS and PERFORMERS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%)  				PROVENCE-ALPES-COTE D'AZUR, FRANCE (92%) FRANCE (92%); MEDITERRANEAN (79%); UNITED STATES (79%); SOUTH KOREA (79%); JAPAN (75%); EUROPE (73%); INDIA (73%); EUROPEAN UNION (73%); CHINA (70%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (73%)  	January 22, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   T210 Edition	LOOK and LISTEN:ARTIST PROFILE;  Exploring the landscape of the human mind 	210 SA; Pg. 7T  	389 words  	WHO:Stacy Berlfein, 28LiNeBrEaKMEDIUM:DrawingLiNeBrEaKBEST KNOWN FOR:Drawing psychological landscapes. Berlfein creates large-scale drawings that allow the viewers to enter her landscapes as if they were in a dream. LiNeBrEaKThe landscapes are mostly imaginative and basic, and Berlfein believes a common subject for most people. "The landscape is something we encounter on a daily basis," Berlfein said. "It enters our psyche and affects the way we experience our world."LiNeBrEaKBerlfein said she draws from psychology and surrealist artists who explored dreams and the subconscious, such as Salvador Dal&iacute; and Ren&eacute; Magritte, for her imagined scenes. "There's a relationship to what goes on in the mind, which is related to the dream," Berlfein said.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, Berlfein's drawing of a tree folding into itself deals with the relationships of the self. To Berlfein, the tree has the appearance of the human figure. "Trees have an interesting connection between natural forms and human beings," Berlfein said. "Trees especially take on human characteristics."LiNeBrEaKBerlfein said at times she also combines interior and exterior environments. "The places we experience - natural or manmade - can leave a lingering impression on our mind," Berlfein said.LiNeBrEaKBerlfein said she's lately become more interested in landscapes and their literal representation, specifically how it affects the social human experience. Subjects such as global warming, survival and human rights have caught her eye. Recent drawings include dry riverbeds and actual, physical landscapes.LiNeBrEaKBerlfein said she's also become interested in her art as a means of social awareness or change. "It interests me instinctively," Berlfein said. "Our society has changed very quickly in very recent years."LiNeBrEaKBACKGROUND:Berlfein received her bachelor's degree of fine art at the University of Texas at Austin in 2003 and her master's degree of fine art at the University of Texas at San Antonio in 2006. While in graduate school, Berlfein began teaching.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Pelosi: '10-ton anvil lifted' when Bush departed  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	545 words  	Jan. 21--WASHINGTON -- Watching George W. Bush leave the presidency and take off on his helicopter "was like having a 10-ton anvil lifted from my shoulders," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday, describing her emotions and thoughts on Inauguration Day.LiNeBrEaKShe was just a few feet away from Barack Obama when he took the oath of office, and Pelosi said she "thought about his mother, and how she raised him and shaped this extraordinary young man." LiNeBrEaKIn a wide-ranging interview with Bay Area reporters, the San Francisco Democrat said the Obama administration "will be great for California," especially on the environment and the economy.LiNeBrEaKObama "has an entrepreneurial way of thinking, a fresh way of thinking, a commitment to the environment, a push for green jobs and reversing global warming, and that will help California," she said.LiNeBrEaK"Continually frustrated" by Bush on many issues, Pelosi said the change in administrations "will be like night and day" for the state and nation.LiNeBrEaKOn a related issue, Pelosi said she supports Rep. Henry Waxman, the Los Angeles Democrat and new chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who wants his panel to approve a climate change bill with limits on carbon emissions by the end of May.LiNeBrEaK"Our plan is to pass it (in the House) this year, though I don't know what the Senate will do," the speaker said.LiNeBrEaKShe expressed a need to move urgently on economic issues, including the $825 billion recoveryLiNeBrEaKpackage, to take advantage of President Obama's high approval ratings.LiNeBrEaKThe new administration and Congress also need to improve oversight of the banking system and markets, she said: "We need more cops on the street. There has been a lack of discipline, supervision and regulation."LiNeBrEaK"The American people want to give the new president a chance," Pelosi said. But Congress has been "a world of incrementalism. And if you want to change the world, much of it has to go through Congress."LiNeBrEaKDuring the transfer of power Tuesday, Pelosi said she watched Bush when Obama pledged a new foreign policy and a clean break from the last eight years.LiNeBrEaK"That must have been a painful part" for Bush, she said. When asked if she felt at all sorry for Bush, she demurred: "I feel sorry for the people hurt by his policies."LiNeBrEaKPelosi also praised Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat, whom she named as the new chairman of the Ethics Committee, a sensitive post that calls for decisions on whether to investigate one's colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Zoe is so talented, she knows the law, is very fair-minded and commands respect on both sides of the aisle," Pelosi said. That appointment also means Lofgren will meet with other House chairs on high-level policy decisions.LiNeBrEaK"She will have a seat at the table, and the world will know more about her extraordinary talents," the speaker said.LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	A great American moment  	Op-Ed; EDITORIALS; Pg. B6  	571 words  	The 44th president of the United States honored our history as he made history Tuesday. He struck just the right tone for these perilous times.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama reminded America that change - and great challenges - have defined this nation. The inauguration of the first African American president celebrated the cherished but sometimes elusive American ideal that "all men are created equal." His references to his place in history were spare, understated and poignant. LiNeBrEaK"This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama is not the first president to suggest "our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness." But no inauguration has drawn an audience as large and as diverse, or a president who, at long last, embodied the realization of the inclusive meritocracy he espoused. LiNeBrEaK"We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace," he said.LiNeBrEaKWithin the soaring themes of unity was a promising blueprint for some of the ways his administration will change direction from Bush policies. He suggested that the power of free markets to "generate wealth and expand freedom" must be tempered with the "watchful eye" of government. Obama, a constitutional lawyer, said he rejected "as false the choice between our safety and our ideals" - an apparent reference to the use of torture and the civil liberties rollbacks during the Bush era. He spoke of leaving Iraq "to its people" and taking on the challenge of global warming. He promised an ambitious effort to revitalize the economy.LiNeBrEaKThough inaugural addresses often avoid mention of contemporary problems, once again, Obama's decision to discuss the problems we face was fitting. Even as he spoke, the difficult circumstances that Obama was chosen to address were bubbling beneath the surface. LiNeBrEaKOn the heels of fresh worries about bank stability, Wall Street welcomed the new president with a record Inauguration Day tumble. The Dow Jones industrial average lost just over 4 percent; the Standard and Poors 500 Index dropped by more than 5 percent. In the Senate, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, temporarily blocked Hillary Rodham Clinton's confirmation as secretary of state, which suggests that Obama will not find partisanship easy to overcome. And in the Middle East, Obama's first international challenge flared as Hamas leaders stood atop the shattered landscape of Gaza and claimed that they had won a victory over the Israeli army, simply because they had survived.LiNeBrEaKFew presidents in modern history will encounter the magnitude of problems, domestic and international, that confront President Obama. His speech was sober about the challenges and powerful in its expression of resolve to meet them. He will need every ounce of the remarkable goodwill that was on display Tuesday.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	The nation's capital feels the warmth  	Op-Ed; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; Pg. B6  	545 words  	Inaugurations can be misleading stuff, a political fiesta filled with promises, fresh energy and defeats untasted. The glittering swearing-ins come with fanfare, snapping flags on the gleaming-white Capitol and 21-gun salutes. LiNeBrEaK Then the hard grind of Washington reality takes over as Congress cuts a new president down to size and the mistakes pile up. The January honeymoon ends fast. LiNeBrEaK President Obama seems to sense this, even if his adoring army doesn't quite yet. For weeks, and especially the last few days, Washington has become an occupied city, filled with Obamaites who've driven, bused and flown thousands of miles for the big moment that came at 12: 10 p.m.LiNeBrEaKOver the weekend, a row of police cars with flickering blue and red lights brought an instant crowd to the curb. Is he about to drive by? One small neighborhood eatery - Ben's Chili Bowl - has a 50-foot line from early morning to past midnight, all because Obama grabbed a quick lunch there. Who knows, he might return, and that's why a satellite TV truck and police car are stationed outside. LiNeBrEaKThe real proof was the enormous turnout for the swearing in. The crowd filled the 2-mile Mall from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. Crowd estimates are notoriously hard to pin down, but the first-blush number is put at more than 1 million. And it was January, and nearly everyone had to be there by 8 a.m. for any hope of claiming a doormat-sized standing spot.LiNeBrEaKWith the headliners so distant and tiny to most of the crowd, the action was followed by watching dozens of billboard-sized TVs. Each backstage glimpse of Obama or his family waiting to take their places brought huge roars that echoed through the open acres filled with his supporters. Who were these cheering hand-clappers? Women in thick minks, schoolchildren in matching jackets and stocking caps, and families who'd driven in overnight from North Carolina or Pennsylvania, nearly all of them with Obama buttons trailing down shirt fronts. It was multiracial, peaceful and friendly, and it brought Washington to a halt.LiNeBrEaKIn White House terms, this onslaught should be converted into something politics here hasn't seen in years, presidential political capital. But with so many problems - two wars, a recession, and feckless solutions to all of it - this advantage may quickly dwindle to pocket change. LiNeBrEaKHence Obama's mix of caution and confidence in his inauguration speech. He underlined the generational and racial turning points that his candidacy represents. He went after the Bush record that ignored science, played down global warming and undercut civil liberties in the name of fighting terrorism. Hard, plain talk on the issues that won him the top job.LiNeBrEaKBut then he came up with a new slogan, a "new era of responsibility." By that he appeared to mean that even the best solutions such as negotiated pullout in Iraq or a return to financial stability aren't enough. His grassroots listeners need to back up Washington with their own personal rescue packages built on thrift, charity and hard work. LiNeBrEaKIt may sound like a dodge to turn the country's problems back on its citizens. But the notion could capture the masses - his backers with Hope buttons and Yes We Can T-shirts - who are wondering where their leader is taking them tomorrow.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Four-day workweek doesn't save as much as predicted  	POLITICS; News; State  	490 words  	After the Legislature suggested cutting $3 million from an energy-efficiency fund, state officials acknowledged savings from the four-day workweek experiment probably won't save the $3 million originally predicted. LiNeBrEaKKim Hood, executive director of the Department of Administrative Services, now says the estimated savings from Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr.'s Working4Utah initiative is a longer-term target goal.LiNeBrEaK"It's like me saying I'll lose 30 pounds in a year, it's a goal," Hood told lawmakers Wednesday. "At this point, I think the $3 million should be considered a stretch. I think we need the full year of a pilot program to determine what the savings are going to be."LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 12, legislative staff suggested cutting $3 million from the revolving fund that pays for projects to make buildings more energy efficient, and repaying the fund with savings from the Working4Utah initiative. That fund has become less restrictive over time, but that money can only be used for energy-related projects approved by the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaK"Energy efficiency is not a cut you want to make. It's an investment that brings money back to the state," said John Harrington, state buildings energy manager. He said the $3. 65 million in the fund had the potential 10-year energy savings of $12. 5 million.LiNeBrEaKHood agreed the fund was essential. LiNeBrEaK"Our target goal of reducing energy use by 20 percent may happen in the first year, or second or third year," said Hood, adding that Huntsman's goal is 20 percent of energy use cutting by 2015. "But our biggest challenge is getting those buildings efficient."LiNeBrEaKShe said shuttering state government offices on Fridays hasn't generated as much cost savings as first predicted.LiNeBrEaKSeveral unforeseen issues, such as extreme temperatures, employee habits and workers coming in on the occasional Friday, made such a large amount of savings an impossibility this year, she said.LiNeBrEaKMichael Hansen, strategic planning manager for the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget, calls the lower savings "lessons learned."LiNeBrEaK"We made all these estimates and assumptions, and it looks like we were optimistic," he said. "We thought it would be easier, but there were all these weird little things."LiNeBrEaKHe said he has a draft report prepared with actual figures showing how much the state has saved thus far, but it has not yet been approved for release.LiNeBrEaKThe initiative was implemented with little to no input from state employees, lawmakers or residents, but Huntsman has worked to make the environment a top priority, even though many in the Legislature look at global warming as a farce.LiNeBrEaKThe initiative moved 17,000 of the state's 24,000 employees from working five, eight-hour days to four, 10-hour days.LiNeBrEaKHood said that while cost savings were not as high as predicted for this first year, the one-year pilot program has allowed the state to identify which buildings need to be more energy-efficient and how best to make them so.LiNeBrEaKsmcfarland@sltrib.com		ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); WORK WEEK (89%); APPROVALS (78%); GOVERNORS (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (61%)  			JON HUNTSMAN (73%)  	UTAH, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  	By Sheena Mcfarland The Salt Lake Tribune

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Four-day workweek falling short of savings goal  	BREAKING; Politics; News; State  	493 words  	Utah's four-day workweek for state employees isn't saving the state as much as money as Gov. Jon Huntsman's staff thought it would when Utah became the first state in the country to adopt the compressed schedule to try to reduce energy consumption. LiNeBrEaKIn August, Utah began the one-year pilot program and shut down most of its services on Fridays in an effort to save $3 million on utilities and cut energy consumption in state buildings by 20 percent.LiNeBrEaK"At this point, I think the $3 million should be considered a stretch," Kim Hood, executive director of the Department of Administrative Services, told lawmakers Wednesday. "I think we need the full year of a pilot program to determine what the savings are going to be."LiNeBrEaKHowever, employees occasionally coming into work on Fridays, unpredictable temperatures and energy prices, and individual electricity use habits of state workers in buildings that may need to be made more energy efficient has made reaching that goal unlikely this year, lawmakers were told.LiNeBrEaK"It's one we feel like we can reach. I don't know that we can reach it in the first year," Hood said. "This is a target and in order to reach that target, it's not just ... enough to close down our buildings to business on Friday. We have to work hard at reducing our energy use."LiNeBrEaKExact figures on cost savings were not available Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKHuntsman had previously set a goal of increasing energy efficiency 20 percent by 2020 when he made the switch to a four-day week.LiNeBrEaKThe move was made by the governor with little-to-no input from state workers, residents or lawmakers and was one of the boldest initiatives he took during his first four years in office. Huntsman is increasingly trying to frame himself as part of a new breed of Republicans that consider the environment a top issue, even in a state where many of his GOP colleagues believe global warming is a hoax.LiNeBrEaKInstead of having employees working eight hours a day, five days a week, Huntsman ordered about 17,000 of the state's 24,000 executive branch employees to begin working four days a week, 10 hours a day.LiNeBrEaKInitially, Huntsman's staff set a target of closing 1,000 of the state's 6,000 buildings on Fridays. College campuses, court houses, liquor stores, veterans hospitals and emergency services remain open on Fridays.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the state has only been able to close 900 buildings and some government offices such as the Utah National Guard had been closing on Fridays before the switch was made this summer. Of those 900 buildings, the state is leasing about 500 of them, reducing the ability to save on energy costs, said John Harrington, state buildings energy manager.LiNeBrEaKHarrington said state officials are been able to identify about 100 buildings where the opportunity for cost savings is significant. However, initial reviews show that about half of those buildings are reducing energy consumption by less than 10 percent, he said.LiNeBrEaK"It's a challenge. It's a work in progress," he said.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Letter: Conservation can change the world  	COMMUNITIES; Los Gatos; News; Local  	483 words  	I am writing to you about conservation of natural resources to help the environment and preserve the Earth for our next generations. As you may know, the planet is slowly losing many of its recourses like the ozone layer. The ozone layer has many deadly holes, which is causing the Earth to warm up faster than ever. As a result, the sun's heat is poking through, hitting areas like the North Pole and Iceland. The polar bears die because they can't even find ice to stand on. They have to swim longer to reach ice. It may not seem like it, but the Earth is slowly dying. I'm sorry if I seem to be taking it out on you because it's not your fault; it's everyone's fault. We drive our cars to places we can easily walk to. Now, I'm not saying we should stop the use of cars, just use them a little less. It may not seem like much, but if everyone tries we can change the world. Here are some of things that can help: recycle, turn off the lights if not needed, drive less, don't waste water, use energy-saving light bulbs, don't hunt endangered animals. LiNeBrEaKParisa KamyabiLiNeBrEaKDrivers should slow down near schoolLiNeBrEaKIn the morning people drive slowly because they know police can make them pay a fine for speeding or crossing a red light. After 1: 30 p.m. they speed and cross the red light. I know this because last week on Monday I was nearly a pancake (or I nearly got ran over by a girl talking on her cell phone with her foot on the dashboard). The same thing happened later that week, only it was Friday. Some guy stopped in the middle of Pollard Road and Quito Road. In fact, he ran a red light!LiNeBrEaKAll I'm trying to say is we need supervision in the afternoon. We need it there before someone really gets hurt. We need cameras or police to supervise that area. I hope you can get this letter because more than 10 people cross there every day, and they can get seriously injured. I know it's rare but it can happen, and the car on Monday that almost ran me over was only stopped about 2 feet away.LiNeBrEaKLoic CiampossinLiNeBrEaKLittering is a serious issueLiNeBrEaKI am going to tell you what I think needs improvement. That would be that people litter too much. For instance, someone could start a car accident when they throw something out the window. It is not safe for the environment either when someone throws trash on the ground when they could just throw it away in the garbage can. If you're thinking, "Well, we are trying to stop it, but people don't follow the rules," here is what you can do to help:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKEnforce the $1,000 fine because if you enforce it may work a little. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKInstead of just making them pay the fine, have them pick up trash on the highway. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWhen someone does litter there is not a police in sight so they think its OK. So you should try to have police looking for that a little better or at least in more places. LiNeBrEaKPlease take this letter into consideration because I know a lot of people do care about this.LiNeBrEaKSarah Palermo		ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (78%); MARINE MAMMALS (78%); MAMMALS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS (70%)  				EARTH (94%) ICELAND (79%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved  	The following letters were written to the Los Gatos Weekly-Times by Rolling Hills Middle School sixth-graders as a classroom project assigned by their teacher, Dorrie Scamporrino:

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Opinion: Saving the economy and the planet, one furnace at a time  	NEWS; Opinion  	636 words  	Like most Americans, I'm guarding my dollars, but when my furnace died during Seattle's coldest winter in decades, I needed to replace it. And when I did, with a high-efficiency Trane model made in Trenton, N.J., the costs and gains underscored key lessons about what we need to do to craft a stimulus package that actually builds for America's future.LiNeBrEaKMy new furnace saves energy and fights climate change. It promotes American jobs, and pays back its costs in a reasonable time frame. It points toward how to genuinely renew America's economy instead of encouraging the same consumption for consumption's sake that has helped create our current problems. LiNeBrEaKLet's look at what my $5,000 purchased. It supported Trane's factory workers, the local installers and beleaguered local tax bases. It meant I'll save more than a third of my yearly gas bill and a commensurate amount of my carbon-dioxide emissions. My old furnace was a 13-year-old, 70 percent efficient model that was down to barely 60 percent because single-cycle furnaces lose 1 percent a year as their burners corrode and heat exchangers get less efficient. The new one is 97 percent efficient and its variable speed motor is designed to maintain far more efficiency. I live in a small, well-insulated house in a temperate climate, and keep my thermostat low, but have still been spending $850 a year on gas heat. Add in electric bill savings from the furnace's extra-efficient fan, and I'll save roughly $340 a year at current gas prices. If natural gas costs keep increasing at their recent rate, 61 percent in five years, my investment will pay back in roughly nine years   a yield approaching that promised by Bernie Madoff. I'll also prevent the release of roughly three tons of carbon-dioxide emissions every year.LiNeBrEaKSo how do we make similar choices affordable for everyone, whether or not they have the savings to do this on their own? Imagine if the pending stimulus package helped people make such investments nationwide, combining direct incentives with low- or no-interest loans. Imagine if it prioritized energy efficiency and investment in American-made renewables,LiNeBrEaKI'm not saying high-efficiency furnaces solve our every problem. Plugging building leaks, adding insulation and switching light bulbs give the maximum energy-efficiency yield even more efficiency for fewer dollars. We need solutions that move us toward eliminating fossil-fuel use altogether, like solar thermal, advanced geothermal and ultra-efficient green buildings, and smart electrical grids. The 300,000-person Swedish city of Malmo already gets 40 percent of its residential heat (and 60 percent of its electricity) from a municipal incinerator plant.LiNeBrEaKBut adding a high-efficiency furnace buys time   like scrapping a Hummer to drive a Ford Focus   and if the furnaces are American-made, recycles money through our domestic economy. If we could replace every inefficient furnace with a high-efficiency model, we'd come out far ahead.LiNeBrEaKEvery industry is hurting these days. But if we spend close to a trillion dollars to jump-start the economy without simultaneously addressing issues such as fossil-fuel dependence, we may not have the resources to do so later on. We can continue to support consumption for its own sake, and that's what we've been doing. But although $5,000 granite countertops look swell, they don't solve global warming, heal our trade deficits or move us toward a more sustainable society. By addressing our root problems, we'd actually be investing in the future instead of cannibalizing it. We might even look back on our present crisis as a national turning point   but we have to make the wise investments now.LiNeBrEaKPaul Rogat Loeb is the author of "The Impossible Will Take a Little While  and "Soul of a Citizen.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Another View: Republicans uniting behind Obama  	OPINION  	286 words  	The American presidency has been described as a glorious burden, and never has that phrase seemed to ring more true - at least in our lifetimes - than it does today. Barack Obama is indeed taking on a glorious burden - one so heavy that many are left wondering why on earth anyone would want it. LiNeBrEaKYet Obama took office with the knowledge that the majority of Americans are confident in his ability to do the job.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 79 percent of Americans are optimistic about the next four years under Obama. Of those who voted for John McCain, 58 percent feel optimistic about an Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the respondents felt that things can't get much worse. That would be understandable, given the disastrous worldwide economy, rising unemployment at home, the plight of the uninsured, continued war in the Middle East, global warming ... the list goes on.LiNeBrEaKStill, given the divisiveness of the Obama-McCain election, we find it remarkable that in a few short months, so many Americans have been able to move past the bitterness and rancor of the campaign to unite behind the new president.LiNeBrEaKThat says much about Obama's ability to inspire, but we believe it says even more about ourselves as a nation - a nation of people willing to look past their many differences, especially in a time of crisis, to give a new president a fair shake.LiNeBrEaKGiven the high expectations for his presidency, Obama's honeymoon period could be short-lived indeed if he fails to deliver positive results, especially when it comes to the economy.LiNeBrEaKFor today, though, may the "glorious burden" not weigh too heavily on his shoulders - and may we all join in celebrating a new beginning.LiNeBrEaKThe Tribune, San Luis Obispo		US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); VOTERS and VOTING (78%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (78%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (76%); POLLS and SURVEYS (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  			BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN MCCAIN (91%)  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%); MIDDLE EAST (74%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Seattle Times (Washington)  	January 21, 2009 Wednesday 	Antarctica has gotten warmer over past 50 years, new research finds  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	876 words  	SEATTLE _ While average temperatures have been rising on all other continents, Antarctica has remained a paradox.LiNeBrEaKThe Antarctic Peninsula, an arm of land that reaches toward South America, is one of the planet's most rapidly warming spots and the site of spectacular ice-sheet collapses in recent years. But temperatures across the bulk of the ice-covered continent have appeared unchanged or dropping in places.LiNeBrEaKNow, a team led by a University of Washington scientist has combined satellite data and temperature measurements to find that, on average, Antarctica has gotten a little bit warmer over the past 50 years. LiNeBrEaK"That means all of the continents are warming, not just six out of seven," said geochemist Eric Steig, who leads the UW's Quaternary Research Center.LiNeBrEaKThe effect is particularly strong in West Antarctica, which is lower in elevation and more moderate in climate than the high, frigid plateau of East Antarctica. "West Antarctica is more like Seattle and East Antarctica is more like central North Dakota," Steig said.LiNeBrEaKA recent cooling trend that scientists believe is caused by a thinning of the ozone layer continues during some parts of the year in East Antarctica, where sea ice also is expanding, the researchers say. But warming elsewhere on the continent was strong enough to yield a net temperature gain.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is a likely factor, though the study published Thursday in the journal Nature says it's impossible yet to sort greenhouse effects from natural patterns and the role of human-caused ozone depletion.LiNeBrEaK"The greenhouse effect is almost certainly contributing to these warming trends, but we can't say how much," said co-author Drew Shindell, of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.LiNeBrEaKThe continentwide warming trend is modest _ slightly more than 1 degree Fahrenheit, which is roughly on a par with worldwide trends. The scientists caution that Antarctic records only go back five decades, a much shorter period than on other continents. But the finding does raise concerns about the future of Antarctica's glaciers and ice sheets, which hold 90 percent of Earth's frozen water.LiNeBrEaK"The reason most people worry about Antarctica is its potential contribution to long-term sea-level rise, and I would say this study is moderately worrisome in that respect," Shindell said.LiNeBrEaKMelting of the ice in West Antarctica alone could raise global sea level by 20 feet, but that would take centuries or even millennia, he said.LiNeBrEaKClimate studies in Antarctica are hampered by remoteness, punishing weather and the lack of data. The land mass _ the size of the continental United States and Mexico combined _ has only 42 permanent weather stations, most of them along the coast.LiNeBrEaK"It's a really tough job, and that's why this picture keeps changing," said Antarctic researcher David Bromwich, of Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center.LiNeBrEaKSteig and his colleagues compared all the data from the weather stations with 25 years' worth of satellite measurements of surface temperatures. Then they used the relationship between the two data sets to fill in gaps in temperature trends across the continent.LiNeBrEaK"It makes a lot of sense to me," said Andrew Carleton, professor of climatology at Penn State University. "One of the main advances in this (study) is their use of the satellite data ... to show trends."LiNeBrEaKBy bringing Antarctica in from the cold, the new study could undermine the small cadre of global-warming skeptics who still argue that the planet is not getting hotter, or that humans are not to blame. Many have used the apparent cooling in Antarctica to attack global climate models and point out perceived weaknesses in the scientific consensus that emissions from automobiles and factories are beginning to change global climate.LiNeBrEaK"The skeptics apparently have one less leg to stand on," Bromwich said.LiNeBrEaKBut he doesn't agree completely with the new study. In a new analysis of his own, as yet unpublished, Bromwich also finds evidence of significant warming in West Antarctica. But it's not enough to cancel out the cooling in East Antarctica for a continentwide temperature increase.LiNeBrEaKThe cooling in East Antarctica started in the late 1970s, Steig said, coinciding with a seasonal hole in the ozone layer caused by aerosol chemicals.LiNeBrEaKLower ozone concentrations cause the atmosphere to cool, and the effects are most pronounced over East Antarctica.LiNeBrEaKTemperature gradients due to the cooling in turn strengthen westerly winds, which at least partly explain the rapid warming on the Antarctic Peninsula _ though the new study suggests that global warming or other factors may have overtaken the ozone hole in shaping Antarctic climate.LiNeBrEaKThe culprit chemicals were phased out years ago, and the ozone hole is expected to heal by the middle of the century.LiNeBrEaK"If that happens, all of Antarctica could begin warming on a par with the rest of the world," Steig said.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday  Correction Appended	GREGOIRE PUSHES CAP-AND-TRADE BILL\ EMISSIONS WOULD COME AT A COST  	NEWS; Pg. A19  	750 words  	Companies that emit high greenhouse gases may need to change their ways or pay for it.LiNeBrEaKA bill called the Climate Action Plan has been requested by Gov. Chris Gregoire that places a cap on companies' emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe process, known as cap and trade, is nothing new and the bill has yet to be introduced this legislative session. But having the governor's backing gives it a better chance of becoming reality than ever before.LiNeBrEaKThough details of the program - which wouldn't be implemented until 2011 - are complex, here's the gist of what cap and trade would do, said Jay Manning, director of the Department of Ecology: LiNeBrEaKA cap would be placed on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that companies release, and companies would be required to buy permits in order to emit at the acceptable level. Companies also could auction off their permits between each other, creating their own market system.LiNeBrEaKFor example, if Company A can reduce its emissions more easily than Company B, Company A can auction off its permit - also known as an allowance - and Company B can buy that permit.LiNeBrEaKDifferent companies would have different costs and because permits would be auctioned, there is no concrete amount of how much a company would have to pay. Manning said that an initial design sets the minimum cost at $3 per ton of carbon dioxide and its equivalent gases, but the cost may be higher.LiNeBrEaKAnd what about companies that find it too hard to comply with the cap and can't find an allowance? Then they can buy an offset.LiNeBrEaKOffsets in this case would be forestland that companies can buy and plant trees on if they cannot find an allowance on the market. A company would calculate how much carbon dioxide could be reduced by the amount of trees it plants. That would make up for not being able to comply with the cap.LiNeBrEaKEvery three years, the cap will decrease.LiNeBrEaK"Typically, (companies) grow over time," Manning said. The idea is that companies will gradually reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and transition toward renewable energy alternatives as they expand and must decrease their carbon dioxide emissions, he said.LiNeBrEaKOne company that would be affected by this bill is Weyerhaeuser Co. "We support cap and trade," public affairs manager Anthony Chavez said. But he said Weyerhaeuser does not support the auction system that this program would create.LiNeBrEaKHe said the trading of allowances should be free, because all companies would have to work to reduce emissions, and companies that could not stay below the cap shouldn't be penalized by paying more.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Chavez said Weyerhaeuser does support offsets, since it could make money by selling its forestland to other companies.LiNeBrEaKBecky Kelley of the Washington Environmental Council and campaign director of the bill said that revenue generated from permit sales would be invested to create green jobs.LiNeBrEaKA criticism of a cap-and-trade system is that gas prices would increase and families with low to moderate income could be hurt by high energy bills.LiNeBrEaKBut Kelley said the revenue generated from cap and trade would be used to provide assistance for those families, in addition to green investment.LiNeBrEaKAnother criticism is that the nuances of the system are too complicated. Even Manning, an ardent supporter of the bill, said the creation of a new market system opens up room for manipulation that could potentially reach Enron-like proportions.LiNeBrEaK"We're hoping to create an oversight body that would watch over the market," Manning said. And with the state facing a $6 billion deficit, it is unlikely any kind of tax would fly high with lawmakers, anyway, he said.LiNeBrEaKIf passed, the program would not be implemented until 2011. Manning said if the cost of running the program would be too high, then the governor could suspend it.LiNeBrEaKCap and trade is no stranger to national politics, either. On June 2, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act was introduced to the U.S. Senate, calling for a similar national program.LiNeBrEaKAfter four days of debate and filibuster tactics - including a reading of the 492-page bill in its entirety - it failed, having stood little chance of passing at a time when gas was $4 a gallon.LiNeBrEaKIf the bill is introduced in Olympia, Rep. Dave Upthegrove, D-Des Moines, will sponsor it. Upthegrove said it was critical that the state get a head start on investing in a greener economy. "It's as much an economic issue as an environmental one," he said. "Do we want to be in the front or at the end of that?"

Edward M. Kennedy, ill with a brain tumor, was hospitalized Tuesday but quickly reported feeling well after suffering a seizure at a post-inauguration luncheon for President Barack Obama.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	A NATION'S PROUD DAY  	NATIONAL; TIMES EDITORIALS; THE INAUGURATION OF BARACK OBAMA; Pg. 16A  	524 words  	At midday Tuesday, Americans came together. From the multicolored sea of faces on the National Mall to crowds gathered around televisions across the country, the historic inauguration of Barack Obama as the nation's 44th president offered hope in a nation weary of war and staggered by economic crisis. Now the new president must marshal this renewed faith and thirst for change into a collective embrace of what he declared "a new era of responsibility.'' LiNeBrEaKObama's understated inaugural address did not sugarcoat the difficult issues facing the country. In what he called "this winter of our hardship,'' he eloquently linked the determination and sacrifices of previous generations to the commitment required from all of us to meet the tremendous challenges of today. It was a sober reminder of the values that carried America through crises of old and of the need now to recommit to a common sense of purpose.LiNeBrEaKEven as the president spoke of "reaffirming the greatness of our nation,'' there was no mistaking the message of change. There were pointed breaks with the outgoing administration. For example, the Bush White House had questioned the existence of global warming and preferred secrecy over transparency. Obama pledged to "restore science to its rightful place'' and to "do our business in the light of day.'' He also offered a powerful repudiation of accepting the erosion of civil liberties as the price of fighting terrorism. "As for our common defense,'' he said, "we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.''LiNeBrEaKThe message to the world was similarly direct, lest anyone consider Obama's campaign emphasis on diplomacy to be a sign of weakness. He warned that America is still determined to defeat terrorists, but he also told the Muslim world "we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.'' That is the sort of nuanced message that has been missing from the White House.LiNeBrEaKThe speech's broader strokes reflected the campaign themes that attracted so many voters to Obama as a leader determined to break out of old boxes. He said the issues are not whether government is too big or too small, or whether the financial markets are "a force for good or evil.''LiNeBrEaK"What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them - that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply,'' Obama said.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the ground shifted Tuesday in even more fundamental ways. The nation's first African-American president spoke from a Capitol largely built by slaves, before a crowd of more than 1-million stretched nearly 2 miles along the National Mall braving below-freezing weather for hours. He used the Bible last used for a presidential swearing-in by Abraham Lincoln, and he recalled that restaurants in Washington would have refused to serve his father not so many years ago. They were subtle, light touches on a day when the weight of history loomed large.LiNeBrEaKObama's inauguration was a proud moment for all of America, a reminder in so many ways of how far this nation has come even as it measures how far it has to go along the difficult road that lies ahead.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 21, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	Obama halts Bush's latter-day regulations  	News; Pg. A9  	310 words  	WASHINGTON (AP) One of President Barack Obama's first acts Tuesday was to put the brakes on all pending regulations that the Bush administration tried to push through in its waning days. The order went out shortly after Obama was inaugurated, in a memorandum signed by the new White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. Former President George W. Bush's administration moved into overdrive in the last year or so on a host of new regulatory proposals.  LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration will review everything that is still pending. In doing so, the Obama administration is taking a page out of Bush's playbook from 2001. Within hours after Bush was sworn in, his advisers were seeking to reverse some late-term actions of President Bill Clinton, who in his final 20 days in office issued 12 executive orders, including directives on migratory birds and the importation of diamonds from Sierra Leone. Eight years later, the Obama White House is making a similar move. In some cases, however, the Bush administration moved too fast for the incoming administration. For example, six weeks ago, the Bush administration issued revised endangered species regulations to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming. Obama has said he would work to reverse the changes. But because the rule takes effect before he is sworn in, he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process. The changes would eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews that government scientists have performed on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a requirement that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases. The rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project's contribution to increased global warming.

LiNeBrEaKLocal businessman Craig Compeau unveiled the frozen likeness on Monday.LiNeBrEaKThe 812-foot-tall, 5-ton sculpture dominates a downtown street corner from its perch on the back of a flatbed truck.LiNeBrEaKCompeau says he's a "moderate" critic of global warming theories. He used Monday's unveiling of the sculpture to invite Gore to Fairbanks -- where it was 22 degrees on Monday -- to explain his global-warming theories.LiNeBrEaKHe says it will stand through March, unless it melts before then.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Forests hold carbon credit opportunities  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	551 words  	Jan. 20--Forestry activities are emerging as opportunities for Thailand to tap into the fast growing international voluntary carbon credit market, which offers cheaper and faster project development than the regulated carbon credit market. LiNeBrEaKAfforestation, reforestation, revegetation, agricultural land management, improved forest management and reduced emission from deforestation (RED) projects could all sell carbon credits to the voluntary market, said the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organisation (TGO), which co-hosted a carbon credit conference on Friday with Tisco Securities and carbon credit consultancy Emergent Venture India (EVI)LiNeBrEaKThe US-initiated voluntary market enables emission reduction projects to sell credits to buyers without commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. These buyers are countries or organisations that volunteer to cut emissions for corporate social responsibility (CSR) motives or to build a green image.LiNeBrEaKThe voluntary market grew 165 percent in volume to 65 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (mtCO2e) in 2007 to reach a value of $331US million.LiNeBrEaKAs environmental awareness and CSR activities have soared in the private sector, the voluntary carbon market has risen dramatically, said Wannawut Apinanratanakul, Tisco's senior vice-president for investment banking group.LiNeBrEaKYet the regulated market remains far larger as buyers have mandatory targets under the Kyoto Protocol. The regulated market has been valued at $63. 6 billion with 2. 9 billion mtCO2e sold through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects.LiNeBrEaKA Certified Emission Reduction (CER) sold in the regulated market is also priced much higher than a Verified Emission Reduction (VER) traded in the voluntary market (around 12 compared with 2).LiNeBrEaKBut TGO deputy executive director Prasertsuk Chamornmarn said project development costs in the voluntary market are also significantly lower -- at $25,000 compared with $65,000 for a small CDM project and $160,000 for a large-scale one.LiNeBrEaKEmergent Venture India added that issuing a VER is also faster, requiring only about five months compared with 16-20 months for a CER to win approval from the CDM project's host country and the United Nations.LiNeBrEaKSmall forestry projects in rural areas of Thailand are best suited to the voluntary market due to their low transaction costs and faster development times, said EVI country manager Jatin Kapor.LiNeBrEaKMr Wannawut said the voluntary carbon market's growth had outstripped projections, with trading estimated at 150 mtCO2e according to investment analysts New Carbon Finance.LiNeBrEaKWith expected continued growth in over-the-counter transactions, total transactions in the voluntary market are expected to hit 557 mtCO2e in 2012.LiNeBrEaKCarbon brokers in the voluntary market include Tisco, HSBC, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. Buyers are mainly banks, retailers such as Unilever and non-profit organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

The Boston Herald 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   ALL EDITIONS	INAUGURATION 2009;   Op-Ed;   A role model for urban kids	EDITORIAL; Pg. 020  	210 words  	As a community organizer - I direct a youth development organization in Boston - I have already seen the election of Barack Obama have a positive effect on urban teens. In the days leading up to the election, young people were drawn to national politics as never before. They studied electoral maps and learned to differentiate between blue and red states. They predicted outcomes and argued about the issues, media coverage and whether America would vote for a black man. Through Obama's innovative campaign, teens learned that community-organizing strategies can lead us from dreams to victory. LiNeBrEaKNow, millions of youth are curious to know how the new president will fix the economy, create energy independence, address global warming, confront al-Qaeda and deal with youth violence, immigration and civil rights. Urban kids will no longer hit the clicker when the president is speaking on TV.LiNeBrEaKEducators now have the challenge of directing this interest into our classrooms through civic classes and project-based learning. Perhaps having a ``Community Organizer in Chief'' as president could be just the catalyst to engage young people through community action that addresses problems at the local level.LiNeBrEaKMartinez is executive director of the Hyde Square Task Force		EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); ADOLESCENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (78%); CITIES (77%); ELECTORAL DISTRICTS (73%); CIVIL RIGHTS (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (53%); IMMIGRATION (53%)  		AL-QAEDA (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (92%)  	BOSTON, MA, USA (92%) MASSACHUSETTS, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 20, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Boston Herald Inc.

Buffalo News (New York) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   ONLINE EDITION	Obama, Take 1  	BLOGS; Outrages and Insights  	914 words  	Barack Obama assumes the presidency today and not a moment too soon.LiNeBrEaKFor starters, it means we're rid of the most incompetent president in the history of the republic. Practically everything Dubya touched turned to you-know-what.LiNeBrEaKIt also means we're past the run-up to the inauguration and all the fawning by the press. The final straw for me was this Sunday's edition of the New York Times Magazine, with a huge photo spread entitled "Obama's People" that treated the subjects like for rock stars. I got a quarter of the way through it before closing the magazine in disgust. Journalism it was not. LiNeBrEaKPeople, I don't think it's going to get much better for a while. The press, like much of the nation, is smitten with our new president. The public I can understand - it's been a long eight years. But the press needs to get back to work.LiNeBrEaKThe national press often isn't good on the big stories anyway - witness the way it played lapdog to Dubya after 9-11 and the run-up to the Iraq fiasco, how it never saw the financial meltdown coming. So anything resembling real scrutiny - as opposed to meaningless controversy - of the new administration is going to have to come from the wings. At least for a while.LiNeBrEaKMe, I'll continue to read the mainstream press, but I'm going to be seeking out voices on the left and right to round out the picture. I'm not talking wind-bag entertainers like Rush Limbaugh, but people with informed, intellectual heft. I suggest you do likewise.LiNeBrEaKAs for Obama, I, like almost all Americans, save those still lamenting Lee's surrender at Appomattox, hope he succeeds. He's certainly a bright, capable guy who seems to have much of the "right stuff" necessary to be a successful president, especially during these especially difficult times.LiNeBrEaKMy fear is that he'll get sucked into Washington's political culture and the thinking that goes with it and we'll end up with a lot more status quo than the nation thought it was signing on for when it voted for change in November. I think we're already seeing signs of it in some of his key appointments and early decisions.LiNeBrEaKI like a lot of his senior appointments, starting with the cast he's assembled to deal with global warming. Smart, accomplished, top-notch people. And a lot of other progressive people elsewhere. Finally, some brains and competency.LiNeBrEaKBut some of the key appointments involving big problems, starting with the economy and foreign policy, give me pause.LiNeBrEaKIn Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner, Obama has empowered two prominent members of the deregulation crowd that helped set the table for the financial mess we're in now. For encores, Summers got run out of Harvard and Geithner got nailed for failing to pay tens of thousands of dollars in taxes.LiNeBrEaKYeah, yeah, I know, they're both "brilliant." So was Robert McNamara, and all he has to show for his smarts is 50,000 body bags shipped back from Vietnam.LiNeBrEaKI wouldn't trust Summers and Geithner with my 401-K, much less the national economy. Come to think of it, we did trust these two, among others, and look where it's gotten us.LiNeBrEaKThen there's Hillary over at the State Department.LiNeBrEaKLet's see, as First Lady she botched health care reform. As a U.S. Senator, she didn't do squat for upstate and blew the biggest vote of her career, giving Dubya the green light to got hunting for imaginary WMDs. As a candidate for president, she ran what most observers agree was a pretty crummy campaign. And of late, we've been treated to the news that she used her clout as a Senator on behalf of big donors to her husband's foundation.LiNeBrEaKYeah, this is someone I want to entrust world peace to.LiNeBrEaKAnd the beat goes on.LiNeBrEaKWe've got Eric Holder incoming as attorney general, a guy involved in some of Slick Willie's most-dubious dealings.LiNeBrEaKWe've got Tom Daschle lined up to be secretary of health and human services. Maybe he can ask the doctors to help him regenerate the spine he shed as head of the Senate Democrats when they decided to roll over and play dead when Dubya declared war on the Constitution and human decency.LiNeBrEaKAnd then there's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, who took time away from government in the late 1990s and early 2000s to work as an investment banker, parlaying his contacts into millions of dollars. In the middle of it, he served on the asleep-at-the-wheel board of Freddie Mac during a wave of scandals.LiNeBrEaKLook, I know much of this stuff is child's play compared to the Bush crowd, but Obama promised us better.LiNeBrEaKA few of Obama's early decisions leave me wondering, as well, starting with the economic bailout.LiNeBrEaKHe still favors big tax breaks as a way of stimulating the economy, even though the consensus is that they won't deliver much bang for the buck. He's pushed Congress to release a second wave of bailout money without fixing the problems with the first one, which has been an unqualified bust. And too much of the Phase Two money is earmarked for purposes that don't strike me as having much to do with fixing the economy. But it will give pols like Chuck Schumer an opportunity to play Santa Claus.LiNeBrEaKThen there's the company Obama is keeping.LiNeBrEaKI didn't have a problem with him palling around with Bill Ayers. But breaking bread with George Will and his right wing buddies is another matter. I'm only half kidding.LiNeBrEaKMemo to Obama: Don't talk to those people. They give bad advice and are part of the crowd we just put out at the curb.LiNeBrEaKMy grumbling notwithstanding, I think Obama has the potential to be a good, maybe great president. But I'm prepared to be disappointed.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Big moment but 'small step'  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1579 words  	Jan. 20--COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Sometimes, history comes full circle.LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, Hannah Jane Hurdle-Toomey, one of the last living children of an African-American slave, will be watching intently on TV as an African-American family takes up residence in the White House, a national monument built by slaves.LiNeBrEaK"At last, the time has come," said the 76-year-old retired Oregon pastor whose father, Andrew Jackson Hurdle, was born into slavery in North Carolina in 1845. "This at least will give our young African-American children hope that they, too, can achieve. We had just about collectively given up."LiNeBrEaKSometimes, history puts things right. LiNeBrEaKOn the front lawn of the South Carolina state Capitol, hard by the Confederate flag waving in the breeze and next to the monument honoring Confederate soldiers, stands a forbidding statue of one of America's most notorious white supremacists.LiNeBrEaK"We have done our level best. We have scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one of them, and we would have done it if we could," declared Benjamin Tillman, a South Carolina governor and senator, speaking of black Americans on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1900. "We stuffed ballot boxes. We shot them. We are not ashamed of it. We of the South have never recognized the right of the Negro to govern white men, and we never will."LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, when the first black man in American history recites the presidential oath of office, Benjamin Tillman officially becomes moot.LiNeBrEaKFor a nation sucker-punched by an economic crisis, a world rocked back on its heels by terrorism and a planet gasping for relief from a steadily warming climate, the inauguration of President Barack Hussein Obama offers a breathtaking moment of audacious hope.LiNeBrEaKUnemployed Americans with evaporated medical insurance are hoping Obama's promised health reforms come through before they get sick. Vulnerable Americans living along the nation's coasts are hoping Obama does something about climate change before the seas rise any higher. War-weary Americans with sons and daughters in the U.S. armed forces are hoping Obama can bring the precarious interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan to a secure conclusion. Black Americans still victimized by systemic racial inequalities are hoping that Obama will address the nation's unfinished business of equal opportunity.LiNeBrEaKAnd every American who is hoping to send a child to college, care for an elderly parent or simply retire without having to take a full-time job as a Wal-Mart greeter is praying that Obama can chart a way out of the nation's deepening financial crisis.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't vote for Obama," said a woman hurrying out of an unemployment office in downtown Columbia, "but if he can create some jobs down here, a lot of us will be willing to change our minds."LiNeBrEaKThe nation's 44th president will scarcely resemble all the Establishment white men who came before him. In fact, even as the Obamas finally integrate 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. after more than 200 years, outgoing President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, will be heading back to Texas to a newly-purchased home in an exclusive, 82-percent-white Dallas neighborhood where, until just a few years ago, home sellers routinely attached "racial covenants" to their property deeds to prevent blacks from buying in.LiNeBrEaKBut President Obama, the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, will look very much like the new, multiracial, multicultural America he will begin to lead -- a nation that, by the time Obama's two young daughters reach middle age, will no longer have a majority white population.LiNeBrEaKYet not only Democrats or liberals or African-Americans will be rejoicing on Inauguration Day. Polls show that more than three-fourths of Americans -- many of them Republican and conservative and white -- are pulling for Obama in these perilous times, far more than the 53 percent of the electorate that voted for him.LiNeBrEaK"You'd have to be irrational not to want the new president to succeed," Newt Gingrich, one of the Republican Party's ideological standard-bearers, recently told The New York Times.LiNeBrEaKThere is another national yearning out there as well, one as old as America's founding sin of slavery -- the hope that, 146 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and nearly 46 years after Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of his evocative dream, Obama's presidency might finally salve the wounds of America's enduring struggles over race.LiNeBrEaKToday, of course, all Americans have the right to vote, or live where they choose, or eat where they want.LiNeBrEaKThe nation can look back at the grainy newsreels of little black girls being escorted by federal marshals into public schools; or the faded photographs of red-faced sheriffs unleashing vicious dogs on peaceful protesters; or the museum displays of "Whites Only" signs posted above water fountains and restrooms, and take comfort in the notion that such Old South anachronisms are locked away in America's shameful Jim Crow past.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, liberated from the rigid categories of "black" or "white," 2 percent of Americans now identify themselves to census-takers as members of two or more races -- like Obama, the progeny of interracial unions that not so long ago triggered arrests and even public lynchings.LiNeBrEaK"We're very excited about the potential for Barack Obama to ignite a very productive discussion about race and culture," said Louie Gong, president of the MAVIN Foundation, an interest group for people of mixed racial heritage. "For the first time, people who aren't multiracial and who have never been concerned with racial issues are really thinking about what it means to be mixed."LiNeBrEaKBut all of that substantial progress only casts into sharper relief how much remains to be done in a nation where some experts say it will take another 500 years for African-Americans to bridge the income gap with whites, where Hispanic immigrants are vilified by TV pundits denouncing them as vectors for leprosy, where the party of Lincoln does not have a single African-American among its 219 senators and representatives in Washington and where many inner-city schools remain as racially segregated -- and educationally deficient -- as they were half a century ago.LiNeBrEaK"The reality is that, for African-Americans, we have lost all the progress we had made since the 1960s," said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at the University of California at Los Angeles and a leading expert on school desegregation. "For whites, it is a lost opportunity to prepare" for the nation's multiethnic future.LiNeBrEaKContrary to the fondest hopes of liberal Americans -- and the insistent declarations of conservatives -- America is decidedly not yet "post-racial."LiNeBrEaKRace, particularly the historic divide between blacks and whites, is still the abiding subtext of many of our national conversations.LiNeBrEaK"On the day after Obama's election, I went to the post office, and the postman couldn't find anything to call me but 'girl,' " said Hurdle-Toomey, whose father, the former slave, died three years after she was born in 1932. "I went to the gym to work out, and a woman asked me if I would do her laundry. You would think there was a committee set up to remind me I am just one generation away from slavery."LiNeBrEaKObama never campaigned to become the nation's first black president. He wants instead to be seen as the first president who happens to be black. And black political leaders are acutely sensitive to the distinction, mindful that a successful president must govern from the center and not be seen as beholden to any particular interest group.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think we are going to be walking up to him and saying 'Brother President,' " Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, told a forum at Williams College in November. "He's not the Black Caucus president. He is the president of America. He's the leader of all Americans."LiNeBrEaKOthers, however, emphasize that they will be looking to the new president and his Justice Department to focus on issues of justice and equality.LiNeBrEaK"Although Obama's candidacy has fantastically and forever shattered the shackles in the American psyche that a black person can't make it in America, it says nothing -- yet -- about what blacks as a people can achieve," said Rev. Al Sharpton. "Until we have reached that tipping point where race does not negatively affect millions of people of color -- as opposed to just one -- there is still much more work for me and other civil rights leaders to do."LiNeBrEaKLonnie Randolph Jr., the president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, is similarly wary. He has been struggling for years to force state officials to repair scores of rural schools -- attended mostly by impoverished black students -- where the roofs leak, the bathrooms are filled with sewage and there is no working heat or air conditioning.LiNeBrEaK"The inauguration is not going to solve the problem in our schools," Randolph said.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Eugene Robinson: Obama knows who he is and the nation is about to find out  	OPINION  	743 words  	BARACK OBAMA STAGED his arrival in Washington to evoke Abraham Lincoln's, but the historical echo is faint. Lincoln's famous train ride to his 1861 inauguration traversed a landscape of bitterness and strife. He had to speed through Baltimore "like a thief in the night" for fear of riots and possible assassination. Obama, by contrast, was met by tens of thousands of Baltimoreans who braved subfreezing temperatures to cheer the new president. As Obama made his way to the capital, he crossed a landscape of hope.LiNeBrEaKRarely has a new presidency been greeted with such a consensus of goodwill   and rarely has a new president so needed it. LiNeBrEaKThe importance of Obama's mind-blowing historical breakthrough can hardly be overstated. Slavery vexed the Founding Fathers; if not for Lincoln's iron determination, it would have ripped the nation apart. For nearly a century after African-Americans were freed from bondage, American society still relegated us to a corner reserved for second-class citizens. Having a black man as president does not magically eliminate racial disparities in income or wealth; it does not fix inner-city schools, repair crumbling neighborhoods or heal dysfunctional families. Psychologically, though, it changes everything.LiNeBrEaKOur mental furniture is being rearranged. The advent of Obama's presidency brings the African-American experience to center stage, but does so in a way that allows society to congratulate itself on having come so far. The implications for black Americans are even more profound, because seeing Obama in the White House obliterates any logic behind self-imposed limits on imagination and ambition.LiNeBrEaKThese are huge impacts   which makes it ironic that, in the end, race is likely to be secondary in defining Obama's place in history.LiNeBrEaKSince Obama's election, I've heard more than one friend joke sardonically that the nation has said sure, a black man can run the country, go right ahead and take your turn   now that the economy is in the tubes, the financial system is a wreck, we're mired in two wars, global warming is parboiling the planet, the government has been forced to spend a trillion dollars or more just to stave off utter ruin and there's precious little money left to finance desperately needed reforms in health care, education, energy, infrastructure ...LiNeBrEaKExpectations that Obama will be able to solve this daunting array of problems are strikingly high. A new Washington Post poll finds that 61 percent of Americans have a "good amount" or "great deal" of confidence that Obama will make the right decisions for the country. A remarkable 72 percent are "fairly" or "very" confident that Obama's economic program   whatever it ultimately turns out to be   will improve the economy.LiNeBrEaKAn Associated Press poll reports that 65 percent of Americans believe Obama will be an "above average" president, including 28 percent who expect him to be "outstanding." Almost two-thirds of Americans, the AP finds, believe their own financial situation will improve during the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKThe conventional wisdom is that Obama risks losing public support through disillusionment as people discover that he can't wave a magic wand and make everything better. But the conventional wisdom has been wrong about Obama so many times over the past year that I use it more as a guide to what's not likely to happen.LiNeBrEaKThe truth is that no one knows whether Barack Obama will be a good president, much less a great president. All that anyone, including Obama, can be sure of is that his will be a consequential presidency   an important piece of knowledge. It took the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to broaden the scope and ambition of George W. Bush's presidency, for better or worse. Obama takes office knowing beyond all doubt that he has no choice but to swing for the fences.LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, as Obama was launching his campaign   over the objections of the Democratic Party establishment, which was still listening to the conventional wisdom   I interviewed him in his Senate office. I was struck by his confidence and his conviction that this was his time, and especially by how unflappable he appeared to be. I saw him last week, after a campaign that had the rest of us on the edge of our seats for months and months, and he seemed temperamentally unchanged.LiNeBrEaKOur new president is a man who knows exactly who he is. The nation, filled with hope, is about to find out.LiNeBrEaKEugene Robinson's e-mail address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com		EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (91%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CIVIL RIGHTS (74%); FAMILY (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (71%); POLLS and SURVEYS (68%); EDUCATION (66%); INFRASTRUCTURE (50%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  			BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	UNITED STATES (97%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	By Eugene Robinson Syndicated columnist

I am sick to death of my tax dollars paying for atrocities. And I am sick to death of the media fostering the belief that this is what Jews want.LiNeBrEaKI am Jewish. Palestinians are my cousins. I do not want massacres committed in my name. What my ancestors went through was more than sufficient suffering. For shame that any of us should miss the lesson and inflict such agony on even one other human being, let alone an entire population. LiNeBrEaKAtrocities have been visited upon my Palestinian sisters and brothers since the founding of the state of Israel. Endless years of displacement, occupation, humiliation, ethnic cleansing and apartheid conditions. Every year the U.N. votes on resolutions to end the conflict, nearly unanimously, with only the U.S. and Israel standing in the way. The Arab nations have put forth workable solutions, also rebuffed by the U.S. and Israel.LiNeBrEaKEvery year, billions of my tax dollars are sent in weapons and aid to Israel and used against the occupied Palestinian population. Every year nearly every congress person votes his or her support. Yet the vast majority of folks I know do not want our hard-earned tax dollars being used this way.LiNeBrEaKThe vast majority of Jews I know do not want our hard-earned tax dollars being used this way. Even if you believe that Israel is a friend, you must curtail the actions of a friend who has gone much too far and crossed the line into committing war crimes. Massacre is massacre. Call it what it is.LiNeBrEaKWhen will our elected officials grow a conscience or a spine, open their eyes and mouths and join the rest of us who are appalled, disgusted, horrified, sickened and outraged, and say enough already?LiNeBrEaKJoshua BethLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKOnerous standardsLiNeBrEaKTHE CALIFORNIA Air Resources Board dashed the first true progress that was made on electric cars in this country, as chronicled in the documentary "Who Killed the Electric Car." They are poised to do it again, this time to the plug-in hybrid vehicle.LiNeBrEaKThey are poised to make a ruling that will cripple the nascent plug-in hybrid conversion industry by imposing onerous testing and warranty standards that capital poor entrepreneurs cannot provide. In the process, they will violate their own mandate to reduce global warming pollution.LiNeBrEaKThey are validly concerned about air pollution that can increase when a hybrid's gas engine is started less frequently. However, conversion companies have since found that simply having their software turn on the gas engine for a period whenever the car starts renders these air quality issues nil.LiNeBrEaKGiven that the air quality issues are now gone, and with CARB's mandate to reduce global warming pollution, CARB has no rational choice but to work these conversion companies to find an equitable solution to keep plug-in hybrids on the road.LiNeBrEaKI'd rather not have to watch another documentary in five years about how CARB could have done the right thing but didn't.LiNeBrEaKDaniel BellLiNeBrEaKOaklandLiNeBrEaKWhy attack?LiNeBrEaKPRESIDENT BUSH and Dick Cheney have both used the fact of no terrorist attacks on the U.S. in more than seven years since 9/11 as major proof of their success in office.LiNeBrEaKWhy would the terrorists return here to attack us when we have sent them thousands of our U.S. military personnel to be conveniently killed over there?

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	For California, new clout in Obama's tech-friendly administration  	NEWS  	1013 words  	and Mary Anne OstromLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON   Barbara Boxer remembers the "dark days" when California and its issues were dismissed by official Washington with disdain and hostility.LiNeBrEaK"Dianne Feinstein and I joked that it was ABC   anything but California, anyone but California," Boxer said, recalling when the two Democrats joined the Senate in 1993.LiNeBrEaKNow, as California Democrats fill Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration, the state can claim a surge of influence in the new, tech-friendly administration. Congress, too, is looking westward, with Californians taking key positions of power. LiNeBrEaKTwo Californians were named to Obama's Cabinet   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu at the Energy Department and Rep. Hilda Solis at the Labor Department   and Leon Panetta, former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, has been appointed to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.LiNeBrEaKObama also named a pair of Golden Staters to key White House posts: Christina Romer, a Berkeley economist, will head the Council of Economic Advisers, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, will bring her experience as a state environmental regulator to the job of leading the Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"These are superstar choices. California is 'in' right now, and we can remember when California was 'out,'" Boxer said. "There is a lot more respect for the state, especially on energy issues."LiNeBrEaKShift on tech, energyLiNeBrEaKOn a policy level, it's a shift from oil drilling to renewable energy, from sidestepping the issue of global warming to dealing with it aggressively, from a pro-industry stance to greater sympathy for organized labor.LiNeBrEaKRep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat, measured the change this way: "I remember Gov. Jerry Brown coming to Washington talking about windmills, and people made fun of him. Now everybody is talking about wind energy and solar."LiNeBrEaKCalifornians with deep experience in tech and energy issues, particularly clean technology, have Obama's ear. That includes Eric Schmidt,  chief executive of Google, venture capitalist John Doerr, who is close to Al Gore, and John Thompson, the former Symantec CEO who may be a contender for commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKThat influence can be seen in major ingredients in the $825 billion stimulus package prepared by the House with the Obama team's input. Doerr, for example, lobbied for the $11 billion that would go toward modernizing the electricity grid. Tech groups pushed hard for $6 billion in grants to speed up broadband deployment. Wind-energy advocates secured a long-term extension of the production tax credit.LiNeBrEaKAnd California renewable-energy companies and investors, struggling with the frozen credit market, cheered when Obama announced his goal of doubling the production of renewable energy in the next three years.LiNeBrEaK"I think what the Obama administration intends to do is move the technology that has been pioneered in California across the country," said Cathy Zoi, CEO of Palo Alto-based Alliance for Climate Protection.LiNeBrEaKThe state's new clout should not be viewed in the traditional sense of more "pork" for California, said Norm Ornstein, an author and longtime analyst of government for the American Enterprise Institute. But it will play out in other ways.LiNeBrEaK"There will be a greater sensibility on issues that matter to California and drive the California economy," Ornstein said. "It helps that Obama puts a high priority about keeping the nation's edge on technology, and is listening to Silicon Valley on that."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia-friendlyLiNeBrEaKSome appointees are not from California but tend to view key issues in California-friendly ways. Carol Browner, a top Obama adviser on energy and the environment, supported the state's pioneering regulations as Environmental Protection Agency chief. And Gov. Janet Napolitano, of Arizona, a graduate of Santa Clara University who has worked on border-state issues, has been named to head the Homeland Security Department.LiNeBrEaKObama is unlikely to cultivate as cozy a relationship with the state as Bill Clinton did, predicted Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College who worked for Republicans during the Reagan and first Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKBut he agrees that just as Reagan-style California conservatism was adopted in Washington in the 1980s, Obama is likely to embrace California-style progressivism.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the 1990s, when Clinton had to deal with a Republican majority in Congress, Democrats now control both branches, with state leaders well-represented   starting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKLofgren, who heads the immigration subcommittee in the House, knows she can get Napolitano on the phone if there's a problem with the immigration bureaucracy, or she can contact Solis on a labor issue.LiNeBrEaKLofgren heads the delegation of 34 California Democrats in the House, which met last week and bid farewell to Solis.LiNeBrEaK"There in the room were the chairmen of the Energy Committee (Henry Waxman,) Education and Labor (George Miller), Foreign Affairs (Howard Berman), and Veterans Affairs (Bob Filner)," Lofgren said. "I thought, if you wanted to get something done, come to this room."LiNeBrEaKState labor leaders expect that with Solis in the Cabinet, they will have a friendly ear on minimum-wage and family-leave issues, and other concerns of an increasingly immigrant work force. Solis, from Los Angeles, is the daughter of immigrants and her father was a union worker.LiNeBrEaK"She is very well-connected and can help bridge the gap and the tensions between immigrant workers and other sectors of the community, including some unions," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.LiNeBrEaKBut Pitney, a veteran observer of Washington, warned that Californians looking for rapid change on energy, labor and other issues from Obama and other leaders they just elected may be disappointed.LiNeBrEaK"Electing officials is a lot like shopping online," Pitney said. "Everything looks better when you log on than when the package arrives at the door."LiNeBrEaKReach Frank Davies at 202-662-8921. Reach Mary Anne Ostrom at 415-477-3794.

Daily Camera (Boulder, Colorado)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Boulder, Colo., carbon watchers watch Obama  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	324 words  	Jan. 20--BOULDER, Colo. -- Long before George W. Bush admitted that global warming is likely caused by humans and Al Gore swept the nation with his inconvenient truths, people in Boulder County were already battling greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKBlame it on the dense concentration of climate scientists or the overflow of renewable-energy startups. Whatever the reason, a lot of people in Boulder spend a lot of time thinking about the perils of carbon.LiNeBrEaKSo when Barack Obama declared his intentions to reduce carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050, many of Boulder's longtime climate crusaders were delighted -- but a bit skeptical.LiNeBrEaK"The Obama administration is unquestionably going to bring new momentum to both domestic and international efforts to address climate change," said Kevin Doran, senior research fellow for the University of Colorado's Center for Energy and Environmental Security. "Remember, though, that the bar for achieving 'new momentum' was set pathetically low by the current administration."LiNeBrEaKDoran warned that people shouldn't underestimate the "huge" challenge ahead.LiNeBrEaK"We are talking about a revolution in the way we produce and consume energy," he said.LiNeBrEaKLeslie Glustrom, who tirelessly crusades against coal, is also tirelessly optimistic.LiNeBrEaK"The president-elect has recognized that bold action is needed," said Glustrom, who founded the nonprofit Clean Energy Action. "And by taking bold action to re-power our country, we can address climate change, rejuvenate our economy and achieve energy independence all at the same time."

El Paso Times (Texas)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Juarez residents react to Obama's inauguration  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	455 words  	Jan. 20--Juarez political leaders and residents said Tuesday they have high hopes the Barack Obama presidency will lead to a positive relationship between the United States and Mexico. LiNeBrEaKMayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Obama has generated a contagious hope in the American people, which has spread to Mexico due to the closeness of the two countries.LiNeBrEaKHe said the border has embraced Obama's vision, because he and his team understand how to solve the nations' mutual problems. As an example, he cited Obama's appointment of Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as secretary of Homeland Security.LiNeBrEaK"The appointment of someone who is familiar with the border, and with our trade agreement and other issues, was a wise one, a departure from the past appointment of someone who rarely visited the border and much less understood it," said Reyes Ferriz, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).LiNeBrEaKJuarez resident Normando Sagarnaga, a state board officer of the National Action Party (PAN) of Chihuahua, said he listened to Obama's speech, and believes the United States and Mexico will have a better working relationship than in the past.LiNeBrEaK"Obama came across as honest and willing to do what he promised," Sagarnaga said. "I hope his administration will be mindful of the labor Mexican immigrants have invested in the United States, and sees to it that people of Mexico are treated fairly and with respect."LiNeBrEaKLorena Edna Fuerte, a political activist in Juarez who is trying to start a new political party,LiNeBrEaKsaid Obama faces a "titanic" job as a new world leader.LiNeBrEaK"He ought to eliminate war as a policy tool, deal with global warming, and also address the world's food crisis environmental problems," she said, "as well as work toward generating an international synergy, which will lead to more equal standards of living for everyone."LiNeBrEaKDaniel Rocha, a Juarez labor activist who worked in the maquiladora industry for 20 years, said he believes the direction of the U.S. government will change under Obama.LiNeBrEaK"He has sought a closer relationship with Latinos, and that is great," Rocha said. "We are looking for a U.S.-Mexico relationship that will produce benefits for employees of the maquiladoras, braceros, and other workers, and for Mexico and Latin America in general."LiNeBrEaKDiana Washington Valdez may be reached at dvaldez@elpasotimes.com; 546-6140.

Eufaula Tribune (Alabama)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	BRIEF: Students learn about inauguration  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	276 words  	Jan. 20--It's a Thursday morning at Admiral Moorer Middle School, and social studies teacher Jennings Gilmore is deep in conversation with his class of eighth graders. LiNeBrEaKThey are discussing the issues that will face President-elect Barack Obama when he takes the oath of office today.LiNeBrEaK"If you were Obama's Chief of Staff, how would you advise our new president?" asks Gilmore. "What topics would you address first?"LiNeBrEaKThe kids throw around issues that will concern the new president deeply: Global warming, the war in Iraq, the faltering economy, the Middle East crisis.LiNeBrEaK"The economy is probably the most important item," says Gilmore. "It's so important he (Obama) is already working on a $700 billion stimulus package."LiNeBrEaKThis leads to offshoot discussions of deficit spending, the debate on global warming, the war in Afghanistan and the strife between Israelis and Palestinians. The students are being educated on several topics by playing Obama's cabinet.LiNeBrEaKGilmore isn't the only teacher at AMMS preparing his students for the inauguration of the 44th United States president. Each day during 10-minute "character education moments", middle school students are exposed to some aspect of today's inauguration and why it will be such a historic event.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday  Correction Appended	We need to know effects of dredging river channel  	RONALD L. LITTLEPAGE; Pg. B-7  	422 words  	If it comes to jobs and money vs. the health of the St. Johns River, which would be the loser?LiNeBrEaKThat's a critical question to ask as the Jacksonville Port Authority pursues deepening the river's main channel to accommodate the bigger ships Jaxport hopes to bring here. LiNeBrEaKMuch of the recent debate on the river's health has focused on a proposal by the St. Johns River Water Management District to withdraw up to 262 million gallons of water a day from the river and its main tributary, the Ocklawaha, to supply water to Central Florida.LiNeBrEaKOpponents of the plan have argued that taking that much water could change the salinity levels farther upstream and harm the vegetation and fish and critters that live there.LiNeBrEaKAfter listening to the protests, the water management district began a three-year scientific study of the effects of the water withdrawal.LiNeBrEaKThe first phase was completed in December and an interim report was released last week (www.sjrmd.com/surfacewaterwithdrawals).LiNeBrEaKAs you might imagine, the report contains a lot of big words.LiNeBrEaKBut one thing is clear: The water withdrawal isn't the only concern.LiNeBrEaKThe first phase of the study looked at three other factors:LiNeBrEaK- The removal of wastewater now going into the river for reuse and the reduction of nutrients.LiNeBrEaK- The rise in sea level that's likely with climate change.LiNeBrEaK- And the port's plan to deepen the main channel from 40 feet to 45 feet.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the report's executive summary, "Results show that the proposed channel deepening scenarios ... cause the greatest increase in St. Johns River salinity."LiNeBrEaKAnd that's at 45 feet. It's likely Jaxport will want to go deeper to handle even larger ships.LiNeBrEaKThe district's study will now try to gauge the effects of salinity changes on the river's inhabitants. That phase of the study is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2010.LiNeBrEaKTo deepen the channel, the Port Authority will have to get a dredging permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.LiNeBrEaKThe corps will take into consideration the environmental impact of the dredging.LiNeBrEaKBefore making a decision, it should wait until the results of this study are known.LiNeBrEaKObviously, the St. Johns River system is complex, and as we humans have proved many times, messing with nature can have devastating effects.LiNeBrEaKJust as obvious, the jobs that come with additional port activity are a big part of our economy.LiNeBrEaKBut just as the water withdrawal needs a thorough vetting so does doing additional dredging.LiNeBrEaKWe should know what we are getting into before and not after.LiNeBrEaKron.littlepage@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4284		RIVERS (91%); HARBORS and PORTS (90%); WATER and WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT (90%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (90%); MARINE and WATERWAY CONSTRUCTION (89%); PORT AUTHORITIES (89%); HARBOR and PORT OPERATIONS (89%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); ENGINEERING (73%); WATER QUALITY (72%); SCIENCE NEWS (71%); CIVIL ENGINEERING (71%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (65%); ARMIES (65%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (65%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (74%)  	ASK ASA (91%)  			JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA (92%) FLORIDA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 30, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Florida Times-Union   	RONALD L.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   ALL S EDITION	Inauguration builds on King's dream;  'Justice is a journey and we're getting further and further along,' Pastor Rick Warren says 	NATION / WORLD; Pg. A2  	442 words  	ATLANTA -- The inauguration of the nation's first black president is a huge step toward realizing Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of racial equality, but there is still work to be done, King's nephew told a crowd Monday at the church where the civil rights leader once preached. LiNeBrEaKIsaac Newton Farris, president of The King Center, told the jubilant crowd on Martin Luther King Jr. Day that the election of Barack Obama was built on a foundation laid by King.LiNeBrEaK"There is definitely a spiritual connection between these two events," Farris told the mostly black congregation that erupted in applause at any mention of Obama's name.LiNeBrEaKThough Obama's election to the nation's highest office is a milestone, King's final achievement will not be complete until disparities in health care, education and economics are eliminated, he said.LiNeBrEaK"The dream was not about an individual or any race of people attaining power," Farris said. "It was a human dream."LiNeBrEaKThe sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church was packed with about 2,000 people, and dozens were left outside.LiNeBrEaKThe celebration also included a keynote address from Pastor Rick Warren, a Southern Baptist who was to give the invocation at Obama's inauguration. Warren urged the crowd to follow King's example of service and selflessness.LiNeBrEaK"Tomorrow when I pray the invocation for my friend, Dr. King and a whole host of witnesses will be shouting," Warren said. "Martin Luther King was a mighty tool in the hand of God. But God isn't through. Justice is a journey, and we're getting further and further along."LiNeBrEaKThe selection of Warren, who opposes same-sex marriage in his home state of California, was controversial for both events. Obama's decision to give Warren a role in the inauguration sparked protests from the gay community and the National Organization for Women. At the Atlanta service, about 100 protesters gathered across the street.LiNeBrEaKFarris defended The King Center's choice of keynote speaker, saying Warren's stances on issues such as global warming, AIDS and poverty are in keeping with King's ideals.LiNeBrEaKKing preached at Ebenezer from 1960 until his death in 1968, and a service commemorating his birthday and life are held there annually. On Election Night, the mainly black audience there was moved to tears when news networks announced that Obama had won the presidential race.LiNeBrEaKKing would have been 80 on Jan. 15.LiNeBrEaKOnly one of King's three living children, Bernice, attended the Monday event. His sister, Christine King Farris, led the ceremony.LiNeBrEaKKing's son Martin Luther King III was in Washington already and his other son Dexter King -- who lives in California -- did not attend. Their sister, Yolanda, died in 2007.

The Janesville Gazette (Wisconsin)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Kids offer words of praise, advice for Obama  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	461 words  	Jan. 20--JANESVILLE -- Tariq Mason smiled broadly Monday when asked about today's events in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKIt's important to him that Barack Obama will become the first African American president, the fifth-grader said, "because I'm African American." LiNeBrEaKMany children across the country will watch the events in Washington, D.C., on TV in school today. Tariq and others at Jackson School will be among them.LiNeBrEaK"It's very news-breaking," fourth-grader John Jones said of Obama's historic first.LiNeBrEaKFourth-grader Ebony Brooks said she admired Barack Obama for having the courage to run in the face of the racism of people who might not want him to be president.LiNeBrEaKThe Janesville Gazette talked to a handful of Jackson School students and asked what they would advise the new president.LiNeBrEaKTheir comments showed a grasp of the major issues of the day. Here are some of them:LiNeBrEaK-- "Try to help the economy, because we need money, plus GM closed," John said.LiNeBrEaKThose economic factors will depress local house prices, which is not a good thing, said John, who said he learned his economics from his parents.LiNeBrEaK-- "He should stop relying on the Middle East for oil because we have to pay to get it shipped over here, and that raises our gas prices," Tariq suggested.LiNeBrEaK-- "I would want him to open all the factories that have closed," said fifth-grader Megan McGuire.LiNeBrEaKMegan said her father lost his job at Lear Corp. after the local General Motors plant ceased production of SUVs.LiNeBrEaKHer father is going to school at Blackhawk Technical College, Megan said, but she'd like him to have his job back.LiNeBrEaKObama could also work to lower prices at the grocery store, Megan said.LiNeBrEaK-- "I think he should help kids in foster care and kids up for adoption," said Ebony, who worried that such children don't have parents and could be out on the street.LiNeBrEaK"They need help. They need a real family," she said.LiNeBrEaK-- "I would ask him if he could try to get everybody out of the war in Iraq and try to stop global warming," said third-grader Cerena Cass.LiNeBrEaKCerena thought helping people hold onto their homes and have money for food was important, too. Perhaps lowering taxes would help them, she said.LiNeBrEaKBut the war is No. 1 on Cerena's priorities. That's because she had an uncle who served in Iraq.LiNeBrEaKHer uncle came home safe, but it would be hard for families to cope if their loved ones died in the war, she said.

Khaleej Times (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Rise in Desert Visitors Prompts Sharjah Awareness Drive  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	950 words  	Jan. 20--SHARJAH -- The Environment and Protected Areas Authority (EPAA) in Sharjah will soon launch an environmentally-friendly camping initiative to raise awareness of the activity among outdoor enthusiasts, according to a top official.LiNeBrEaK"Every municipal council in the emirate is supposed to conduct its own environmental camp this year to enlighten camping enthusiasts about the rules and regulations to follow when camping. The activities to be run during these camps would include an exhibition on wildlife, an environmental play, along with traditional songs, games, meals and competitions," said EPAA Director Hana Al Suwidi. LiNeBrEaKVisits will be paid to bedouin localities, where brochures, plastic bags and waste bins would be distributed.LiNeBrEaKElaborating, Al Suwidi said camping enthusiasts would be told how to get permits from the bodies concerned prior to camping, and how to avoid fires, and collect and dump wastes at designated areas.LiNeBrEaKExcerpts of the interview:LiNeBrEaKGreen buildings regulations have been introduced both Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. Does the authority have any plans in this regard?LiNeBrEaKThe EPAA is more interested in sustainable development that goes in harmony with environment. The latest massive development projects have had very destructive impact on the wildlife.LiNeBrEaKOil tankers have terribly damaged the environment. The sewage waters are also said to have resulted in the red tide phenomenon. Global warming poses a risk to all creatures as well.LiNeBrEaKTherefore, samples of all the emirate's environments are declared as protected areas. There is a continuous coordination with all the bodies concerned, particularly the Environmental Section at the Sharjah Municipality.LiNeBrEaKThe Sharjah Desert Park (SDP) under the EPAA has seen a noticeable increase in visitors. What are the reasons?LiNeBrEaKThe four centres under the Park, including the Arabian Wildlife Centre, Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife, Children's Farm, Natural History Museum and Plant Life Centre are attracting thousands of visitors every year.LiNeBrEaK"As many as 300,000 visitors visited the SDP's four centres in 2008 as compared to 155,000 in 2007. Besides UAE nationals, who visit the Park throughout the year, Asian guests, including Indians, Japanese and Chinese are among the bulk of visitors. Delegations from European countries, including Russia, Spain and Germany,  followed by Arabs, visit the Park, especially in the winter season -- December 15 to January 15.LiNeBrEaKThe recent renovations, activities and programmes were attracting more visitors to the centres. Further facilities, including a cafeteria and mosque, were built.LiNeBrEaKThe EPAA, in association the Sharjah Commerce and Tourism Development Authority, has entered in several agreements with international travel agencies. Various awareness campaigns have been launched on the Authority website, as well as Sharjah TV Channel.LiNeBrEaKThe tickets are affordable.LiNeBrEaKVisitors pay only Dh15 to visit all the centres in the Park.LiNeBrEaKSchool children are charged Dh2 each, and people with special needs and members of the Holy Quran memorisation centres are exempted from entrance fees.SDP provides 12 well-trained tour guides who speak Arabic, English, Urdu, French and other languages fluently.LiNeBrEaKWe would like to have a better idea on the centres under the Park?LiNeBrEaKThe EPAA provides a significant opportunity for researchers to study the natural environment systems in their original condition as well as offering a chance for gaining environmental awareness and education by facilitating easy access to protected areas for students, interested individuals and even picnickers to enjoy kind of environmental tourism.LiNeBrEaKProtected AreasLiNeBrEaKEPAA had also emphasised on researching a network of protected areas representing a variety of habitats in the emirate, such as desert, sand dunes, hills and valleys, coastal and marine areas. Certain sites characterised by their environmental and biological diversity, have been designated to form the core of protected areas programme in Sharjah. These areas include Sir-bin-Ni'eer marine protected area, Khor Kalba seashore protected areas for mangroves and their habitat, and Al Zulaiyma enclave protected area for Sand Dunes system.LiNeBrEaKArabia's Wildlife Centre (AWC):LiNeBrEaKThe centre, which is considered a unique scientific and educational landmark, was inaugurated in 1999 to offer the chance of learning about the animals that exist in the Arabian Peninsula.LiNeBrEaKIt also facilitates the researchers to observe animals, which might not be seen in the wild at all.LiNeBrEaKSharjah Natural History Museum (SBHM):LiNeBrEaKThe Sharjah Natural History Museum opened in 1995 and is considered a distinguished landmark providing the opportunity to the public to learn about natural life in the Arabian Peninsula in its various forms -- marine, land and flora -- different geological periods as well as its entire natural history.LiNeBrEaKBreeding Centre for Endangered Wildlife (BCEAW)LiNeBrEaKEstablished in 1996, the breeding centre aims at preserving wildlife in Arabia. It has taken giant steps that transformed its size, goals and nature of its human resources since its inception.LiNeBrEaKThe centre intends to design conservation strategies for wild animals, especially in the Northern Emirates. It also carries out research work on animals in captivity and the wild.LiNeBrEaKahmedshaaban@khaleejtimes.com		ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); DESTINATIONS and ATTRACTIONS (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (78%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (78%); GREEN BUILDING (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); INTERVIEWS (77%); MUSEUMS and GALLERIES (75%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (73%); TOURISM DEVELOPMENT (72%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (72%); HISTORY (70%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (67%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (67%); SEAWEED and ALGAE (65%); GLOBAL WARMING (65%); TRAVEL AGENTS (50%); TOURISM (50%)  				ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (79%) DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (92%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (97%); EUROPE (79%); GERMANY (78%)  	January 20, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009    	Ahmed Shaaban, Khaleej Times, Dubai, United Arab Emirates  			Education  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090120-KJ-Rise-in-Desert-Visitors-Prompts-Sharjah-Awareness-Drive-0120  	KJ

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   Final Edition	YOUR OPINIONS  	A News; Pg. 12  	875 words  	INAUGURATIONLiNeBrEaKA great presidentLiNeBrEaK They called it the Great War. That is, until there was another one. Then it was World War I.LiNeBrEaK They called it the Great Depression. Will it become Depression I? I hope not.LiNeBrEaK The entire system of numbering history practically sets up the future for sequels. Why not just call it War: To Be Continued?LiNeBrEaK The word "great" has taken a lot of flak in history books. Taken out of context, it is synonymous with inspiring and extraordinary. Neither of those comes to mind when war or economic disaster are pending. LiNeBrEaK Why not save the word "great" by using it for inspirational titles? Great Britain and Great Plains are much more inspiring uses of the word "great," but there will not likely be a Britain II or a Plains II.LiNeBrEaK I'm just glad that today, we are historically inaugurating a Great African-American President, and I hope there will be many more to come.LiNeBrEaK John BoeroLiNeBrEaK ThiensvilleLiNeBrEaKObama needs the prayers of citizensLiNeBrEaK As the immediate past chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, I was disappointed that Republican nominee John McCain lost his bid for the presidency of the United States. I voted against Barack Obama because I believe he is wrong on numerous issues. I am concerned that many of his policies will hurt business, and I am leery of his potential judicial appointments.LiNeBrEaK He will be our president, and he needs our prayers. I will pray for him to receive strength, courage and wisdom. I also will pray for his safety and for those around him.LiNeBrEaK I may disagree with him on his policies, but I will be praying for Obama over the next four years. I encourage everyone else to pray for the president, too.LiNeBrEaK Brad CourtneyLiNeBrEaK Whitefish BayLiNeBrEaKNow's the time for environmental actionLiNeBrEaK With the inauguration of President Barack Obama, now is the time to act on our car mania's environmental effects. As someone with no driver's license, dependent on public transportation, I have seen over the past 70 years the manipulation by both oil and automobile companies. Despite oil being non-renewable, the Big Three U.S. automakers have continued to promote in ads big gas guzzlers.LiNeBrEaK Al Gore pointed out in "An Inconvenient Truth" that the Big Three have continued to sue states such as California over higher energy standards instead of putting money into researching and developing hybrids and other environmentally friendly cars, contributing to their poor financial health in the current economic downturn. "The 11th Hour" notes the same poky behavior by corporate executives in the oil business toward research and development in renewable resources.LiNeBrEaK Obama can jump-start a clean energy economy and start reducing global warming pollution by immediately directing the Environmental Protection Agency to grant the waiver that will allow California and other states to limit global warming pollution from cars.LiNeBrEaK Stop subsidies to oil companies and invest instead to move public transportation from the margins to the mainstream.LiNeBrEaK Miu TorkeLiNeBrEaK GreendaleLiNeBrEaKHope for a new eraLiNeBrEaK Behold, we have been "Obama-tized!" Has Karl Rove's marriage of the Christian right to George Bush and the Republican Party given birth to an abomination? No! It has given birth to an "ObamaNation"! America will now move on to better times.LiNeBrEaK My expectations are that the successors of the "ObamaNation" will be as happy and hopeful as we are today. Also that our world, our nation and our children will be healthier and better educated and feel as we do today.LiNeBrEaK Eugene FowlerLiNeBrEaK MilwaukeeLiNeBrEaKTone down the hypeLiNeBrEaK Enough, already! We have been "treated" to nonstop coverage of the event that hasn't happened yet: the Obama inauguration.LiNeBrEaK Printed news, Internet news, television news and radio news have been relentless in the search to find another angle to this "story." The crowning touch to this coverage was during the Steelers-Ravens football game on Sunday. The half time report from Katie Couric was a fawning preview of today's inauguration. A good portion of the bill for this occasion (services, security, etc.) will be left to the taxpayers to pay.LiNeBrEaK Wouldn't it be better to wait until President Barack Obama actually does something?LiNeBrEaK David V. SzymczakLiNeBrEaK MilwaukeeLiNeBrEaKChange has been a long time comingLiNeBrEaK The Jan. 14 article "Hoover museum tells a cautionary tale," with its statement on how Barack Obama could take some cues from the Hoover Museum exhibit, made me think of a specific story in the exhibit. When first lady Lou Henry Hoover invited the wife of Illinois congressman Oscar DePriest to the White House, it was the first time an African-American woman had entered through the front door. Hoover was harshly criticized for this action.LiNeBrEaK Letters in response to this incident in the exhibit show the fascinating range of responses, and values, of Americans of the time. Whether Mr. Obama knows this story I don't know, but it shows how far we have come as an electorate and as Americans. My colleagues and I learned this and much more as our firm, Teller Madsen Inc., designed the exhibits in 1992. The project remains one of my favorite work and learning experiences.LiNeBrEaK Frank MadsenLiNeBrEaK Delavan		GREAT DEPRESSION (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); WORLD WAR I (90%); ECONOMIC DEPRESSION (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (88%); AUTOMAKERS (85%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (85%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (84%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (79%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (78%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); HISTORY (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (75%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (68%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (67%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (67%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (67%); AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (67%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (67%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (67%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (67%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (65%); RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT (65%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (62%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (62%); PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (61%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%)  			BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN MCCAIN (55%); AL GORE (52%)  	MILWAUKEE, WI, USA (79%) WISCONSIN, USA (93%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (93%); UNITED KINGDOM (71%)  	January 20, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Journal Sentinel Inc.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   01 EDITION	Gore hosts environmental ball  	A; Pg. 08  	220 words  	THE INAUGURATION OF BARACK OBAMALiNeBrEaKGore hosts environmental ballLiNeBrEaKAssociated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Green is suddenly glamorous again.LiNeBrEaKAfter chafing under eight years of President George W. Bush's environmental policies, advocates supporting renewable energy and conservation gathered Monday night at a glitzy ball to celebrate the greening of the White House. LiNeBrEaK"The new president totally gets it on these issues," said Gene Karpinksy, executive director of the League of Conservation Voters. "This is by far the best reason to celebrate that the environmental movement has had."LiNeBrEaKThe event, hosted by former Vice President and Nobel-laureate Al Gore, drew celebrities such as Will.i.am, Blair Underwood and Melissa Etheridge, many of whom made their entrance on a moss green carpet made partly of recycled fiber.LiNeBrEaKAlso in attendance were Obama's choices to head the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Inaugural Ball was one of four environmentally themed inaugural events. But it strived to be the greenest. The food was local or organic and cooked in a kitchen nearby to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The scraps will be composted. And the ball's contribution to global warming - known as a carbon footprint - will be canceled out by investment in renewable energy projects.

The New York Times 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	More-Reflective Crops May Have Cooling Effect  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; OBSERVATORY; Pg. 3  	337 words  	Some of the most imaginative solutions to the problem of global climate change involve planetary-scale geoengineering projects to reduce the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. But proposals like building a huge sunshade in space or seeding the atmosphere with sulfate particles would cost enormous sums and require a degree of international cooperation that is difficult to achieve. LiNeBrEaK  Andy Ridgwell and colleagues at the University of Bristol in England have another idea, one they call bio-geoengineering. Rather than developing infrastructure to help cool the planet, they propose using an existing one: agriculture. LiNeBrEaK  Their calculations, published in Current Biology, suggest that by planting crop varieties that reflect more sunlight, summertime cooling of about 2 degrees Fahrenheit could be obtained across central North America and a wide band of Europe and Asia.LiNeBrEaK  ''Arable agriculture is already a global-scale undertaking,'' Dr. Ridgwell said. ''We wondered whether you might grow slightly different crops and have some sort of climate impact.''LiNeBrEaK  Plants reflect slightly different amounts of light depending on factors like how waxy  the leaves are. Even differences in growth patterns between two varieties of a crop -- the way leaves are arranged -- can affect reflectivity.LiNeBrEaK  Existing varieties could be used, Dr. Ridgwell said, or crops could be bred or genetically engineered for greater reflectivity (without affecting yields, nutritional values or other important characteristics). But shifts to different crops -- from wheat to corn, for instance -- would be too disruptive, he said.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Ridgwell acknowledged that the idea would not be a complete solution to the climate change problem. For one thing, the Southern Hemisphere would be less affected, in part because there is much less agricultural land. LiNeBrEaK  But it wouldn't cost much, and it wouldn't require much international cooperation. ''It's very practical, and it could just be done,'' he said. ''It's not some trillion-dollar pie-in-the-sky idea.''	http://www.nytimes.com  	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (52%); GENETIC ENGINEERING (50%)  				EARTH (92%) NORTH AMERICA (79%); ENGLAND (72%); UNITED KINGDOM (72%); ASIA (55%); EUROPE (55%)  	January 20, 2009  	ENGLISH  	DRAWING (DRAWING BY CHRIS GASH)     		Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By HENRY FOUNTAIN  															
The Oakland Tribune (California)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Cal professor sends Obama a reading assignment  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	506 words  	Jan. 20--Barack Obama certainly has a lot of goals to conquer as he becomes the 44th president of the United States, but understanding radioactive decay and uranium bombs might not be on his short list of things to do. LiNeBrEaKBut Richard Muller, a UC Berkeley professor of physics and past winner of the MacArthur Fellowship, commonly called the "genius award," hopes Obama, 47, will take time out to read his book "Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines."LiNeBrEaKHe said he has sent several copies to Obama's advisers and even managed to get a book to Michelle Obama through a personal friend of his.LiNeBrEaKThe 346-page hardback, released last year, covers everything from the difference between a uranium bomb, a plutonium bomb and a hydrogen bomb to solar power to space and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"What I've done is taken physics and eliminated everything that isn't urgently important," he said from his Berkeley home.LiNeBrEaKMuller's book is not political, and he openly admits he sent a copy to people who work with former Republican presidential nominee John McCain before Obama won the election.LiNeBrEaK"Physics is nonpartisan, and I think that it's really important to realize that physics is nonpolitical," said the 65-year-old South Bronx native who came to Berkeley in 1964.LiNeBrEaKMuller said there are topics in his book that will enable the president to act quickly and wisely in the event of a terrorist attack or a nuclear bombing. Muller explainsLiNeBrEaKin his book that the country likely will be highly dependent on fossil fuels for many generations and that there are no easy answers to global warming.LiNeBrEaKMuller said his book can lead the president through a wealth of conflicting information about a bevy of subjects, which if not understood could lead to "solutions" that will actually make things worse.LiNeBrEaK"The president can't just be told that a nuke in the hands of North Korea is a big danger," he said. "The president must understand what a big danger it is."LiNeBrEaKMuller said there are many valuable lessons for Obama -- or any leader -- in his book.LiNeBrEaK"We live in a high-tech world, and many of the decisions we face on an individual level and on the presidential level have high-tech components. If you are talking about alternative energy, you need to understand coal, clean coal, nukes, solar and geothermal energy.LiNeBrEaK"If you are going to be the leader of the country, you can't depend on simply picking science advisers to tell you what to do. Decisions (about alternative energy) can't be based on science alone. They have to be based on science, economics and business and even on issues regarding diplomacy," said Muller.

The Porterville Recorder (California)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Transfer of power  	COMMENTARY  	613 words  	Jan. 20--The rituals have become so commonplace that we sometimes forget just how significant an accomplishment this country has managed. Power will be passed peacefully not just from one elected leader to another but to a leader from a different party, with a different governing philosophy. A man who won election in part by systematically disparaging the record and perhaps even the character of the man he will replace will be -- has been -- treated graciously and with full cooperation by the outgoing president and his minions.LiNeBrEaKIt doesn't happen that way in every country; some countries seem to need bloodshed and armed combatants to change political governance. When a change from one party to the other first occurred in this country, it wasn't a certainty by any means that the transition would be entirely peaceful. John Adams refused to attend the inauguration of the man who replaced him, Thomas Jefferson. The campaign had been bitter and personal in ways that would shock some moderns. LiNeBrEaKAs President-elect Obama put it in a newspaper interview last week, "Elections aren't democracy, as we understand it. They are one facet of a liberal order." A democratic order requires not just a mechanical process for counting votes, but a willingness on the part of the losing party to abide by the results, and a concomitant willingness on the part of the winner not to persecute a minority or undermine individual rights. It is a delicate balance, and today we celebrate an America that through numerous tests and trials has maintained that balance.LiNeBrEaKPresident Barack Obama no doubt anticipated having to handle two unresolved wars, but until quite recently he didn't expect to have to deal with an economic and financial crisis. He has for the most part moved deftly to put people in place who command respect, although he may soon learn that government cannot command recovery.LiNeBrEaKAmid the pomp and pageantry today, it is worth remembering that life in America is richer and more complex than the political side of life can begin to reflect. Some now-obscure scientist toiling patiently on approaches to cancer, some techie seeking new uses for microchips, a climatologist getting to the root of climate change rather than reflecting a mock consensus, a novelist who finally captures the American scene, a composer working on a symphony or a songwriter crafting the perfect song may change America more than all the dignitaries assembled today in Washington, D.C. Far greater things are almost always afoot than are dreamt of in our capitals.LiNeBrEaKSo politics is hardly everything in life. But a political order that can accommodate changes that seem wrenching at the time, a country that began with black people in chains that can elect an African-American to the highest office in the land, are worth celebrating.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Obama has stressed personal responsibility and accountability during the transition. The time will come, and sooner than he would probably prefer, to hold him accountable for mistakes and misjudgments in office. For today, however, let us celebrate the fact that an awesome amount of power -- perhaps too much power -- can be passed from one person to another amid revelry rather than recrimination and even bloodshed.

The Record-Eagle (Traverse City, Michigan)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Geography education takes students over the planet and maybe to D.C.: What's required  	LIFESTYLE  	1019 words  	Jan. 20--TRAVERSE CITY -- Noah Aulicino, 11, wrote his answer, then held his breath.LiNeBrEaK"The Gulf of Guinea is off the west coast of what continent?"LiNeBrEaKThe Central Grade School student answered "Africa" and, whew, he was right.LiNeBrEaKNoah and nine other fifth-graders had made it to the finals of Central's Geography Bee, a competition that's part of the National Geographic Bee. As a school winner, Noah "gets the honor of taking a test," said his teacher, Jaye Lynn Trapp. If he places in the top 100 in the state, he'll go to the state bee April 3 at Central Michigan University. LiNeBrEaKThe 50 state winners compete in Washington, D.C., May 19-20. Students in grades 4 through 8 are eligible.LiNeBrEaKLearning geography is more than maps and colored pencils, although her students do like those, said Nancy Fitzpatrick, a teacher at East Middle School in Traverse City.LiNeBrEaK"I try to help them become aware of people outside their world," she said. "At this age, they're thinking about themselves, their family, maybe Traverse City. My goal is to get them to realize we're all connected."LiNeBrEaKHer Eastern Hemisphere Studies students just finished projects about countries in Africa.LiNeBrEaK"They made presentations and a lot of them said things like, 'Maybe you complain when you don't get that new bicycle, but can you imagine not knowing what a bicycle is?' They're becoming more aware and they have more empathy," Fitzpatrick said.LiNeBrEaKShe said wishes they posted on a bulletin board after Christmas included finding a cure for AIDS and ending the civil wars in Congo.LiNeBrEaKDessie Hughes, a geography and history teacher at West Middle School, said geography is "the most important subject, given the flat world we live in."LiNeBrEaKShe said geography is engaging because it's always current. "When teaching about Antarctica, we discuss the international issue on global warming. Students may simulate studying elements on Antarctica like our scientists, then make decisions based on their findings."LiNeBrEaKBee winner Noah said it's important because it helps him learn about history, but also because geography will tell "scientists and travelers cool places to go."LiNeBrEaKBoys disproportionately outnumber girls in geography bees, Trapp said, but she's not exactly sure why.LiNeBrEaK"There aren't any conclusive studies," she said, "but there is a lot of spatial thinking in geography and there are studies that say boys are better at that."LiNeBrEaKJessica Budz, 11, another Central Grade School finalist, studied by reading "a lot of atlases, taking tests online and using the National Geographic study guide," she said.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of reading 'Harry Potter,' I'd read the atlas," Jessica said. She likes to learn what happens in other places and "how it became that way."LiNeBrEaKGary Howe, an adjunct professor of geography at Northwestern Michigan College, said the State Department is always in need of geographers.LiNeBrEaK"Some say, with our less-than-robust success in Afghanistan, that it's because we don't know enough about how the place works," Howe said. "Geography is all-encompassing. When we study a region, we look at the major things that define it -- like language and the major issues that the people face and the major issues that the environment faces.LiNeBrEaK"When we study Saudi Arabia, for instance, we talk a lot about water," Howe said. "Where do the people live? They're clustered around water. What are they doing about their water shortage? Are they using their oil money wisely and building desalination plants?LiNeBrEaK"In geography, the answers are always going to change," he said. "We need to be able to formulate good questions."LiNeBrEaKFifth-grade teacher Trapp is a member of the Michigan Geographic Alliance, a network of teachers and geographers, and has developed a course of study for teachers about American Indians and their first encounters with Europeans. The students use maps to trace settlement routes and compare patterns from 1491 to 1650. Technology, geography and history are incorporated, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Geography is a great way to incorporate technology, math, science and the arts," she said. "When you're studying maps, you're reading. When you're studying relationships and patterns, you're doing math. We use charts, graphs and tables all the time."LiNeBrEaKTrapp said one of the most interesting themes for fifth-graders in her gifted services classes is when they talk about regions.LiNeBrEaK"It leads to talking about languages, recipes and customs. It's just fascinating," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe Michigan Department of Education outlines expectations for K-8 geography. Among them are:LiNeBrEaK-- Places and Regions (physical and human characteristics);LiNeBrEaK-- The World in Spacial (spacial thinking, geographic understanding)LiNeBrEaK-- Physical Systems (ecosystems, physical processes)LiNeBrEaK-- Human Systems (cultures, patterns of human settlement, conflict)LiNeBrEaK-- Environment and Society (global issues past and present, humans and the environment)LiNeBrEaKAre you smarter than a fifth-grader?LiNeBrEaKHere are some sample questions from the National Geographic Bee.LiNeBrEaK1. Which state has a climate suitable for growing citrus fruits -- California or Maine?LiNeBrEaK2. Which country has the world's largest Muslim population -- Indonesia or Mexico?LiNeBrEaK3. The North Atlantic current brings warm waters from the tropics to the west coast of which continent?LiNeBrEaK4. What is the term for a part of an ocean or sea that cuts far into the bordering landmass and may contain one or more bays?LiNeBrEaK5. The port of Rotterdam is built on the delta of which major European river?LiNeBrEaK6. Which Canadian province produces more than half of the country's manufactured goods?LiNeBrEaK7. To visit the ruins of Persepolis, an ancient ceremonial capital of Persia, you would have to travel to what present-day country?LiNeBrEaKAnswers: 1. California 2. Indonesia 3. Europe 4. Gulf 5.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Time for new rules on suction mining  	COMMENTARY  	538 words  	Jan. 20--It's not news that salmon populations have declined drastically. Last year, regulators voted to ban all salmon fishing along the Pacific coast of California and Oregon. Their actions wiped out the livelihoods of thousands of commercial fishermen, fish processors and charter boat operators. LiNeBrEaKThe threat facing salmon is so dire that regulators are expected to continue the 2008 salmon fishing ban through 2009.LiNeBrEaKSo it seems incredible that in the creeks and tributaries of the state's major rivers where salmon lay their eggs, suction gold mine dredging continues under regulations that are now 15 years old. These rules are badly out of date and inadequate to protect dwindling number of fish.LiNeBrEaKRecreational miners use giant dredges to vacuum the creeks and river beds, sucking up tons of sand and rocks in search of tiny flecks of gold. In the process, state fish and game experts say, they destroy precious salmon spawning grounds and kill salmon eggs, young salmon, trout and sturgeon.LiNeBrEaKThe California Department of Fish and Game has the power to stop the damaging practice. It should do so immediately.LiNeBrEaKThe Karuk Indian Tribe and a handful of conservation groups, including California Trout and the Sierra Fund, have petitioned DFG to issue emergency regulations to limit when and where dredging can be done on the Klamath River, its tributaries and five other streams in the Sierra including the north fork of the American River near Auburn.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, the Karuks sued Fish and Game to force the department to overhaul its suction dredging rules. Pushed by suction dredge miners, the courts ordered the department to complete a California Environmental Quality Act review before it acted. That review was supposed to take 18 months and be completed by July 2008.LiNeBrEaKThe department has already missed its deadline by 6 months and the review hasn't even begun. Meanwhile, harmful dredging continues.LiNeBrEaKAs the petition seeking the emergency actions makes clear, the fish are in peril. A 2008 federal report documented a 73 percent decline in coho salmon returning to spawning grounds in California between 2004 and 2007. Another study concluded the coho "was in danger of extinction."LiNeBrEaKSuction dredge gold miners claim that their activities improve the spawning grounds, especially on streams where dams have impeded the flow of water allowing silt to build up. They say global warming, not suction mining, has harmed the fishery. But fish experts both inside and outside the department disagree.LiNeBrEaKAt a minimum it will take the department two more years of study before the CEQA review is completed and rules can be updated to protect fish. That is two more years of status quo dredging while endangered salmon populations continue to dwindle.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Fish and Game should act before that trend becomes irreversible.

LiNeBrEaKLast spring, Weber County made $102,000 selling carbon credits it was awarded by the Chicago Climate Exchange for reducing greenhouse gases in 2005, 2006 and 2007, said Gary Laird, the county's solid-waste manager.LiNeBrEaKLaird sold at the top of the market, when carbon credits were worth $6. 30 to $7 each. Friday on the Chicago Climate Exchange, the credits were down to $1. 95 each.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated sold about $14,000 worth at a lower $2 market rate, but is holding onto more than 88,000 credits, figuring the price will rise with demand when the government gets around to regulating greenhouse gas emissions, said Wasatch's Executive Director Nathan Rich.LiNeBrEaK"It's sure worked out neat so far," he said.LiNeBrEaKChicago Climate Exchange is one of dozens of markets that have cropped up worldwide in recent years as pressure has mounted on countries and companies to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated, which burns and puts into landfills almost all the waste in Davis County and all ofLiNeBrEaKMorgan County's, joined in January 2007; Weber County joined that spring.LiNeBrEaKEach had begun capturing methane natural gas generated in capped trash heaps a few years earlier, mainly to keep it from migrating and, later, exploding.LiNeBrEaKThe gas is piped to nearby power generating stations. Weber County owns its station and sells electricity to Rocky Mountain Power -- a source that gave the county a tidy $240,000 last year. Wasatch Integrated's methane goes to a plant over the fence at Hill Air Force Base. Sales last year amounted to $40,000 for Wasatch.LiNeBrEaKWhile energy and environmental activists applaud such efforts, some are not so enthusiastic about the markets, like Chicago Climate Exchange, that let those curbing emissions trade on their own good deeds.LiNeBrEaKOne, Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of the book Hell and High Water: Global Warming -- the Solution and the Politics -- and What We Should Do, calls them carbon "rip-offsets."LiNeBrEaKHe doesn't like that the Chicago Climate Exchange rewards companies or governmental agencies for past greenhouse-gas reductions.LiNeBrEaK"If I'm going to put up money, I want my money to go to a project that wouldn't otherwise happen," Romm said.LiNeBrEaKHe also believes there isn't enough scrutiny of the projects that earn the credits, and likens the market to the mortgage-backed securities market now in shambles.LiNeBrEaK"The offset business is unregulated and voluntary, and it doesn't take a genius to see unregulated markets tend to attract a lot of dubious players," said Romm, who is also editor of the Web site www.climateprogress.org.LiNeBrEaKRich disagreed.LiNeBrEaK"I've been through the verification process, and it's crazy, very detailed," he said. "If you're buying these credits, they're real."LiNeBrEaKThe Chicago Climate Exchange uses independent engineers to verify emission reductions and Wasatch, which is a full member of the exchange, also is scrutinized by auditors who verify that it is reducing emissions at its burn plant, as promised when it became a full exchange member.LiNeBrEaKWasatch agreed to reduce burn plant emissions by 6 percent by 2010.LiNeBrEaKRich also defended the market's practice of rewarding credits for past good work.LiNeBrEaK"What's wrong with rewarding people for good behavior?" he said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Wasatch didn't expect to make a bundle of money, selling carbon offset credits can help new green projects pencil out, he said.LiNeBrEaKLaird said the sale of carbon credits was part of Weber County's calculation all along.LiNeBrEaK"This was what made our project feasible," he said.LiNeBrEaKkmoulton@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKWhat's a carbon credit?LiNeBrEaKIt's a marketable security, traded like a corporate stock or futures contract. New markets, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, have emerged to award companies or government agencies "credits" for projects that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. They sell the credits, via the exchange, to individuals or companies that want to offset their own carbon emissions -- or to appear more "green." The value of each credit fluctuates, as in any market.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Riverton fifth-graders see reasons for hope (with multimedia)  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	355 words  	Jan. 20--RIVERTON -- Schools across the country mounted ambitious efforts to let students witness and reflect on the inauguration. Riverton Elementary staged a mass inaugural viewing in its cafeteria for the younger kids. The older grades were encouraged to view it inside their classrooms and then write about it. LiNeBrEaKLennan Jensen asked her class of gifted fifth-graders to consider what this singular event means for the nation's future.LiNeBrEaK"One day they will look back and tell their grandchildren about this day," Jensen said. "They'll say I was in the fifth grade, and I saw the inauguration of America's black president."LiNeBrEaKJensen, 58, grew up in Texas at time when schools were segregated.LiNeBrEaKBut she said, for her students, the idea of racial equality is a foregone conclusion.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	Citywide push nudges residents to cut the carbon;  BERKELEY;  Support groups will try to reduce greenhouse gases	Metro; Pg. B1  	601 words  	Some cities urge residents to go on citywide exercise kicks. Others promote municipal book clubs. Berkeley wants its citizens to go on a collective low-carbon diet.LiNeBrEaKTo meet its ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Berkeley is encouraging all 100,000 residents to join support groups to help individuals fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKLike Alcoholics Anonymous and Weight Watchers, the groups are part social, part confessional and partly about accountability. LiNeBrEaK"It does sound like AA," said Timothy Burroughs, Berkeley's climate action coordinator, who is helping to start the program. "But it's in the context of a policy goal of the city's. In order for us to achieve our goal, individuals have to change their behavior. This is a way for them to do that."LiNeBrEaKThe city kicks off the program with a workshop Jan. 28. Residents will learn simple things they can do at home, work and school to reduce emissions, and be encouraged to start groups with neighbors, friends and co-workers.LiNeBrEaKThe idea originated with a 2006 book by Portland, Ore., writer David Gershon, "Low Carbon Diet: a 30 Day Program to Lose 5,000 Pounds." Berkeley bought 50 of the books, at $10 each, for the first residents who enroll.LiNeBrEaKThe program encourages participants to meet four times over a month to calculate their carbon footprints, create individual goals and help each other meet those goals. The goals can range from giving up driving to insulating one's hot water heater to eating more vegetarian meals.LiNeBrEaKSome residents have already started low-carbon groups. Linda Currie, a graphic artist and mother of two, joined a group in 2007 and was so moved by the experience she's helped start 10 more.LiNeBrEaK"I was searching for a way I could make a difference without being a policymaker or a scientist," she said. "I wanted something that would help an average citizen do something about climate change."LiNeBrEaKBy giving up a car, adjusting the refrigerator and hot water temperatures, bringing their own bags to the grocery store and making other changes, Currie's family was able to reduce its carbon output from 55,000 pounds a year, which is about average for an American family of four, to about 27,000 pounds a year.LiNeBrEaKThe program allows much leeway with the details. Some groups meet for wine and cheese or a potluck, some meet during an office lunch break, others meet after church services.LiNeBrEaKParticipants share tips, such as where to find dimmable fluorescent lightbulbs on sale, and encourage each other to persevere.LiNeBrEaKThe Ecology Center in Berkeley has been hosting groups for a year or so for residents throughout the Bay Area.LiNeBrEaK"The beauty of this program is that it addresses climate change but also builds community networks. And it's fun," said Debra Berliner, the Ecology Center's climate action coordinator. "There are so many temptations and obstacles, it really helps to have a team of cheerleaders behind you."LiNeBrEaKIn 2006 Berkeley voters approved Measure G, which sets the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions citywide 80 percent by 2050. The City Council is scheduled this spring to approve its climate action plan, which details ways the city can meet that goal.LiNeBrEaK"We're not saying individuals are the biggest part of the problem. Obviously, industry has to change," Burroughs said. "But this is a good way for individuals to get involved and make a difference."LiNeBrEaKLearn more LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKFor more information, go to www.ecologycenter.org, links.sfgate.com/ZFWZ or call 510 548-2220.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	PITCH PERFECT;  EDITORIAL: Obama's inaugural address sets the right tone, blends inspiration and humility and summons Americans to meet the challenges of the times 	Op-Ed; Pg. G2  	561 words  	The 44th president of the United States honored our history as he made history today.LiNeBrEaKIt was just the right tone for these perilous times.LiNeBrEaKPresident Obama reminded America that change - and great challenges - have defined this nation. The inauguration of the first African American president celebrated the cherished but sometimes elusive American ideal that "all men are created equal." His references to his place in history were spare, understated and poignant.LiNeBrEaK"This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed - why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath," he said. LiNeBrEaKObama is not the first president to suggest "our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness." But no inauguration has drawn an audience as large and as diverse, or a president who, at long last, embodied the realization of the inclusive meritocracy he espoused. LiNeBrEaK"We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace," he said.LiNeBrEaKWithin the soaring themes of unity was a promising blueprint for some of the ways his administration will change direction from Bush policies. He suggested that the power of free markets to "generate wealth and expand freedom" must be tempered with the "watchful eye" of government. Obama, a constitutional lawyer, said he rejected "as false the choice between our safety and our ideals" - an apparent reference to the use of torture and peeling back of civil liberties during the Bush era. He spoke of leaving Iraq "to its people" and taking on the challenge of global warming. He promised an ambitious effort to revitalize the economy.LiNeBrEaK"Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions - who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans," he said. "Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage."LiNeBrEaKThere were many memorable lines in the speech, none more than its soaring conclusion: "Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations."LiNeBrEaKThere is something inspiring about any presidential inauguration - the peaceful transfer of power that defines and affirms the strength of our democracy. Few presidents in modern history will encounter the magnitude of problems, domestic and international, that confront President Obama. On this historic day, his speech was sober about the challenges and powerful in its resolve to meet them. He will need every ounce of the remarkable goodwill that was on display today.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Gore, enviros celebrate changing of the guard  	FEATURES  	321 words  	WASHINGTON &raquo; Green is suddenly glamorous again.LiNeBrEaKAfter chafing under eight years of President George W. Bush's environmental policies, advocates supporting renewable energy and conservation gathered Monday night at a glitzy ball to celebrate the greening of the White House. LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama, unlike his predecessor, supports stiff, mandatory reductions in the gases blamed for global warming and he wants to create millions of new "green" jobs.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups that have spent years playing defense against the Bush administration see an opportunity to push through their policies under Obama.LiNeBrEaK"The new president totally gets it on these issues," said Gene Karpinksi, president of the League of Conservation Voters. "This is by far the best reason to celebrate that the environmental movement has had."LiNeBrEaKThe event, hosted by former Vice President and Nobel-laureate Al Gore, drew celebrities such as Will.i.am, Blair Underwood and Melissa Etheridge, many of whom made their entrance on a moss green carpet made partly of recycled fiber.LiNeBrEaK"We need to change the way we use energy, the way we treat the Earth," Gore said.LiNeBrEaKAlso in attendance were Obama's choices to head the Environmental Protection Agency and the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"I think America voted for a big green step by voting for Obama," said John Legend, who was one of the scheduled performers.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Inaugural Ball was one of four environmentally-themed events scheduled for inauguration weekend. But it strived to be the greenest.LiNeBrEaKThe food was local or organic and cooked in a kitchen nearby to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The scraps will be composted. And the ball's contribution to global warming -- known as a carbon footprint -- will be canceled out by investment in renewable energy projects.LiNeBrEaKAbout 2,000 people attended the ball at Donald W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture in downtown Washington.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Sting brings music, eco-message to Sundance fest  	SUNDANCE; Features  	655 words  	PARK CITY &raquo; Sting drew cheers with an impromptu jam session at the Sundance Film Festival, but his real purpose was to bring attention to a film dealing with the singer's other passion: rainforest preservation.LiNeBrEaKJoe Berlinger's "Crude" traces 15 years of a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Ecuador residents who claim that oil producer Chevron Corp. is liable for contaminating water supplies around the headwaters of the Amazon River.LiNeBrEaKSting and wife Trudie Styler are founders of the Rainforest Foundation, and they became involved at Berlinger's behest. The film chronicles Styler's fact-finding trip to Ecuador and includes footage of Sting performing with the Police at last summer's Live Earth music marathon on behalf of global-warming issues. LiNeBrEaK"I have a walk-on in this film and nothing else. I'm here to support the missus," Sting said in an interview alongside Styler, Berlinger and plaintiffs' attorneys Pablo Fajardo and Steven Donziger.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's a great battle to fight," said Sting, whose Sundance visit included performing with the house band at a lodge sponsored by Gibson guitars.LiNeBrEaK"All the things we've been arguing against and about are involved in this film. The right to breathe clean air, to drink fresh water, to feed your children and have a healthy life. No one has the right to stand in the way of that."LiNeBrEaKBerlinger, whose documentaries include "Brother's Keeper," "Paradise Lost" and "Metallica: Some Kind of Monster," heads into the rainforests in "Crude" to record field arguments with the judge and legal teams involved in the lawsuit. He also interviews indigenous people who claim oil-tainted water has caused cancer, skin lesions and other ailments.LiNeBrEaK"I'm used to seeing great environmental and humanitarian tragedies and problems, and throwing Sting's light around that raises dollars to help relieve them. But I didn't bargain for the devastation I saw when I got there," Styler said. "Speaking with mothers who were nurturing their children with murky, brown, petrol-smelling, horrible water containing many, many contaminants. ... They are in dire need of help."LiNeBrEaKPlaintiffs' claim Texaco, which was bought by Chevron in 2001, left an environmental mess when it departed Ecuador in the early 1990s after decades of oil drilling.LiNeBrEaKChevron contends it was absolved of liability by a 1998 agreement between Ecuador and Texaco, which carried out a $40 million cleanup.LiNeBrEaKThe Rainforest Foundation is helping to bring in tanks to capture rain and provide clean drinking water as a stopgap measure, but the plaintiffs say Chevron needs to pay for long-term measures.LiNeBrEaK"We're all conscious of the fact that the world without petroleum would basically stop," said Fajardo, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, speaking in Spanish translated by Donziger, an American attorney consulting on the case.LiNeBrEaK"If these companies act to a greater responsibility, respecting life, I believe we could coexist with oil companies. The problem isn't petroleum in and of itself. It's how it's drilled in our case."LiNeBrEaK"Crude," one of 16 films in Sundance's U.S. documentary competition, presents a fairly balanced portrait of the case, with Chevron's side of the story well represented.LiNeBrEaKThe company's attorneys and chief environmental scientist argue that its former partner, Petroecuador, continued polluting the area after Texaco departed and that its own research did not support plaintiffs' claims that oil contamination presented health risks.LiNeBrEaKBerlinger said he set out to present all sides of the story, but he came away with a strong conviction himself.LiNeBrEaK"When we destroy the rainforest, we destroy our own livelihood. When we fill up our gas tanks in this country with relatively cheap gasoline compared to the rest of the world, it's at the expense of other people who have lived in harmony with nature," Berlinger said. "That was a life-changing epiphany for me. I had heard it as catch-phrases before, but I had never truly felt it."

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Cal professor sends Obama a reading assignment  	BREAKING; News  	432 words  	Barack Obama certainly has a lot of goals to conquer as he becomes the 44th president of the United States, but understanding radioactive decay and uranium bombs might not be on his short list of things to do. LiNeBrEaKBut Richard Muller, a UC Berkeley professor of physics and past winner of the MacArthur Fellowship, commonly called the "genius award," hopes Obama, 47, will take time out to read his book "Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines."LiNeBrEaKHe said he has sent several copies to Obama's advisers and even managed to get a book to Michelle Obama through a personal friend of his.LiNeBrEaKThe 346-page hardback, released last year, covers everything from the difference between a uranium bomb, a plutonium bomb and a hydrogen bomb to solar power to space and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"What I've done is taken physics and eliminated everything that isn't urgently important," he said from his Berkeley home.LiNeBrEaKMuller's book is not political, and he openly admits he sent a copy to people who work with former Republican presidential nominee John McCain before Obama won the election.LiNeBrEaK"Physics is nonpartisan, and I think that it's really important to realize that physics is nonpolitical," said the 65-year-old South Bronx native who came to Berkeley in 1964.LiNeBrEaKMuller said there are topics in his book that will enable the president to act quickly and wisely in the event of a terrorist attack or a nuclear bombing. Muller explains in his book that the country likely will be highly dependent on fossil fuels for many generations and that there are no easy answers to global warming.LiNeBrEaKMuller said his book can lead the president through a wealth of conflicting information about a bevy of subjects, which if not understood could lead to "solutions" that will actually make things worse.LiNeBrEaK"The president can't just be told that a nuke in the hands of North Korea is a big danger," he said. "The president must understand what a big danger it is."LiNeBrEaKMuller said there are many valuable lessons for Obama   or any leader   in his book.LiNeBrEaK"We live in a high-tech world, and many of the decisions we face on an individual level and on the presidential level have high-tech components. If you are talking about alternative energy, you need to understand coal, clean coal, nukes, solar and geothermal energy.LiNeBrEaK"If you are going to be the leader of the country, you can't depend on simply picking science advisers to tell you what to do.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	King nephew talks of work to be done  	NEWS; Pg. A5  	386 words  	ATLANTA - The inauguration of the nation's first black president is a huge step toward realizing Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of racial equality, but there is still work to be done, King's nephew told a large crowd Monday at the church where the civil rights leader once preached. LiNeBrEaKIsaac Newton Farris, president of the King Center, told the jubilant crowd on Martin Luther King Jr. Day that the election of Barack Obama was built on a foundation laid by King.LiNeBrEaK"There is definitely a spiritual connection between these two events," Farris told the mostly black congregation that erupted in applause at any mention of Obama's name.LiNeBrEaKThough Obama's election to the nation's highest office is a milestone, King's final achievement will not be complete until disparities in health care, education and economics are eliminated, he said.LiNeBrEaK"The dream was not about an individual or any race of people attaining power," Farris said. "It was a human dream."LiNeBrEaKThe sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church was packed with about 2,000 people, and dozens were left outside.LiNeBrEaKThe celebration also included a keynote address from Pastor Rick Warren, a Southern Baptist who is scheduled to give the invocation at Obama's inauguration on Tuesday. Warren urged the crowd to follow King's example of service and selflessness.LiNeBrEaK"Tomorrow when I pray the invocation for my friend, Dr. King and a whole host of witnesses will be shouting," Warren said. "Martin Luther King was a mighty tool in the hand of God. But God isn't through. Justice is a journey, and we're getting further and further along."LiNeBrEaKThe selection of Warren, who opposes same-sex marriage in his home state of California, was controversial for both events. At the Atlanta service, about 100 protesters gathered across the street, and there was an outburst from at least one critic before Warren addressed the audience.LiNeBrEaKFarris defended the King Center's choice of keynote speaker, saying that Warren's stances on issues like global warming, AIDS and poverty are in keeping with King's ideals.LiNeBrEaKKing preached at Ebenezer from 1960 until his death in 1968, and a service commemorating his birthday and life are held there annually. On election night, the mainly black audience there was moved to tears when news networks announced that Obama had won.LiNeBrEaKKing would have been 80 years old on Jan. 15.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Goodbye, George, I fear you were a total failure  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 015  	783 words  	As I was driving around the Capitol area with my brother Sunday evening observing the preparations for today's inaugural ceremony, I heard a radio announcer running through the usual list of suggestions. Arrive early, dress for the cold, etc.LiNeBrEaKAnd then he brought on another expert who warned Washingtonians to make sure and wear sunscreen. Sunscreen? Yes, this expert went on to warn of the possibility of getting a bad sunburn in mid-winter Washington. LiNeBrEaKMy brother didn't seem shocked by this. He has lived inside the Beltway for 30 years and is used to such unapologetic alarmism. But I found myself wondering just how it would be possible to get a sunburn at this latitude on a day in mid-January on which overcast skies were forecast. Somehow I suspect the emergency rooms will not be packed this evening with people who used SPF-15 sunscreen when they really needed SPF-45.LiNeBrEaKBut that's the Beltway mentality. Someone is always selling some imaginary fear, warning of some unmenacing menace. And that is where George W. Bush went so horribly wrong. Every president in the modern era has been surrounded by people who believe that the only thing we need to fear is fear itself - so let's drum up some fear. Fear more than money is the mother's milk of D.C. politics. The greater the fear, the more power the Washington crowd can concentrate inside the Beltway.LiNeBrEaKAnd much of this is our fault, by which I mean the fault of those of us in the media. The sycophantic Beltway pundits like William Kristol and Charles Krauthammer and the moronic radio talkers like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity insist that the media were biased against Bush. Nonsense. We gave him a free pass when it came to peddling panic. In fact, it was the New York Times itself, in the person of then-reporter Judy Miller, that handed Bush and Dick Cheney the paranoic conspiracy theory about a nonexistent Saddam-al Qaeda link that led to the biggest foreign-policy blunder in American history. That was well within the tradition of American journalism. It's been almost a century since Baltimore's H.L. Mencken wrote that the most prominent aspect of American journalism was "its constant effort to evade the discussion of fundamentals by translating all issues into a few elemental fears."LiNeBrEaKThe duty of a president is to keep a calm head amidst all this. Bush failed miserably. The man who went to Washington hoping to reduce the role of the federal government ended up expanding it immeasurably.LiNeBrEaKHis failure represents a victory for all of the people I saw yesterday lining the route for today's inaugural parade. They were handing out leaflets for every liberal cause imaginable, from national health care to ending global warming. The media are mainly covering the ethnic angle of the inauguration, the election of the first African-American president and all that, but the real celebration is the triumph of the Beltway bureaucracy. Thanks to Bush's bungling, the bureaucracy is stronger than ever. It is impossible to overestimate the damage he has done. He inherited a country in which the economy was strong and young people wanted to work in private industry. He's leaving us with a country in which the idea of public employment and public power is ascendant.LiNeBrEaKWorse, he and the aforementioned sycophant pundits argued for adoration of that public power. Well, adoration they shall have. As of this afternoon, a Democrat inherits all the vast powers of the so-called "unitary executive." If Barack Obama leads us into some form of socialism, he will only be carrying Bush's "compassionate conservatism" to its logical end.LiNeBrEaKAs for me, I will be glad to see this gang of rascals routed. They were awful human beings and they destroyed everything they hoped to stand for.LiNeBrEaKBut if the future is bleak, at least a proper perception of the political spectrum will be restored. I recall in the Clinton years being regularly denounced for my acerbic attitude toward the Beltway crowd. After a particularly harsh piece on Hillary Clinton, I got to read this passage in a letter to the editor of this newspaper calling for me to be forever silenced:LiNeBrEaK"While we all enjoy spirited political commentary, many of us would prefer if the paper limited the publication of personal attacks on our nation's leaders," the reader wrote.LiNeBrEaKIt was a better day when it was the Democrats who were calling for an end to criticism. And now that day is upon us again. Every cloud has a silver lining, they say, even the mid-January cloud that will permit me to risk spending the day in Washington without sunscreen.LiNeBrEaKNotes: Paul Mulshine appears regularly in The Star-Ledger.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	A lesson from Estrella  	LETTERS  	1313 words  	If Estrella Seals, a sixth grader from Cherokee Heights Elementary School in St. Paul, is an example of our future -- there is hope ("An inaugural winner," Jan. 19).LiNeBrEaKAs a "conservative old guy," it seems that I have let myself become overwhelmed by the negativity in our world today. The economy is in turmoil; our leaders are less than trustworthy; terrorists are in the shadows; our retirement savings are shrinking fast; TV displays our decadence. And, heaven forbid, Al Franken will represent Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKIt seems to me that Estrella, winner of an essay contest on black excellence, has been blessed with positive, supportive and loving parents.LiNeBrEaKI pray that Estrella realizes her dreams and that she continues to be surrounded with positive role models. She has the right idea. She has the right goals. LiNeBrEaKAs we welcome President Barack Obama, it is comforting to know that Estrella and other young people will be there to witness this most historic and special time in our country's history.LiNeBrEaKI think we can all take a lesson from Estrella.LiNeBrEaKJohn R. Santos, MaplewoodConfusing weatherwith climateLiNeBrEaKI am somewhat dismayed that many readers are still confusing weather (individual storms and air masses) with climate (long-term trends in such weather attributes as temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.) when they contemplate how seriously they should take environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKI realize that some individuals respond more to the messenger than to the message, but when it comes to climate change, it is my opinion that it is real, it can be substantiated by the scientific data and it is already having observable consequences, even in Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKAs someone who has studied atmospheric and climate science for more than 35 years, I still have to admit that science cannot explain precisely all of the atmospheric processes and interactions driving climate change, often overly simplified in the popular media. But we must acknowledge that climate change is happening, and we should use our knowledge and technology to adapt to it or to mitigate its human-induced drivers.LiNeBrEaKMinnesotans have a reputation for valuing citizenship and community action, overcoming our differences and, in the end, doing the right thing. As we grapple with our struggling economy and what to do about it, let's also consider doing the right thing for Minnesota's rich landscape and resources.LiNeBrEaKMark Seeley, St. PaulLiNeBrEaKThe writer is professor and extension climatologist/meteorologist with the Department of Soil, Water and Climate at the University of Minnesota.Cost of smoking banLiNeBrEaKThis letter is to all the people at the Capitol who passed the smoking ban on a legal product.LiNeBrEaKI, and many others, would like to know how much tax money the state has lost because of this ban. You can bet it is huge. People have lost jobs and businesses have closed or are struggling to make it. The money being lost could have helped pay for services that are going to be cut (police, fire, health, education and many more jobs).LiNeBrEaKThe governor and his crew at the Capitol should face the fact this ban was a huge mistake. If they are worried about people's health, then they should put a ban on a lot of food and drinks that can be bad for your health.LiNeBrEaKI'm a nonsmoker, by the way.LiNeBrEaKMary Wenner, St. Paul IRV: What's not to like?LiNeBrEaKJason Hoppin reported that instant-runoff voting is "supported in Minnesota by a bevy of left-leaning politicians and interest groups" ("Instant-runoff voting gets nod from court," Jan. 15). Maybe so, but as a longtime Republican, not known to be "left-leaning," I find IRV a welcome proposal for electoral reform, as well.LiNeBrEaKIt is less costly, may produce a more timely outcome and will produce a majority winner. I don't see what's not to like -- no matter which way people lean.LiNeBrEaKLoanne R. Thrane, St. PaulSoucheray's right about 'miracle' flightLiNeBrEaKWay to go, Joe Soucheray. Your column on the US Airways plane's "miracle" flight (Jan. 18) was great and so true.LiNeBrEaKWe have turned into a "sue you, sue me" society in which you can spill hot coffee on yourself and sue the restaurant for damages.LiNeBrEaKEveryone on that plane has so much to be thankful for. They all walked off and went home to their loved ones. You cannot put a price on that. Please, as Joe said, "let's keep lawsuits off this miracle."LiNeBrEaKLaura McGinn, St. PaulA voice aimedat the futureLiNeBrEaKTo the letter writer ("Interpreting votes and recount rules," Jan. 15) who wondered where the Democratic voices are: The election is over, and most of us, along with most Republicans, are waiting for the judges to determine who will represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate, and as soon as possible.LiNeBrEaKI trust these distinguished jurists to do the job specified by the laws and Minnesota Constitution. Whoever wins will be accepted by most of us as the legally elected senator.LiNeBrEaKUnlike sports, there are no photo finishes with two gold medals; there will be only one person elected. And in an election, there is no such thing as a "statistical dead heat."LiNeBrEaKThis voice has been urging legislators to use the economic stimulus package to rebuild the badly neglected infrastructure: highways, bridges, dams and the electrical distribution system. And this voice has been calling for more investment in education, funded by rescinding the unwarranted tax cuts of recent years, the tax cuts that have caused the current financial mess (along with irresponsible deregulation). And I have been urging investment in nuclear power to support a move to electric cars.LiNeBrEaKLen Schakel, LakelandPerceptions aboutoff-duty officersLiNeBrEaKRub&eacute;n Rosario's recent column on police officers' activity while off duty was on target ("Cop's off-duty club questioned in lawsuit," Jan. 11).LiNeBrEaKBeing a police officer, I agree that my personal life off duty will determine how I am perceived by others. Whom I socialize with, where I spend my time and money and how I live my life will be used in this determination. Public perception may not always be accurate, but our actions determine how people arrive at their opinions. Be assured, many in police officer motorcycle groups are non-drinking officers simply looking for an escape and allowing themselves to leave their jobs behind.LiNeBrEaKThe law enforcement profession has a higher rate of divorce, alcoholism and suicide than the general public. While we remain brave and strong, while solving the world's problems and making split-second decisions, we are often questioned by others who disagree with our reasoning. While we have a need to let our hair down and cut loose, we need to remember that ethics and integrity will shape the way we are perceived. How we are perceived will determine how effective we are in working in our communities.LiNeBrEaKPaul A. Johnson, Spooner, Wis. Why reveal hockey players' names?LiNeBrEaKI felt great anger at your newspaper's absolute dogged determination to find and reveal the names of the four Hill-Murray High School hockey players who were removed from the team roster ("Down four, Hill-Murray regroups," Jan. 16).LiNeBrEaKIf the team and the administration wanted to give privacy to the boys, that was their decision, and it was kind, considerate and wise. It was an internal thing.LiNeBrEaKIt appears your paper dug and dug until it found the four names. What did you prove, except that you can destroy and invade privacy and make the boys feel even worse? I don't know the boys, but you certainly let everyone know who they are.LiNeBrEaKLila J. Recksiedler, Roseville'Dream' still eludes usLiNeBrEaKNot to rain on anybody's parade, but the way the media is fawning over President Barack Obama is very disturbing. It's as if we elected a god, not just a man.LiNeBrEaKMartin Luther King Jr. dreamed of a day when we would judge a person by the content of his character, not the color of his skin. Ronald Reagan sought a "colorblind" society.LiNeBrEaKBut sadly, the only thing people are focusing on with Obama is the color of his skin. Apparently, the dream still eludes us.LiNeBrEaKMatt Marchetti, North St. Paul		LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (88%); CLIMATE CHANGE (87%); HISTORY (72%); METEOROLOGY (71%); PERSONAL FINANCE (71%); TRENDS (71%); SCIENCE NEWS (69%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (69%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (66%); SMOKING (63%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%); TERRORISM (56%)  			AL FRANKEN (57%); BARACK OBAMA (56%)  	MINNESOTA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved  	Pioneer Press  															
The Tribune (San Luis Obispo, California)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: A glorious burden, and a heavy one  	COMMENTARY  	359 words  	Jan. 20--The American presidency has been described as a glorious burden, and never has that phrase seemed to ring more true -- at least in our lifetimes -- than it does today. When he is sworn into office, Barack Obama will indeed take on a glorious burden -- one so heavy that many are left wondering why on earth anyone would want it. LiNeBrEaKYet Obama takes office with the knowledge that the majority of Americans are confident in his ability to do the job.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 79 percent of Americans are optimistic about the next four years under Obama. Of those who voted for John McCain, 58 percent feel optimistic about an Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the respondents felt that things can't get much worse. That would be understandable, given the disastrous worldwide economy, rising unemployment at home, the plight of the uninsured, continued war in the Middle East, global warming ... the list goes on.LiNeBrEaKStill, given the divisiveness of the Obama-McCain election, we find it remarkable that in a few short months, so many Americans have been able to move past the bitterness and rancor of the campaign to unite behind the new president.LiNeBrEaKThat says much about Obama's ability to inspire, but we believe it says even more about ourselves as a nation -- a nation of people willing to look past their many differences, especially in a time of crisis, to give a new president a fair shake.LiNeBrEaKGiven the high expectations for his presidency, Obama's honeymoon period could be short-lived indeed if he fails to deliver positive results, especially when it comes to the economy.LiNeBrEaKFor today, though, may the "glorious burden" not weigh too heavily on his shoulders -- and may we all join in celebrating a new beginning.

The Tribune-Star (Terre Haute, Indiana)  	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Let us put divisions aside on this inauguration day  	COMMENTARY  	403 words  	Jan. 20--The litany of "challenges" facing the new president of the United States of America is long and ominous -- an economy in trouble, two wars, a lingering terrorist threat, climate change, chronic instability in the Middle East, and it doesn't stop there. LiNeBrEaKNone of these issues will be far from center stage today as Barack Obama is sworn in as the nation's 44th president. But for a brief period, as the peaceful transfer of power occurs in our nation's capital, Americans should make an effort to pause from their collective worries to revel in the greatness of this system of government and rule of law that has guided the country through good times and bad for the past 232 years.LiNeBrEaKAmericans are passionate about their nation and their legacy of self-government. And they should be. But that shared passion does not mean they are always in agreement. In fact, they are often bitterly divided along political and philosophical lines. Despite the rancor those divisions produce, we come together every four or eight years as fellow citizens to inaugurate a new president and pay respect to that individual we have elected to represent us around the world.LiNeBrEaKToday's inauguration is especially noteworthy as the first African-American president takes the oath of office. Barack Obama's election was dramatic in many ways, including its shattering of a significant social barrier. It is a proud and poignant moment for a country that has struggled throughout its history with racial injustice.LiNeBrEaKObama seems destined to enjoy a groundswell of goodwill as his term begins. How long that will last is uncertain, although partisan bickering in Washington, D.C. never takes much of a holiday. With all the problems facing America, the new president will need all the goodwill he can find.LiNeBrEaKFor the man who ascended to the presidency on themes of hope and change, it is our hope that the next four years brings our new president, and our country, great change accompanied by national prosperity and progress.

The Washington Times 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 		NATION; INSIDE THE BELTWAY; A05  	709 words  	TWO SHIPS PASSINGLiNeBrEaKThat was President Bush's motorcade getting in formation to depart the White House for a Sunday night dinner with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at her Watergate apartment, just after President-elect Barack Obama's motorcade pulled up across the street to the Blair House for his dinner with Oprah Winfrey.LiNeBrEaKFor one of the motorcades (we'll let you guess which one), adoring throngs, held to the sidewalks by the Secret Service, cheered and took pictures. LiNeBrEaKHISTORY SELLSLiNeBrEaKNeedless to say, guests will be carefully protecting their heavy-card-stock, gold-raised-seal invitations to the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, the official Presidential Inaugural Committee invites could fetch hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars in the not-too-distant future.LiNeBrEaKHours before the swearing-in ceremony on Capitol Hill, several dozen of the soon-to-be- "used" invitations were posted on the Internet auction site eBay, with bidding reaching more than $300 and counting.LiNeBrEaKINAUGURAL FEETLiNeBrEaKScores of celebrities have arrived by private jet for the much-hyped inauguration of Barack Obama. And no better time for Al Gore to emerge from his hibernation to draw attention to the environmental footprint that the star-studded visitors will be leaving behind.LiNeBrEaK(Actually, Mr. Gore is busy staying warm during this unusually frigid week of global warming.)LiNeBrEaKIn the meantime, the Institute for Liberty (IFL) has taken data from federal agencies, environmentalist organizations and news agencies to extrapolate the estimated environmental impact for the 2009 inauguration. It concludes that the 600 private jets expected to fly visitors to and from the capital city will produce 25,320,000 pounds of carbon dioxide, with personal vehicles accounting for 262,483,200 pounds of the odorless gas.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, during the inaugural parade, horses alone will produce more than 400 pounds of carbon dioxide, with the total carbon footprint for the day likely exceeding 575 million pounds of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKIn comparison, it would take the average U.S. household 57,598 years to produce a carbon footprint equal to that of the new president's housewarming party.LiNeBrEaK"The inauguration of President Obama is truly an historic occasion that should be celebrated," said IFL President Andrew Langer. "However, it would be very hypocritical for the scores of celebrities, VIPs and political elites to lecture on environmental policy to middle America and small businesses that are merely trying to survive in these difficult economic times, and then turn around and contribute to the half-billion pounds of emitted CO2."LiNeBrEaKIN-ROADSLiNeBrEaKIt remains to be seen how many celebrities will adorn their arms at the inaugural balls tonight with those new high-fashion bags made from recycled tractor tire inner tubes, otherwise known as "Recycled Tractor Tire Inner Tube Bags."LiNeBrEaKThe bag maker, the Passchal Collection, says Hollywood's hottest stars, including the Golden Globe nominees and presenters, have been scooping up the "handcrafted" bags in recent days. Cost of each bag: $170 to $525, depending on the size of the tire.LiNeBrEaKPasschal says it has collected and recycled more than 25 tons of tractor inner tubes before they were discarded to landfills.LiNeBrEaKCOME AS YOU ARELiNeBrEaKPerhaps for future presidential inaugurals, what with the rapid advances in computer technology, Americans won't physically flock to the nation's capital to dance the night away.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, Smart Girl Politics, a right-of-center women's movement, is throwing an online "Twitter Ball" this Inauguration Day, counting among its guests conservative pundit Michelle Malkin.LiNeBrEaKSo do women attending the Twitter Ball wear gowns?LiNeBrEaK"Our goal is to not just give conservatives something to do [this Inauguration Day] but to have an open dialogue about where we go from here," said Teri Christoph, co-founder and executive director of the smarter girls.LiNeBrEaKSEEKING 'CHANGE'LiNeBrEaKAnd after Barack Obama's inaugural parade draws to a close, several hundred thousand marchers will be marching for "change" in another parade this week.LiNeBrEaKThe entire student body of Christendom College in Virginia, we've learned, will carry the lead banner in Thursday's 36th annual March for Life.

The Washington Times 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 		PLUGGED IN - POLITICS; ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT; A14  	479 words  	Capitol's howlin' winds may offset L.A.'s flyin' celebsLiNeBrEaKFor once, the strong winds blowing off Capitol Hill might be useful. Two wind turbines at the U.S. Botanical Gardens, within eyeshot of the Capitol building, will help power the city's electric grid. LiNeBrEaKThe carbon-neutral generators should help offset some of the pollution caused by the celebrities flocking to see Barack Obama this week.LiNeBrEaKThe Institute for Liberty estimates that celebrities flying to Washington for the festivities will pump more than 25 million pounds of CO2 into the air, drivers will emit more than 260 million pounds of CO2, and the total carbon footprint of the inaugural parade will come to 575 million pounds of CO2.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the whole thing may be a wash if some of the more dire predictions found in the Environmental Protection Agency's 786-page report detailing the effects of a sea rise pan out. Some of Washingtonians' favorite vacation spots - the mid-Atlantic's coastal areas and barrier islands - are in danger of being wiped out by rising ocean waters, the EPA found.LiNeBrEaKTop staff joins global-warming committeeLiNeBrEaKRepublican Rep. James F. Sensenbrenner Jr., the ranking Republican on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, added two high-level staffers to his team last week.LiNeBrEaKFormer Ambassador Harlan L. Watson returns to Hill-staffing duties following a seven-year run representing the Bush administration before the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change. Before his diplomatic work, Mr. Watson staffed the House Science Committee for 16 years and worked as a science adviser there.LiNeBrEaKBart Forsyth comes from the House Science Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, where he worked as counsel to Mr. Sensenbrenner.LiNeBrEaKMr. Watson will work as professional staff on the recently re-impaneled global-warming committee, and Mr. Forsyth becomes deputy chief of staff and chief counsel.LiNeBrEaKJackson the "strong" pickLiNeBrEaKNew Jersey's senators like to wear their aphorisms on their chests, Sen. Robert Menendez told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKMr. Menendez said he and Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg have a favorite T, which reads "New Jersey: Only the Strong Survive."LiNeBrEaKMr. Menendez used the statement to assert that his New Jersey colleague Lisa Jackson, Mr. Obama's pick for EPA chief, already had been well-vetted by a state that shows no mercy.LiNeBrEaK"And Lisa Jackson has not only survived there, but she has thrived in developing and implementing policies that have won wide-ranging praise and respect," Mr. Menendez said.LiNeBrEaKWhen it came time for her to question Mrs. Jackson, Sen. Amy Klobuchar motioned that Northerners are a tough lot, too.LiNeBrEaK"It was 25 below zero in Minnesota last night, so I think we could amend the T-shirt," the Minnesota Democrat said.

The Washington Times 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday 	Senators ponder vetting czar Browner;  New post to coordinate with Cabinet members 	PLUGGED IN - POLITICS; A14  	625 words  	Senators quizzing President-elect Barack Obama's energy and environment Cabinet members last week pondered whether they were vetting the wrong people - raising larger questions about who will steer the nation's climate and energy policies.LiNeBrEaKSen. James M. Inhofe, ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, asked Nancy Sutley, Mr. Obama's pick for Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) chairman, whether she would be undermined by the new climate czar, Carol M. Browner. LiNeBrEaK"I'm quite concerned that the chair's role has been diluted by the addition of former EPA Administrator Carol Browner as White House climate and energy czar," said Mr. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican. "The new Senate-confirmed CEQ chair will be expected to have the full authority to represent the White House on all matters before this committee."LiNeBrEaKMr. Inhofe also prodded Mrs. Browner at a press conference last week about her ties to the Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society. The Washington Times had reported that she had been listed until recently as one of 14 leaders of the Society and had attended a conference of the socialist group last summer.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama announced last month that Mrs. Browner would coordinate among Cabinet members who work on energy and environmental goals from the new post on the White House staff.LiNeBrEaKThe hearings last week provided the first major forum for questions about who will guide climate and energy priorities in the new administration, which have been brewing since Mr. Obama said last month he would create the new post.LiNeBrEaKA transition-team spokeswoman said Mrs. Browner will work with Cabinet appointments to advise Mr. Obama.LiNeBrEaK"The range of energy and climate issues impact the entire federal government, and [Mr. Obama] will rely on the advice and counsel of not only these individuals, but also additional members of his Cabinet and White House advisers for their expertise and input," said Jen Psaki, a transition-team spokeswoman.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman asked Energy Secretary-designate Steven Chu where he fit in the new Obama organizational chart.LiNeBrEaK"How does this affect your role, and how do you see your role in the issue of climate change, which you referred to, as it relates to others in the administration?" the New Mexico Democrat asked Mr. Chu.LiNeBrEaKLater in the hearing, Sen. Bob Corker, Tennessee Republican, suggested that Mrs. Browner appear for a quasi-confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee because of her "czar" status coordinating energy and environmental policy.LiNeBrEaKMembers of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee questioned whether Mr. Obama's pick for EPA chief, Lisa Jackson, would have clear authority on setting environmental policy.LiNeBrEaK"Ms. Browner's appointment into an office of energy and climate change does not change EPA's statutory responsibilities and in my mind, change EPA's other nonstatutory responsibilities to advise this body, to advise the president," Mrs. Jackson said in response to a question from Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican.LiNeBrEaKAlthough senators have asked about who will call the shots, confirmation hearings for Mr. Obama's energy and environment picks mostly have been cordial this week.LiNeBrEaKSenate Environment and Public Works Chairwoman Barbara Boxer said she was excited to have a strong team working on cleaning up the environment and told Mrs. Jackson she was happy with Mr. Obama's restructuring.LiNeBrEaK"I love that idea because I think bringing Carol Browner and bringing you and bringing Nancy Sutley - and you all have your responsibility statutorily and of the law. I think it would be a very good thing," said Mrs. Boxer, California Democrat.

The Washington Post 	January 20, 2009 Tuesday   Regional Edition	No Choice but to Matter  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25  	738 words  	Barack Obama staged his arrival in Washington to evoke Abraham Lincoln's, but the historical echo is faint. Lincoln's famous train ride to his 1861 inauguration traversed a landscape of bitterness and strife. He had to speed through Baltimore "like a thief in the night" for fear of riots and possible assassination. Obama, by contrast, was met by tens of thousands of Baltimoreans who braved subfreezing temperatures to cheer the new president. As Obama made his way to the capital, he crossed a landscape of hope.LiNeBrEaKRarely has a new presidency been greeted with such a consensus of goodwill -- and rarely has a new president so needed it. LiNeBrEaKThe importance of Obama's mind-blowing historical breakthrough can hardly be overstated. Slavery vexed the Founding Fathers; if not for Lincoln's iron determination, it would have ripped the nation apart. For nearly a century after African Americans were freed from bondage, American society still relegated us to a corner reserved for second-class citizens. Having a black man as president does not magically eliminate racial disparities in income or wealth; it does not fix inner-city schools, repair crumbling neighborhoods or heal dysfunctional families. Psychologically, though, it changes everything.LiNeBrEaKOur mental furniture is being rearranged. The advent of Obama's presidency brings the African American experience to center stage but does so in a way that allows society to congratulate itself on having come so far. The implications for black Americans are even more profound, because seeing Obama in the White House obliterates any logic behind self-imposed limits on imagination and ambition.LiNeBrEaKThese are huge impacts --  making it ironic that, in the end, race is likely to be secondary in defining Obama's place in history.LiNeBrEaKSince Obama's election, I've heard more than one friend joke sardonically that the nation has said: Sure, a black man can run the country; go right ahead and take your turn -- now that the economy is in the tubes, the financial system is a wreck, we're mired in two wars, global warming is parboiling the planet, the government has been forced to spend a trillion dollars or more just to stave off utter ruin, and there's precious little money left to finance desperately needed reforms in health care, education, energy, infrastructure . . .LiNeBrEaKExpectations that Obama will be able to solve this daunting array of problems are strikingly high. A new Post poll finds that 61 percent of Americans have a "good amount" or "great deal" of confidence that Obama will make the right decisions for the country. A remarkable 72 percent are "fairly" or "very" confident that Obama's economic program -- whatever it ultimately turns out to be -- will improve the economy.LiNeBrEaKAn Associated Press poll reports that 65 percent of Americans believe Obama will be an "above average" president, including 28 percent who expect him to be "outstanding." Almost two-thirds of Americans, the AP finds, believe their own financial situation will improve early in the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKThe conventional wisdom is that Obama risks losing public support through disillusionment as people discover that he can't wave a magic wand and make everything better. But the conventional wisdom has been wrong about Obama so many times over the past year that I use it more as a guide to what's not likely to happen.LiNeBrEaKThe truth is that no one knows whether Barack Obama will be a good president, much less a great president. All that anyone, including Obama, can be sure of is that his will be a consequential presidency.  That is an important piece of knowledge. It took the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to broaden the scope and ambition of George W. Bush's presidency, for better or worse. Obama takes office knowing beyond all doubt that he has no choice but to swing for the fences.LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, as Obama was launching his campaign -- over the objections of the Democratic Party establishment, which was still listening to the conventional wisdom -- I interviewed him in his Senate office. I was struck by his confidence and his conviction that this was his time, and especially by how unflappable he appeared to be. I saw him last week, after a campaign that had the rest of us on the edge of our seats for months and months, and he seemed temperamentally unchanged.LiNeBrEaKOur new president is a man who knows exactly who he is. The nation, filled with hope, is about to find out.LiNeBrEaKeugenerobinson@washpost.com		AFRICAN AMERICANS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CIVIL RIGHTS (74%); FAMILY (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (71%); POLLS and SURVEYS (67%); EDUCATION (66%); INFRASTRUCTURE (50%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  			BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	UNITED STATES (97%)  	January 23, 2009  	ENGLISH  	IMAGE; By Linda Davidson -- The Washington Post; President-elect Barack Obama speaks to volunteers at Calvin Coolidge High School in the District yesterday.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 19, 2009 Monday   Online Edition	Political Insider;  Rick Warren at Ebenezer: 'Can we not all just get along?' 		501 words  	Monday, January 19, 2009, 01: 03 PMLiNeBrEaKProtestors jumped up as the Rev. Rick Warren of Saddleback Church began his MLK Day address at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on Atlanta.LiNeBrEaKThe two women were quickly escorted out.LiNeBrEaKIt took nearly three hours for Monday's ceremony to get to Warren, the featured speaker of the program, who also will give the invocation at the inauguration of President Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKProtestors, who object to Warren's stand against same-sex marriage and abortion, also stood outside and shouted. LiNeBrEaKHere's one line from Warren that sounded like a theme for tomorrow: "Justice is a journey, and we're getting further and further along."LiNeBrEaKWarren's strongest reference to the hoopla surrounding his participation in the Obama inauguration came at the very end of a 50-minute address:LiNeBrEaK"I am a white, overweight, southern California mega-church pastor. I love you. And I reach out my hand to you and I say to you and to anyone of good will --- to quote that great theologian Rodney King --- 'Can we not all just get along?'LiNeBrEaK"You don't have to agree on everything. You don't have to agree to be agreeable. You can disagree without being disagreeable. You can walk hand-in-hand with out seeing eye-to-eye.LiNeBrEaK"You know what I love about America? It's diversity. I don't know if you've figure this out, but God likes variety.''LiNeBrEaKOtherwise, Warren's remarks were largely King-oriented and inspirational.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the most interesting was the rousing defense of Warren offered by Isaac Farris, CEO of the King Center, from the pulpit:LiNeBrEaK"When Pastor Warren was selected to deliver the invocation at the inauguration tomorrow, it sparked a bit of controversy because of his views on same-sex marriage and abortion rights.LiNeBrEaK""But you know, Pastor Warren is not so easy to pigeon-hole as your average conservative on the political spectrum. Because he holds views on issues like poverty, compassion help for people with AIDS, global warming --- what some people might characterize as liberal or progressive...LiNeBrEaK"Here at the King Center we would just call it the social gospel. There are those who feel that because of his conservative views on some issues, Pastor Warren shouldn't be a speaker at this service.LiNeBrEaK""I submit to you that these are people who, quite frankly, don't understand the beloved community of Martin Luther King Jr. In the beloved community, you will find both conservative and liberal Christians, people of Jewish, Islamic and Hindu faiths. People of all races --- gays, lesbians.LiNeBrEaK""I would urge his critics to rise to the challenge of Martin Luther King Jr., who said --- if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition.LiNeBrEaK""And let us remember that followers of Martin Luther King Jr. hold diverse opinions on topics like abortion and same-sex marriage. All of the great freedom movements in America are based on free speech."LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2009/01/19/rick_warren_at_ebenezer_on_mlk.html		RELIGION (90%); PROTESTANTS and PROTESTANTISM (90%); CHRISTIANS and CHRISTIANITY (90%); GAYS and LESBIANS (89%); CIVIL RIGHTS (78%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (76%); SAME SEX MARRIAGE and UNIONS (75%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (73%); MARRIAGE (70%); ABORTION (70%); MUSLIMS and ISLAM (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%) Blogs  			BARACK OBAMA (91%)  	ATLANTA, GA, USA (91%) GEORGIA, USA (91%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspapers  	2009 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   	JIM GALLOWAY; Staff  															
Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 19, 2009 Monday 	Inauguration signals a sea change in U.S. attitudes toward race  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	1576 words  	COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Sometimes, history comes full circle.LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, Hannah Jane Hurdle-Toomey, one of the last living children of an African-American slave, will be watching intently on TV as an African-American family takes up residence in the White House _ a national monument built by slaves.LiNeBrEaK"At last, the time has come," said the 76-year-old retired Oregon pastor whose father, Andrew Jackson Hurdle, was born into slavery in North Carolina in 1845. "This at least will give our young African-American children hope that they, too, can achieve. We had just about collectively given up."LiNeBrEaKSometimes, history puts things right. LiNeBrEaKOn the front lawn of the South Carolina state capitol, hard by the Confederate flag waving in the breeze and next to the monument honoring Confederate soldiers, stands a forbidding statue of one of America's most notorious white supremacists.LiNeBrEaK"We have done our level best. We have scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one of them, and we would have done it if we could," declared Benjamin Tillman, a South Carolina governor and senator, speaking of black Americans on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1900. "We stuffed ballot boxes. We shot them. We are not ashamed of it. We of the South have never recognized the right of the Negro to govern white men, and we never will."LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, when the first black man in American history recites the presidential oath of office, Benjamin Tillman officially becomes moot.LiNeBrEaKFor a nation sucker-punched by an economic collapse, a world knocked back on its heels by terrorism and a planet gasping for relief from a steadily warming climate, the inauguration of President Barack Hussein Obama offers a breathtaking moment of audacious hope.LiNeBrEaKUnemployed Americans with evaporated medical insurance are hoping Obama's promised health reforms come through before they get sick. Vulnerable Americans living along the nation's coasts are hoping Obama does something about climate change before the seas rise any higher. Patriotic Americans with sons and daughters in the U.S. armed forces are hoping Obama can bring two precarious wars to a secure conclusion. Black Americans still victimized by systemic racial inequalities are hoping that Obama will address the nation's unfinished business of equal opportunity.LiNeBrEaKAnd every American who is hoping to send a child to college, care for an elderly parent or simply retire without having to take a full-time job as a Wal-Mart greeter is praying that Obama can chart a way out of the nation's deepening financial crisis.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't vote for Obama," said a woman hurrying out of an unemployment office in downtown Columbia, "but if he can create some jobs down here, a lot of us will be willing to change our minds."LiNeBrEaKThe nation's 44th president will scarcely resemble all the Establishment white men who came before him. In fact, even as the Obamas finally integrate 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue after more than 200 years, outgoing President George W. Bush and his wife Laura will be heading back to Texas to a newly-purchased home in an exclusive, 82-percent white Dallas neighborhood where, until just a few years ago, home sellers routinely attached "racial covenants" to their property deeds to prevent blacks from buying in.LiNeBrEaKBut President Obama, the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, will look very much like the new, multi-racial, multicultural America he will begin to lead _ a nation that, by the time Obama's two young daughters reach middle age, will no longer have a majority white population.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKNot only Democrats or liberals or African Americans will be rejoicing on Inauguration Day. Polls show that more than three-fourths of Americans _ many of them Republican and conservative and white _ are pulling for Obama in these perilous times, far more than the 53 percent of the electorate who voted for him.LiNeBrEaK"You'd have to be irrational not to want the new president to succeed," Newt Gingrich, one of the Republican Party's ideological standard-bearers, recently told The New York Times.LiNeBrEaKThere is another national yearning out there as well, one as old as America's founding sin of slavery _ the hope that, 146 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation and nearly 46 years after Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of his evocative dream, Obama's presidency might finally salve the wounds of America's enduring struggles over race.LiNeBrEaKToday, of course, all Americans have the right to vote, or live where they choose, or eat where they want.LiNeBrEaKThe nation can look back at the grainy newsreels of little black girls being escorted by federal marshals into public schools, or the faded photographs of red-faced sheriffs unleashing vicious dogs on peaceful protesters, or the museum displays of "Whites Only" signs posted above water fountains and restrooms, and take comfort that such Old South anachronisms are locked away in America's shameful Jim Crow past.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, liberated from the rigid categories of "black" or "white," 2 percent of Americans now identify themselves to census-takers as members of two or more races _ like Obama, the progeny of inter-racial unions that not so long ago triggered arrests and even public lynchings.LiNeBrEaK"We're very excited about the potential for Barack Obama to ignite a very productive discussion about race and culture," said Louie Gong, president of the Mavin Foundation, an interest group for people of mixed racial heritage. "For the first time, people who aren't multiracial and who have never been concerned with racial issues are really thinking about what it means to be mixed."LiNeBrEaKBut all of that substantial progress only casts into sharper relief how much remains to be done in a nation where some experts say it will take another 500 years for African Americans to bridge the income gap with whites, where Hispanic immigrants are vilified by TV pundits denouncing them as vectors for leprosy, where the Republican Party of Lincoln does not have a single African American among its 219 senators and representatives in Washington and where many inner-city schools remain as racially segregated _ and educationally deficient _ as they were half a century ago.LiNeBrEaK"The reality is that, for African Americans, we have lost all the progress we had made since the l960s," said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at the University of California at Los Angeles and a leading expert on school desegregation. "For whites, it is a lost opportunity to prepare" for the nation's multi-ethnic future.LiNeBrEaKContrary to the fondest hopes of liberal Americans _ and the insistent declarations of conservatives _ America is decidedly not yet "post-racial." Race, particularly the historic divide between blacks and whites, is still the abiding subtext of many of our national conversations.LiNeBrEaK"On the day after Obama's election, I went to the post office and the postman couldn't find anything to call me but 'girl,'" said Hurdle-Toomey, whose father, the former slave, died three years after she was born in 1932. "I went to the gym to work out and a woman asked me if I would do her laundry. You would think there was committee set up to remind me I am just one generation away from slavery."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKObama never campaigned to become the nation's first black president. He wants instead to be seen as the first president who happens to be black. And black political leaders are acutely sensitive to the distinction, mindful that a successful president must govern from the center and not be seen as beholden to any particular interest group.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think we are going to be walking up to him and saying 'Brother President,'" Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, told a forum at Williams College in November. "He's not the Black Caucus president. He is the president of America. He's the leader of all Americans."LiNeBrEaKOthers, however, emphasize that they will be looking to the new president and his Justice Department to focus on issues of justice and equality.LiNeBrEaK"Although Obama's candidacy has fantastically and forever shattered the shackles in the American psyche that a black person can't make it in America, it says nothing _ yet _ about what blacks as a people can achieve," said Rev. Al Sharpton. "Until we have reached that tipping point where race does not negatively affect millions of people of color _ as opposed to just one _ there is still much more work for me and other civil rights leaders to do."LiNeBrEaKLonnie Randolph Jr., the chairman of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, is similarly wary. He has been struggling for years to force state officials to repair scores of rural schools _ attended mostly by impoverished black students _ where the roofs leak, the bathrooms are filled with sewage and there is no working heat or air conditioning.LiNeBrEaK"The inauguration is not going to solve the problem in our schools," Randolph said. "Ceremonially it's a nice event. But one out of 44 presidents and we are supposed to be happy? This is just a very small step."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	For California, new clout in Obama's tech-friendly administration  	NEWS  	1015 words  	and Mary Anne OstromLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON   Barbara Boxer remembers the "dark days" when California and its issues were dismissed by official Washington with disdain and hostility.LiNeBrEaK"Dianne Feinstein and I joked that it was ABC   anything but California, anyone but California," Boxer said, recalling when the two Democrats joined the Senate in 1993.LiNeBrEaKNow, as California Democrats pour into Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration, the state can claim a surge of influence in the new, tech-friendly administration. Congress, too, is looking westward, with Californians taking key positions of power. LiNeBrEaKTwo Californians were named to Obama's Cabinet   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu at the Energy Department and Rep. Hilda Solis at the Labor Department   and Leon Panetta, former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, has been appointed to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.LiNeBrEaKObama also named a pair of Golden Staters to key White House posts: Christina Romer, a Berkeley economist, will chair the Council of Economic Advisers, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, will bring her experience as a state environmental regulator to the job of chairing the Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"These are superstar choices. California is 'in' right now, and we can remember when California was 'out,'"[0/00]" Boxer said. "There is a lot more respect for the state, especially on energy issues."LiNeBrEaKShift on tech, energyLiNeBrEaKOn a policy level, it's a shift from oil drilling to renewable energy, from sidestepping the issue of global warming to dealing with it aggressively, from a pro-industry stance to greater sympathy for organized labor.LiNeBrEaKRep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat, measured the change this way: "I remember Governor Jerry Brown coming to Washington talking about windmills, and people made fun of him. Now everybody is talking about wind energy and solar."LiNeBrEaKCalifornians with deep experience in tech and energy issues, particularly clean technology, have Obama's ear. That includes Eric Schmidt,  chief executive of Google, venture capitalist John Doerr, who is close to Al Gore, and John Thompson, the former Symantec CEO who may be a contender for commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKThat influence can be seen in major ingredients in the $825 billion stimulus package prepared by the House with the Obama team's input. Doerr, for example, lobbied for the $11 billion that would go toward modernizing the electricity grid. Tech groups pushed hard for $6 billion in grants to speed up broadband deployment. Wind-energy advocates secured a long-term extension of the production tax credit.LiNeBrEaKAnd California renewable-energy companies and investors, struggling with the frozen credit market, cheered when Obama announced his goal of doubling the production of renewable energy over the next three years.LiNeBrEaK"I think what the Obama administration intends to do is move the technology that has been pioneered in California across the country," said Cathy Zoi, CEO of Palo Alto-based Alliance for Climate Protection. The state's new clout should not be viewed in the traditional sense of more "pork" for California, said Norm Ornstein, an author and longtime analyst of government for the American Enterprise Institute. But it will play out in other ways.LiNeBrEaK"There will be a greater sensibility on issues that matter to California and drive the California economy," Ornstein said. "It helps that Obama puts a high priority about keeping the nation's edge on technology, and is listening to Silicon Valley on that."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia-friendlyLiNeBrEaKSome appointees are not from California but tend to view key issues in California-friendly ways. Carol Browner, a top Obama adviser on energy and the environment, supported the state's pioneering regulations as Environmental Protection Agency chief. And Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a graduate of Santa Clara University who has worked on border-state issues, has been named to head the Homeland Security Department.LiNeBrEaKObama is unlikely to cultivate as cozy a relationship with the state as Bill Clinton did, predicted Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College who worked for Republicans during the Reagan and first Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKBut he agrees that just as Reagan-style California conservatism was adopted in Washington in the 1980s, Obama is likely to embrace California-style progressivism.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the 1990s, when Clinton had to deal with a Republican majority in Congress, Democrats now control both branches, with state leaders well-represented   starting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKLofgren, who chairs the immigration subcommittee in the House, knows she can get Napolitano on the phone if there's a problem with the immigration bureaucracy, or she can contact Solis on a labor issue.LiNeBrEaKLofgren chairs the delegation of 34 California Democrats in the House, which met last week and bid farewell to Solis.LiNeBrEaK"There in the room were the chairmen of the Energy Committee (Henry Waxman,) Education and Labor (George Miller), Foreign Affairs (Howard Berman), and Veterans Affairs (Bob Filner)," Lofgren said. "I thought, if you wanted to get something done, come to this room."LiNeBrEaKState labor leaders expect that with Solis in the Cabinet, they will have a friendly ear on minimum-wage and family-leave issues, and other concerns of an increasingly immigrant work force. Solis, from Los Angeles, is the daughter of immigrants and her father was a union worker.LiNeBrEaK"She is very well-connected and can help bridge the gap and the tensions between immigrant workers and other sectors of the community, including some unions," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.LiNeBrEaKBut Pitney, a veteran observer of Washington, warned that Californians looking for rapid change on energy, labor and other issues from Obama and other leaders they just elected may be disappointed.LiNeBrEaK"Electing officials is a lot like shopping online," Pitney said. "Everything looks better when you log on than when the package arrives at the door."LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at mostrom@mercurynews.com or 415 477-3794.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	Contra Costa Times Jan. 20 letters  	LETTERS; Opinion  	803 words  	President Bush was a good president. I want to thank him for protecting us against terrorism.LiNeBrEaKFor the last eight years, he was the greatest world leader. He was the only world leader respected by all dangerous countries that knew America would not allow any large-scale invasions and takeovers to terrorize the world.LiNeBrEaKOf course, there will always be insignificant internal infighting between terrorists all over the world, like the 21 separate violent actions now going on all over the world. But Bush's leadership has stopped all major violent actions and we must sincerely thank him for the existing world peace. LiNeBrEaKMost of the socialistic media constantly spewed hate accusations and lies about Bush every day for the last eight years until most Americans now are brainwashed and believe all this negative hate and lies.LiNeBrEaKBush stopped all terrorist attacks on America, he cut our taxes, held back from the global warming lie, slowed down the Big-Eco attacks on property rights and he appointed more minorities and women than any past president.LiNeBrEaKBut he was too nice and he would not fight his enemies.LiNeBrEaKElla JensenLiNeBrEaKEl CerritoLiNeBrEaKEssential solutionLiNeBrEaKThe ironies of all current ironies is the fact that President Bush over the last eight years has, for reasons too numerous to mention, got this country into the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression of the 1930s.LiNeBrEaKNow the poor Democrats are supposed to fix it all up. My question is: "Why should we Democrats have to make it right?"LiNeBrEaKIt's probably going to take years for us to get back on track again and during that time, unemployment will soar and we will all suffer to one extent or another.LiNeBrEaKBut the one half of 1 percent of us who are wealthy beyond belief won't suffer at all. In fact, they are probably profiting by the downturn.LiNeBrEaKSo that's why "taxing the rich" is one essential solution to our crisis.LiNeBrEaKRobert BlauLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaKBART bus rampLiNeBrEaKBART's Oakland Airport connector project is dead because it can't fund a $386 million tramway between the Coliseum and the airport. A cheaper solution is needed.LiNeBrEaKAirBART shuttle buses suffer from three problems: they get delayed in traffic, riders must descend from the station platform to reach buses and buses have steps, making them hard to board with luggage. Relatively-inexpensive solutions exist to two of these problems while we wait for BART's solution to all three.LiNeBrEaKFirst, build a spiral, buses-only ramp at the Coliseum station from the train platform level to the ground. Passengers would no longer have to descend from the station to reach buses.LiNeBrEaKThey would ride down on the bus on the way to the airport. Second, eliminate stairs from buses. At the Coliseum and airport buses would descend into a well or climb a ramp, allowing passengers to wheel their luggage on and off the bus as they do on BART trains.LiNeBrEaKThere would be no going up and down escalators or elevators, or lifting luggage, and the cost would a small fraction of $386 million.LiNeBrEaKGordon DebooLiNeBrEaKWalnut CreekLiNeBrEaKOverspendingLiNeBrEaKThe Times' editorial position is dead wrong. California's economy is in the tank not because of under-taxation, but overspending.LiNeBrEaKJay MillerLiNeBrEaKPittsburgLiNeBrEaKBudget miracle?LiNeBrEaKI read with interest the Jan. 4 Sunday Forum solutions of the state budget problem put forth by readers.LiNeBrEaKI was especially interested in the solutions offered by Ernest Hampson and Pete Laurence as they are regular contributors to the opinion pages of the Times.LiNeBrEaKThey didn't disappoint, as I expected the same view points as they regularly express on any matter of interest. However, I disagree strongly with their proposals because slash-and-burn tactics are not the answer.LiNeBrEaKIf these individuals had their way, we Democrats, union members, teachers and anyone else whom they determined to be not to their liking would be eliminated.LiNeBrEaKThen the Republican right would come to the rescue with the same type of expertise that has served us so well in the past.LiNeBrEaKWe don't need to completely gut all programs and government to solve our budget problems if our elected representatives, both Democrats and Republicans, would just cooperate and do what's best for our state.LiNeBrEaKThat seems very unlikely given the constant comments of the far-right Republican partisan members of our community. The mantra of "no new taxes" is their battle cry, and that wont change.LiNeBrEaKWe just have to hope for a miracle but don't hold your breath!LiNeBrEaKDave SuttonLiNeBrEaKConcordLiNeBrEaKRight about GazaLiNeBrEaKThe Times explained the situation in Gaza exactly as it is and I commend you for it.LiNeBrEaKThe marchers and the media do not seem to be interested in the truth of what is going on and only consider what the media present   civilians and children being killed, homes being destroyed, and not in the real story, as you present.LiNeBrEaKCongratulations for doing the right thing and shedding light instead of heat on a very contentious subject.LiNeBrEaKEugene MyersLiNeBrEaKWalnut Creek		LETTERS and COMMENTS (94%); TERRORISM (90%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); MOTORCOACHES and BUSES (85%); SHUTTLE BUS and VANPOOL SERVICES (85%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (73%); ECONOMIC DEPRESSION (70%); GREAT DEPRESSION (65%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); GLOBAL WARMING (53%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (65%)  			GEORGE W BUSH (94%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	Letters from our readers  															
Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	Cal professor sends Obama a reading assignment  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	739 words  	Barack Obama certainly has a lot of goals to conquer as he becomes the 44th president of the United States, but understanding radioactive decay and uranium bombs might not be on his short list of things to do.LiNeBrEaKBut Richard Muller, a UC Berkeley professor of physics and past winner of the MacArthur Fellowship, commonly called the "genius award," hopes Obama, 47, will take time out to read his book "Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines."LiNeBrEaKHe said he has sent several copies to Obama's advisers and even managed to get a book to Michelle Obama through a personal friend of his. LiNeBrEaKThe 346-page hardback, released last year, covers everything from the difference between a uranium bomb, a plutonium bomb and a hydrogen bomb to solar power to space and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"What I've done is taken physics and eliminated everything that isn't urgently important,'' he said from his Berkeley home.LiNeBrEaKMuller's book is not political, and he openly admits he sent a copy to people who work with former Republican presidential nominee John McCain before Obama won the election.LiNeBrEaK"Physics is nonpartisan, and I think that it's really important to realize that physics is nonpolitical," said the 65-year-old South Bronx native who came to Berkeley in 1964.LiNeBrEaKMuller said there are topics in his book that will enable the president to act quickly and wisely in the event of a terrorist attack or a nuclear bombing.LiNeBrEaKMuller explains in his book that the country likely will be highly dependent on fossil fuels for many generations and that there are no easy answers to global warming.LiNeBrEaKMuller said his book can lead the president through a wealth of conflicting information about a bevy of subjects, which if not understood could lead to "solutions" that will actually make things worse.LiNeBrEaK"The president can't just be told that a nuke in the hands of North Korea is a big danger," he said. "The president must understand what a big danger it is."LiNeBrEaKMuller said there are many valuable lessons for Obama   or any leader   in his book.LiNeBrEaK"We live in a high-tech world, and many of the decisions we face on an individual level and on the presidential level have high-tech components. If you are talking about alternative energy, you need to understand coal, clean coal, nukes, solar and geothermal energy.LiNeBrEaK"If you are going to be the leader of the country, you can't depend on simply picking science advisers to tell you what to do. Decisions (about alternative energy) can't be based on science alone. They have to be based on science, economics and business and even on issues regarding diplomacy," said Muller.LiNeBrEaKMuller teaches a class called "physics for future presidents" at UC Berkeley and used his wildly popular course (there are 512 students enrolled and a waiting list) as a blueprint in his writing.LiNeBrEaK"We talk about the physics of energy, we do a lot on nukes, we learn about Hiroshima and nuclear power, then I talk about space," said Muller, who has been teaching at UC Berkeley since 1974 and became a professor in 1980.LiNeBrEaKAbout half of those in his class are freshman, and many come to the class hating physics or being afraid of it, Muller said.LiNeBrEaK"I regard my students as being courageous," he said. "They are taking the course even though they dread physics."LiNeBrEaKIn his attempt to get his book into Obama's hands, Muller asked a friend (he won't say who because he fears his pal will be besieged with requests to pass on other books) who knows Michelle Obama to get her to slip it to her husband. He said he is hopeful Obama will see the book and maybe even read it.LiNeBrEaK"I suspect (Michelle Obama) will give it to him, but I don't know how to evaluate the promises of friends of wives of presidents," he said.LiNeBrEaKMuller said he also sent the book to Obama's science advisers, major fundraisers and consultants. Actually, he always sends two books   one copy for the person to pass on to Obama and one for the person to keep.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to teaching and writing, Muller gives about 50 lectures a year around the country, and said he's never found a "nonresponsive group" to the subject matter in his book. LiNeBrEaK"I think people are refreshed that they can't tell my politics," he said. "I was delighted when I got reviews from the Huffington Post and the National Review (around the same time). I was quite pleased with the Review that they said that a Berkeley professor could be so reasonable."LiNeBrEaKKristin Bender covers Berkeley. Reach her at www.ibabuzz.com/outtakes.

Daily Camera (Boulder, Colorado)  	January 19, 2009 Monday 	CU, OSMP to battle invasive plants on the plains  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	490 words  	Jan. 19--BOULDER, Colo. -- With the help of a $500,000 federal grant, a team of Front Range researchers is hoping to find new ways to deal with non-native plant species on the warmer, drier high plains. LiNeBrEaKUniversity of Colorado professor Timothy Seastedt received the grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to create a project focused on invasive plant species in the Boulder region. The research, modeling and outreach effort will try to find new and cost-effective methods for addressing plant problems in an environment that is seeing dramatic climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Things are hitting the fan in terms of environmental changes and their impacts on native plants," said Seastedt, an ecology professor and fellow at CU's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. "A number of invasive plant species have become better adapted for some of these altered Great Plains ecosystems than dominant native species."LiNeBrEaKThe program will focus on three species: dalmation toadflax, Canada thistle and cheatgrass. Those species are specifically threatening the conservation goals of Boulder's Open Space and Mountain Parks, which is partnering with CU for the program.LiNeBrEaKSeastedt has had success before in combating the influx of non-native species. In the late 1990s he and his colleagues successfully controlled knapweed, which was taking over some Boulder County grasslands. They used a species of weevil to consume knapweed seeds and foliage, and plan on using other insects for this project.LiNeBrEaKBut there will be more challenges now, partially because of climate change. Seastedt said he has seen some "annuals" become more vibrant in the last few decades because of longer growing seasons and less moisture. Those species have also become particularly adept at filling "vacuums" created by weed-control methods used in the past.LiNeBrEaKThe annuals, such as stork's bill, have pushed out species that have dominated the plains ecosystem. So part of the project will be finding a balance between non-natives that are detrimental and some that may be positive.LiNeBrEaKSeastedt and his team will do a large part of their research on OSMP land, thanks to the partnership between the university and the city. The partners are also hoping to use each other to help get kids interested in plants.LiNeBrEaK"It is harder to get people's attention about plants. They usually say, 'Let's talk about bears. Let's talk about lions,'" said Steve Mertz, spokesperson and outreach coordinator for OSMP.LiNeBrEaK"But Professor Seastedt has an excitement about it that really makes it come alive."

The Denver Post 	January 19, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Our romance with a '57 Chevy  	A SECTION; Pg. A-27  	685 words  	The fins, long, sleek and ending in a sharp-angled sideways "7" pointing toward the ground, defined this car. My older brother's '57 Chevy was a cherry red jewel posing in front of our house. It was the coolest coupe yet in those days of automobile architecture that changed each year like fall dress fashions.LiNeBrEaKIt was an era that underscored Veblen's conspicuous consumption, a socio-economic phenomenon that epitomized capitalism and the financial well-being it could produce if only Americans would just buy, baby, buy. LiNeBrEaKWe did, especially cars - one a year was how it was done then.LiNeBrEaKA recent story on National Public Radio told of a longtime San Francisco dealership that had stopped selling new Chevrolets altogether and was converting to a used-car outlet. Besides describing the pain of firing 45 long-time employees, the dealership spokesman reminisced about learning to drive his first Chevrolet at the age of 12, taught by his grandfather on the dealership lot. He said that while he would no longer sell new Chevrolets, he would continue to drive them exclusively.LiNeBrEaKThat sort of brand loyalty was nurtured by advertising tied to appeals to patriotism that branded not only an automobile but a lifestyle. Remember Dinah Shore's anthem to see the USA in your Chevrolet because America's the greatest land of all?LiNeBrEaKWe were a Chevrolet family. My mother always bought her cars from a West Denver Chevrolet salesman she had dealt with for nearly two decades. My first car was a used, olive green, four-door 1951 Chevrolet that I fueled at a self-serve station where a dollar's worth of tokens filled a glass container nearly to the four-gallon mark. I dispensed the gas into my tank and then did what Dinah implored.LiNeBrEaKLike Kerouac's car-crazed Neal Cassady, I drove the streets of Denver, around Sloan's Lake, up and down Colfax Avenue into Bear Creek Canyon and Evergreen, to the top of Lookout Mountain.LiNeBrEaKThat California dealership's market-driven decision is but the latest pang in a painful divorce in the century-long romance between Americans and automobiles they invented. The romance clich&eacute; is apt; novels have been penned and films produced adoring the car and the open road.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's multibillion-dollar loan to the industry seems more of a last-ditch counseling effort to prolong this doomed relationship, which has been on the skids for the last three decades, than the long-term solution the carmakers desperately need.LiNeBrEaKCar consumerism has detoured into another direction.

The Denver Post 	January 19, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Guest Commentary Our romance with a '57 Chevy  	Pg. A-27  	685 words  	The fins, long, sleek and ending in a sharp-angled sideways "7" pointing toward the ground, defined this car. My older brother's '57 Chevy was a cherry red jewel posing in front of our house. It was the coolest coupe yet in those days of automobile architecture that changed each year like fall dress fashions.LiNeBrEaKIt was an era that underscored Veblen's conspicuous consumption, a socio-economic phenomenon that epitomized capitalism and the financial well-being it could produce if only Americans would just buy, baby, buy. LiNeBrEaKWe did, especially cars - one a year was how it was done then.LiNeBrEaKA recent story on National Public Radio told of a longtime San Francisco dealership that had stopped selling new Chevrolets altogether and was converting to a used-car outlet. Besides describing the pain of firing 45 long-time employees, the dealership spokesman reminisced about learning to drive his first Chevrolet at the age of 12, taught by his grandfather on the dealership lot. He said that while he would no longer sell new Chevrolets, he would continue to drive them exclusively.LiNeBrEaKThat sort of brand loyalty was nurtured by advertising tied to appeals to patriotism that branded not only an automobile but a lifestyle. Remember Dinah Shore's anthem to see the USA in your Chevrolet because America's the greatest land of all?LiNeBrEaKWe were a Chevrolet family. My mother always bought her cars from a West Denver Chevrolet salesman she had dealt with for nearly two decades. My first car was a used, olive green, four-door 1951 Chevrolet that I fueled at a self-serve station where a dollar's worth of tokens filled a glass container nearly to the four-gallon mark. I dispensed the gas into my tank and then did what Dinah implored.LiNeBrEaKLike Kerouac's car-crazed Neal Cassady, I drove the streets of Denver, around Sloan's Lake, up and down Colfax Avenue into Bear Creek Canyon and Evergreen, to the top of Lookout Mountain.LiNeBrEaKThat California dealership's market-driven decision is but the latest pang in a painful divorce in the century-long romance between Americans and automobiles they invented. The romance clich&eacute; is apt; novels have been penned and films produced adoring the car and the open road.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's multibillion-dollar loan to the industry seems more of a last-ditch counseling effort to prolong this doomed relationship, which has been on the skids for the last three decades, than the long-term solution the carmakers desperately need.LiNeBrEaKCar consumerism has detoured into another direction. Asian and European manufacturers, encouraged by high gas prices and angst over carbon-fueled global warming, long ago steered the automobile conversation away from mag wheels and four-barrel carbs toward long warranties, controlled emissions, fuel efficiency, hybrids and voltage.LiNeBrEaKSimply, Americans stopped wanting what the American car dealers were selling. Because of their stubborn insistence on pushing the fuel-hungry, power-boasting behemoths of yore, the domestic manufacturers are experiencing the economic consequences of a pass&eacute; business strategy based primarily, like the elements of a failed marriage, on looks and status.LiNeBrEaKIt was a blast, in those days of my Denver driving youth, hanging dice from the rear-view mirror, dangling arms out the rolled down window that let in a summer breeze, blaring KIMN radio's electric guitars on car speakers and gunning the engine as we shifted our four-on- the-floor down 16th Street on Friday nights.

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	January 19, 2009 Monday 	On road, battling climate change  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	503 words  	Jan. 19--MUMBAI -- It was their overwhelming passion for climate conservation that brought Caroline Howe (23), a Mechanical and Environmental Engineering graduate from Yale College, and Alexis Ringwald (25), a Masters in Environmental Management from Yale University, together in India. LiNeBrEaKThe duo is responsible for orchestrating the Indian Climate Solutions Road Tour, which was flagged off in Chennai on January 3 and will conclude in Delhi on February 5. The team will cover 3,500 km, visiting prominent college and university campuses in the cities they will pass through and make rural visits to document prevailing climate solutions in India.LiNeBrEaKKartikeya Singh, the    ounded and setup a solar company, Valence Energy, in New Delhi. Her first project with her solar company looks at solar luxury homes in Hyderabad.LiNeBrEaKThe 20-member road trip team, including solar-powered American band, Solar Punch, was commissioned three solar plug-in electric Reva vehicles by the CEO of Reva, Chetan Maini, who believed theirs was a worthy cause.LiNeBrEaKThis young group of environmental activists completed 2,000-km on driving into Mumbai on Saturday in their six alternatively fuelled vehicles.LiNeBrEaK"Ours is a dual purpose. The first is to document solutions to climate change in India. We have already witnessed biogas installations in rural India, rainwater harvesting in Chennai, organic farming in Anantapur and luxury solar homes in Hyderabad. Our second purpose involves climate leadership trainings, in which we train students and young professionals to take leadership on climate solutions in their own campuses and communities," said Ringwald, who has interned with Nobel laureate Dr Rajendra K. Pachauri for her research on renewable energy trends in India.LiNeBrEaKOver the week, the group will meet youth from several city colleges, take an eco-tour of the city and host a Climate Leadership Training session at Mumbai University's Fort campus.LiNeBrEaKDeeply involved in the climate youth movement in India, Howe, the climate solutions co-ordinator, has also been tracking the emerging global youth movements to create a network to share ideas and solutions globally. "Young people in India are already aware of climate change. It's now time for action. The tour intends to create, communicate and celebrate climate solutions."LiNeBrEaKMembers of IYCN in different cities have helped the road tour team in setting up discussions, leadership summits and events.LiNeBrEaK"I've realised that the youth in India are angry about the climate crisis but don't know how to act on this anger," said 22-year-old Ruchi Jain, the project co-ordinator in Mumbai.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 19, 2009 Monday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Energy in balance;  Conservation, new supplies needed for security. 	B; Pg. 8  	404 words  	SOMEWHERE between outgoing Vice President Dick Cheney's dismissal of conservation as a mere "personal virtue" and unrealistic demands by some environmental advocates to shut down the oil and gas industry tomorrow, this country must find consensus on energy. Concerns over global warming and wallet-busting flirtations with $4 gas prices tell us unmistakably that our times require balanced, workable energy policy. The status quo won't cut it. LiNeBrEaKIf Senate confirmation testimony by Steven Chu, Barack Obama's nominee for energy secretary, is any indication, balance and workability are the incoming administration's energy priorities. This should be greeted with relief by interested observers in the energy industry across our city. It should also encourage oil and gas interests to get more comfortable with the trade-offs likely to shape the coming energy policy mix.LiNeBrEaKOne high-profile Houstonian who evidently has is ConocoPhillips head James Mulva. Speaking in Washington last week, Mulva called for the energy industry and environmentalists alike to compromise to achieve more balanced policies.LiNeBrEaKMulva is a member of the United States Climate Action Partnership, a high-level coalition that has offered a useful blueprint for new policy. The ConocoPhillips CEO favors a combination of increased domestic oil and gas production, alternative energy, a boost in conservation efforts and an increased focus on reducing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThis thinking is in line with what Chu had told senators in confirmation hearings earlier in the week. The Nobel Laureate physicist rightly acknowledged the place of new nuclear plants, clean coal technology and some offshore drilling in a comprehensive energy bill. He also properly emphasized the central place conservation will have in helping achieve energy independence. "More efficient use of energy in the United States is the one big factor that can most help us decrease our dependence on foreign oil," Chu told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaKOne area where oil and gas folks are right to insist on more specificity is on expanding offshore drilling. It isn't clear where he stands on opening up new areas for drilling. Chu says we can't drill our way to energy independence, which is true, but beside the point. Achieving relief from oil price spikes relating to global demand requires tapping resources that could bring a cushion of up to 1 million barrels per day.

Bush's failure to prevent the devastating attacks of 9/11, despite ample and explicit warnings. An unnecessary war, justified by lies and fear-mongering, that killed more than 4,000 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis. A country devastated and plunged into civil war and with millions of refugees driven from their homes.  LiNeBrEaKNonexistent WMDs. Nonexistent ties with al-Qaida. Distortion and manipulation of intelligence. "Mission Accomplished." Abu Ghraib. Gross violations of human rights, in direct violation of the Geneva Convention, including torture, "enhanced interrogation techniques," indefinite detentions, "special renditions," and other inhumane and degrading treatment of prisoners. Illegal, warrantless wiretapping and spying on innocent American citizens. Cover-ups and retaliation against critics. Stigmatizing critics as "unpatriotic" and saying that they "hurt the troops," while warehousing seriously injured veterans in squalid conditions. Failure to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. Callousness and fecklessness as a major American city is devastated by a natural disaster. Appointing political hacks and inept "Brownies" to head important government agencies. Politicizing the Department of Justice and turning it into a gang of ideologically pure functionaries. Thwarting checks and balances on executive power. Nullifying laws with signing statements. Squandering billions of taxpayer dollars on "faith-based initiatives," that is, fundamentalist evangelism. Gutting federal regulatory agencies by appointing industry hacks and lobbyists to head those agencies. Obscuring, obstructing and censoring science when its finding conflicted with ideology. Vetoing SCHIP health insurance for children. Doing nothing to address global warming. Promotion of worthless "abstinence only" sex-education programs. Thwarting vital stem-cell research. Gutting environmental rules and regulations. Unswerving loyalty to "his base"- the "haves and the have mores." A total failure of leadership, leading to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Spin, spin and more spin.LiNeBrEaKJan. 20, 2009: The nightmare ends. The recovery begins.LiNeBrEaK- KEITH M. PARSONS, FriendswoodLiNeBrEaKBush kept pledgeLiNeBrEaKas our nation looks forward with anticipation to Barack Obama's administration on Tuesday, many also are reflecting on President Bush's presidency. After 9/11, Bush pledged his highest priority to protecting our nation from terrorist attacks. Many questioned the Iraq war, the interrogation of captured terrorists and listening to phone conversations of suspected terrorists. However, no one can question the results of these actions. Terrorist plots have been foiled, and, to our great surprise, America has not been attacked again.LiNeBrEaKAll Americans should give Bush our sincerest thanks and gratitude for keeping us safe and saving untold American lives. He has kept his pledge - mission accomplished.LiNeBrEaKLet us hope that President-elect Barack Obama will follow Bush's example and exhibit the courage to put America first even at the cost of political gain and personal popularity. When the myopic bias of today's extremism fades under the revealing light of honest historical perspective, Bush will no doubt be judged to have been a very good president.LiNeBrEaK- JOHNNIE RUTLEDGE, BrenhamLiNeBrEaKInspiring newsLiNeBrEaKIt is fitting and gratifying that the actions of all of the US Airways Flight 1549 heroes stole the thunder of the farewell address of the anything-but-heroic President George W. Bush on Thursday. I shall derive inspiration from the crew, passengers and rescuers of this seemingly doomed flight, not from any action of our out- going "leader."LiNeBrEaK- OREN M.

I run a small company, and I know the problems I have daily. The president has the problems of the whole world. It doesn't matter who you are or the color of your skin. It's still the same.LiNeBrEaK- CARL J. SCHIRO, HoustonLiNeBrEaKLet's build planes like thatLiNeBrEaKREGARDING Friday's Page One article "FIRST A TAKEOFF, THEN A 'MIRACLE' / EXPLOSION: Witnesses say birds may have caused N.Y. jet crash": Besides the professional work of the pilots and crew, Americans might want to ask themselves why an Airbus made by the French is equipped with a mechanism to seal all the doors/openings on the plane, enabling it to float for a period of time. Strangely, our profit-oriented U.S. companies often feel it is not cost effective and do not provide all our planes with this capability. There were 155 lives preserved for all their families and our nation. It seems very cost effective to me.LiNeBrEaK- NANCY WILLIAMS, KatyLiNeBrEaKA doctor's advice on fluLiNeBrEaKIn response to the recent Chronicle article regarding recent reports of influenza strain resistance to Tamiflu, I wanted to take the opportunity to reinforce the importance of annual influenza vaccination with your readers. (Please see "NEW STRAIN OF FLU HITS AREA / CDC advises combined drugs to treat children," Page One, Jan. 9.)LiNeBrEaKWorking at Texas Children's Hospital, I see firsthand how dangerous the influenza virus can be for my patients, especially for the ones at increased risk for serious complications (such as those with chronic medical conditions like asthma). I emphasize to parents the best way to help prevent the spread of influenza is through an annual vaccination and encourage the entire family and all close contacts to get immunized.LiNeBrEaKI have joined with the American Lung Association's Faces of Influenza educational initiative. This campaign is designed to help our community put a "face" on this serious disease and recognize the importance of annual influenza immunization for themselves and their loved ones.LiNeBrEaKThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than four out of five individuals should get vaccinated against influenza this year. In Houston, on average, between 97,681 and 390,726 people will suffer from influenza.LiNeBrEaKThe flu season usually peaks in February or March, so there is still time for individuals to get vaccinated if they have not yet done so this season. I speak for my profession and encourage all community members to get immunized this year.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	EDITORIAL: Radical agenda  	A; Pg. 19A  	419 words  	Carol Browner, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency under Bill Clinton, is the latest Clinton-era retread to resurface in the Barack Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKSkeptics may be excused if they start to wonder whether the motto for this administration should be not so much "change" as the title of a 1976 Firesign Theatre compilation album: "Forward, Into the Past." LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, because Mr. Obama has asked Ms. Browner to serve as his "assistant to the president for energy and climate" (already dubbed "Climate Czarina"), which is not an official Cabinet post, there will be no Senate confirmation hearings.LiNeBrEaKThat's too bad, because it would be nice to hear Ms. Browner answer a few questions raised by Doug Bandow's column in the Jan. 12 American Spectator, headlined "Carol Browner a Socialist?" which itself draws on a piece in last week's Washington Examiner.LiNeBrEaK"There's a tendency of conservatives to carelessly toss about the 'S' word," Mr. Bandow acknowledges. "However, as the Washington Examiner pointed out last week (and the Washington Times mentioned today), Carol Browner really is a socialist. ... Reports the Examiner:LiNeBrEaK"'Browner is a member of the Commission for a Sustainable World Society (CSWS), which is a formal organ of the Socialist International. ... The Socialist International is no group of woolly-headed idealists. It is an influential assembly of officials from across the international community whose official Statement of Principles describes an agenda of gaining and exercising government power based on socialist concepts. ...LiNeBrEaK"'At the Congress of the Socialist International held last June 30-July 2, the CSWS officially resolved that "market solutions alone are insufficient and will not provide the financial support and resources necessary to achieve the required combination of deep emission reduction, adaptation to already changing climate conditions, energy security and equitable and environmentally sound economic development. By appointing Browner to a White House post, Obama has at the least implicitly endorsed an utterly radical socialist agenda for his administration's environmental policy. ...'LiNeBrEaK"The best part," Mr. Bandow concludes, "is that Browner obviously is embarrassed by the connection, since someone has engaged in a bit of Stalinist air-brushing of history by eliminating her picture and bio from the socialist Web site."LiNeBrEaKDid we say "Forward, Into the Past"? Perhaps we were thinking of an earlier Firesign Theatre classic, from 1971:LiNeBrEaK"We're All Bozos on This Bus."

The New York Post 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	A PREZ POISED TO LEAD A US GREEN REVOLUTION  	All Editions; Pg. 22  	1032 words  	THE time is ripe for a green revolution - and President-elect Obama is poised to lead America's Declaration of Energy Independence.  LiNeBrEaK"If climate change and our dependence on foreign oil are left unaddressed, we will continue to weaken our economy and threaten our national security," Obama told the nation's governors during a recent green conference.  LiNeBrEaK"Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response."   LiNeBrEaKObama is laying the foundation to wean America off its addiction to fossil fuels from the Middle East. He's already talked about funding "green jobs" during the economic downturn.  LiNeBrEaK"His greatest opportunity is to reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve national security and economic security," said lobbyist Eric Burgeson, a former top Energy Department official.  LiNeBrEaK"Obama has got some good opportunities before him to change the game on how this country uses and produces energy," he said.  LiNeBrEaKAmericans were angry when gas at the pump skyrocketed to $4 a gallon over the summer, and they even backed offshore domestic oil-drilling as part of an effort to reduce reliance on foreign petroleum.  LiNeBrEaKPrices have since plummeted to under $2 with the recession, but motorists realize they're hostage to price fluctuations because the US gets most of its oil from foreign sources, including countries that finance and back terrorism.  LiNeBrEaKObama and Congress can't afford to wait, many argue, or America will lose out on clean energy jobs in the new economy. "The Chinese are building windmills and building wind turbines and shipping them here," notes Michael Allegretti, government-relations director of the Climate Group.  LiNeBrEaK"[Obama] won't let this historic opportunity go to the wayside. There are an enormous amount of opportunities on the table," Allegretti said.  LiNeBrEaKAlternative-power companies (wind, solar and biofuels) see Obama as the catalyst to ignite private investment in green technology. "People in the wind industry are excited about President Obama," said Curt Pawlisch, a Wisconsin lawyer representing windmill makers. "Obama is going to move this country in a radically different direction to create cleaner energy and jobs."  LiNeBrEaKObama proposes spending $15 billion a year to spur production in greener energy production. His stimulus plan aims to double the production of renewable energy production in three years. "We'll invest in solar, wind power and next-generation biofuels. We'll tap nuclear power while making sure it is safe. And we'll develop clean coal technologies," said the president-elect.  LiNeBrEaKObama was cool to offshore drilling during the campaign, arguing that America, with just 3 percent of the world's oil reserves, "cannot drill its way to energy security." And he hedged on expanding nuclear power as a carbon-free alternative. Where John McCain called for building 45 nuclear power plants, Obama only said boosting nuclear power is an option, if radioactive waste can be stored safely.  LiNeBrEaKHe does support other ways to increase America's energy supply, including building a massive natural-gas pipeline in Alaska. And, with pollution-spewing coal plants generating much of our electricity, Obama wants to fund research to develop technologies to make coal cleaner.  LiNeBrEaKHis green plan aims to have 10 percent of US energy production come from renewable sources by 2012, and 25 percent by 2020. And he wants to eliminate oil imports from the Middle East and Venezuela within 10 years.  LiNeBrEaKEco-friendly cars would get 150 miles per gallon by 2015 under the new White House's marching orders and new low-carbon-fuel standards. He'd provide a $7,000 tax credit to help put 1 million plug-in hybrids and other green cars on the road by then.  LiNeBrEaKBy 2013, automakers would be required to produce flex-fuel cars that can run on biofuels, such as ethanol.  LiNeBrEaKBut because of the fragile economy, the new president may not push his most controversial measures: imposing a carbon tax on power producers to dramatically cut greenhouse gases or imposing stricter rules to force cash-strapped automakers to make more fuel-efficient cars.  LiNeBrEaK"There's going to be a slowdown for sure," said Climate Group's Allegretti.  LiNeBrEaKCritics say Obama's green plan is impractical and Pollyannaish in the current economic climate.  LiNeBrEaK"We don't have the technology to do this on a large scale. Wind power is not ready yet. Solar energy is way behind. We don't have alternative energy sources of sufficient magnitude to replace 70 percent of carbon-based energies," said David Kreutzer, an energy economist at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation.  LiNeBrEaKFrank Maisano of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council agreed, saying Obama's team is underestimating Not-In-My-Back-Yard opposition even to offshore wind farms. Even if all these green alternatives were available, he said, the country lacks an electrical-grid system to move the electricity from one place to another. "People oppose wind projects, and they oppose the transmission lines that carry the wind," Maisano warned.  LiNeBrEaKThe recession has halted green projects, he added: "I have a wind developer in Maryland who has a permit for a wind project. But he can't get the financing to do it."  LiNeBrEaKObama insists he's not tilting at windmills - but will actually build them.  LiNeBrEaKHis stimulus package includes funding to upgrade the grid system and electrical lines "to protect our power sources from blackout or attack, and deliver clean, alternative forms of energy to every corner of our nation."  LiNeBrEaKHe's also focusing on ways to improve energy efficiency and cut consumption - which is easier and less costly than expanding the energy supply. Aside from building a new grid, the conservation measures include modernizing buildings and insulating homes.  LiNeBrEaK"Obama has the potential to be a green president, but he will have to be pushed and prodded by people who want a green revolution," said Larry Shapiro, program director of the Rockefeller Foundation, which funds green initiatives.

The New York Times 	January 19, 2009 Monday   Late Edition - Final	U.A.E. 123  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 24  	473 words  	The United Arab Emirates has bested other oil-rich Persian Gulf countries by becoming the first to conclude a legally binding nuclear cooperation agreement with the Bush administration. It deserves even greater congratulations for forswearing uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing. Those are the key processes for making fuel for nuclear reactors -- or nuclear weapons.  LiNeBrEaK  Many countries have these agreements -- known in the business as 123's -- with Washington, which allow them to buy American nuclear reactors and fuel. But none have made that important concession. LiNeBrEaK  Under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, all members in good standing have the right to make their own fuel. But the temptations are considerable and the technology far too easy to divert (see Iran). LiNeBrEaK  That is why the U.A.E's choice is so especially important, and why other nuclear suppliers should be encouraging their clients to make the same choice. LiNeBrEaK  Nuclear energy is one way to address climate change, and developing countries -- that agree to international rules for inspections -- must have the same access to nuclear technology as the developed world.LiNeBrEaK  President Bush promoted nuclear energy with gusto but notably failed to develop a strategy to ensure that a proliferation of nuclear power would not also lead to a proliferation of nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama and the new Congress must do better.LiNeBrEaK  More than 25 nations plan to build nuclear power plants for the first time. That includes Saudi Arabia, which is negotiating its own cooperation deal with Washington. LiNeBrEaK  Many of these countries say they must diversify to meet future energy needs. And the major nuclear suppliers are only too eager to compete for their business.LiNeBrEaK  Too often these countries ignore serious questions about whether more nuclear plants will pose new safety and waste disposal hazards, and whether their clients' sudden enthusiasm is driven less by concerns about global warming or declining oil reserves and more by rising fears of Iran's nuclear ambitions and appetites for their own weapons programs.LiNeBrEaK  Congress must review the U.A.E. deal before it is finalized. Some lawmakers have raised worrisome questions about goods with military or potential nuclear- related uses moving through Dubai, one of the emirates, to Iran. Officials there must explain how they plan to strengthen their export controls. If not, Congress may have to slow its approval or place tougher restrictions on the 123 agreement until it is sure that American technology sold to the U.A.E. cannot be diverted.LiNeBrEaK  There is also something unsettling about the slick lobbying campaign the U.A.E. has mounted to push the deal through quickly.LiNeBrEaK  The agreement sets an important and welcome new standard. But Congress must exercise due diligence with this agreement and all of the others that will follow.	http://www.nytimes.com  	NUCLEAR WEAPONS (92%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); ARMS CONTROL and DISARMAMENT (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); MILITARY WEAPONS (89%); POWER PLANTS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (78%); LEGISLATORS (75%); LOBBYING (73%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (73%); EXPORT TRADE (73%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); APPROVALS (60%); EXPORT CONTROLS (50%)  			GEORGE W BUSH (55%); BARACK OBAMA (54%)  	INDIAN OCEAN (90%); DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (79%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (96%); UNITED STATES (96%); IRAN (93%); GULF STATES (91%); SAUDI ARABIA (79%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Editorial  	Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   																
The New York Times 	January 19, 2009 Monday  Correction Appended  	Energy Inefficient  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 24  	588 words  	Late Edition - FinalLiNeBrEaKFrom plug-in cars to carbon capture to wind farms linked to ''intelligent'' power grids, many of the solutions pitched to restructure the country's energy system and confront global warming rely on a faith in high tech: we expect, or at least hope, that an Apollo project, the energy equivalent of the dot.com revolution or some other burst of creative genius will engineer the problem away.LiNeBrEaK  Obviously, game-changing technologies will play a big role in cutting America's consumption of fossil fuels. They will also be essential to achieving the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that most scientists think will be necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. But as it frames its strategy to deal with both problems, the Obama administration cannot overlook the low-hanging fruit -- the gains to be had from making existing technologies more efficient.  LiNeBrEaK  The plain truth is that the United States is an inefficient user of energy. For each dollar of economic product, the United States spews more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than 75 of 107 countries tracked in the indicators of the International Energy Agency. Those doing better include not only cutting-edge nations like Japan but low-tech countries like Thailand and Mexico.LiNeBrEaK  True, energy efficiency has improved, especially in states like California. But American drivers, households and businesses still use more energy than those in most other rich countries to do the same thing. The United States spends more energy to produce a ton of cement clinker than Canada, Mexico and even China. It is one of the most energy-intensive makers of pulp and paper, emitting more than three times as much carbon dioxide per ton as Brazil and twice as much as South Korea. LiNeBrEaK  Per-capita carbon dioxide emissions by households in the United States and Canada are the highest in the world -- in part because of bigger homes. And the energy efficiency of electricity production from fossil fuels is lower in the United States than in most rich countries and some poor ones, mainly because of the higher share of coal in the mix. LiNeBrEaK  Transportation tells the same story. The United States uses the most energy per passenger mile among the 18 rich economies surveyed by the energy agency. In 2006, the American auto fleet used, on average, a little less than five gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. The Irish went the same distance with under four gallons, the Italians with less than three, basically because they use smaller cars that get better mileage.LiNeBrEaK  The Union of Concerned Scientists points out that switching from an S.U.V. that gets 14 miles per gallon to one that gets 16 would save the same amount of fuel as swapping a 35-mile-a-gallon car for a 51-m.p.g. new generation gas-sipper. This is not an argument for more S.U.V.'s. It simply shows that we can wring savings from modest efficiency gains in products we already use. LiNeBrEaK  A study by McKinsey and Company last year argued that most of the carbon abatement needed between now and 2030 could be achieved with existing technologies, things like insulating homes, improving fuel efficiency, and switching to concentrated laundry detergents to reduce packaging and transport costs. Merely improving transmissions would vastly increase fuel economy. LiNeBrEaK  A quantum jump in energy efficiency will still require political leadership. Cheap energy has kept America from making the necessary investments. Yet they must be made; neither the country nor the atmosphere can wait for high tech to ride to the rescue. 	http://www.nytimes.com  	ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (91%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); POWER PLANTS (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); PAPER and PACKAGING (64%)  	TON AS (65%)  	INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY (55%)  	BARACK OBAMA (56%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%); MEXICO (92%); NORTH AMERICA (92%); CANADA (92%); THAILAND (55%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Editorial  	Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   									January 24, 2009  	An editorial on Monday placed the United States incorrectly on a list of carbon dioxide emitters.

The New York Times 	January 19, 2009 Monday   Late Edition - Final	Fighting for Recognition: 'Tyson' at Sundance  	Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 1  	919 words  	The Sundance Film Festival always has much on its plate. And one of the jobs served up this year involves feeding Mike Tyson.LiNeBrEaK  On Saturday night, John Besh, the New Orleans restaurateur, was preparing to do exactly that at Bon Appetit's temporary supper club, which is perched on a slight rise above the party tents on Main Street here.LiNeBrEaK  The menu was built around Kobe beef short ribs  stripped from the bone and cooked for 26 hours at precisely 141 degrees. ''Since we're cooking for Mike Tyson, I wanted big blows for the palate but also some food for the soul,'' Mr. Besh said, shortly before pouring the soupe de poisson with blue crab and tapioca. LiNeBrEaK  The idea is not so much to sate the appetite of Mr. Tyson, a 42-year-old former boxer who has been in and out of jail, as to create a bit of theater around a documentary film about him.LiNeBrEaK  The movie, ''Tyson,'' directed by James Toback, screened earlier on Saturday to a packed house of about 450 at a the town library, where the film was screened. Mr. Tyson spoke briefly afterward, but the real event was simply his presence.LiNeBrEaK  ''Mike Tyson's coming in!'' Pierce Brosnan said as he left the supper club from an earlier dinner honoring his own movie, ''The Greatest,'' shortly before Mr. Tyson walked in through a crowd of gawkers. LiNeBrEaK  The new film tries mightily to find a redemption story in Mr. Tyson's rise, fall and reconciliation with his demons. ''The regeneration, reconstruction and rehabilitation of a great spirit is always possible,'' Mr. Toback said, summing up his movie's moral during cocktail hour at the supper club. LiNeBrEaK  Still, Mr. Tyson appears to remain more spectacle than morality tale, which is not altogether a bad thing as far as Sundance is concerned.LiNeBrEaK  One of the festival's jobs, bluntly put, is to sell documentaries. In one of the ''Storytime'' memory reels attached to the beginning of each screening here, Robert Redford, the festival's patriarch, muses of documentaries: ''What if we use the festival to promote them on an equal footing with theatrical films?''LiNeBrEaK  The key word is promote, and it is not necessarily a dirty one. Despite a supposed marketplace surge that came with the runaway success of Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' in 2004, documentaries generally remain a poor relation at the box office.LiNeBrEaK  Many of the art form's bigger box-office hits have been political. Those include Mr. Moore's ''Sicko'' and ''Bowling for Columbine,'' as well as Davis Guggenheim's ''Inconvenient Truth,'' the global warming film with Al Gore.LiNeBrEaK  Every once in a while a nonpolitical specimen breaks the rules by doing as well as any other kind of feature film. The last such example was ''March of the Penguins,'' which took in $77 million at the domestic box office after Warner Independent Pictures released it in 2005.LiNeBrEaK  But the record has been much spottier for most documentaries. Sony Pictures Classics, which only days ago acquired rights to distribute ''Tyson,'' in the last couple of years released ''Waltz With Bashir,'' ''Jimmy Carter, Man From Plains'' and ''My Kid Could Paint That,'' none of which has topped $1 million  at the box office, although ''Waltz With Bashir,'' which won a Golden Globe award, is still playing.LiNeBrEaK  ''Nine months ago we were thinking we weren't going to do any more documentaries,'' said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, speaking at the same reception. ''Then you see a film like this.''LiNeBrEaK  Where ''Tyson'' is concerned, Sundance has some work to do. The festival is supposed to reignite interest in a movie that's been around for a while: It has screened at a number of festivals, including Cannes, where Mr. Tyson and Mr. Toback did some heavy selling last May.LiNeBrEaK  On a large scale, Sundance is supposed to use its promotional tricks -- among them, feeding the 90 movie and media types at this dinner -- to convince people that there really is something appetizing about real-life stories told, on the whole, with fidelity to the facts.LiNeBrEaK  For Mr. Barker, the next step is to begin releasing ''Tyson'' in theaters on April 24. The plan, he said, is to cultivate both the art-house crowd and African-American viewers, aiming for a crossover hit like ''Hoop Dreams,'' a 1994 basketball documentary that took in $7. 8 million.  LiNeBrEaK  If Mr. Tyson caused excitement on Saturday night, the same sort of sizzle was in the air that morning, when several hundred festival-goers started lining up four hours early at the Har Shalom Temple's theater for a look at ''The September Issue,'' another documentary. That one follows the fashion editor Anna Wintour as she assembles the September 2007 issue of Vogue magazine.LiNeBrEaK  Theatrical rights to ''The September Issue'' are for sale here by the Creative Artists Agency, so even Ms. Wintour, whose legendary lack of warmth is a theme in the film, had some promoting to do.LiNeBrEaK  Tucked inside a jacket edged with a big fur collar, she took questions from John Cooper, the festival's director of programming, on Saturday.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Cooper asked Ms. Wintour about the experience of watching underlings dissect her vision and decisions on screen, not always in flattering ways. ''There wasn't much in there I didn't know before,'' she said.LiNeBrEaK  ''Do you like it?'' Mr. Cooper persisted, referring to the film, which was directed by R. J. Cutler, a producer of ''The War Room,'' about Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's quite hard to look at oneself in such an intense way,'' Ms. Wintour said. But, she added, ''I'm very glad to have a record of what we do.''	http://www.nytimes.com  	FILM (90%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (90%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (89%); ARTS FESTIVALS and EXHIBITIONS (89%); FESTIVALS (89%); MOVIE REVENUES (78%); TICKET SALES (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); LIBRARIES (66%); THEATER (58%); FILM DIRECTORS (78%)  			AL GORE (50%)  	UTAH, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: Mike Tyson on Main Street in Park City, Utah, for Sundance.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	Cape Wind advances despite ploy  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 4  	524 words  	SANDWICHLiNeBrEaKTHE OPPOSITION of the wealthy and politically influential elite to the Cape Wind project is a tragedy of epic scope. Never has there been a NIMBY group that so values the view of a few that has hypocritically raised millions to stop a project so crucial to America s quest for energy independence, new jobs and the effort to curtail global warming. LiNeBrEaKUnder the pretext of a hazard to navigation, in spite of the Coast Guard finding otherwise, they had the gall to entice other willing congressional accomplices to politically interfere, at the last hour, with the responsible agencies of the government.LiNeBrEaKThe intrusion of Congressman James Oberstar, of Minnesota, and Congressman Nick Rahall, of West Virginia (coal country), by requesting a longer review of the Coast Guard s decision that the proposed wind farm poses no significant problem for marine radar, stalled yet again the permitting process just days before the release, on Friday, of the Minerals Management Service s crucial Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which strongly approved the project.LiNeBrEaKThis ploy reeks of the scandalous but failed effort by the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound and Sen. Edward Kennedy to enlist the far-off and now discredited former Sen. Ted Stevens and Congressman Don Young (the Bridge to Nowhere) of Alaska to hinder the Coast Guard decisions at that time.LiNeBrEaKWell, perhaps there is a saving grace in this move. The Obama administration is far more concerned with energy independence, jobs and global warming than the anti-science, pro-oil and coal Bush compatriots. Fortunately, Sen. Jeff Bingaman   with the support of former Sen. Pete Domenici   (both of New Mexico) of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources stepped in to urge Dirk Kempthorne, outgoing secretary of the interior, and Randall Luthi, director of the Minerals Management Service,  to complete your work on the Cape Wind project in an expeditious manner. LiNeBrEaKAfter seven years of exhaustive study, numbingly numerous public hearings and the nefarious intervention of well-funded opposition, it s time to get on with building a flagship project that will provide needed jobs and a source of clean, renewable energy that will ease our addiction to oil from foreign sources. With the Cape Wind project, New England would be the center of catalyzing a new clean-energy economy with many construction and professional employment opportunities.LiNeBrEaKIn 18 years of experience with 17 operational shallow-water offshore wind farms in Europe, there has never been a vessel collision with a wind turbine or between two shallow-draft vessels within a wind farm. Having been in a fishing vessel myself within the Nysted wind farm, between Denmark and Germany in the Baltic Sea, and observing the on-board radar, I can assure you that there is obviously no risk of misinterpretation of radar signals. In fact, the wind turbines are viewed as an aid to navigation. You can see exactly where you are. And one can see the majestic slowly rotating blades that are a source of energy from a fuel that is free and forever.LiNeBrEaKCharles Kleekamp, a retired engineer, is vice president of Clean Power Now.

B-2  	627 words  	Temperature records broken, tied in countyLiNeBrEaKHigh-temperature records for the date were broken and tied yesterday in the county, where the unseasonably warm weather experienced during the past week is expected to continue through today.LiNeBrEaKIn El Cajon, the mercury hit 87 degrees, surpassing the previous 83-degree record for Jan. 18 set in 2005, the National Weather Service said.LiNeBrEaKIn San Diego, yesterday's 81 tied the 2005 record for the date. According to records dating to 1850, 81 degrees is the highest January temperature recorded in San Diego. LiNeBrEaKOther high temperatures in the county yesterday were 88 in Escondido, 86 in Coronado, 85 in Oceanside and 84 in Encinitas, but a comparatively cool 77 in Borrego Springs.LiNeBrEaKThis is fairly typical with an offshore flow or Santa Ana conditions, said weather service meteorologist Steve Vanderburg.LiNeBrEaK"The air descends from the mountains to the coast, and the lower it descends, the warmer it gets," Vanderburg said.LiNeBrEaKThe warm weather is expected to last into tomorrow, the weather service said. More typical winter weather is expected to return by midweek, with possible rain and temperatures down to the 60s forecast by Thursday.LiNeBrEaK--L.B.LiNeBrEaKLobbyist slated to appear before Ethics CommissionLiNeBrEaKLobbyist Art Castanares is facing a hearing in March before San Diego's Ethics Commission for failing to file disclosure forms in a timely manner -- the same kind of violation for which he paid a $4,500 fine in 2007.LiNeBrEaKThe commission last week scheduled a hearing March 20 for failure by Castanares to file a disclosure form for the first quarter of last year, and for submitting the wrong form for the second quarter of last year.LiNeBrEaKCastanares has been a campaign strategist for several political candidates, including San Diego City Council President Ben Hueso, Assemblywoman Lori Saldana, Chula Vista Mayor Cheryl Cox, National City Mayor Ron Morrison and San Marcos Mayor Jim Desmond.LiNeBrEaKCastanares, a registered lobbyist with the city since 2003, attributed his latest run-in with the commission to "a paperwork problem." He said he didn't lobby during the period that a report wasn't filed, "so there's no information the public was deprived of."LiNeBrEaKCastanares said he plans to attend the hearing in March and explain the filing problems.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	It's time to rethink local food-stamp program  	LOCAL; Pg. B-2  	789 words  	The lean young man who becomes the 44th president tomorrow was, for a short time in his youth, nourished by food stamps, the relief program with roots in the Depression.LiNeBrEaKAs if we needed further proof that there should be no stigma to poverty, especially in this benighted day and age.LiNeBrEaKSan Diego County is notable, we are told, in that local participation in the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program -- that's food stamps to you and me -- is far and away the worst of any American metropolitan area. LiNeBrEaKOnly 29 percent of those eligible receive the debit card. Denver has the next lowest rate of enrollment, at 42 percent.LiNeBrEaKWhat should be the lowest-hanging fruit appears to be out of reach to the majority of San Diego's poor people.LiNeBrEaKSan Diego's poor may have more convenient options to forage for free calories. Food banks and charitable kitchens may have been more effective in these parts.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, the county's bureaucracy, encouraged to prevent fraud, could be especially forbidding in San Diego, a stronghold of conservative social values that include self-reliance.LiNeBrEaKWhatever the reason, anti-hunger champions, including San Diego Councilwoman Marti Emerald, are agitating for a higher rate of participation.LiNeBrEaKThe trendy adjective in policy circles is "smart," as in smart growth and, as recently articulated by Hillary Rodham Clinton, smart power.LiNeBrEaKMaybe the time is ripe for smarter food stamps. When the subject is the American way of eating, arguably the smartest voice on the public stage belongs to Michael Pollan, the Knight Professor of Journalism at UC Berkeley and most recently the author of "In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto."LiNeBrEaKIn an open letter to "Farmer in Chief" Barack Obama, published in The New York Times, Pollan contends that energy independence, health care and global warming are inextricably linked to agricultural reform.LiNeBrEaKBoiled down, healthful food is created by traditional farming that requires far less fossil fuel than large corn and soybean producers and generates far less pollution.LiNeBrEaKMuch of the food we buy in supermarkets and consume in fast-food restaurants, Pollan argues, is artificially cheap and as bad for the human body as it is for the environment.LiNeBrEaKAmong his prescriptions for a sustainable food economy, Pollan's view of food stamps struck me as particularly pointed.LiNeBrEaK"It makes no sense," Pollan says to Obama, "for government food-assistance dollars, intended to improve the nutritional health of at-risk Americans, to support the consumption of products we know to be unhealthful."LiNeBrEaKAs it is, government debit cards cannot be used to buy tobacco and alcohol, "so why not prohibit something like soda, which is arguably less nutritious than red wine? ... We need to stop flattering nutritionally worthless food-like substances by calling them `junk food' -- and instead make clear that such products are not in fact food of any kind."LiNeBrEaKPollan acknowledges that redefining food will be difficult in a grossly obese culture that savors cheap, fast sustenance.LiNeBrEaK"One approach would be to rule that, in order to be regarded as a food by the government, an edible substance must contain a certain minimum ratio of micronutrients per calorie of energy. At a stroke, such a definition would improve the quality of school lunch and discourage sales of unhealthful products, since typically only `food' is exempt from local sales tax." Naturally, Pollan is an ardent champion of farmers' markets, the portable bazaars of locally grown food.LiNeBrEaK"Food-stamp debit cards should double in value whenever swiped at a farmers' market," Pollan suggests.LiNeBrEaKHe also advocates an expansion of WIC, which supplements the diets of at-risk mothers and children younger than 5: "Such programs help attract farmers' markets to urban neighborhoods where access to fresh produce is often nonexistent."LiNeBrEaKSan Diego County may be behind the curve in food-stamp enrollment, but in one sense, it's ahead.LiNeBrEaKThree farmers' markets run by the San Diego County Farm Bureau -- Lakeside, Valley Center and City Heights -- either do or will accept food stamps.LiNeBrEaKThe challenge for the county, according to bureau Director Eric Larson, is keeping up with the demand. Much of San Diego County's locally grown produce is trucked to more lucrative markets in Los Angeles and Orange County.LiNeBrEaKLarson estimates that 20 million food-stamp dollars a year are left on the table because San Diego's poor do not enroll.LiNeBrEaKIt's one thing to bring up the numbers of food-stamp recipients in the county. The cratering economy will solve that anomaly, I suspect.LiNeBrEaKWhat's ultimately as important is that struggling families be nourished by the same good food the lean new president has learned to love.LiNeBrEaKLogan Jenkins:LiNeBrEaK(760) 737-7555; logan.jenkins@uniontrib.com		FOOD STAMPS (91%); FOOD CHARITIES (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (89%); NUTRITION (89%); FAST FOOD (73%); RESTAURANTS (73%); DEBIT CARDS (70%); SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (67%); SOYBEAN FARMING (65%); CRIME PREVENTION (52%); GROCERY STORES and SUPERMARKETS (50%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			BARACK OBAMA (82%); HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (54%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The San Diego Union-Tribune   	Logan Jenkins

LiNeBrEaKLast spring, Weber County made $102,000 selling carbon credits it was awarded by the Chicago Climate Exchange for reducing greenhouse gases in 2005, 2006 and 2007, said Gary Laird, the county's solid-waste manager.LiNeBrEaKLaird sold at the top of the market, when carbon credits were worth $6. 30 to $7 each. Friday on the Chicago Climate Exchange, the credits were down to $1. 95 each.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated sold about $14,000 worth at a lower $2 market rate, but is holding onto more than 88,000 credits, figuring the price will rise with demand when the government gets around to regulating greenhouse gas emissions, said Wasatch's Executive Director Nathan Rich.LiNeBrEaK"It's sure worked out neat so far," he said.LiNeBrEaKChicago Climate Exchange is one of dozens of markets that have cropped up worldwide in recent years as pressure has mounted on countries and companies to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated, which burns and puts into landfills almost all the waste in Davis County and all of Morgan County's, joined in January 2007; Weber County joined that spring.LiNeBrEaKEach had begun capturing methane natural gas generated in capped trash heaps a few years earlier, mainly to keep it from migrating and, later, exploding.LiNeBrEaKThe gas is piped to nearby power generating stations. Weber County owns its station and sells electricity to Rocky Mountain Power -- a source that gave the county a tidy $240,000 last year. Wasatch Integrated's methane goes to a plant over the fence at Hill Air Force Base. Sales last year amounted to $40,000 for Wasatch.LiNeBrEaKWhile energy and environmental activists applaud such efforts, some are not so enthusiastic about the markets, like Chicago Climate Exchange, that let those curbing emissions trade on their own good deeds.LiNeBrEaKOne, Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of the book Hell and High Water: Global Warming -- the Solution and the Politics -- and What We Should Do, calls them carbon "rip-offsets."LiNeBrEaKHe doesn't like that the Chicago Climate Exchange rewards companies or governmental agencies for past greenhouse-gas reductions.LiNeBrEaK"If I'm going to put up money, I want my money to go to a project that wouldn't otherwise happen," Romm said.LiNeBrEaKHe also believes there isn't enough scrutiny of the projects that earn the credits, and likens the market to the mortgage-backed securities market now in shambles.LiNeBrEaK"The offset business is unregulated and voluntary, and it doesn't take a genius to see unregulated markets tend to attract a lot of dubious players," said Romm, who is also editor of the Web site www.climateprogress.org . LiNeBrEaKRich disagreed.LiNeBrEaK"I've been through the verification process, and it's crazy, very detailed," he said. "If you're buying these credits, they're real."LiNeBrEaKThe Chicago Climate Exchange uses independent engineers to verify emission reductions and Wasatch, which is a full member of the exchange, also is scrutinized by auditors who verify that it is reducing emissions at its burn plant, as promised when it became a full exchange member.LiNeBrEaKWasatch agreed to reduce burn plant emissions by 6 percent by 2010.LiNeBrEaKRich also defended the market's practice of rewarding credits for past good work.LiNeBrEaK"What's wrong with rewarding people for good behavior?" he said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Wasatch didn't expect to make a bundle of money, selling carbon offset credits can help new green projects pencil out, he said.LiNeBrEaKLaird said the sale of carbon credits was part of Weber County's calculation all along.LiNeBrEaK"This was what made our project feasible," he said.LiNeBrEaKkmoulton@sltrib.com What's a carbon credit?LiNeBrEaKIt's a marketable security, traded like a corporate stock or futures contract. New markets, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, have emerged to award companies or government agencies "credits" for projects that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. They sell the credits, via the exchange, to individuals or companies that want to offset their own carbon emissions -- or to appear more "green." The value of each credit fluctuates, as in any market.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 19, 2009 Monday 	'WARS ARE UNHELPFUL - YOU SHOULD STOP THEM'  	NEWS; Pg. A10  	466 words  	Asked to write a letter to the president-elect, 7-year-old Avante Price came up with a lot of questions and a few suggestions.LiNeBrEaKFirst, though, he shared an observation. LiNeBrEaK"You are just like a big me," the boy wrote, "because I am from Chicago, and I am biracial and have curly hair."LiNeBrEaKPrice's letter and those of several other students involved in the 826 Seattle writing center will be part of a collection released later this week, letters written mostly by children who have no memory of any president but George Bush.LiNeBrEaKThe collection - titled "Have Fun Running the Country: Kids' Letters to President Obama" and published by McSweeney's - contains letters written by students at 826 centers around the country.LiNeBrEaKBarack Obama's election came as a surprise, a welcome one, to many of the children studying at the Greenwood neighborhood writing center, said Toffer Lehnherr, a programs assistant there.LiNeBrEaKStudents age 6 to 18 come to the 826 center for help with schoolwork and writing workshops.LiNeBrEaKMany are children of recent immigrants or immigrants themselves, Lehnherr said, or face adversity at home.LiNeBrEaKAsked to write letters to the soon-to-be president at a Saturday workshop, the kids jumped at the chance.LiNeBrEaK"Students were saying, 'Now I could be president,' " Lehnherr said. "You tell kids they can be anything they want when they grow up. But to show kids, to have them see this kind of barrier being broken, it's really powerful."LiNeBrEaKSome of the students' writings read like notes to a pen pal, others like more serious letters to Santa. One child requests less expensive college tuition; he has a friend who couldn't go because he couldn't pay. Others request a better economy, cheaper gas, an end to the wars most can't recall living without.LiNeBrEaK"I think you should focus on education, and global warming, and the wars," wrote Renea Harris Peterson. The 9-year-old went on to note that "wars are unhelpful - I think you should stop them, if you can."LiNeBrEaKThe kids also offered suggestions, and advice to the Obama girls.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect, one wrote, should sit down with a cool glass of water and get his bearings after the inauguration.LiNeBrEaKAnother advised Sasha and Malia on how to make friends at the girls' new school.LiNeBrEaKJory John, programs director for the 826 center in San Francisco, said the nonprofit launched the initiative in part because of the excitement so many of their students showed following the election.LiNeBrEaK"Most of these kids have only known one president all their lives," John said.LiNeBrEaK"Suddenly kids are saying they want to be president. I've worked with kids for (10) years, and I've never heard them say they want to be president."\ ON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKMore information about the organization is available at 826national.org .

St. Joseph News-Press (Missouri)  	January 19, 2009 Monday 	The light bulb dilemma: What you need to know about disposing of CFLs  	LIFESTYLE  	727 words  	Jan. 19--Congratulations! You've been doing your part to slow down global warming by switching to the new energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) -- those swirly bulbs that claim to use up to 75 percent less energy than incandescent light bulbs and last up to 10 times longer, according to the United States Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKBut before you smugly pat yourself on the back, answer this: What do you do with them when they burn out? LiNeBrEaKDon't put them with your regular recyclables, says Tim Basta, co-owner of stjoegreen, a St. Joseph curbside recycling company. Although customers regularly try to leave them in the recycling bins, he says his company can't take them because the bulbs are considered a hazardous waste.LiNeBrEaK"I was kind of shocked to be honest," Mr. Basta says about when he first learned of the situation. "They are supposed to be the greatest invention since sliced bread and then there's mercury in it."LiNeBrEaKMercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that, when put into landfills, will leach into the ground water and contaminate streams, rivers, lakes and drinking water. According to the HTR-Group, a government-certified resource recovery facility in Kaiser, Mo., 1/70th of a teaspoon of mercury can contaminate a 25-acre lake to the point that the fish in it are unsafe to eat for 50 years. Although one CFL only contains a tiny amount of mercy (an average of 4 milligrams, according to the EPA), small amounts add up and are a hazard if not disposed of properly.LiNeBrEaKDISPOSELiNeBrEaKOne option is to take your CFLs to a hazardous waste collection site. The city of St. Joseph household hazardous waste program is held twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall, says Public Works Director Bill Woody. You also can take your batteries, paint and other hazardous waste at the same time. The dates are not yet scheduled for this year, but it's always on a Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and the city advertises the date several weeks ahead of time. It's free, however, it is only open to St. Joseph resident property owners.LiNeBrEaKIt is legal to throw the bulbs in your regular trash, says Mark Conner, public information specialist with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources Hazardous Waste Program. If you do, the department recommends putting the bulb in a zipper-type plastic bag before disposal. The Environmental Protection Agency suggests two bags. Although it is legal, he says the department recommends recycling them instead. But it must be a recycling facility that handles bulbs with mercury.LiNeBrEaKRECYCLELiNeBrEaKProbably the easiest and best thing to do is to take your bulbs to Home Depot. All stores recently began accepting them for recycling at no charge as part of the Eco Options program. Simply bring unbroken bulbs to the service desk at any Home Depot. They'll take your batteries, too.LiNeBrEaKThe city of St. Joseph also will recycle them if you bring them to the landfill (not the recycling center). The cost is 50 cents per bulb (which is at cost for the city to recycle them), and anyone can bring them in. They also take other types of fluorescents for a fee. Call the landfill at 253-9764 for more information.LiNeBrEaKIf you break one, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources has a seven-step process to follow (www.dnr.mo.gov and click on Fluorescent Bulbs in the directory). Essentially, you should evacuate and ventilate the room for 15 minutes before cleaning it up. Then wear disposable gloves to pick up the broken pieces and put them in a glass jar with a metal lid or a zipper-type plastic bag. Clean the area with a wet paper towel and put the towel and the gloves in the container. Do not use a vacuum because it will spread the mercury vapor and dust throughout the room. The site also suggests that consumers may want to avoid using CFL's in bedrooms or carpeted areas frequented by infants, small children or pregnant women.LiNeBrEaKLifestyles reporter Sylvia Anderson may be reached at sylviaanderson@npgco.com		TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (92%); MATERIALS RECOVERY and RECYCLING (90%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (89%); SOLID WASTE COLLECTION (89%); WASTE MANAGEMENT and REMEDIATION SERVICES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); HAZARDOUS WASTE TREATMENT and DISPOSAL (88%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (73%); LANDFILLS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); LAKES (72%); WATER POLLUTION (72%); HOME CENTERS (66%)  		US DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (57%); CANADIAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE (54%)  		MISSOURI, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 St. Joseph News-Press   	Sylvia Anderson, St. Joseph News-Press, Mo.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 19, 2009 Monday   Final Home Edition	Inauguration is poetry in motion  	Satellite (new); Pg. D1  	343 words  	 You, created only a little lower than The angels, have crouched too long in The bruising darkness, Have lain too long Face down in ignorance. LiNeBrEaKThis verse was delivered by Maya Angelou in the inaugural poem she wrote on behalf of President Bill Clinton. Her words are especially applicable now, 16 years later. However, this time it is a new president, and a new poet.  LiNeBrEaKElizabeth Alexander has every poet's dream and nightmare composing the perfect poem, especially for an event so fraught with symbolism. LiNeBrEaKBut, if she's like Angelou, her poem will be focused on the nameless people in the crowd and beyond. And I feel so lucky to be just one of those in the crowd. LiNeBrEaKYes, I actually have a ticket to the inauguration. LiNeBrEaKI spent weeks naively daydreaming about what it would be like to huddle in the cold in Washington, D.C., when my mom finally broke the news that we were going. LiNeBrEaKNow that I've fully digested the fact, I can think about what this is actually going to entail messy crowds, frigid weather and sore feet. But I don't care. LiNeBrEaKThere should be no petty disclaimer such as the aforementioned onmy ticket. LiNeBrEaKThis kind of opportunity just doesn't come around twice in a lifetime. LiNeBrEaKBut even for those just sitting at home on the couch, this is a big deal. Never before have Americans straddled such a range of emotion: dread and hope. LiNeBrEaKEvery day there's a new headline of disaster: the economy, Iraq, Gaza, Afghanistan, global warming. &acirc;[#x20ac]&brvbar; And yet people are working for the solutions. LiNeBrEaKWhether you supported Barack Obama or not, you must want him to succeed, for America's sake. You must think that this inauguration symbolizes more than just the first African- American presidency or perhaps a new era of liberalism. LiNeBrEaKThere is the potential for this to be the starting point for a more united America, where more work is done and more problems are solved. LiNeBrEaKYes we can? Depends on where you stand. But all of us, inaugural attendees or not, will be standing on the verge of history Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKGabi Inhofe 581-8480 Booker T.

USA TODAY 	January 19, 2009 Monday   FIRST EDITION	The scientific climate is changing;  Obama vows to 'value science,' but the budget and politics play roles 	LIFE; Pg. 9B  	1562 words  	The politics of science, which has been storm-tossed for the past eight years, heads for uncharted waters with the inauguration of Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration has fought a long battle with the nation's scientific community over funding and philosophy, and great divides have formed over such issues as global warming and stem cell research. Scientists are hopeful that Obama, who has called for increased research spending, will bring a new dawn. But how realistic are their hopes? And can the nation afford to make them a reality?LiNeBrEaK"My administration will value science. We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action," Obama said at the nomination of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, a climate-change technology advocate, as the next secretary of Energy.LiNeBrEaKSays environmental scientist Donald Kennedy, Stanford University's president-emeritus: "I think we are seeing some really good first steps, appointment of people that the science community takes seriously, people who value science." LiNeBrEaKBut others sound a note of caution.LiNeBrEaK"The air of anticipation in the nation's laboratories and faculty clubs is not unfounded; the danger is that it will become excessive," writes David Goldston, a former chief of staff with the House Science Committee, in a recent Nature  magazine.LiNeBrEaK"Scientists are going to have to contain their insatiable appetite for dollars, and their tendency to see politicians as either with them or against them, for the current mood to survive much beyond inauguration," Goldston says.LiNeBrEaKThe most immediate change may be in the White House's attitude toward global warming.LiNeBrEaKObama has selected other key advisers who are strong advocates of taking action to address climate change. In addition to Chu, he picked Harvard's John Holdren, a climate and energy expert, to be his science adviser and marine biologist Jane Lubchenco as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.LiNeBrEaKObama has pledged to curb heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases by selling industries limited rights to release emissions, creating a "cap and trade" market. Cap and trade markets, such as the existing European Union Emission Trading Scheme, allow firms to buy and sell emission credits while keeping the total amount of emissions under an upper limit, or cap.LiNeBrEaKFor the average household, a cap and trade plan in which credits are sold to polluters -- and "dividend" money is returned to taxpayers -- would affect power rates, boosting annual household energy costs $809, a Resources for the Future analysis has found. But the poorest 20% of consumers would gain an average $145 through tax breaks.LiNeBrEaKStriving for balanceLiNeBrEaK"We must also take a leadership role in designing technologies that allow us to enjoy a growing, prosperous economy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050," Obama pledged during the campaign. His energy plan includes yearly weatherization of 1 million homes, $7,000 tax credits for fuel-efficient cars and putting 1 million hybrid cars on roads by 2015.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration has not capped power-plant emissions, stressing the need for voluntary agreements and technological advances to address climate change. In 2001, President Bush renounced the Kyoto Protocol, an international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions, on the grounds that it could hurt the U.S. economy and unfairly exempted China.LiNeBrEaKResearch involving human embryonic stem cells is another area that may change significantly.LiNeBrEaKIn his first televised presidential address on Aug. 9, 2001, Bush kick-started a long-running tussle with scientists by limiting funding for such research. The president allied himself with abortion opponents who are against the destruction of embryos required to harvest these stem cells. "While we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease, it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama has pledged to reverse Bush's funding limits and said they "have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations." The National Institutes of Health allocated $655 million this year for stem cell research of all sorts, so human embryonic researchers would compete against other stem cell researchers for money from that pot. Studies also focus on animal and adult stem cells.LiNeBrEaKFor the average American, embryonic stem cell treatments are still years away, say researchers such as George Daley of Children's Hospital in Boston. Nearly 1,000 lines of embryonic stems would become eligible for research funding, Daley says, if Obama follows through on his pledge. Only 22 are now allowed under the Bush rule.LiNeBrEaKBush detractors, defendersLiNeBrEaK"Anything would likely be an improvement for scientists after Bush," says physicist Robert Park of the University of Maryland-College Park, who writes an Internet roundup of science politics widely read by researchers.LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, Nobel-winning scientists campaigned against Bush. The 250,000-member Union of Concerned Scientists and the 131,000-member American Association for the Advancement of Science have criticized administration stands on science questions.LiNeBrEaKBut some, such as current White House science adviser John Marburger, say the controversy has  overshadowed actions by the Bush administration that have won favor with conservation groups, such as declaring four oceanic national monuments, which created the world's largest marine reserve.LiNeBrEaK"When you consider the real behavior, as opposed to the symbols, the past eight years have been good for science," Marburger says. He points to the administration's steady support for research funding, including the doubling of the NIH  budget to about $28 billion in 2004.LiNeBrEaKAnd Marburger notes that the Bush administration started a new research agency at the Department of Homeland Security while also proposing a doubling of money two years ago for basic research.LiNeBrEaKBut right up to the finish line, the administration is battling it out with science and health advocates in high-profile science-related scraps over mercury levels in fish, the endangered status of polar bears and air pollution limits.LiNeBrEaK"Science enjoys a very high prestige," Marburger says. "That makes it attractive to anybody who wants to sell something. Everyone who wants to sell patent medicine or a cure for climate change will claim science is on their side."LiNeBrEaKAnd Bush has other defenders. "I don't think George Bush changed the fundamental relationship between the scientific and political establishments," says Arizona State University's Daniel Sarewitz, author of Frontiers of Illusion: Science, Technology, and the Politics of Progress, who remains critical of some administration moves.LiNeBrEaK"Federal support for science is usually a function of the size of the federal discretionary budget, no more, no less," Sarewitz says. "Virtuous noises about protecting the purity of science arise from politics just like everything else."LiNeBrEaKScientific integrityLiNeBrEaKSo what exactly do the scientists want from Obama?LiNeBrEaKFor one thing, more clout. In an Oct. 30 letter to the presidential candidates, 178 organizations (ranging from AAAS to the business-oriented Council on Competitiveness to the Center for the Study of the Presidency) urged the next president to make the science adviser a Cabinet position.LiNeBrEaKThe adviser heads the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy and has a role in every scientific matter -- in today's world that is to say practically everything -- the federal government touches.LiNeBrEaKMarburger wasn't named until five months into the Bush administration and held a lower rank. Past presidential advisers, such as Clinton science adviser Neal Lane, now at Rice University, suggest this made him a less powerful figure. Lane was not the head of a federal agency but enjoyed Cabinet status.LiNeBrEaKIn past interviews, Marburger has downplayed that notion, suggesting that rank matters less than presidential access. The "real challenge" for the science adviser, he says, will be keeping federal support for science amid a budget straitjacketed by mandatory spending and tough economic times.LiNeBrEaK"President Obama does not need a high-profile science adviser," agrees physicist Richard Muller of the University of California-Berkeley, author of the just-released Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines. "He needs a low-profile one whom he trusts completely, one who knows or can quickly gather the scientific information that the president needs, and educate him so that the scientific, technical and engineering information plays its proper role in the making of the decision."LiNeBrEaKAlso important is the membership of roughly 1,000 scientific advisory committees, called the "fifth arm of government" by Harvard science policy expert Sheila Jasanoff. The administration appoints members of the committees, which can exert tremendous influence on government decisions. Perhaps the best known are the ones advising the Food and Drug Administration on whether new drugs are safe for approval to the market.LiNeBrEaKMoves by the Obama administration in naming committee members and making their deliberations public, Jasanoff suggests, will influence how scientists see the new administration: "The same virtues of good science, openness and communication are good government and good democracy."

The 250,000-member Union of Concerned Scientists and the 131,000-member American Association for the Advancement of Science have criticized administration stands on science questions.LiNeBrEaKBut some, such as current White House science adviser John Marburger, say the controversy has  overshadowed actions by the Bush administration that have won favor with conservation groups, such as declaring four oceanic national monuments, which created the world's largest marine reserve.LiNeBrEaK"When you consider the real behavior, as opposed to the symbols, the past eight years have been good for science," Marburger says. He points to the administration's steady support for research funding, including the doubling of the NIH  budget to about $28 billion in 2004.LiNeBrEaKAnd Marburger notes that the Bush administration started a new research agency at the Department of Homeland Security while also proposing a doubling of money two years ago for basic research.LiNeBrEaKBut right up to the finish line, the administration is battling it out with science and health advocates in high-profile science-related scraps over mercury levels in fish, the endangered status of polar bears and air pollution limits.LiNeBrEaK"Science enjoys a very high prestige," Marburger says. "That makes it attractive to anybody who wants to sell something. Everyone who wants to sell patent medicine or a cure for climate change will claim science is on their side."LiNeBrEaKAnd Bush has other defenders. "I don't think George Bush changed the fundamental relationship between the scientific and political establishments," says Arizona State University's Daniel Sarewitz, author of Frontiers of Illusion: Science, Technology, and the Politics of Progress, who remains critical of some administration moves.LiNeBrEaK"Federal support for science is usually a function of the size of the federal discretionary budget, no more, no less," Sarewitz says. "Virtuous noises about protecting the purity of science arise from politics just like everything else."LiNeBrEaKScientific integrityLiNeBrEaKSo what exactly do the scientists want from Obama?LiNeBrEaKFor one thing, more clout. In an Oct. 30 letter to the presidential candidates, 178 organizations (ranging from AAAS to the business-oriented Council on Competitiveness to the Center for the Study of the Presidency) urged the next president to make the science adviser a Cabinet position.LiNeBrEaKThe adviser heads the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy and has a role in every scientific matter -- in today's world that is to say practically everything -- the federal government touches.LiNeBrEaKMarburger wasn't named until five months into the Bush administration and held a lower rank. Past presidential advisers, such as Clinton science adviser Neal Lane, now at Rice University, suggest this made him a less powerful figure. Lane was not the head of a federal agency but enjoyed Cabinet status.LiNeBrEaKIn past interviews, Marburger has downplayed that notion, suggesting that rank matters less than presidential access. The "real challenge" for the science adviser, he says, will be keeping federal support for science amid a budget straitjacketed by mandatory spending and tough economic times.LiNeBrEaK"President Obama does not need a high-profile science adviser," agrees physicist Richard Muller of the University of California-Berkeley, author of the just-released Physics for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines. "He needs a low-profile one whom he trusts completely, one who knows or can quickly gather the scientific information that the president needs, and educate him so that the scientific, technical and engineering information plays its proper role in the making of the decision."LiNeBrEaKAlso important is the membership of roughly 1,000 scientific advisory committees, called the "fifth arm of government" by Harvard science policy expert Sheila Jasanoff. The administration appoints members of the committees, which can exert tremendous influence on government decisions. Perhaps the best known are the ones advising the Food and Drug Administration on whether new drugs are safe for approval to the market.LiNeBrEaKMoves by the Obama administration in naming committee members and making their deliberations public, Jasanoff suggests, will influence how scientists see the new administration: "The same virtues of good science, openness and communication are good government and good democracy."

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 19, 2009 Monday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	The south pole lies at what elevation?  	FRONT; Pg. A15  	388 words  	By The GlobalistLiNeBrEaKANTARCTICA IS THE fifth-largest continent - and is home to the coldest place on Earth. What is the elevation of the South Pole?LiNeBrEaKAnswersLiNeBrEaKA. Sea levelLiNeBrEaKB. 8,200 feetLiNeBrEaKC. 9,200 feetLiNeBrEaKD. 16,100 feetLiNeBrEaKA. Sea level is not correct.LiNeBrEaKIt is the North Pole's elevation - not the South Pole's - that lies roughly at sea level. While the South Pole is near the center of Antarctica - a landmass 1. 7 times larger than Australia - the North Pole is an ice mass in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. LiNeBrEaKIn the summer of 2008, satellite images revealed that ice in the North Pole had melted to such an extent that for the first time since the beginning of the last Ice Age, passages of open water had been created through the northwest and northeast of the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKSuch a passage, which could drastically reduce shipping times, has long been anticipated by shipping companies - but feared by scientists who see it as an example of rapid global warming.LiNeBrEaKB. 8,200 feet is not correct.LiNeBrEaKThe Antarctic ice sheet - with an average thickness of 8,200 feet - contains more than 70 percent of the world's fresh water and 90 percent of the world's ice.LiNeBrEaKScientists have discovered that climate change appears to be destabilizing vast ice sheets of western Antarctica that had previously seemed relatively protected from global warming - raising the prospect of faster-rising sea levels.LiNeBrEaKC. 9,200 feet is correct.LiNeBrEaKWhile Antarctica as a continent has widely varying elevations, the South Pole is at an elevation of 9,200 feet. Average temperatures at the South Pole run at minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit during the coldest month of August - and minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit during the warmest month of January.LiNeBrEaKVostok Station in Antarctica, with an elevation of 11,500 feet, is known as the coldest place on Earth, with an average annual temperature of minus 67 degrees Fahrenheit.LiNeBrEaKD. 16,100 feet is not correct.LiNeBrEaKThe highest mountain in Antarctica is Vinson Massif, which reaches 16,100 feet. Climbers of this peak must contend with winds of 70 mph.LiNeBrEaKVinson is one of the "Seven Summits," the tallest peaks on each continent - revered by mountain climbers. The other summits are Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, Europe's Mount Elbrus, South America's Mount Aconcagua, North America's Mount McKinley, Asia's Mount Everest and Oceania's Puncak Jaya in Indonesia.LiNeBrEaK- www.theglobalist.com		GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); MOUNTAINS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (87%); MARINE SHIPPING (77%); OCEANS (70%); SCIENCE NEWS (67%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (67%); EXTREME SPORTS (60%)  				EARTH (93%); VINSON MASSIF (92%); MOUNT KILIMANJARO (79%); MOUNT EVEREST (79%); MOUNT MCKINLEY (79%); ACONCAGUA (79%); ANDES (79%); ARCTIC OCEAN (79%); HIMALAYAS (79%); ELLSWORTH MOUNTAINS (79%); ALASKA RANGE (79%); MOUNT ELBRUS (79%) ANTARCTICA (94%); ARCTIC (92%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); AUSTRALIA (79%); ASIA (79%); EUROPE (79%); AFRICA (79%); AUSTRALIA and OCEANIA (79%); SOUTH AMERICA (50%); INDONESIA (50%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Landmark Communications, Inc.

The Washington Post 	January 19, 2009 Monday   Regional Edition	White House Directive Guides Policy on Arctic;  Bush Calls for Protecting U.S. Interests 	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	849 words  	The White House last week issued a new policy directive to guide government decisions involving the Arctic, a document that outlines an array of challenges the incoming administration will face as rising temperatures spark a surge in economic and military activity there -- along with new environmental concerns.LiNeBrEaKThe 10-page directive signed by President Bush, which took two years to write and is meant to guide 10 Cabinet departments along with the Environmental Protection Agency, updates a policy first established 14 years ago. While fairly general, the document highlights the need for the United States to assert its interests in a region that has become increasingly desirable to countries that hope to exploit its natural resources and strategic possibilities. LiNeBrEaK"The United States has broad and fundamental national security interests in the Arctic region and is prepared to operate either independently or in conjunction with other states to safeguard these interests," the directive says.LiNeBrEaKWhite House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said the administration wanted to update the Arctic policy in order to reflect the creation of new federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and because the changing climate in northern latitudes has spurred new military and commercial activity there.LiNeBrEaK"The overarching purpose of doing the directive is because of the significant changes that have taken place in the Arctic . . . and realigning policy to deal with it," he said.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program issued a report, led by the U.S. Geological Survey, concluding that the extent of Arctic summer sea ice loss over the past few decades is highly unusual compared with what has occurred over the past several thousand years. Temperature change in the Arctic has outpaced that of other regions in the Northern Hemisphere, the study said, and the trend is expected to continue.LiNeBrEaKThe new policy directive covers several key areas, including national security, energy exploration and the environment, but it does not specify whether any should take precedence over others.LiNeBrEaKThat led Jeremy Rabkin, a professor at George Mason University Law School, to comment: "It's really a list of all the things we're concerned about; that's not policy. I don't see anything here that helps you decide what gets priority."LiNeBrEaKBush administration officials have emphasized in recent years that the government lacks the necessary equipment and infrastructure to maintain a more consistent presence in the Arctic. Last summer, the U.S. Coast Guard conducted a series of test deployments of aircraft, small boats and personnel to the North Slope of Alaska, and navigation aids and communications equipment in the Bering Strait, to explore their ability to operate in the harsh Arctic climate. Unsurprisingly, the service had earlier found that its equipment, such as C-130 aircraft, had difficulty navigating and communicating in minus-40-degree temperatures.LiNeBrEaKMore broadly, lawmakers have complained of a shortage of working icebreakers -- a legacy of a turf fight between the Coast Guard, which operates them, and the National Science Foundation, which pays to maintain them.LiNeBrEaKRichard Ranger, senior policy adviser for the American Petroleum Institute, said that while the oil and gas industry believes "there is a significant resource future in the Arctic, many around the world are raising hard questions" about both the environmental impact and technical challenges of operating there.LiNeBrEaKBoth Ranger and the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Thad W. Allen, have said that expanded commercial activity in the region will require the establishment of search and rescue capability as well as a formal oil spill response program, among other measures.LiNeBrEaKThe directive calls for increased study of changing climate conditions and environmental concerns such as increased pollution in the area, but environmentalists said the government needs to make these issues a higher priority.LiNeBrEaK"We think the only sensible approach in the Arctic is to have a science-based approach," said Janis Searles Jones, senior vice president for national policy and legal affairs at the Ocean Conservancy, an advocacy group. With warmer temperatures, she said, "you're removing the shield that has effectively sheltered the Arctic from this gold rush."LiNeBrEaKThe new policy directive may provide added impetus for Senate ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, a global pact that could govern some of the competing Arctic claims. Some conservatives have blocked a vote on the treaty despite the Bush administration's support of it. On Tuesday, incoming Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) said he would push for ratification.LiNeBrEaK"The Arctic should be recognized as a strategic priority for our nation," Kerry said in a statement. "In order to guarantee secure borders, ensure access to natural resources, mediate shipping and transportation routes, and protect our marine resources, we must become full partners with the other Arctic nations and ratify the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea."

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   Final Edition	For Griffin to fly, OU needs wingmen  	SPORTS; Pg. C01  	868 words  	COLLEGE STATION - After his Sooners' 69-63 win on Saturday, Oklahoma point guard Austin Johnson had a few choice words for Texas AandM's head basketball coach, the Aggies and possibly even the raucous Reed Arena crowd as he left the court.LiNeBrEaKMaybe Johnson was just upset about global warming or Bernard Madoff's hand in the $50 billion cookie jar. LiNeBrEaKOr as Aggies coach Mark Turgeon said, "He might have been talking to himself. No big deal."LiNeBrEaKOn the contrary, the senior point guard for the sixth-ranked team in the nation was the biggest deal in this very important matchup early in the Big 12 season.LiNeBrEaKOU pulled out a second road victory in as many tries, a week after holding off Kansas State by eight points in Manhattan, where it unveiled a nifty 1-3-1 zone defense for the first time. No other Big 12 team has a pair of wins away from home, and OU also catches Kansas in Norman in their lone meeting.LiNeBrEaKAdd in a blowout win over arch-rival Texas sandwiched between these road triumphs, and the Sooners have clearly established themselves as the team to beat in a league short on heavyweights.LiNeBrEaKBut if OU is to live up to its midseason ranking , it will have to get better backcourt help, as it did Saturday from Tony Crocker, freshman Willie Warren and especially Johnson.LiNeBrEaKBlake Griffin has to be considered one of the early frontrunners for national player of the year awards , but he'll need consistent play from his teammates for OU to claim the Big 12 title and some NCAA tournament wins . He got it on a day when he scored just 16 points and had only six rebounds before a rowdy crowd of 12,720.LiNeBrEaK"They played extremely well," Griffin said of his teammates, who include his older brother, Taylor. "I think we out-toughed them in the end. Taylor and I can't slack off and play mediocre basketball, but we're incredibly better."LiNeBrEaKTwice Blake Griffin left this game because of foul trouble. Twice, OU extended its lead.LiNeBrEaK"He still dictated the whole game," Turgeon said. "He knows how to play. You can hold him down. That makes their other players better. He's so smart. The reason Blake Griffin is better is all the players around him are better. They're all grown up."LiNeBrEaKNone moreso than the heavily tattooed, willowy Johnson, his postgame antics aside. Third-year Sooners coach Jeff Capel has spent immeasurable time with the 6-foot-3-inch guard from Amarillo, trying to groom him in Capel's own Duke image and develop night-in, night-out consistency.LiNeBrEaK"I was good, I wasn't great," Capel said, kidding about his college career. "Austin is playing at a high level right now. He's got a great assists-to-turnover ratio (of a Big 12-best 80 to 25). He's just scoring more now."LiNeBrEaKJohnson's 19-point game, peppered with clutch shots, seven assists and even a couple of blocked shots, was the latest example of an improved Sooners team. Capel's hungry to make a statement in the NCAA tournament after losing by 30 to Louisville in the second round of last year's tournament.LiNeBrEaKThe Sooners are more prepared this go-around.LiNeBrEaK"Give them credit. There's a reason they're 17-1," Turgeon said. "They make plays. And they believe. Not to say we didn't but ""LiNeBrEaKOU believed more when Johnson rained in a three-pointer from an eye-popping 26 feet at the shot-clock buzzer, extending the Sooners' lead to seven with 4: 02 to play.LiNeBrEaKThe normally unreliable long-distance shooter cranked out another three-pointer with 95 seconds remaining to keep the OU advantage at five. Johnson had three for the game in six tries, a drastic improvement over his 29. 4 percent marksmanship this season behind the arc.LiNeBrEaKBut then OU got a lot from Johnson it didn't expect Saturday.LiNeBrEaKHe's not known for his long-range accuracy or the feistiness that spilled over at the end of the game when, as Turgeon put it, Johnson "barked at our bench."LiNeBrEaKCapel admitted after his postgame news conference that the scene was out of character for his senior, but said he "got on him" about his verbal outburst. Johnson spoke to the media before reporters learned of the incident, but said earlier that his team was better-prepared to handle testy situations on the road and was more adapt at closing out games.LiNeBrEaK"We've been through this a lot," Johnson said. "We know we've got a target on our back because we're a top-five team and because of our record."LiNeBrEaKJohnson was just as instrumental in OU's win over Texas six days ago. The former high school teammate of Longhorn guard Justin Mason scored the first five points of the game and finished with 15, taking the game to the Longhorns' Damion James to the point where a steamed Rick Barnes took James out of the game.LiNeBrEaKThere will be nights when Johnson may defer to 6-6 Tony Crocker or the precocious Warren, a McDonald's All-American who can create for himself as well as his teammates, but on this one Johnson stole the show.LiNeBrEaKIs he setting the new standard in the Big 12, a league that sorely misses D.J. Augustin, Mario Chalmers and Acie Law?LiNeBrEaK"Collins is the best in the conference," Capel said emphatically, referring to Kansas' Sherron Collins. "But Austin has played well. On two of those threes, he wanted the ball. That was the main thing. He really wanted the ball."LiNeBrEaKAnd Capel is more than glad to give it to him.LiNeBrEaKkbohls@statesman.com; 445-3772		BASKETBALL (90%); ATHLETES (89%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY SPORTS (89%); SPORTS AWARDS (78%); STADIUMS and ARENAS (77%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (77%); TOURNAMENTS (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (57%)  			BERNARD MADOFF (57%)  	OKLAHOMA, USA (92%); TEXAS, USA (92%); KANSAS, USA (91%); NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 18, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved  	KIRK BOHLS AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  															
The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	The Baltimore Sun Jean Marbella column: Joe Flacco: The fame without the flash  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1006 words  	Jan. 18--Maybe some time down the road, he'll be dating a series of those interchangeably beautiful women you see on the arms of athletes and actors. He'll be driving some hot stud-machine car, turning up in South Beach clubs and surrounding himself with an entourage of assorted hangers-on.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, maybe someday Joe Flacco will start acting like the NFL quarterback that he is.LiNeBrEaKBut for now, let's enjoy our pre-if-ever-hip QB and his helmet-haired, nearly uni-browed and decidedly non-metrosexual grooming. Let's enjoy the utter nerditude of a guy who drives his grandmother's Volvo to training camp and rooms with his little bro. Let's enjoy his total lack of flash, the bone-dry, ice-water, dead-eye diffidence with which he reacts to thrilling victories and agonizing defeats alike. LiNeBrEaKLet's sing an ode to Joe, the anti-divo.LiNeBrEaKHas there ever been such an amazing athlete on the field who once off it turns so ordinary? Well, actually yes, that would be his fellow Baltimore sports star, Michael Phelps, dolphin-sleek in the water, tripping on his own feet on terra firma. But even he has gone glam in his own way since temporarily hanging up the Speedos after his dazzling Olympics in favor of the cards and the cocktail waitresses of Vegas.LiNeBrEaKWhatever it is Flacco does in his off-hours largely seems to have escaped the tabloids -- but then, of course, no one was really watching for him until recently, when he's been a bit preoccupied with the playoffs. If the news stories are right, his nighttime activities largely involve falling asleep in front of the TV before the 11 o'clock news. Has anyone ever seen him, say, at Pazo, as Ray Lewis and Phelps were recently spotted, arriving separately but on the same night?LiNeBrEaKWe know where he'll be tonight of course, hopefully leading the Ravens to the AFC championship, which will only heighten the mania around our improbable leading sports man. But what has been funny about watching Flacco's growing stardom is that as the mania grows more feverish, he gets even freakishly cooler.LiNeBrEaKListening to his post-game interviews has been almost as much fun as the games themselves. I find myself rooting for him to say something even more deadpan and less quotable than the last time -- and he's never let me down. Someday, someone will have to make one of those beer commercials where they splice Flacco's actual statements with entirely different questions.LiNeBrEaKQ: Joe, in an effort to highlight the perils of global warming, the AFC championship is going to be played on a rapidly melting iceberg, meaning you may occasionally find yourself sloshing through Arctic waters. How will that affect your game?LiNeBrEaKA: I've never played in weather that cold, but I'm not really planning on it being too much of a factor.LiNeBrEaKQ: Joe, after your game-winning performance in the Super Bowl, as you were driving from the stadium, you joined a police chase that was under way and, breaking the speed of sound, managed to capture the killer of JonBenet. What was that like?LiNeBrEaKA: Same as any other drive.LiNeBrEaKThe other day, in an attempt to get to the bottom of the whole Flacconomenon, I tried to get into the heart of the heart of the beast -- at least the T-shirts.LiNeBrEaKYou've seen them on every other person in town -- "Joe Cool" or "Wacko for Flacco" or "Triple Threat See Joe Pass See Joe Run See Joe Catch."LiNeBrEaKSee Joe Save the Local T-Shirt Industry. Like the rest of the economy, it had been rather flat of late, said Craig Pfeifer, owner of Maryland Screen Printers, which has the exclusive licensing agreement to print Flacco shirts.LiNeBrEaKPfeifer had been to an industry meeting, where everyone was complaining about how T-shirts -- with the exception of those Life is Good ones -- just aren't selling. Not so here, though, where Pfeifer estimates he's sold more than 20,000 Flacco shirts -- there are five different designs -- since he received the licensing agreement about four weeks ago.LiNeBrEaKThey were still rolling off the presses when I stopped into the printing plant, located in an industrial park off Holabird Avenue in East Baltimore, where Pfeifer was trying to keep up with the demand for them. Workers pulled a stream of purple shirts, one after the other, off one machine, next to another one that was spitting out black ones bearing the visage of that fellow cool cat, Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKFlacco has been an added boost to his usual client base -- Marriott, Constellation and Special Olympics of Maryland, on whose board of directors he serves -- and gotten him off to a good start in the new year.LiNeBrEaK"It's important for business. It's huge. It's not just me; it's the whole town," he said. "If the Ravens weren't in the postseason, the bars and restaurants wouldn't be full. Of course, the city might be a lot more productive on Mondays."LiNeBrEaKPfeifer and some of his 35 employees will be watching tonight's game right here, since they also have the contract with Reebok to print the official AFC Champion T-shirts.LiNeBrEaK"We gotta start printing as soon as the game ends," Pfeifer said. "We'll be printing at 10 o'clock at night until 7 o'clock the next morning."LiNeBrEaKPfeifer has met The Man himself, when Flacco came to the Special Olympics summer games last year. Pfeifer characterized him as, not surprisingly, "very quiet."LiNeBrEaK"He didn't even know if he'd be playing at that point," Pfeifer said. "I told him about the T-shirts I'd done before and said if he ever wanted to do some T-shirts. ... He just kind of shrugged and said, 'You think I could sell that many T-shirts with my name on it?,"LiNeBrEaKIf anyone can explain Flacco's appeal, perhaps it's Pfeifer: "It's his name. He's got a cool football name. And he can throw the ball 75 yards."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	U.S., Europe feel big chill, but climate change shows no end in sight, scientists say  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	779 words  	LONDON _ Where has global warming gone when we need it most?LiNeBrEaKAs cities from Chicago to London deal with an unusually bitter winter, weather records show that 2008 was one of the cooler years in the last decade. And the early months of 2009 are shaping up as "numbing" in the United States, according to the Farmer's Almanac, that nearly 200-year-old source of traditional weather lore.LiNeBrEaKThe chilly weather has fueled arguments that man-made global warming is bunk. "This (climate) 'crisis' is over," insists Joseph Bast, president of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, which will sponsor a conference for climate change dissenters in March in New York. LiNeBrEaKBut most meteorologists say climate change shows little sign of slowing, and they blame our shivering misery this season on two key factors: normal variation in weather, which happens on a much shorter scale than climate shift, and short memories, or a gradual shift in what we think of as "normal" winter weather.LiNeBrEaKBritain this year has had its coldest start to winter in 30 years, with temperatures 5 degrees below average, but "this would have felt like a warm year as recently as the 1980s, and an exceptionally warm year in Victorian times," said Myles Allen, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford.LiNeBrEaKIn most parts of the world, "what we regard as normal weather is the average weather over the past 10 years," he said. "We forget what it was like before then," even if someone occasionally drags out old photos of houses roof-high in snowdrifts or tales of slogging miles to school in near-impassable conditions.LiNeBrEaKBritain's recent deep freeze _ its coldest spell since 1996 _ is due to stalled weather patterns that have funneled in frigid air from Siberia and from continental Europe, which is also shivering after years of unusually mild winters, according to the Hadley Center, the United Kingdom's leading weather service.LiNeBrEaKStalled or unusual weather patterns also have contributed to remarkable snow and cold across much of the United States this winter. So far, this winter has been the 22nd coldest in 139 years of record-keeping in Chicago, and the fourth-snowiest in 124 years of records, according to Tom Skilling, chief meteorologist at WGN-TV.LiNeBrEaK"Just because certain areas cool down in the midst of an overall warming trend doesn't mean warming isn't going on," Skilling said. But the intensity of the cold and snow over the past two winters is raising some questions about how well scientists understand the interaction of an array of weather-changing forces, from sunspots to volcanic activity.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, one reason the last two winters have been chillier than normal, climate scientists say, is a cyclical change in Pacific Ocean currents known as La Nina. In La Nina years, cold ocean currents rise to the surface near the equator, often causing cooler winters in northern regions like the United States. An opposite warming effect occurs in El Nino years.LiNeBrEaKMeteorologists say La Nina phase in the Pacific is now ending, and some predict that by 2010 the world should again be seeing some of the warmest years on record _ warm enough that the Hadley Center is warning that poor residents of Britain may need help paying air-conditioning bills this summer.LiNeBrEaKBut other meteorologists see evidence of an unusual second La Nina on the rise in the Pacific, which could extend the current stretch of colder-than-average winters.LiNeBrEaK"It's a very complex puzzle, this whole climate thing," Skilling said.LiNeBrEaKSnowfall in Chicago in recent years still isn't anything approaching the snowy winters of the 1970s, when the Chicago average was 54 inches, Skilling said. But he said graphs that his research department has drawn up suggest "we're cycling back into an era of a little more snow."LiNeBrEaKWhether that is a simply a temporary break from a long-term rise in planetary temperatures or a new, not-well-understood winter trend isn't entirely clear. But "the fact that 2009, like 2008, will not break records does not mean that global warming has gone away," warned Phil Jones, director of climate research at the University of East Anglia in England.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, "when you step back and look at the bigger picture, the overwhelming evidence is that temperature is increasing around the world," said John Hammonds, a meteorologist with the Hadley Center.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   Home Final Edition	OUTDOORS;  Climate change threatens Ohio;  'Cracked Earth' video outlines dangers and what can be done about them	SPORTS; Pg. 09C  	828 words  	A dismal prognosis for polar bears and Pacific salmon isn't likely to incite panic among the bulk of Ohio's sportsmen. At the same time, most carry an inkling something is amiss in the immediate neighborhood.LiNeBrEaK"Surveys show that 70 percent or more of hunters and anglers say they have seen changes consistent with climate change," said Jim Wentz, an Ohio native who toiled for the Ohio Division of Wildlife before becoming a nationally known producer of films about fishing, wildlife and outdoor recreation.LiNeBrEaKWentz, a hunter and fisherman with a science background, saw the same things others were seeing and wanted to know why he was seeing them. LiNeBrEaKAfter study and discussion with experts, Wentz reached a conclusion: Global warming is real; it's caused in large part by humans; it's happening now.LiNeBrEaK"I have no doubts," he said.LiNeBrEaKWentz's Reynoldsburg-based company, Silvertip Productions, recently released Cracked Earth -- A Call to Action from the League of Ohio Sportsmen. The DVD, which is available and free to sportsman's groups, schools and the like, outlines what climate change means to hunters, to fishers, to wildlife watchers and to wildlife managers.LiNeBrEaKThe film includes a message on global warming from Jack Hanna, director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and excerpts from several on-the-ground experts, including Alan Wentz, Jim's brother and Ducks Unlimited's senior group manager for conservation.LiNeBrEaKWhat the experts relate is how disrupted cycles of heat and cold in North America are altering behavior in animals and growth in plants.LiNeBrEaKOne example: "Driven by temperature, some birds come north before there is anything to eat. Or, in the fall, they're hanging in when there's no longer food for them to eat," Wentz said.LiNeBrEaKBirds often can fly out of problems, he pointed out, and in some cases can cope with short-term variations in climate. However, damage to habitat caused by rising temperatures threatens the forest and wetlands homes of many animals common to Ohio.LiNeBrEaKAmong the tree species that will have a tough time surviving an over-warmed Ohio are sugar maple, black cherry, white ash, American elm, white oak, red maple, American beech, slippery elm, black walnut and yellow poplar or tuliptree. Many such trees are valuable as lumber but vital to the health of wild turkeys, deer, squirrels and songbirds.LiNeBrEaKInsects previously restricted to warmer climes are moving northward, some rapidly.LiNeBrEaKNorthern-dwelling Inuit people of late have been seeing "insects and bugs they have no name for," Wentz said.LiNeBrEaKSome insects, like the pine bark beetle and the spruce beetle, are wiping out huge tracts of forest. Canadian researchers recently reported that parts of the northern forest are releasing more carbon than they are absorbing because insects previously not seen in those regions have killed so many trees.LiNeBrEaKClimate models vary, meaning nobody claims the power to predict precisely what the world will look like in 80 years, but a consensus is emerging if present trends continue unaltered.LiNeBrEaK"The Union of Concerned Scientists is saying that Ohio's summertime climate could end up pretty much like Arkansas and wintertime like South Carolina," Wentz said.LiNeBrEaKIn such a case, southern pine forests would begin to replace leafy trees. Rivers, inland lakes and streams would become too warm to sustain cool-water fish like muskies, trout and saugeyes. Lake Erie would shrink by one-sixth, wiping out buffer wetlands and exposing land that today is fish-ridden reef and shoal in the western basin.LiNeBrEaKAs Lake Erie heats, dead zones can be expected to increase, and species such as walleye and yellow perch will give way to largemouth bass, bluegills and catfish.LiNeBrEaK"In general, we're looking at loss of habitat for cool-water and cold-water species," Wentz said.LiNeBrEaKWentz understands, however, that many persons, for reasons other than science, cling to doubts. Some even reject climate change altogether as a conspiracy against, for example, free enterprise.LiNeBrEaKBut the doubters and the disbelievers, particularly the sportsmen among them, are risking more than they realize. Hunters and fishermen began the conservation movement and need to recommit themselves to the danger, which to Wentz is clear and present.LiNeBrEaK"If we as sportsmen do not take an active role in doing something about climate change," he said, "hunting, fishing and wildlife-watching opportunities are likely to decline. That, to me, makes this a quality-of-life issue."LiNeBrEaKoutdoors@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKBox Story: For more informationLiNeBrEaKGroups can obtain a copy of the DVD, Cracked Earth --A Call to Action from the League of Ohio Sportsmen, by sending an email request to climate@silvertip.net Jim Wentz is available to groups and schools for talks about the impact of climate change on Ohio wildlife.LiNeBrEaKFor detailed information on how some groups believe global warming is changing hunting, fishing and wildlife watching, check out the following Web sites:LiNeBrEaK* www.seasonsend.orgLiNeBrEaK* www.targetglobalwarming.orgLiNeBrEaK* www.ohioforwildlife.org		MAMMALS (90%); BIRDS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); WILDLIFE (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); SPORT FISHING (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (76%); ZOOS and AQUARIUMS (76%); MOVIE and VIDEO PRODUCTION (75%); POLLS and SURVEYS (72%); WETLANDS (71%); RODENTS (69%)  		DUCKS UNLIMITED (54%)  		COLUMBUS, OH, USA (90%) OHIO, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); CANADA (79%)  	January 18, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  	Dave Golowenski, FOR THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH

The Denver Post 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Livestock and bonds Life at Collins Ranch keeps rollin' along into fifth generation  	DENVER and THE WEST; Pg. B-01  	890 words  	WILD HORSE - Through decades raising beef amid health-food crazes, fuel-price crises and global-climate changes, the nemesis of 75-year-old ranching matriarch Polly Collins Johnson was as ancient as the hills: the tumbling tumbleweed.LiNeBrEaKRussian thistle breaks free from desiccated roots 30 miles to the north of here, rolls across the dryland prairie of eastern Colorado, and comes to rest against Collins Ranch fences that enclose 40,000 acres. The tumbleweeds pile up relentlessly, standing on one anothers' shoulders as if to better mock the cattle. In blizzards, tumbleweeds accumulate snow, and knock over fence posts. LiNeBrEaKThe other preoccupation of a dryland rancher, Johnson notes as she bumps her pickup through a close-in pasture, is waiting for rain.LiNeBrEaKAnd there lies the balance of a life tied to the soil: "Good rain brings more tumbleweeds later," she smiles.LiNeBrEaKEquanimity in the face of natural injustice has been one key to the long-term thriving of Collins Ranch and its 1,000-head herd. Johnson was honored by the National Western Stock Show on Saturday as only the second female rancher ever named a "Livestock Leader."LiNeBrEaKIn an age when the number of cattle ranches and farms dropped by nearly 400,000 nationwide in 20 years, Johnson held Collins Ranch together and is now ready to turn it over to two of her sons who live on the property. A daughter ranches two hours away in Wray.LiNeBrEaKThe grandchildren are thriving, 6 miles away at Kit Carson's tiny school, and far off at Princeton, Penn and Colorado College. Among the 13 grandchildren from her four children, there very likely lurks the heart of another Collins Ranch overseer who will extend family supervision into a fifth generation.LiNeBrEaKOne of the earliest female livestock judges in Colorado, Johnson is brutally honest when 421 red and black yearling heifers trip past her feet on their way to their hay- filled lunch wagon. This one is too skinny for birthing. That one is too short for the bloodline.LiNeBrEaKBut she simply beams when one of her own offspring crosses her path, as when 4-year-old Tess, daughter of her son Toby, gets underfoot during preparation of a hot farm lunch, hoping for a stray cookie.LiNeBrEaK"I'm so happy they like ranching life and chose to do it," Johnson said. Her ranching life would get plenty lonely otherwise, when the street address is little more than Milepost 439. "I feel very fortunate."LiNeBrEaKReading the landLiNeBrEaKLuck is for meteorologists, though, as Collins Ranch admirers well know. Holding a ranch through five generations and only 13 inches of rain a year requires animal stewardship, business savvy, kindness to ranch hands and a war of attrition with burrowing prairie dogs.LiNeBrEaK"They know how to read the land," said Bill Wailes, chairman of the department of animal sciences at Colorado State University. Johnson was a third-generation graduate of what was then Colorado AandM, in 1956, and was the first woman on the school's livestock judging team.LiNeBrEaK"They were always ahead of the game," Wailes said. "It's a neat legacy they have left. My guess is their kids are going to want to do the same thing."LiNeBrEaKThe Collins Ranch reading of the terrain this year is to take a break from the spring dangers of calving. A thousand-head herd usually yields about 945 calves in spring; nearly all males are sold to feed lots, while about 200 heifers are kept to become mother cows the next year.LiNeBrEaKLast summer was so dry on the ranch and prices were high enough that the family sold those replacement heifers for beef rather than spend money bringing in feed to supplement stunted pastures.LiNeBrEaK"It will be strange not calving, it's hard to remember our last skipped year," said Johnson, pointing to spots in her pastures where sudden spring storms and snowdrifts can make calving an adventure for all involved. "What do you think, Toby? Gosh, I guess it's been 20 years."LiNeBrEaKShe'll take it as a mixed blessing, she said. Toby, wife Amy and their three children (including Tess) will be using that calmer time this spring to move from an outlying ranch house 15 miles away to the original Collins Ranch home, which is being remodeled. Johnson moved out of the 103-year-old home, built with adobe from surrounding mud pits, a few weeks ago and into a newly built home that's an extension of the old hacienda compound.LiNeBrEaK"This is home"LiNeBrEaKPacking and unpacking brings up fond memories of her late husband, Rogers Johnson, who died in 1993 after a two-year battle with lymphoma. His stamp remains on every corner of the ranch, including on the walls of the new home he never saw.LiNeBrEaKPolly Johnson hung some of his favorite cowboy paintings by former Denver Post Sunday artist Paul Gregg, who was her great-uncle. The framed cowboys spur their steeds in bright sunshine streaming through windows that look out on the main pastures where Toby, brother Scott and the rest of the family glide on real horses.LiNeBrEaKJohnson is still figuring out where the kids put her silverware in the new kitchen, but she can't stop smiling at the prospect of growing older just a few feet from where she grew up.LiNeBrEaK"I did think of assisted living seriously," said Johnson, who in her running shoes, quilted jacket and perfect makeup seems much more likely to be doing the assisting. "A lot of my friends have moved to places like that. But this is home, I guess. This is where I like to be."LiNeBrEaKMichael Booth: 303-954-1686LiNeBrEaKor mbooth@denverpost.com		FARMERS and RANCHERS (90%); BEEF CATTLE FARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); MAMMALS (90%); WEATHER (78%); METEOROLOGY (73%)  				DENVER, CO, USA (57%) COLORADO, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  	Michael Booth The Denver Post  															
The Denver Post 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Priming pump against Ritter  	DENVER and THE WEST; Pg. B-01  	590 words  	And so it starts.LiNeBrEaKThe unofficial campaign to unseat Gov. Bill Ritter has begun as a crusade against his new oil and gas rules.LiNeBrEaKYou've heard the drill. Gas companies long have grumbled, illogically, that drilling regs would force you to pay more at the pump and otherwise bring end times to Colorado.LiNeBrEaKNow - months before the rules even go into effect - the state's most ambitious Republican is blaming them not only for a drilling slowdown but also for the economic downturn. LiNeBrEaK"They're contributing to industry pulling back. They're costing jobs. They're affecting the bread and butter in my district," says Senate Minority Leader Josh Penry, R-Fruita. "The governor needs to take responsibility."LiNeBrEaKThe oil and gas lobby is all too eager to fuel the hysteria, suggesting Ritter's regs may encourage terrorism aimed at our gas patches.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, we don't see that kind of thing come down to Colorado," said Ken Wonstolen, inciting Club 20, a group of Western Slope leaders, on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKThere are lots of reasons to knock Ritter.LiNeBrEaKHis oil and gas rules aren't among them. They call for basic accountability such as drilling away from homes and rivers.LiNeBrEaKFact is, new drilling has slowed in Colorado and nationally for reasons that have nothing to do with regulations.LiNeBrEaKAmong those are that natural-gas prices have plummeted 60 percent since July as part of a global market whose rates rise and fall with worldwide, not statewide, factors. Also, as Penry well knows, the credit crunch has hit businesses that are speculative and capital intensive, like drilling companies.LiNeBrEaKWhile Ritter's rulemaking dominated headlines in 2008, Colorado still allowed more drilling than any other Rocky Mountain state, issuing total permits second only to Texas nationally.LiNeBrEaKEven Penry's own sister disproves his arguments.LiNeBrEaK"It would be false to say" that Chevron's decision to curb investment in Colorado "is a direct result of the rules," that company's Kristi Pollard was quoted as saying in November.LiNeBrEaKPenry's lack of reason is stunning, like blaming global warming on the market crash.LiNeBrEaKSo, too, is the hypocrisy that he and his limited-government cronies are calling for a study group on the same rules the state worked on for 18 months, held 24 days of hearings and spent more than two weeks deliberating. The state even boasts - amazingly - that 95 percent of the wording in some drilling rules comes verbatim from industry.LiNeBrEaKIllogical, indeed. Unless Penry's Mountain Dew-induced rants have less to do with drilling than with raw politics.LiNeBrEaKStalling the rules enables Penry to drag out his crusade against Ritter long past April, when they're slated to take effect. That gives him a wedge issue pitting jobs against the environment and Western Slopers against Front Rangers - all leverage the 32-year-old Grand Junction resident could use to challenge Ritter in 2010, as expected. It also ups Penry's stock among the companies that helped put energy lobbyist Bill Owens into office and would relish bringing Ritter down.LiNeBrEaKThe governor so far is 0-for-1 against the industry, having been trounced in trying to convince voters to nix severance subsidies in November.LiNeBrEaKEven in a state that overwhelmingly wants more-LiNeBrEaKresponsible drilling, he has failed to make his case for why companies should be held accountable when pocking up our land.LiNeBrEaKRitter has 22 months to defend what has emerged all too quietly as his pet issue, or he risks being scapegoated and Swiftboated out of office.LiNeBrEaKSusan Greene writes Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Pulte to raise home energy efficiency, hopes to be leader  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	878 words  	Jan. 18--Pulte Homes Inc. plans to increase the energy efficiency in homes built in Michigan this year, part of a national trend toward saving resources.LiNeBrEaKSteven Atchison, president of Pulte Homes' Michigan division, said the company has been building its homes to most of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star requirements in Michigan. But now, the Bloomfield Hills-based builder is making it official.LiNeBrEaKMore than 200 builders in Michigan are involved in the Energy Star program, but Pulte is the largest. LiNeBrEaK"It is right for the environment. As a large national builder ... we think we can possibly influence other builders," Atchison said.LiNeBrEaKThe mainstreaming of energy efficiency is an offshoot of a rocky economy as people are more worried about energy costs and also a rise in environmental consciousness, said Mark J. Bennett, leader of the climate change practice team at Miller Canfield in Troy.LiNeBrEaK"Michigan builders are finally getting into the game," Bennett said. "You have significant challenges in residential homebuilding so it's a competitive tool on behalf of the homebuilder."LiNeBrEaKSaving energy costs were important to Justin Haas, 38, a Farmington Hills attorney, and his fiancee, Wendy Hoefer, 33, an economic-development worker in Detroit.LiNeBrEaKHaas and Hoefer researched several Michigan builders before deciding to buy a 3,700-square-foot Pulte home in Northville last month. The first utility bill hasn't arrived yet, but they are expecting savings compared with their previous homes.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously, one of the going trends was going green, and that was very important for us," Haas said. "It not only benefits the environment, but also impacts the long-term cost of living in the home."LiNeBrEaKAtchison said that the company had been building energy-efficient homes, but, for the Energy Star certification, some changes were made. The company needed to partner with an independent third-party inspector to examine its homes. And it needed to increase its insulation requirements to meet the home energy-rating score set by EPA guidelines.LiNeBrEaK"We want to continue increasing the efficiencies of our homes. We think energy costs are a concern for all our customers," Atchison said.LiNeBrEaKEnergy Star-certified homes can reduce energy bills by 30% to 50%, he said.LiNeBrEaKHaas said they found that many builders don't add the energy-efficient furnaces, appliances, extra attic insulation and foam sealing and other conservation methods because it adds to their costs.LiNeBrEaKAtchison said that making each home Energy Star-certified would cost just a few hundred dollars extra. Pulte Homes has built Energy Star-rated homes in many other states with a total of 69,500 through September 2008, according to Pulte.LiNeBrEaKThe company has 15 communities in Michigan that are building Energy Star homes, including ones in Canton, Lake Orion, Holly, Northville, Macomb and Novi.LiNeBrEaKPulte hired Don Nelson, president of D.R. Nelson and Associates in Lake Orion, to handle the home inspections. He conducts what is known as a Minneapolis Blower Door test to see how much air is leaking from a house. To do the test, a fan is put into a door opening. "The blower door test tells us how the whole house performs," Nelson said.LiNeBrEaKHe said a typical house that has not been sealed up to the Energy Star standard can leak 400 to 600 square feet of air, which is equivalent to leaving a small window open all the time.LiNeBrEaKThe interest in Energy Star has risen as the building boom has waned. Nelson said he started working with Pulte on the Energy Star plan in 2007. The company committed to it last summer and then in October, new state energy codes took effect that mandate energy-efficient standards in new residential construction.LiNeBrEaKBuilders can comply with the code in two different ways, Nelson said. One is the performance method, which measures how efficiently a home performs. The second is prescriptive, which means the builder constructs a home according to a chart of specifications.LiNeBrEaKBrian Yeck, project manager for MJC Builders in Macomb Township, started building to Energy Star specifications in 2007.LiNeBrEaK"We were trying to be one step ahead just like Pulte when we started this program," Yeck said. "Now everyone pretty much has to comply with this code."LiNeBrEaKAnd while there are other ways to comply with the code, Yeck said the company selected Energy Star because it is the most recognized by consumers.LiNeBrEaK"There is a name recognition with Energy Star. It is something people have seen, they are comfortable with," he said. "We wanted to convey to homeowners that you are getting a quality, energy-efficient home."LiNeBrEaKMJC has three condominium projects in Macomb County with the Energy Star features. But they have not built any single-family homes lately.LiNeBrEaK"When we get through these tough economic times and start building again, we will go Energy Star," Yeck said.LiNeBrEaKContact GRETA GUEST at 313-223-4192 or gguest@freepress.com		ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (94%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (90%); TRENDS (89%); GREEN BUILDING (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); COST OF LIVING (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (77%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (76%)  	PULTE HOMES INC (94%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (58%)  		DETROIT, MI, USA (79%) MICHIGAN, USA (99%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 18, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Detroit Free Press   	Greta Guest, Detroit Free Press  		PHM (NYSE) (94%) NYSE:PHM  	NAICS236116 NEW MULTIFAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION (EXCEPT OPERATIVE BUILDERS) (94%); NAICS236115 NEW SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING CONSTRUCTION (EXCEPT OPERATIVE BUILDERS) (94%); SIC1522 GENERAL CONTRACTORS - RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OTHER THAN SINGLE-FAMILY (94%); SIC1521 GENERAL CONTRACTORS - SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES (94%) Construction  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090118-DE-Pulte-to-raise-home-energy-efficiency-hopes-to-be-leader-0118  	DE  									
Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	REDEFINING 'EVANGELICAL';  Pastor Rick Warren is at the center of a debate on the very meaning of the word 	Pg. D-1  	970 words  	The howls came from the left and the right when President-elect Barack Obama announced that evangelist Rick Warren would give the opening prayer at Tuesday's presidential inauguration.LiNeBrEaKMany liberals were outraged because Warren openly supported last year's successful effort to ban same-sex marriage in California, his home state.LiNeBrEaKConservative Christians didn't like that such a high-profile evangelical Christian - and a Southern Baptist to boot - would so openly embrace a Democrat they consider to be one of the most liberal in history. LiNeBrEaKBut some say the controversy is a sign that white, conservative Christians, so influential in Republican politics for the past three decades, are losing their grip not only on political power but on the power to exclusively define the word "evangelical."LiNeBrEaKThe real source of confusion and frustration about Warren is that he has long bucked the accepted definition of what it means to be an evangelical Christian, said the Rev. Spike Hogan, leader of a Southern Baptist church in Jacksonville that is modeled after Warren's Saddleback church.LiNeBrEaKWhile conservative on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, Warren has routinely reached across political and theological lines to combat poverty, AIDS and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"He's a [political] independent, his heart is for change," said Hogan, pastor of Chet's Creek Church. "Mr. Obama must have looked at him and said 'Here's a man I can ask to pray without an agenda.' "LiNeBrEaKIN THE TRUEST SENSE . . .LiNeBrEaKTo be theologically conservative and socially progressive is neither a novelty nor a contradiction, said the Rev. Timothy Simpson, a Presbyterian minister in Jacksonville and an editor of the academic journal Political Theology.LiNeBrEaKIn the truest sense, an evangelical is a Christian who believes in the authority of Scripture, holds that Jesus Christ is the sole path to salvation and who feels an imperative to share his faith with others.LiNeBrEaK"Literally, it means 'that which pertains to the good news, the gospel,' " said Simpson, also an adjunct religion professor at the University of North Florida.LiNeBrEaKBut in the media and in common usage the word has become almost exclusively associated with the religious right, a movement that came to prominence in the late 1970s, Simpson said.LiNeBrEaK"It created the impression that all evangelicals were only anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage ... denied global warming and didn't care about social issues" like hunger, education and AIDs, Simpson said.LiNeBrEaKBut the war, increased evidence of climate change and the growth of government became a concern even to the white conservative Christians who voted overwhelmingly for President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.LiNeBrEaK"As a result, the religious right has fragmented," Simpson said.LiNeBrEaKUniversity of North Florida political scientist Henry B. Thomas agreed, but suggested the cause of that fragmentation may be a generational phenomenon.LiNeBrEaK"I think that young evangelicals are much more likely to take seriously a thesis like global warming than are elderly evangelicals," Thomas said.LiNeBrEaK"Those differences may lead folk to different places on public policy issues even though they fundamentally agree on a lot of faith stuff."LiNeBrEaK'RELYING ON LABELS'LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that Christians are both the purveyors and targets of stereotyping, said the Rev. Mark Griffin, pastor of Wayman Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jacksonville.LiNeBrEaKBy and large, Griffin said, the black church falls in line with white conservative Christians on issues like abortion and gay marriage.LiNeBrEaKPost-election analysis concluded correctly that the large number of Florida's African-Americans who turned out for Obama in November also sealed the passage of an amendment to the Florida constitution banning same-sex marriage, Griffin said.LiNeBrEaKYet black ministers and churches are often considered liberals - and, therefore, not evangelicals - because their day-to-day focus is on issues like crime, education, justice and poverty, he said.LiNeBrEaKEvangelical "has become more of a political word than a religious word, and that's unfortunate," Griffin said. "Because the black church is largely evangelical - we are all supposed to spread the good news."LiNeBrEaKAt heart the misunderstanding stems from the desire to easily label individuals and groups, Griffin said.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	The Bush record, issue by issue  	NATION / WORLD; Pg. A16  	724 words  	Ups and downs of George W. Bush's presidency:LiNeBrEaKBUDGETLiNeBrEaKBlack ink to red: Bush inherited a record $236 billion surplus, but the fiscal picture deteriorated sharply on his watch. The 2008 deficit was a record $455 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe national debt: It almost doubled, to $10. 7 trillion, as did the wartime defense budget, to $594 billion in 2008. LiNeBrEaKInterest payments on the debt were $451 billion in 2008.LiNeBrEaKCONGRESSLiNeBrEaKFirst term: Bush's popularity and role as a wartime president -- as well as Republican majorities -- translated into notable successes:LiNeBrEaK-- Homeland security.LiNeBrEaK-- Combating terrorism.LiNeBrEaK-- $1 trillion in tax cuts.LiNeBrEaK-- No Child Left Behind education reforms.LiNeBrEaK-- Medicare drug benefit.LiNeBrEaK-- Fighting AIDS in Africa.LiNeBrEaKSecond term: Bush was not able to cash in on his "political capital," failing to overhaul Social Security and immigration law. Hurricane Katrina and bad news from Iraq laid him low in polls.LiNeBrEaKECONOMYLiNeBrEaKRecession: The downturn that began in December 2007 has lasted longer than any in a quarter-century.LiNeBrEaKFinancial crisis: The most severe since the Great Depression:LiNeBrEaK-- American households have seen trillions of dollars in savings evaporate.LiNeBrEaK-- The Dow Jones average fell by 33. 8 percent in 2008, the biggest decline since 1931.LiNeBrEaK-- The economy has lost nearly 2 million jobs.LiNeBrEaKENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKClimate change: Bush spurned government-imposed emissions cuts, and he stopped in its tracks further consideration of the Kyoto Protocol as well as stopped Congress capping carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKWetlands: The administration fulfilled promises to scale back standards, narrowing what is considered a wetland.LiNeBrEaKENERGYLiNeBrEaKPolicy-making: An effort led by Vice President Dick Cheney called for more domestic production of oil and gas, development of renewable energy, reduction on reliance on foreign oil, greater support for nuclear energy and need to modernize the aging electric power grid. Most of those goals have yet to be met..LiNeBrEaKDrilling: The Bush administration gave energy companies greater access to tens of thousands of acres of federal land in the intermountain West.LiNeBrEaKFuel efficiency: Bush mostly opposed attempts in Congress to increase the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard but finally embraced a 40 percent hike to 35 mpg.LiNeBrEaKHEALTH CARELiNeBrEaKMedicare drug benefit: The largest expansion of the government health care for the elderly eased the financial burden of more than 25 million seniors and disabled people. It cost less than anticipated.LiNeBrEaKGovernment coverage: Bush's attempts to reduce spending on Medicaid and Medicare by slowing the growth of provider payments were thwarted by Congress. He blocked lawmakers' attempt to expand an insurance program for children.LiNeBrEaKThe uninsured: At the same time, the ranks of those without coverage grew from 38. 4 million in 2000 to 45. 7 million in 2007.LiNeBrEaKStem-cell research: Bush put in place a policy that limited federal funding of research on human embryonic stem cells.LiNeBrEaKJUSTICE AND TERRORLiNeBrEaKExecutive authority: The Bush administration pushed it to its limits -- and the Constitution's -- in dealing with terror suspects, in the U.S. and at Guantanamo Bay. Federal courts overruled the president in both areas.LiNeBrEaKCIA interrogation: Bush also held the line on numerous attempts by Congress to rein in the CIA's interrogation, detention and extraordinary rendition program. He signed an executive order in 2007 deeming it compliant with a law requiring all detainees to be treated humanely.LiNeBrEaKNo second attack: Terrorists have not struck the U.S. since 2001. But Bush's central promise to get al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden "dead or alive" remains unfulfilled.LiNeBrEaKAttorney firings: Justice Department investigations found that hiring and firing decisions at the once-fiercely independent agency was the result, in part, of White House political meddling. The firing of nine U.S. attorneys, including West Michigan's Margaret Chiara, ultimately forced the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.LiNeBrEaKREPUTATION ABROADLiNeBrEaKTravel: Bush made less frequent trips than many presidents, and always seemed uncomfortable with the pomp. The unease was mutual, even among historical allies such as France and Germany.LiNeBrEaKGlobal support: Bush marshaled global support after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and quickly lost much of it. People in Europe as well as the few allies in the Muslim world clucked that he squandered good will by the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   3 STAR EDITION	GREENHOUSE GASES;  What to do about CO2;  Some are touting the benefits of a carbon tax over a cap-and-trade system for regulating harmful emissions	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	1639 words  	Attacking climate change through a complex greenhouse gas trading system is a centerpiece of the incoming Obama administration's energy policy.LiNeBrEaKBut economists and energy analysts of all ideological stripes are saying a better approach to getting a cleaner atmosphere might involve a political dirty word - tax.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide, already operating in Europe and contained in some proposed U.S. energy legislation, would aim to reduce greenhouse gases by setting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, issuing emissions permits and allowing companies to trade them in an open market. Over time, the number of permits would drop, forcing companies to lower emissions.LiNeBrEaKA tax, on the other hand, would simply impose a fee for every ton of CO2 produced by users of fossil fuels, like power plants and refineries. Over time the tax would increase, again encouraging companies to find alternatives. Both options give companies incentives to lower emissions, and both would result in higher energy prices for consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut proponents of a tax on CO2 emissions say it would be less complicated and less expensive to administer and monitor. And the cost would be more predictable to businesses and consumers than a trading system, in which prices can fluctuate greatly. LiNeBrEaKGregory Mankiw, the former head of the Bush administration's Council of Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office, among others, have touted a CO2 tax as a better path. Energy industry executives have too, including former Duke Energy Chief Executive Paul Anderson, Dynegy CEO Bruce Williamson and Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson, who said this month that a tax would be "a more direct and transparent approach."LiNeBrEaK"There seems to be a pretty good consensus among economists in support of a tax, which is surprising given the admiration most have for the strength of markets," said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.LiNeBrEaKBut getting a new tax passed could be a long shot, despite growing public support for climate change legislation and a Democratic administration and Congress that are more inclined to support taxes on industry than Republican predecessors.LiNeBrEaK"So even if a tax is better, can a tax actually get passed by Congress?" asked Francisco Padua, a trader at Amerex Brokers in Sugar Land, which is active in existing emissions markets. "Why even talk about it?"LiNeBrEaKMomentum buildsLiNeBrEaKThe momentum for a cap-and-trade program continued to build last week, as a coalition of business and environmental groups ranging from ConocoPhillips and General Electric Co. to the Natural Resources Defense Council provided a detailed plan to Congress.LiNeBrEaKNo matter how CO2 is regulated in the U.S., it will have a large effect on Texas, and Houston in particular.LiNeBrEaKHarris County ranks No. 1 in the country for tons of CO2 emitted per year at 18. 6 million tons, according to a Purdue University study released last spring. That's because of the concentration of refineries in the area, combined with more than 3 million cars and trucks. CO2 legislation likely would raise costs for local industry.LiNeBrEaKBut a cap-and-trade system also could also create a business opportunity. CO2 trading could top $3. 1 trillion by 2020, double the size of the current global commodities derivatives market, according to Point Carbon, an emissions market advisory firm. A U.S. market would be the largest, worth about $2. 3 trillion.LiNeBrEaKHouston is home to many large commodity trading operations, so it would be a natural place to locate CO2 traders.LiNeBrEaKCap-and-trade programs enjoy strong support for many reasons.LiNeBrEaKSuch a program has been used for more than a decade to cut acid rain in the U.S. by reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide power plants produce. The program assigned a cap on emissions from coal-fired power plants and then created a trading system for allowances that lets companies decide whether it's more cost effective to reduce emissions or buy allowances to pollute.LiNeBrEaKOver time, the number of available allowances was lowered. This made it more expensive to buy emission allowances than to install cleaner technologies at the power plants - so plants installed more equipment to clean emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe acid rain program cut sulfur dioxide emissions more than 30 percent below 1990 levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, in a way that was predictable and cost-effective to businesses. A similar program aimed at reducing nitrogen oxides, a key component of smog, helped cut those emissions 74 percent below 1990 levels in 20 Eastern states.LiNeBrEaKMuch more complexLiNeBrEaKHow much CO2 might decline under a U.S. cap-and-trade program would depend upon how it was structured, what caps were set and other factors.LiNeBrEaKBut success with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides trading won't necessarily translate to CO2.LiNeBrEaKThose trading schemes were applied only to a segment of one industry - certain coal-fired power plants. CO2 trading would apply to all power plants and many other industries, so it would be more complex and require more oversight.LiNeBrEaKPower plants also have several relatively easy options for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides reductions, such as switching the type of fuels burned or adding smokestack scrubbers. For CO2, there are currently few easy options, highlighting a need for new methods.LiNeBrEaKAnd the early results for Europe's CO2 cap-and-trade system - which is many times larger than the U.S. sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides programs - are seen by some as less than stellar.LiNeBrEaKThe first round of emission credits were free, allowing some emitters to sell permits at big profits without actually lowering their CO2 output.LiNeBrEaKAnd too many credits were issued, leading to a steep crash in carbon credit prices in 2006.LiNeBrEaKAnother component of the system that has raised questions is a United Nations-run market that issues tradable carbon credits from projects that trap or destroy carbon emissions, such as restoring carbon dioxide absorbing forests. Stanford University researchers found some Chinese chemical companies actually increased their output of a refrigerant because destroying a byproduct of the process creates a carbon credit they could then sell.LiNeBrEaKBrice Lalonde, France's special ambassador in charge of climate change, defends the European Union's trading scheme, saying early problems will resolve themselves as the market develops.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see that many missteps," Lalonde said. "We had an experimental phase to start with, and we are trying to learn by doing. The main outcome is that the cap-and-trade system works."LiNeBrEaKSpecial interestsLiNeBrEaKThe Baker Institute's Jaffe has misgivings because a cap-and-trade system creates a large commodity market designed by the U.S. Congress under the influence of competing special interests.LiNeBrEaK"The lobbying over the design will be intense, and there are a lot of aberrations that can be created when you design a market through the political process," she said.LiNeBrEaKAnd just like any large commodity market, CO2 prices could be highly volatile, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston who is co-teaching a graduate-level carbon trading class this semester.LiNeBrEaK"Banks like the volatility and complexity, because the more volatile and complex, the more money they could make," Pirrong said. "But volatility may make companies put off investing in cleaner technology because they can't get an accurate estimate on the costs."LiNeBrEaKSome resistance to cap and trade also stems from the current economic downturn, triggered in part by failures on the part of market participants and regulators.LiNeBrEaK"I think cap-and-trade is unpoliceable," said S. David Freeman, a former executive with several large utilities around the country, including Texas' Lower Colorado River Authority. He now spends much of his time crusading against nuclear power.LiNeBrEaK"You could plant a bunch of trees for a credit, but someone has to make sure you don't cut them down five years later," Freeman said. "There seems like a lot of chances to manipulate."LiNeBrEaKStill, some leading environmental groups prefer cap-and-trade. The Environmental Defense Fund has favored trading, in part because it sets limits on carbon emissions and a tax sets only a price.LiNeBrEaKAnd many are skeptical that the government would make good use of tax proceeds. Various proposals call for the money to go directly back to consumers or to pay for research in low-carbon energy technology, but some worry that the money could just be used for other, un-related projects.LiNeBrEaK"The private sector would do a better job using that value," Amerex's Padua said.LiNeBrEaKSpelling out a solutionLiNeBrEaKCap and trade is one of two most-discussed methods of controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The other is a tax on carbon emissions, which would increase over time.LiNeBrEaKCap and tradeLiNeBrEaKPros:LiNeBrEaKGovernment revenue from auctioning permits could fund research and development in renewable energy technologies, or be distributed to taxpayers to offset higher energy costs that likely would result under stricter emissions controls.LiNeBrEaKTrading would provide companies flexibility in meeting environmental goals, since they could buy time by purchasing permits.LiNeBrEaKCons:LiNeBrEaKAs with other products traded on commodity markets, the price for CO2 permits could be volatile and difficult for some companies to budget.LiNeBrEaKThe price could be subject to speculation and manipulation, so policing the system could require an expensive new regulatory structure.LiNeBrEaKCARBON TAXLiNeBrEaKPros:LiNeBrEaKTax revenue could fund research and development in renewable energy technologies, or be distributed to taxpayers to offset higher energy costs.LiNeBrEaKCosts would be more predictable and the system could be administered under existing tax structure.LiNeBrEaKCons:LiNeBrEaKIt would not be tied to a specific emissions level so CO2 levels might not fall as quickly as hoped.LiNeBrEaKLike any tax, it would be politically difficult to impose.LiNeBrEaKSource: Chronicle research		EMISSIONS (94%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (91%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (91%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); ECONOMIC POLICY (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (78%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (78%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (77%); AIR POLLUTION (77%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (76%); POWER PLANTS (73%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (70%) Houston Ecology Air Pollution  	DUKE ENERGY CORP (90%); EXXON MOBIL CORP (84%); CONOCOPHILLIPS (84%); GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (61%); DYNEGY INC (58%); TELENT LTD (51%)  	COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS (54%); CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (54%)  	BARACK OBAMA (91%); REX W TILLERSON (54%); BRUCE A WILLIAMSON (54%)  	HOUSTON, TX, USA (91%) TEXAS, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (92%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Drawing; 1.; Graphic: CAP AND TRADE; Photo: 3.

The Idaho Statesman (Boise)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Kempthorne's legacy may lie in his lesser-known efforts: His success in ending the Klamath River stalemate and protecting parks may outlive his ESA rule changes  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1758 words  	Jan. 18--If Dirk Kempthorne gets his name in a history book, it's likely to be for listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKBut that decision, which showed global warming was a serious threat, came with faint praise because Kempthorne sought to take the teeth out of the listing so it couldn't be used to control greenhouses gases.LiNeBrEaKLike most of Kempthorne's achievements in his short time leading the 73,000 employees of the Department of the Interior, this one was tainted by the environmental record of the Bush administration's prior six years -- and by the agency's record of ethical lapses and questionable decision-making.LiNeBrEaKStill, even his critics acknowledge that Kempthorne cleaned up the corruption and the political interference that marred many of the agency's years under Bush. He also stood up for the nation's national parks, resolved one of the most polarizing water disputes in the West, and aggressively pushed oil and natural gas drilling -- either helping boost the nation's energy independence or further destroying the environment, depending on whom you ask. LiNeBrEaK"Secretary Kempthorne came in the wake of the Abramoff scandal and bitter record of Gale Norton, and he could only go up from there," said Bob Irvin, senior vice president for conservation programs at Defenders of Wildlife. "He didn't go far enough."LiNeBrEaKGreg Schildwachter, a former Kempthorne gubernatorial aide who works in the White House Council of Environmental Quality, said polar bears get the most attention, but Kempthorne's actions on parks and his approach to solving a controversy along the Klamath River may be his longest-lasting legacies.LiNeBrEaK"In retrospect, those very unsexy institutional things may have more reckoning in history," Schildwachter said.LiNeBrEaKThe former Boise mayor, U.S. senator and Idaho governor leaves office Tuesday along with his boss. He has no new job lined up and plans a long vacation with his wife, Patricia.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne helped persuade Bush to end the offshore drilling moratorium put in place in the early 1990s by Bush's father, and wrote a five-year plan for oil and gas development that included new drilling for the first time and kept aggressively pushing natural gas drilling in the West. Yet at the same time, Kempthorne took steps to improve protections for everything from mule deer to antelope and sage grouse -- not enough for some environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK"Whenever there was a conflict, the weight of the decision went to energy and industry interests, and that just didn't change," said William Meadows, executive director of the Wilderness Society.LiNeBrEaK1. THE POLAR BEAR BREAKS A LONG ESA SILENCELiNeBrEaKFor years before being pegged to head Bush's Interior Department, Kempthorne had made a political career of advocating alternatives to protecting animals and plants under the Endangered Species Act. His goal: to protect species with the least amount of regulations.LiNeBrEaKAnd for almost two years as head of the agency that makes these decisions, he added no new species to the list.LiNeBrEaKTo some, like Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, this was "the worst record in the history of the Endangered Species Act."LiNeBrEaKHis group filed the lawsuit that ultimately forced Kempthorne's hand.LiNeBrEaKThe environmentalists had a far-reaching goal: If polar bears were listed as endangered, and global warming was named as the culprit, it could force the government to stop greenhouse gas sources like coal-fired power plants all around the country.LiNeBrEaKFederal scientists told Kempthorne what the Bush administration had denied for most of the president's term: that global warming, caused in part by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, was melting the Arctic ice where the polar bear lived. He had no choice but to list.LiNeBrEaK"Reality was outpacing the models," Kempthorne said. "I think history will prove it was the correct decision."LiNeBrEaKBut Kempthorne immediately began writing rule changes that would prevent using the act against distant power plants.LiNeBrEaKThose rules, which took effect in December, also allowed federal agencies to avoid consulting with fish and wildlife agencies to determine whether things like operating a dam or logging in national forests were jeopardizing an endangered species.LiNeBrEaK"The new regulations make the most sweeping changes in nearly a quarter century to the way the statute works and not in a way that will advance protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species," said Lewis and Clark Law School professor Daniel Rohlf of Portland, Ore.LiNeBrEaKThe rules may not survive a more environmentally friendly administration, but Kempthorne's action gave climate change an icon. Just as the bald eagle was long the symbol of the Endangered Species Act, now the polar bear is linked to the world fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne is satisfied with that result, and in a sense it was a natural passing of the torch.LiNeBrEaKHe was able to take the bald eagle off the list.LiNeBrEaK2. INTEGRITY NOTICEABLY LACKINGLiNeBrEaKInterior had troubles under Gale Norton, the biggest coming from the connection of her deputy Steve Griles to lobbyist Jack Abramoff -- a scandal that helped Republicans lose the Senate and the House in the 2006 elections.LiNeBrEaKWhen Kempthorne arrived, he came with marching orders from Bush: Take care of the ethics problems.LiNeBrEaK"The president told me to make some changes," Kempthorne said. "I did."LiNeBrEaKKempthorne has not been free of minor scandals himself. From the latest Taj Mahal-like bathroom renovation to accepting ski junkets as a senator, the University Place fiasco in Boise and his use of campaign funds for personal use as governor, Kempthorne has had his own ethics questioned throughout his career. But nothing rose to a level that threatened to slow his confirmation.LiNeBrEaKOne of the first Interior staffers Kempthorne met with was Earl Devaney, the department's inspector general, whose job is to audit agencies and investigate allegations of wrongdoing. He had been busy under Norton's watch.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne spent two hours with Devaney, asking his advice on how to change the culture of the agency and where to set the ethical lines. From his first day in office, Kempthorne told the entire staff that he would not tolerate ethical violations.LiNeBrEaK"The willingness of this secretary, as opposed to his predecessor, to hold people accountable for ethical failure is night and day," Devaney said.LiNeBrEaKDevaney was impressed enough by Kempthorne's attitude and the changes he instilled that he asked the secretary to address the National Inspector Generals' Association.LiNeBrEaKIn June 2008, Devaney reported that 12 Mineral Management Service employees and former employees handling billions of dollars in oil royalties had received numerous gifts from and improperly engaged in relationships -- including sexual ones -- with energy company staff, all before Kempthorne's administration.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne turned to one of his own to help clean up that part of the agency. Stephen Allred was a no-nonsense former Morrison-Knudsen executive and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality director whom Kempthorne had named assistant secretary for land and minerals management.LiNeBrEaK"He's never really told me what to do," Allred said. "He told me 'do what you think is right.' "LiNeBrEaKKempthorne acted immediately, and when Congress demanded a report, he testified along with Devaney.LiNeBrEaK"It was outrageous," Kempthorne said. "There has to be consequences for that kind of behavior."LiNeBrEaKBut it turned out that the agency's ethical lapses also were affecting policy.LiNeBrEaKIn December 2008, Devaney showed how the meddling of engineer Julie MacDonald, Norton's deputy assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks, undercut what was supposed to be the solely scientific listing decisions for more than 13 species.LiNeBrEaK"MacDonald's zeal to advance her agenda has caused considerable harm to the integrity" of the Endangered Species Act, "and to the morale and the reputation" of the Fish and Wildlife Service, "as well as potential harm to individual species," Devaney wrote.LiNeBrEaKDevaney calls the improvements Kempthorne made in the integrity and morale of the department "incredible."LiNeBrEaK3. A RENEWED FOCUS ON NATIONAL PARKSLiNeBrEaKKempthorne's first official conversation with Ken Salazar, the Democratic Colorado senator whom Barack Obama has picked for Interior, came during Kempthorne's own confirmation in 2006. The topic was a cause the two shared: protecting national parks.LiNeBrEaKSalazar asked Kempthorne to reconsider a 2005 plan that would have placed more emphasis on recreation and expanded the use of snowmobiles and ATVs in national parks.LiNeBrEaKThe plan proposed that in order for activities to be prohibited in parks, they must "irreversibly" harm the parks, instead of only harming them. Within weeks of taking over, Kempthorne reversed the decision.LiNeBrEaKHe persuaded President Bush to approve a decade-long program to upgrade and improve the national parks, and in 2008 Bush approved the largest budget increase in the history of the National Park Service. He established the centennial funding program that allows the government to match -- dollar for dollar -- private donations for the parks.LiNeBrEaK4. A STALEMATE BREACHED ON THE KLAMATH RIVERLiNeBrEaKWhen a judge in 2001 forced farmers along the Klamath River to aid salmon by draining their irrigation water downstream, they formed a "Freedom Cavalry" to unlock the headgates and close off the water. They captured national attention.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration sided with the farmers and vowed not to leave them high and dry, especially with the 2002 midterm elections coming up. Bush brought in Vice President Dick Cheney to force Interior officials to toe the line.LiNeBrEaKThe result killed more than 10,000 salmon -- exactly what the administration's own scientists predicted.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Advanced car battery makers seek juice from stimulus plan  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	856 words  	WASHINGTON _ The U.S. is struggling to catch up with China, Japan and Korea in a race to build the advanced batteries needed to power the electric cars of the future.LiNeBrEaKThe latest setback came last week, when General Motors picked a Korean company over an American rival to build lithium ion batteries for GM's Chevy Volt, which is due on the market late next year.LiNeBrEaKLithium ion is the current hot technology to replace the familiar lead-acid batteries used in most cars today, and the newer nickel-metal hydride batteries in hybrid electric vehicles, such as Toyota's popular Prius. LiNeBrEaKThe National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture intends to ask the U.S. government for as much as $2 billion in grants and loans during the next five years to jump-start the American lithium ion industry, while creating thousands of jobs in the process.LiNeBrEaKThe alliance, a group of 14 U.S. battery manufacturers that was formed in December, hopes it will be funded as part of the stimulus package proposed by Congress and the incoming Obama administration. Electric cars reduce the demand for oil and contribute less to global warming.LiNeBrEaKLithium ion is an extremely light metal atom that's lost or gained an electron and can be used to produce an electric current. Small lithium ion batteries are widely used in cell phones, power tools and laptop computers, but aren't yet ready for mass use in cars.LiNeBrEaKThe battery gap has major implications for the health of the U.S. auto industry and, more broadly, for U.S. competitiveness in the world.LiNeBrEaK"For 20 years, the United States has sat idly and waited for foreign markets to become the leaders in lithium ion technology," said Alan Eishafei, chief executive of MicroSun Technologies of Lisle, Ill.LiNeBrEaKExperts say a moderately priced battery with enough power and endurance may be the key to survival as the industry attempts the difficult transition from gasoline engines to an electric future.LiNeBrEaK"Whoever makes the batteries will one day make the cars," said James Greenberger, an attorney for the battery alliance. "If we don't secure a supply, we'll be at the mercy of foreign suppliers _ not just for the battery but for everything else that goes into a car."LiNeBrEaKAsian firms, backed by heavy government subsidies, currently dominate the growing advanced battery market. The U.S. has no large-scale domestic manufacturer, and must import almost all the lithium ion "cells" that make up the battery, said Greenberger, a lawyer with Reed Smith LLP in Chicago.LiNeBrEaK"Electric engines will help break our reliance on petroleum," Greenberger said. "They are cleaner and much more efficient than the internal combustion engine."LiNeBrEaKA123 Systems of Watertown, Mass., the company that lost the Chevy Volt contract, had recently applied for a $1. 84 billion loan from the Energy Department to open a large battery assembly plant in the Detroit area.LiNeBrEaKGM announced on Jan. 12, however, that it would buy lithium ion cells from LG Chem of Seoul, South Korea. The cells will be manufactured in Korea and assembled into battery packs at a new facility that GM will build in Michigan. Robert Lutz, a GM vice chairman, said that his company preferred the Korean design.LiNeBrEaK"LG Chem has massive support from the Korean government," Lutz said at the Detroit Auto Show. "Korea recognizes that advanced battery technology is a key component of the country's competitiveness."LiNeBrEaKAmerican lithium ion backers acknowledge that their batteries face a number of problems before they can be widely used in cars and trucks. They include cost, endurance and the need for a nationwide infrastructure of recharging stations.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Department has set a target price of $1,700 to $3,400 for an all-electric car battery that could go 40 miles on a full charge.LiNeBrEaKThe lithium ion battery in the Chevy Volt is believed to cost significantly more than that, but the price should go down as more vehicles are sold. GM said the first Volts are expected to sell for about $35,000.LiNeBrEaKTheoretically, lithium ion batteries could be recharged in a home or office garage. Public charging stations can be set up in parking lots and shopping malls. Stations are currently being installed in Portland, Ore.; Boulder, Colo.; and San Jose, Calif.LiNeBrEaK"This offers new business opportunities _ charging stations at Starbucks or Wal-Mart," said Michael Brylawski, a vehicle efficiency expert at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental policy organization in Snowmass, Colo.LiNeBrEaKBrylawski acknowledged that it's easy to install a few dozen recharging stations, but hundreds of thousands eventually will be required. "That's very different than (what) we have now," he said.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Global warming: As climate change turns up the heat, how can our gardens survive?  	LIFESTYLE  	1253 words  	Jan. 18--Climate change promises hotter temperatures, heavier downpours and more intense hurricanes -- and changes in our gardens.LiNeBrEaKScientists predict that in the near future the southeastern United States will be wetter, but Florida may be drier. That could mean more wildfires and more stress on the water supply even though water restrictions are already in place.LiNeBrEaKWe can help our gardens adapt by modifiying the design as well as changing our practices.LiNeBrEaKWe've already seen our warm weather move north. In 2006, the Arbor Day Foundation revisited the U.S. Department of Agriculture's plant hardiness zones, which indicate the lowest temperatures in a given area. While South Florida remains in Zone 10 a and 10 b (lows are 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit), Zone 10 has made a substantial northward move (see map), reaching Brevard County from Palm Beach County on the east coast, and Hillsborough/Pinellas counties from Charlotte on the west coast. LiNeBrEaKWith these weather extremes, we must adapt and change our gardens. But how? We can plant more natives, increase our tree canopy for both carbon dioxide absorption and the protection of plants that need extra humidity and moisture. We also may become more selective with exotic plants.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, plan before we plant.LiNeBrEaKThe right plant selection is crucial. Our native plants, which evolved to survive and thrive here, should be at the top of your planting list. Plants of the wider Caribbean are good candidates as well.LiNeBrEaKCaribbean palms can thrive here -- wonderful Cuban palms in the genus Copernicia, such as the Bailey palm, Copernicia baileyana, and the petticoat palm, Copernicia macroglossa, and Copernicia fallaensis, which is larger than Bailey.LiNeBrEaKMany palms are drought-tolerant once they become established. But rain-forest palms need a well-protected area with high humidity. You can create such areas with large trees, windbreaks and other foliage, but you'll have to work at it.LiNeBrEaKRein in the rain forest. Or, rather, relegate rain-forest plants to the microclimate beneath a big shade tree where temperatures are more even and humidity is higher. They'll love residing together.LiNeBrEaKWith our present restrictions of twice weekly sprinkling, it's difficult to justify using water-thirsty plants such as impatiens for winter color. Instead, plant native wildflowers. Indian blanket, coreopsis (our state wildflower), verbena and goldenrod are good examples.LiNeBrEaKPut the right plant in the right place. Don't plant saplings that will grow into large trees beneath power lines.LiNeBrEaKGroup plants with similar water needs. Water-thirsty plants should be near the house or in containers; those with moderate needs can be placed where your irrigation system can hit them twice a week (or better, where a micro-irrigation system can be used); native trees and shrubs that seldom have to be watered except in an extended drought can hold down the perimeter.LiNeBrEaKCheck the South Florida Water Management District website (www.sfwmd.gov), linking to Water Conservation for lists of "water-wise" trees, shrubs and groundcovers as well as hints on how to be "yardsmart."LiNeBrEaKTropical fruit trees are good candidates for climate-change gardening. Mangoes don't need much watering in the dry season, so take them off the water grid, says Richard Campbell, senior curator of tropical fruit at Fairchild. Citrus should be watered well every seven to 10 days when there is little rainfall. Mature carambolas and lychees need watering twice a week if no rain occurs. Key limes are drought-tolerant.LiNeBrEaKRecreate a little bit of Florida in your yard. Creating habitats is more important than ever, as plants are not the only things under stress. Leave a standing dead palm or pine as home for woodpeckers, owls and even parrots. Find a place for a pond, even a small one. Plant a butterfly garden, and include nectar-filled flowers (the native shrub Hamelia patens is a perfect example of a flowering shrub that attracts butterflies and hummingbirds) as well as some larval plants for the caterpillars. A butterfly garden, by the way, will provide nectar for beneficial insects, such as tiny wasps that parasitize unwanted insects such as ficus whitefly.LiNeBrEaKHammocks are our tropical evergreen forests. When fire is excluded from pine rocklands, hammock trees will naturally move in and create more humid conditions. They bring with them a suite of plants, including gumbo limbo, live oak, satinleaf, pigeon plum and other trees, as well as wild coffees, ferns, bromeliads and orchids. Matheson Hammock Park in Coral Gables and Secret Woods in Broward County are good places to experience these remnants and get ideas for how to plant them.LiNeBrEaKJoyce and Don Gann, who are retired from owning a native plant nursery and tomato farming, had a 2  1/2 -acre parcel of nursery adjacent to their hammock in Goulds that they restored to hammock beginning in 1994, two years after Hurricane Andrew. They planted trees that were rejects from the nursery, without a particular plan in mind. After the trees, shrubs followed. Today, plants have established themselves so well they are reproducing and there's not a sign that this once was a bean field.LiNeBrEaKThe habitat most critically needed is pine rockland, which includes South Florida pines, palmettos, Bahama cassia, silver palms, white indigo berry and many more examples. The Center for Tropical Plant Conservation at Fairchild has launched a "Connect to Protect" project in order to create corridors and "stepping stones" among isolated pine rockland remnants. You can create a small connection in a corner of your yard.LiNeBrEaKTo get started with a pineland garden, go to www.fairchildgarden.org and click the Center for Tropical Plant Conservation link. Then link to Connect to Protect, and you'll even find nurseries that carry pineland plants.LiNeBrEaKIf you live on a lakefront, try using native wetland plants to frame your view of the water. Paurotis or Everglades palms need a nearby water source, and they grow tall enough to serve as the upper canopy. Wax myrtle, pond apples, buttonbush, leather ferns, cypress trees, pop ash and beach lilies can create a beautiful setting and give sustenance to birds and wildlife.LiNeBrEaKLook for a place to locate a pond. Researchers at Iowa State University have found that they are good carbon sinks, and a backyard pond not only benefits wildlife but reduces carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKImprove your energy efficiency with trees and shrubs. Plant hurricane-resistant trees and shrubs in order to reduce power bills. Trees that shade south-facing concrete-block walls during the afternoon will help reduce heat buildup.LiNeBrEaKCeiling fans and compact fluorescent lights can leverage the effort.LiNeBrEaKSelect wind-resistant trees. If hurricanes become more frequent, our gardens must become more wind-resistant.LiNeBrEaKSupple palms and small palms are hurricane survivors, but they must have complementary canopy trees that provide adequate shade.LiNeBrEaKWind-resistant trees include buttonwood, wild tamarind, gumbo-limbo, dahoon holly, ironwood, lignum vitae, sweetbay magnolia, live oak, paradise tree, pigeon plum, pond apple, pond cypress, stoppers and palms from areas that experience hurricanes.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Newcomer to Keys is unwelcome, uncouth: The non-native lionfish has caused ecological havoc everywhere it has spread. Now it has reached the Keys.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	874 words  	Jan. 18--Becky Fowler was shipwreck-diving 66 feet below the surface, exploring a watery paradise, when she came face to face with a four-inch-long, zebra-striped Cujo of the deep.LiNeBrEaKYes, the dreaded lionfish has made its way to the Florida Keys. Fowler's discovery, confirmed a few days later by divers who captured and dissected the creature, has sent shivers through the Keys' fishing and tourism industries.LiNeBrEaKJust as pythons have disturbed the natural ecosystem of the Everglades, the lionfish could someday become a scourge of the Keys. A Bluto Blutarsky of the water kingdom, it will eat anything it can cram into its mouth -- sea horses, crustaceans and all manner of native fish -- and is a breeding machine. LiNeBrEaKAlso, it stings divers, painfully.LiNeBrEaK'We knew this 'perfect predator' was coming," said Lisa Mitchell, executive director of the Key Largo-based Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF), which responded to Fowler's discovery. "We just didn't know when."LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish is a native of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but was introduced to Atlantic waters 16 years ago. Some blame the ballast of sea-going vessels. Others cite selfish aquarium owners, who dump the fish when they outgrow their tanks.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of the culprit, the lionfish has since caused ecological havoc on fragile Atlantic ecosystems already burdened by overfishing, pollution and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's another huge challenge for the tropical marine ecosystem, on par with habitat degradation and overfishing," said Dave Score, superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. "Lionfish are altering the diversity of an area that has taken hundreds of thousands of years to adapt and evolve."LiNeBrEaKAnd, of course, with the Keys heavily dependent on tourism, diving and recreational and commercial fishing, it is an economic threat as well as an environmental one.LiNeBrEaKTrue, only one fish has been found thus far. But the plague of Everglades Burmese pythons likely began with a single snake. Then a second. Then, a bacchanal of breeding and -- voila! -- snakes are devouring alligators whole.LiNeBrEaK"Lionfish are eating their way through the [Atlantic] reefs like a plague of locusts," said Mark Hixon, a coral reef ecology expert at Oregon State University. "This may well become the most devastating marine invasion in history."LiNeBrEaKLong before the South Carolina accountant made her discovery while diving the Benwood shipwreck off Key Largo's Atlantic Coast, the Keys had been bracing for this day. It had created an official response plan and held workshops to educate the public.LiNeBrEaKNow that the fish has arrived, Keys officials will be taking the matter "very seriously," said Scott Zimmerman, executive director of the Florida Keys Commercial Fishermen's Association. The public is asked to report sightings to the REEF office at 305-852-0030.LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish hardly looks like the menace it is. It grows to a maximum of 20 inches long. Because of its exotic features -- the zebra striping and a feathery mane of fins -- it is a favorite for aquarium keepers.LiNeBrEaK"Lionfish are the No. 2 aquarium fish in the U.S., behind clownfish," said Bruce Purdy, owner of Davie-based Blackbeard's Cruises, which hosts Bahamas diving excursions.LiNeBrEaKBut the beauty is a beast.LiNeBrEaKThe first documented Atlantic sightings came days after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when six lionfish were spotted in Biscayne Bay and traced to a private aquarium swept away from a Miami waterfront home.LiNeBrEaKIt is believed that lionfish hitched a ride north on the Gulf Stream, up the East Coast, as far as Rhode Island. Other currents and eddies led the lionfish to Bermuda, then to the Bahamas and farther south to the Caribbean as well as Belize. The lionfish was "completing a loop" by reaching the Keys, said Lad Akins, REEF's director of special projects.LiNeBrEaKThey are fearless fish, their bravado bolstered by the poison released by their sharp spines. Cold water appears to be their only real enemy. Otherwise, they thrive at depths ranging from a few inches to 500 feet.LiNeBrEaKThe lionfish's coloring allows it to strike its prey from the protective camouflage of a coral reef.LiNeBrEaKLionfish eat like no other fish in the Atlantic, using their fanned-out fins to block escape by prey. They devour commercial fish, such as grouper and snapper juveniles, as well as those species' food supplies.LiNeBrEaKJust how voracious are they?LiNeBrEaKIn a 2008 University of Oregon State study, the first to quantify the severity of the situation, research teams observed one lionfish gorging on 20 small fish in less than 30 minutes.LiNeBrEaKScientists fear the lionfish will kill off helpful species, such as algae-eating parrotfish, allowing seaweed to overtake reefs.LiNeBrEaKIf the lionfish multiply, Mitchell of REEF offers one possible remedy: Fishermen could start to catch them for commercial sale.LiNeBrEaK"They are delicious," she said. "Kind of like hogfish, but not quite as mild."

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	The Miami Herald Andres Oppenheimer column: Obama's Latin American priority: energy  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	860 words  	Jan. 18--Here's my bet: The Obama administration's top priority in Latin America will be signing a hemispheric energy cooperation deal that -- if carried out -- would reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil, bolster U.S. ties with Brazil, and undermine Venezuela's petrodollar-fueled radicalism in the region.LiNeBrEaKIt's almost official, although they won't frame it that explicitly. Obama first proposed an "Energy Partnership of the Americas" in a May 2008 campaign speech and later advanced the idea to develop alternative fuels in the region in interviews with me and other journalists. LiNeBrEaKLast week, Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton elevated the idea to a maximum regional priority during her confirmation hearings. In her opening statement, when she got to Latin America -- almost at the end of her foreign policy priorities -- her most specific proposal was "taking up the president-elect's call for a new Energy Partnership of the Americas."LiNeBrEaKLater at the hearing, when asked by the Senate panel about the Obama administration's plans for Latin America, Clinton said: "We want to not only respond to the issues that are in the headlines," but to "seize the opportunities in Latin America, which is why the energy partnership that the president-elect has suggested has so much potential."LiNeBrEaKSo what's this plan all about? I asked people in Obama's transition team. Is it any different from George W. Bush's much-publicized 2007 cooperation agreement with Brazil to jointly develop ethanol and other alternative fuels in the two countries, as well as in Central America and the Caribbean?LiNeBrEaKSources close to the Obama plan tell me that there are several differences.LiNeBrEaKFirst, the cooperation agreement between Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was a "memorandum of understanding," which, in diplomatic lingo, often means a declaration of goodwill. The Obama plan would become a U.S. law and a regional treaty, which means that it would include U.S. funding for feasibility studies and concrete projects and would have a broader geographic and political scope.LiNeBrEaKSecond, in addition to meeting Obama's domestic goal of reducing U.S. oil dependency and fighting global warming, it would shift U.S. policy away from its current narrow focus on free trade agreements and anti-drug efforts.LiNeBrEaK"There is free trade fatigue and anti-drug fatigue in Latin America," a senior staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told me. "Energy opens a new path to relations with the hemisphere and is consistent with the president-elect's overall energy and climate change objectives."LiNeBrEaKThird, it would cement U.S. relations with Brazil. While the United States currently has free trade agreements with Mexico, Central America, Peru and Chile, as well as anti-drug treaties with Colombia and other Andean countries, it has no such institutional bond with South America's most important country, sources close to the plan say.LiNeBrEaKFourth, the plan is likely to adopt several proposals contained in a $59 million "Western Hemisphere Energy Compact" bill that Sens. Dick Lugar, R-Ill., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., are expected to reintroduce before the April 17 Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago.LiNeBrEaKAmong other things, the Lugar-Dodd plan calls for U.S. funds to create mechanisms such as regional oil reserves or regional ethanol reserves; provide funding for feasibility studies that would allow countries in the region to look into whether they can create jobs and promote economic growth by creating solar or wind-based energy industries or by turning soybeans, sugar cane or other crops into biofuels.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, it could find an international mechanism to help Mexico's ailing state-run oil industry, which is constitutionally barred from accepting foreign investments in key oil production facilities. And with Brazil's active role, the plan could help build pipelines that would help countries such as Argentina and Chile overcome their chronic natural gas shortages.LiNeBrEaKMy opinion: It won't be easy. During the campaign, Obama opposed cutting U.S. import duties on Brazil's sugar cane ethanol. Also, with gasoline prices at their current lows, political pressures to achieve energy independence may diminish. And the monumental U.S. financial bailouts will leave little money for grand hemispheric programs, no matter what they are.LiNeBrEaKBut if Obama can persuade Latin American countries that there is something in it for them -- be it job-creating investments, energy diversification or economic and political independence from Venezuela's erratic President Hugo Chavez -- he may be onto something.LiNeBrEaKWe may move from regional free trade and anti-drug fatigue to a new stage of hemisphere-wide enthusiasm over development of environmentally safe alternative energies.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   Final Edition	MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. &lt;|&gt; World must work together  	S Special; Pg. 3  	405 words  	First PlaceLiNeBrEaK Grade 6LiNeBrEaKBy William P. EstyLiNeBrEaK Golda Meir SchoolLiNeBrEaK Today is the day that we must live together in peace. The world is fighting, the economy is falling, and our hope is dying. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. In his acceptance speech, he said, "Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace." Because of the problems in the world, we need to live together in peace sooner, rather than later. LiNeBrEaK The war in Iraq is causing many needless deaths. After 9-11, we had the world's sympathy on our side. Instead of just going into Afghanistan after al-Qaeda, we also marched into Iraq. Besides causing more deaths and costing lots of money, we also lost the goodwill of much of the world. We could have just stopped the threat in Afghanistan and lived in peace with Iraq. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught nonviolence to work against discrimination and violence toward African-Americans. Fighting violence with violence never works because each person thinks what the other person did to them was worse. We can choose peaceful ways to settle our problems. We need to live together in peace.LiNeBrEaK With the whole world together we can eliminate problems such as world hunger, poverty and global warming. Living in peace would give countries the chance to build their economies. However, if we all act like different continents instead of one joint world, these problems will be almost impossible to solve. Dr. King helped bring attention to the fact that people were poor and hungry. Today, we can help by donating to causes that help the less fortunate. We need to live together in peace.LiNeBrEaK We must give our children hope that they will live to see a brighter future. If we live in peace, the world will be better for the next generation and the next and the next. The next president of the United States, Barack Obama, says, "Yes we can!" Yes, we can change the world. We may be individuals, but together we are a community, a town, a city, a state, a country, a world and a family. We must live together in peace.LiNeBrEaK Together we could start to see less destruction and more creation, less war and more peace, less hate and more love. Now is the time for us to live together in peace!

The New York Times 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	Green Building Trend Picks Up Pace in County  	Section WE; Column 0; Westchester Weekly Desk; YONKERS; Pg. 2  	722 words  	  LIVING in a building with geothermal heat makes Garfield Hylton happy. He enjoys knowing his carbon footprint is smaller because he uses less energy in his apartment here.LiNeBrEaK  ''I'm a positive person, and this is a positive thing to be doing,'' said Mr. Hylton, 28, a network technology specialist who lives at 66 Main Street, Yonkers's first geothermally heated and cooled apartment building. The system will pay for itself in energy savings over 10 years, said Ken Dearden, the developer of 66 Main.LiNeBrEaK  The new Ossining Public Library and the almost completed Mount Kisco Public Library  also use geothermal heating and cooling systems. They are part of a green building trend -- one that uses energy-efficient materials and technologies and minimizes disruption to the environment -- that has accelerated in Westchester over the past two years. LiNeBrEaK  The economic slowdown accentuates this shift in construction practices, said Steven Winter, an energy and construction consultant in Norwalk, Conn.LiNeBrEaK  ''Commercial and speculative projects have fallen off, but school buildings, affordable housing, government buildings and health facilities are least affected, and these tend to be green projects,'' Mr. Winter said.   He was chairman of the United States Green Building Council  in 2000 when it released its  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, known as LEED, which  is a nationally recognized third-party certification process for the construction of green buildings.LiNeBrEaK  More than three dozen new building projects in Westchester have  sought  or completed LEED certification,  according to the Green Building Council, which is based in Washington.LiNeBrEaK  Building green in the county does not always mean building to LEED certification standards. Some local governments, like New Rochelle's and the county Department of Public Works, have committed to green building in principle but are not going for LEED sign-off because of extra costs of hiring consultants and paying certification fees.LiNeBrEaK  ''We are requiring all of our staff and consultants to provide us with a listing of options for the different levels of certification, and then we are analyzing the costs,'' said Ralph L. Butler, commissioner of public works for the county, who has begun offering LEED certification training to county engineers but has not adopted LEED standards.LiNeBrEaK  Reese Berman, the supervisor of the Town of North Castle, has been working with a team of county leaders on climate-change issues for the past few years and now, as a member of the Westchester Municipal Officials Association executive committee, is working on green guidance for local governments.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's hard when development is slow for towns to make this kind of legislation,'' said Ms. Berman, whose town has had to shelve plans for a new highway garage with solar panels. ''Unless there are really big incentives from the state or federal government, we are not going to see the kind of green initiatives we were hoping to see.''LiNeBrEaK  Yonkers, which has the most at stake in the county with Struever Fidelco Cappelli's $1. 6 billion redevelopment plan in the works, as well as other waterfront and downtown building proposals, has drafted the most aggressive green building standards in Westchester.LiNeBrEaK  ''We had heard that it was not going to be economically feasible,'' said Liam J. McLaughlin,  the Republican minority leader on the City Council, who  heads its Environmental Policy and Protection Committee. ''Then we talked to other developers and municipalities and found that the added expense is not that great.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Dearden, the developer of 66 Main, estimated that complying with LEED standards would have added up to 4 percent to his building costs.LiNeBrEaK  In a rare instance of unanimity, the Yonkers City Council is expected to pass a green building code this month that will require that most new construction, including the Struever Fidelco Cappelli project, comply with LEED standards, Mr. McLaughlin said.LiNeBrEaK  Mayor Phil Amicone  has not endorsed the law yet but is  likely  to support some form of green building code, said David Simpson, his spokesman.LiNeBrEaK  ''Especially in Yonkers, where we have the Hudson River and the Saw Mill River,'' Mr. Simpson said, ''we have to do the best thing to protect these environmental assets, at the same time that we are developing the city.''  	http://www.nytimes.com  	GREEN BUILDING (92%); GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); TRENDS (89%); CONSULTING SERVICES (88%); COUNTIES (87%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (87%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (78%); CONSTRUCTION (78%); HVAC SYSTEMS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (75%); LOW COST HOUSING SCHEMES (75%); PUBLIC LIBRARIES (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); SOLAR ENERGY (73%); CITY GOVERNMENT (71%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (68%); INFRASTRUCTURE (66%); ECONOMIC NEWS (53%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (50%)  				CONNECTICUT, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 18, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: A FIRST: Ken Dearden in 66 Main, which uses geothermal power.(PHOTOGRAPH BY SUSAN FARLEY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)                                		Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By ABBY GRUEN  	YONKERS   														
Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Hiring of 'Wilds' adviser is affront to taxpayers  	REVIEW and OPINION; Pg. F04  	471 words  	Upon hearing that we are in for some of the coldest temperatures in years, I was reminded that we are still very much in the throes of winter. But while we endure the chilly conditions, there is climate change going on in Harrisburg. LiNeBrEaKThe mercury is rising in Gov. Ed Rendell's office, as a thaw in the hiring freeze has apparently begun. In the midst of these difficult economic times, the governor has taken job creation to a new level by bringing on board defeated former 75th Legislative District state Representative Dan Surra as a senior adviser for the "Pennsylvania Wilds," a 12-county region of northern Pennsylvania being marketed as an outdoors destination. Surra, who was voted out of office after 18 years when he was beaten by Matt Gabler in the November General Election, will be tasked with balancing the region's tourism with the surging interest in drilling for natural gas.LiNeBrEaKRendell's office is calling the hiring a "wise investment." The governor is banking on Surra's experience in the area, as the 75th District is made up of all of Elk County and the northwest portion of Clearfield County. The clincher is Surra's $95,000 salary, which is more than he would have made had he remained in office.LiNeBrEaKI do not have a great deal of experience in the region of the state that is of concern here. But a simple look at a Pennsylvania map leads me to believe that there is sufficient land in the 12-county region to keep tourists from being told that their camp can be found by turning right after the third drilling site. Also, while I will not deny that a balance must be struck, I will not agree with the notion that there are not sufficient government entities already in place that can work together to achieve that desired balance.LiNeBrEaKThe people of Pennsylvania are being asked to do more with less. We as employees of the voters who send us into state government to work for them must do likewise. The hiring of Dan Surra is a slap in the face to hard-working taxpayers who are fighting to hold on to their jobs while the economy crumbles around them. It is a classic case of repetition of services and mutual back-scratching that sours our citizens on state government.LiNeBrEaKOn Feb. 2, Punxsutawney Phil will emerge from his den in northern Pennsylvania and make his prediction on our meteorological future, and there will be good-natured debate as to the accuracy of his prognostication.LiNeBrEaKThe following day, Rendell will emerge from his office with a budget address on our economic future, and I guarantee he will forecast more than six weeks of financial "winter." What follows will be not-so-good natured debate that questions how sincere he is about finding solutions to a huge budget shortfall when he can't follow his own directives about spending cuts.LiNeBrEaKROSEMARIE SWANGER is a republican representing Lebanon Country.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Obama's window of opportunity won't last long  	REVIEW and OPINION; Pg. F01  	867 words  	The results of the 2008 national elections and the unfolding economic crisis have given Barack Obama the support and resources necessary to launch a program of major policy change. The extent to which his leadership project will be successful depends in large part on the choices the new president will make during his first 100 days in office.LiNeBrEaKFew presidents in the past century have entered the Oval Office with such a leadership opportunity. In shattering the idea that Americans could never elect an African-American president, Obama received nearly 70 million votes, the highest popular vote total in history. He received 53 percent of the popular vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. He will have large, though not filibuster-proof, Democratic majorities in Congress. LiNeBrEaKThough his platform addressed dozens of issues, four major initiatives stood out: (1) a plan for economic growth that included tax cuts for the middle and working class; (2) proposals to help the U.S. achieve energy independence in 10 years, together with efforts to combat global warming; (3) a strategy to make health care more accessible and affordable; and (4) ideas for increasing educational opportunity.LiNeBrEaKIt is clear that the economy will dominate President Obama's first 100 days. The question is, what will happen to the rest of his domestic agenda? Before he goes forward, there are three key questions he must address.LiNeBrEaKFirst, how big should his agenda be? Scholars of presidential agenda-setting such as Paul Light of New York University argue that presidents should focus on only a few domestic issues in the first months of office. The model was President Reagan, who, like Obama, entered office during an economic downturn and focused exclusively on economic reform in his first year.LiNeBrEaKObama's potential agenda is large; however, it is likely that his early proposals on energy, climate change, health care and education will be tied to his economic stimulus plan. Spending on energy efficient buildings, creating green jobs in alternative energy, and computerizing all health records will be described in terms of infrastructure investment.LiNeBrEaKSecond, what should be the timing and sequence of introducing domestic initiatives? President Clinton followed the Reagan example to win congressional support for his economic program, but this forced him to delay introducing his health care reform plan until the fall of his first year. This proved a fatal decision.LiNeBrEaKWhether Obama will go further to include human investment proposals, such as increased funding for early childhood education or creating a new government healt insurance program, in his economic program is one of the most important decisions he will make. He must decide whether to address only the economic crisis in his first few weeks or to make his American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan the vehicle for comprehensive domestic reform.LiNeBrEaKThird, what strategy should be used to mobilize political support for the domestic program? When presidents have overwhelming party majorities in Congress as Lyndon Johnson did in 1964, they do not need help from the opposition; however, most first-year presidents need to build cross-party coalitions.LiNeBrEaKTo illustrate, Reagan overcame a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives by putting together a conservative coalition of Republicans and Southern, boll-weevil Democrats. By winning support from Ted Kennedy, George W. Bush was able to secure passage of No Child Left Behind.LiNeBrEaKThough he has spoken of wanting to bring sweeping bipartisan change to Washington, Obama will be tempted to push a more partisan program. Already some Democratic leaders in Congress have criticized his stimulus plan for providing too much in tax cuts in order to placate Republicans.LiNeBrEaKTo succeed in moving his domestic agenda through Congress in the first hundred days, Obama will have to be disciplined, strong, and lucky. He will have to tell powerful elements of his electoral coalition, such as labor unions, that they should be patient.LiNeBrEaKAnd, he must hope that unexpected international events or scandals will not drown out his message of reform. We should remember that as the new president deals with what is arguably the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, he must simultaneously confront challenges in the Middle East and the ongoing threat of terrorism.LiNeBrEaKEven if everything breaks his way, Obama will learn, as all modern presidents must, that the window for major domestic change does not remain open indefinitely. Inevitably supporters will be disappointed, the opposition party will make a stand, the media will resume its adversarial role, and the public will want instant results from a plan that even Obama's advisers say will take months, if not years, to implement.LiNeBrEaKGiven the historic nature of his ascension to the presidency, the enormous challenges that face him, and the best wishes of the nation for his success, Obama has the opportunity to join FDR and Reagan as an architect of a new political regime. But his defining moment will not last long.LiNeBrEaKDr. E.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Our leaders give advice to Obama  	A SECTION; Pg. A19  	1360 words  	Ed Rendell / Governor The governor said that he is eager for an "activist" government.LiNeBrEaKRendell said he hopes Obama will be a "progressive president who will use the power of government to help bring about change in our social fabric.LiNeBrEaK"Things like universal health care for all Americans. A real policy on energy and the environment that switches us over to an alternative and renewable energy plan for the country that combats climate change. Progressive government that can stimulate growth in the economy and real jobs for America in both the green economy and the high-tech and research economies."LiNeBrEaKRendell is also anxious to see Obama "restore America's reputation in the international community. To have us rejoin that community, exert our moral leadership and bring about not only a true global economy but global understanding so that we can try to combat the problems that exist for the entire planet." --Charles ThompsonLiNeBrEaKPatricia Vance State Senator LiNeBrEaKVance said it is "imperative that the economy is stabilized and gets back on track. ... Many other problems and concerns pale in comparison to the fiscal problems the nation is facing."LiNeBrEaKShe said she supports offering temporary assistance to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages.LiNeBrEaK"I think the mortgage market has to become stabilized so the people who have made honest efforts to keep up with their payments but, knowingly or unknowingly, all of a sudden are faced with a huge increase in their rates can get temporary help or perhaps a chance to refinance," Vance said.LiNeBrEaK"We also need to see a loosening of credit so the average small businessperson has the ability to expand or reinvest in their companies. And if we're going to have another round of federally funded bailouts, we have to have greater accountability for where this money is going. Where did it go and did it produce results?"LiNeBrEaK--Charles ThompsonLiNeBrEaKMelvin Johnson // Chairman, Capital Region Fair Housing CouncilLiNeBrEaKJohnson would like to see a public works project, similar to the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, one that would build bridges and roads.LiNeBrEaK"My fear however is that, if not administered properly, it will not impact the people it will be designed to help," said Johnson, who is also president of M.T. Johnson Group LLC.LiNeBrEaK"It should help not only the people who are unemployed right now, but also some of the traditionally underemployed individuals. I think we've got to reach further than putting people back to work who recently lost jobs," said Johnson, whose company does construction and diversity consulting. "I think any kind of economic stimulus should benefit people from the bottom to the top and from the top to the bottom."LiNeBrEaKAny new public works project must adhere to federal guidelines on hiring minorities and women, laws rarely enforced, Johnson said.LiNeBrEaK--Diana FishlockLiNeBrEaKPaul Navarro // President, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaK"Like everyone else out there, we're hoping the stimulus package reaches the communities in a quick time frame to get everybody back in the working ranks," said Navarro of Navarro and Wright Consulting Engineers Inc. in New Cumberland.LiNeBrEaK"We'd like to see some Hispanics be appointed to cabinet positions where he would be more in tune with the needs of the Hispanic community," Navarro said..LiNeBrEaK"I think the other area that still needs addressed is the immigration reform," Navarro said.LiNeBrEaKIf illegal immigrants doing farm work were given guest-worker status, both the immigrants and farmers would benefit, he said.LiNeBrEaK--Diana FishlockLiNeBrEaKStephen R. Reed // Harrisburg MayorLiNeBrEaKReed said economic growth over the next two years could be supercharged by the federal stimulus package.LiNeBrEaKHe is requesting $700 million for the city.LiNeBrEaKEven if Reed only gets some of that amount, he said residents would soon see results in the form of streets under construction, more police on the streets and new local jobs.LiNeBrEaKAmong the Harrisburg requests: $7. 2 million for repaving 75 streets, $3. 1 million to hire 50 police officers, $9 million for a citywide recreation center and skating rink, $2 million for bus stops with LED signs and $98 million for the southern gateway project at Paxton and Second streets.LiNeBrEaKThe mayor also seeks $22 million for the city's two downtown hotel Proposals. Reed said both projects were put on hold as a direct result of the rocky economy, which tightened up financing and inflated commodity prices. --John LuciewLiNeBrEaKLinda Thompson //LiNeBrEaKHarrisburg city council presidentLiNeBrEaKThompson expressed both enthusiasm and caution about the impact of a potential spending spree on the city.LiNeBrEaK"We must think through these projects with the high spirit of stimulating our local economy for the purposes of creating sustainable jobs to stabilize our local economy," she said.LiNeBrEaKThompson said she would revive a plan by Brinjac Engineering for a $50 million upgrade of the city's wastewater treatment plant to meet nitrate removal standards. However, that plan was discarded last year by the Harrisburg Authority board appointed by the council in favor of purchasing credits to continue to discharge nitrates into the Susquehanna River.LiNeBrEaKThompson also would spend up to $100 million to upgrade the city's network of sewer pipes. "No matter how many new schools, businesses and new housing we create, if our underground current system is outdated and insufficient to handle the growth it defeats the purpose," she said.LiNeBrEaK-- John LuciewLiNeBrEaKDr. Roger Longenderfer // PinnacleHealth System CEOLiNeBrEaKLongenderfer said he hopes Obama continues a push to cover uninsured children. The logical first step is to reauthorize the existing State Children's Health Insurance Program, he said.LiNeBrEaK"If you can't provide good access to health care for children, you're just setting them up for long-term health problems," he said.LiNeBrEaKIt's also urgent to find ways to cover the millions of uninsured adults, he said.LiNeBrEaKThat includes a growing group of people losing health insurance because of losing jobs.LiNeBrEaKAnother issue for Longenderfer is rebalancing payments from programs such as Medicare. Some treatments are reimbursed at very high levels, causing too many providers to offer those services. Other important treatments and specialists, including primary care doctors, are underpaid, he said.LiNeBrEaKAlso, Longenderfer is hoping for more funding toward preventative care and toward research showing which medical treatments are truly effective. -- David WennerLiNeBrEaKMike Fiaschetti //LiNeBrEaKHighmark Inc., senior vice presidentLiNeBrEaKHighmark Inc., a Pennsylvania-based health insurer, would like to see Obama eliminate a practice known as "medical underwriting," said Fiaschetti.LiNeBrEaKUnder medical underwriting, a health insurer looks at a person's health history and uses it to set premiums or to reject coverage request.LiNeBrEaKHighmark believes it's better to put people in large pools and spread costs evenly. That helps keep coverage affordable for the sick, and also prevents small businesses from seeing dramatic spikes in premiums when employees get sick.LiNeBrEaKHighmark wants to see government help in implementing health care information technology, which the insurer believes will improve medical quality and financial efficiency.LiNeBrEaKThe company wants a cap on pain and suffering awards in malpractice lawsuits.LiNeBrEaKHighmark also hopes for an alternative to the present system of dealing with medical errors in court. --David WennerLiNeBrEaKGerald Kohn // Harrisburg School District superintendentLiNeBrEaKIf Barack Obama wants to create jobs, Kohn has a $75 million project for him: A career technology academy for the 9,500-student district. It would be built on the district-owned vacant tract in Susquehanna Twp.LiNeBrEaKThe center would arm students with in-demand skills -- everything from skilled construction trades to information technology jobs, engineering fields and green energy, Kohn said.LiNeBrEaKThe project is part of the school district's $217 million request for funding under the federal stimulus package being formed in Washington.LiNeBrEaKKohn said he hopes Obama can reverse the decline of public education by committing more resources and reducing the reliance on standardized testing.LiNeBrEaK"The way we are going, we are about to give up on public education for the lack of funding and the overreliance on tests," Kohn said.LiNeBrEaK-- John Luciew		ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (89%); CONSTRUCTION (87%); HEAVY and CIVIL CONSTRUCTION (85%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); HOUSING ASSISTANCE (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (76%); WORKPLACE DIVERSITY (76%); ECONOMIC DEPRESSION (75%); BAILOUTS (73%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (72%); MORTGAGE BANKING and FINANCE (71%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (71%); HOMEOWNERS (71%); MORTGAGE REFINANCING (70%); FAIR LENDING (70%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (70%); MORTGAGE LOANS (70%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (70%); INFRASTRUCTURE (69%); BRIDGES and TUNNELS (61%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (61%); BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (61%)  			BARACK OBAMA (95%); ED RENDELL (93%)  	PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 18, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTOPHOTO  		Newspaper  	2009 The Patriot News Co.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	Goodbye, Mr. Bush;  NO JOY FOR US 	EDITORIAL; ISSUE ONE; Pg. G-3  	242 words  	President George W. Bush, about to leave office, described his two-term presidency as a "joyous" time. Here's what the last eight years have brought us: an economy teetering on the brink of a depression, an unnecessary war in Iraq that is helping to bleed us dry and a war we're losing in Afghanistan, the shame of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, the pathetic response to Hurricane Katrina, the threat of global warming not only ignored but even denied, civil liberties disregarded and put in danger, the reputation of our country at an all-time low throughout the world and the list goes on. But for Mr. Bush, "Every day has been joyous." LiNeBrEaKIn a recent interview, President Bush was asked what achievement he is most proud of, and he responded that he's kept al-Qaida from having a safe haven in Iraq. When the interviewer noted that al-Qaida wasn't in Iraq until we invaded the country, he said, "So what?" That says it all.LiNeBrEaKOne has to wonder if "the boy in the bubble," as he once was described, understands the world or sees everything in terms of black and white.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush's father said his son can leave office "with his head held high." Given the current president's arrogance, I have no doubt that he will hold his head high as he leaves. But if he could remove his blinders and face reality, he would leave with his head forever bowed in disgrace.LiNeBrEaKGoodbye and good riddance, Mr. President.

LiNeBrEaKCelebrated for his discovery of oxygen, the process later called photosynthesis and soda water, Priestley was also a controversial theologian and political thinker.LiNeBrEaKHe had a profound impact on his native England and the fledgling United States, his home for the last decade of his life.LiNeBrEaKSteven Johnson, the author of "Interface Culture: How New Technology Transforms the Way We Create and Communicate," here uses Priestley's life to explore and celebrate the space that connected science, religion and politics in the late 18th century.LiNeBrEaKAlthough occasionally overheated and not always original, his account of a world we have lost is accessible and engaging.LiNeBrEaKThe great minds of the Enlightenment, including Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, learned from the ascent of science that society could improve "if the light of reason was allowed to shine upon it ?," Johnson points out.LiNeBrEaKWith Priestley, they grasped the political power of the air pump and the electrical machine.?LiNeBrEaKIn addition to invoking "the spirit of the age,"?Johnson credits the emergence and circulation of so many revolutionary ideas at one time to the unstructured, cross-disciplinary environment in which?"dabblers and amateurs"?worked.LiNeBrEaKPriestley's roving intelligence,? he acknowledges, was better-suited to exploding old conventions than setting forth new paradigms. ?LiNeBrEaKPriestley's ideas, Johnson points out, were nurtured, spread and sustained by an increasingly robust information network, the Enlightenment era's ecosystem. Whether they are disseminated through clubs, correspondence, publications or the World Wide Web, ideas differ from energy in one fundamental respect: the supply of energy is finite, while ideas can gather strength as they "attract the attention of the ingenious."?LiNeBrEaKThe restoration of Charles II, Newton's theory of gravity and the South Sea Bubble, Johnson proclaims, with a straight face, occurred, in part, because Englishmen had developed a taste for coffee and a fondness for shoptalk in coffeehouses.LiNeBrEaKReplacing alcohol as the daytime drug of choice, coffee improves cognitive function. Create enough caffeine abusers in your society and you'll be statistically more likely to launch an Age of Reason.?LiNeBrEaKAs he embraces the "new openness" of the Enlightenment, Johnson sends a shot across the bow of American conservatives.LiNeBrEaKVoters, Johnson insists, should repudiate any politician who pushes a policy agenda without a good grasp of atomic energy, global warming, evolution and stem cell research.LiNeBrEaKFor better and worse, of course, specialization is here to stay.LiNeBrEaKJohnson admits that the Enlightenment world view may well be obsolete, especially as more and more ?progressives conclude that catastrophe is imminent.LiNeBrEaKJohnson maintains, passionately and persuasively, that to disconnect the timeless insights of science and faith from the transitory world of politics, to give up the sublime view of progress and to rely on the old institutions without conjuring new ones is to betray the core and connected values that Priestley shared with the American founders.LiNeBrEaKAnd that Priestley's legacy, the ability to understand life with ever-increasing precision, can be cause for hope that radical change is possible.LiNeBrEaKb&gt; "THE INVENTION OF AIR: A STORY OF SCIENCE, FAITH, REVOLUTION AND THE BIRTHLiNeBrEaKOF AMERICA"LiNeBrEaK/b&gt;LiNeBrEaKBy Steven JohnsonLiNeBrEaKRiverhead Books ($25. 95)		POLITICS (90%); RELIGION (89%); BOOK REVIEWS (79%); ASTRONOMY and SPACE (78%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (70%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (66%); STEM CELL RESEARCH (50%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (50%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  					January 20, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: Gilbert Stuart's portrait of Joseph Priestly  		Newspaper  	2009 P.G.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	How Europe can break Russia s gas grip  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 4  	740 words  	BLOOMINGTON, Ind.LiNeBrEaKMANY EUROPEANS have been learning a hard lesson: It s better to be upstream than downstream in a shared gas pipeline.LiNeBrEaKWhile Russia and Ukraine quarreled over payments for Russian gas, downstream customers felt the chill. Central and southeast European countries were especially hard-hit. Serbs and Bosnians plugged in electric space heaters to replace lost home-heating gas. Gas shortages were blamed for a production halt at an auto-assembly plant in Hungary. Bulgaria and Slovakia contemplated restarting mothballed nuclear-power plants.LiNeBrEaKGas is flowing again, now that Russia and Ukraine have inked a new gas-delivery deal. However, the new agreement may prove as volatile as the gas itself. LiNeBrEaKRecent history shows that when Russia signs even richer gas contracts downstream, prior agreements between Russia and Ukraine are imperiled. A new standoff could emerge in 2011 or 2012 if not earlier.LiNeBrEaKTo protect themselves, some European countries could build liquefied-gas terminals so as to diversify imported gas supplies. This is a costly option that fails to advance energy self-reliance.LiNeBrEaKA much-awaited gas pipeline from the Caspian, designed to bypass Russian sources, is another medium-term palliative. As intermediate solutions, docking points for liquefied gas and the Caspian route are seductive but their benefits are fleeting. The long run demands a bolder vision.LiNeBrEaKThe recent U.S. presidential campaign featured two nominees pledging to invest boldly in alternative energy and to diversify America s energy supply. But Europe s current energy-supply crisis demonstrates vividly that energy diversification is even more urgent for Europe than for America.LiNeBrEaKWhat s more, unlike the U.S., most European countries are legally bound to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKNatural gas, while cleaner than coal and oil, does not measure up to the demands of the Kyoto Protocol nor the tougher treaty rules that will follow. For many European countries, the prospects of replacing Russian gas with substitutes like wind energy, solar and biogas make good environmental and economic sense and, if scaled up, could largely replace gas delivered from Russia via Ukraine.LiNeBrEaKElectricity production in Europe, particularly in new power plants, relies heavily on natural gas. Renewable energy could eventually replace much of this supply at a reasonable cost with fewer environmental problems.LiNeBrEaKConsider solar s prospects. Italy and Turkey, hurt by the latest gas dispute, are well bathed in the sun s energy. But this essentially free energy source is unharnessed. Bulgaria should also set its sights skyward. As a new European Union country, it is eligible for grants and other subsidies from Brussels that could help its solar energy industry leapfrog past neighbors who rely on heavily-polluting coal.LiNeBrEaKRussian gas importers in southern and southeastern Europe are also major producers of another important but mostly untapped energy source: rice husks. Too often discarded as waste, rice husks are rich in hydrogen and are ingredients in the emerging synthetic natural gas industry.LiNeBrEaKProduction of biomass crops could revolutionize European agriculture and help repair Europe s battered image in world trade discussions. Today, European farmers receive billions of euros in export subsidies.LiNeBrEaKEurope s heavily protected sugar-beet industry stifles Africa s trade in cane sugar, and sugar beets yield little or no byproduct for biomass energy. If agricultural subsidies are an unavoidable political reality, than they should support production of biomass crops that have little or no value for export but are vital for domestic energy security.LiNeBrEaKProduction of substitutes for natural gas in Europe can be justified on many levels, from agricultural-policy reform to environmental treaty obligations, not to mention energy security. But the latter resonated particularly loudly this past winter as steam lines cooled off and generators blinked out for European customers.LiNeBrEaKEuropean countries that depend on Russian gas, tired of the games played at the front of the supply line, can eventually leave that line and determine their own energy futures, even as they tackle other problems such as unfair trade practices and climate change.LiNeBrEaKMatthew R. Auer ( mauer@indiana.edu) is a professor of public and environmental affairs at Indiana University.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Studies shed light on ecosystems  response to change  	NEWS; Local; Pg. 4  	1959 words  	Two recent studies by scientists at the University of Rhode Island shed more light on the sensitivities of ecosystems to climate change and varying inputs of nutrients.LiNeBrEaKOne study by oceanographer John King and a collaborator at the Geological Survey of Canada shows that the Great Lakes have reacted dramatically to past changes in the climate.LiNeBrEaKScientists were aware of great fluctuations in Great Lakes water levels in the past, according to King, but believed they were due to the movement of glaciers. But the new study finds that the last time the lake levels fell dramatically   some 20 meters   was between 7,900 and 7,500 years ago. The cause was a climate so dry even the Niagara River ran dry.LiNeBrEaK People used to say that the oceans are so big, we can dump whatever we want in them and nothing will happen,  said King, whose study was published last month in the journal EOS.  They thought of the Great Lakes in the same way, that the system is too large to be sensitive to climate variations. But now we know that to be untrue.  LiNeBrEaKA second study by Autumn Oczkowski, a doctoral student, found that due to increased runoff of sewage and fertilizers the fisheries in the delta of Egypt s Nile River have recovered from virtual collapse.LiNeBrEaKShe used stable isotopes of nitrogen to show that 60 to 100 percent of the fishery production was supported by nutrients from fertilizer and sewage.LiNeBrEaKBefore construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1965, the Nile flooded its delta each fall, irrigating agricultural land and carrying nutrients out to the Mediterranean, where the nutrients supported a large fishery. When the dam ended the flooding, the fishery collapsed.LiNeBrEaKOczkowski said farmers responded by dramatically increasing their use of fertilizers. A population boom also triggered expansion of public water and sewer systems.LiNeBrEaKNow, fish landings are three times the levels that were recorded in the pre-dam days, indicating that nutrients from people have more than replaced those formally carried by flooding.LiNeBrEaKOczkowski said her findings raise questions among scientists concerned about adding too many nutrients from people into local waterways.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, after the Greenwich Bay fish kill in 2003, the State of Rhode Island ordered many sewage treatment plant operators to reduce their output of nitrogen into Narragansett Bay, using processes that cost millions of dollars.LiNeBrEaK We re programmed in the West to think of nutrient enrichment of coastal systems as bad,  Oczkowski said.  But the Egyptians don t think it s a bad thing. For them, it s producing tons of fish and feeding millions of hungry people. It s forcing us to reconsider whether we can say that nutrient inputs are always a bad thing. LiNeBrEaKOczkowski s research will be reported in the Jan. 21 online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.LiNeBrEaKPets focus of disaster summitLiNeBrEaKIn partnership with the Department of Environmental Management, the Rhode Island Disaster Animal Response Team has received a $20,000 Emergency Preparedness Initiative grant from the State Animal Response Team and PetSmart Charities Inc. The grant will be used to improve care for pets, farm livestock and wildlife animals in disasters, which could range from storms or floods to fires and oil spills. The grant will finance a two-day summit at the University of Rhode Island s Bay Campus on Friday and Saturday and assure national certification and continued development of RIDART.LiNeBrEaKThe grant requires a state match, and DEM has fulfilled this requirement by purchasing a pair of trailers full of equipment and supplies that will be used for pet sheltering in a state emergency.LiNeBrEaKOn Friday from 10: 30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the URI Coastal Institute in Narragansett, the first day of the summit will focus on the dairy industry. Managers and owners of all Rhode Island dairies, as well as processing, transportation and regulatory agency staff, are invited to attend. .LiNeBrEaKThe second session will be held Saturday from 8: 30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and will focus on shelter and rescue of pets in an emergency. The morning sessions are geared toward current and prospective RIDART volunteers. The afternoon sessions are for people interested in learning more about leadership opportunities on the shelter management teams for the two state animal shelters.LiNeBrEaKThe summit is free and open to current and prospective RIDART volunteers. Advance registration is required. Register online at www.RIDART.org by using the link to the registration form on the RIDART calendar for Jan. 23 and 24. For information, call Richard Horwitz in DEM s Division of Agriculture at (401) 222-4700, ext 2411.LiNeBrEaKComments sought on dredging planLiNeBrEaKAt the request of the Town of New Shoreham, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is proposing to perform maintenance dredging of portions of Great Salt Pond on Block Island.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed work involves dredging portions of the 18-foot-deep mean lower low water entrance channel. According to project manager Michael Walsh, natural shoaling has reduced available depths to as little as 3. 5 feet MLLW.LiNeBrEaKHe said,  There is a particularly hazardous shoal at the eastern, or inner, end of the entrance channel, which is making navigation to and from the pond hazardous at all stages of the tide. LiNeBrEaKThe last complete maintenance dredging was performed in 1982. Emergency dredging efforts were performed in 2000 and 2004, in which 12,250 and 9,970 cubic yards of material respectively were removed from a hazardous shoal area and disposed of at a site on the west side of the island.LiNeBrEaKDisposal options, possible temporary adverse effects on essential fish habitat and environmental assessment for the work is available for review at www.nae.usace.army.mil. Select  public services,  then  navigation  and then  public notices.  Public comments on the proposal may be emailed to nae-pn-nav@usace.army.mil by Thursday.LiNeBrEaKNature session set for childrenLiNeBrEaKThe Rhode Island Wild Plant Society and Blithewold Mansion and Garden in Bristol are co-sponsoring a nature journaling workshop for children on Saturday from 2 to 4 p.m. at Blithewold. Children are invited to explore a variety of nature printing techniques and create a handmade field guide with instructor Chris Kalina. The class is for students in grades 3 to 5. Acrylic paints will be used; therefore, appropriate clothing is recommended. Fee is $10 plus $5 material fee to be paid on the day of the workshop. Advance registration is required at www.blithewold.org. For information, call the society office at (401) 789-7497.LiNeBrEaKDEM to offer services at showLiNeBrEaKDepartment of Environmental Management staff will be at the Providence Boat Show at the Convention Center to renew current boat registrations, answer questions about registering new boats and have available boating safety information. Boat registrations can be renewed, by check only, on Friday, Jan. 30, from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday, Jan. 31, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sunday, Feb. 1, from noon to 5 p.m. There will also be a secured drop box at the boat show for boat registration renewals by check only. Renewal registrations left in the drop box will be processed on Monday, Feb. 2.LiNeBrEaKThe DEM s environmental police officers will host a center featuring information on boater education courses that are now mandatory for all boaters born after Jan. 1, 1986, who operate a boat with a motor greater than 10 horsepower, and for all operators, regardless of age, of personal watercraft. They will also offer safety tips, provide information about boating laws and equipment requirements and answer questions on boating, hunting, fishing and shellfishing.LiNeBrEaKIndividuals seeking summer employment can pick up application forms at the DEM s boat registration booth. The department is seeking seasonal employees 16 and older for such positions as park rangers, beach managers, seasonal laborers, lifeguards, lifeguard captains, program interns, recreation area clerks, student researchers and mosquito technicians.LiNeBrEaKPaid positions are also available as part of the department s minority internship program, which is designed to encourage minorities to pursue careers in the environmental field. The program gives qualified individuals a chance to explore jobs in agriculture, parks and recreation, fish and wildlife, air resources, waste management, forest environment, water resources, management services and policy and planning.LiNeBrEaKThe DEM has mailed out more than 22,000 boat registration renewal forms to boaters whose current registrations expire at the end of February.LiNeBrEaKForms for registering and titling new boats will be available at the show and are also available on the DEM Web site, www.dem.ri.gov. New boats must be registered at DEM headquarters, 235 Promenade St., Providence.LiNeBrEaKSolar energy firm holds open houseLiNeBrEaKAlteris Renewables, formerly SolarWrights and Solar Works Inc., is sponsoring an open house for business people and members of the public interested in solar energy from 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the Wolcott Eco-Office at 28 Wolcott St. in Providence.LiNeBrEaKThe company says it wants to celebrate its new name, a new year and  a new energy direction for our country.  It will offer locally made food and wine. For questions, call (401) 396-9901 or send an e-mail to kdewitt@alterisinc.comLiNeBrEaKSchools awarded Tisdale grantsLiNeBrEaKThe Environment Council of Rhode Island Education Fund recently announced the winners of the fourth-annual Loraine Tisdale Environmental Education Awards.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   All Editions	Mr. President;  Scholars weigh in on agenda for Obama;  Global warming	OPINION; Pg. O01  	966 words  	WE ARE PLEASED to see that President-elect Obama recognizes global warming as a serious threat. He is promoting renewable energy as part of the solution to climate change and has also expressed support for the Lieberman-Warner bill meant to confront global warming, which was defeated recently in Congress.LiNeBrEaKObama's focus on renewable energy is laudable, but his endorsement of the failed legislation, although well meaning, is misplaced. LiNeBrEaKIn fact, the measure's defeat may prove a blessing in disguise.LiNeBrEaKThis bill and many other proposals are based on unrealistic policies that cannot prevent harmful climate changes. As long as the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere continues to increase, global warming and resulting climate changes are bound to grow worse.LiNeBrEaKOne would expect climate policymakers to focus on reducing the gas levels in the air, but this is not the aim of the Lieberman-Warner bill or other current and proposed programs.LiNeBrEaKRather, they are designed only to cut existing emissions, called "business-as-usual" discharges, by a percentage-reduction rate over some number of years, regardless of whether these cutbacks will achieve any improvement in the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration.LiNeBrEaKFor example, California regulations would require vehicles to reduce gas emissions 30 percent by 2016, allowing the remaining 70 percent of business-as-usual discharges to increase gas levels in the air every year.LiNeBrEaKThe Lieberman-Warner bill called for cutting gas emissions in stages, culminating in a 66 percent reduction by 2050. This bill would have allowed a third of current business-as-usual discharges to continue in 2050, permitting larger emissions in the years up to that date.LiNeBrEaKAll of these first-step regulatory programs would allow persistent gas discharges to increase the atmospheric concentration every year. In short, these emissions-reduction programs would not decrease crucial greenhouse levels in the air; instead, they would only reduce the increases in annual greenhouse gas pollution.LiNeBrEaKEmissions-reduction approaches that do no more than reduce annual greenhouse gas increases, including cap-and-trade pollution credit schemes that many experts prefer, are merely first-step or interim measures that cannot achieve long-term climate change solutions.LiNeBrEaKA first step is only valuable if it is a step in the right direction.LiNeBrEaKWe believe a much better strategy would focus nearly all energy research, regulatory initiatives and financial investments on enabling a reasonably rapid but feasible transition to greenhouse gas-free technologies in as many economic contexts as possible.LiNeBrEaKThe technology needed to meet interim emissions-reduction targets, such as those in the Lieberman-Warner measure, will often be wholly different from the technology required to attain a carbon-free standard.LiNeBrEaKSmaller enginesLiNeBrEaKMotor vehicles, for example, can cut greenhouse gas discharges by using smaller engines and lighter materials, substituting biofuels for high-carbon dioxide petroleum, or by adopting hybrid engine designs.LiNeBrEaKBut these first-step modifications can go only so far in reducing greenhouse gas pollution. They can never approach the cleanliness of all-electric or hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.LiNeBrEaKIf we spend billions of dollars on first-step technology improvements, the funding available for carbon-free vehicles will be reduced. If auto manufacturers make first-step changes at relatively high costs, they will undoubtedly resist replacing these interim modifications with carbon-free designs.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Lieberman-Warner approach, we would have to pay the cumulative costs of first-step improvements, likely second-step improvements, and eventually, conversion to carbon-free technologies that are essential over the long term.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, implementing interim end-of-the-pipe pollution control devices is simply an expensive stop-gap measure that will ultimately be scrapped in favor of newer technologies, such as "carbon capture and storage" systems that would inject large quantities of greenhouse gases deep underground instead of letting the harmful gases reach the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThere is an international consensus that developed nations cannot overcome global warming without the cooperation of developing nations, including China and India, which rank among the five worst greenhouse gas polluters. Yet, developing countries will not agree to mitigation measures that would impede their pursuit of greater prosperity.LiNeBrEaKA first step of paying these states to adopt our emissions-reduction programs would neither enable economic development nor improve the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration.LiNeBrEaKThe only thing we could give poor nations that will meet their objectives and ours is greenhouse gas-free technologies that promote economic progress without exacerbating global warming.LiNeBrEaKDecentralized generatorsLiNeBrEaKRenewable energy technologies would be especially suitable for developing states because the power generators could be decentralized without the enormous cost of creating nationwide electricity networks.LiNeBrEaKAny genuine effort to combat global warming will evoke a political and economic Battle Royale. The new administration cannot afford to squander financial and political capital on first-step approaches that detract from our long-term needs.LiNeBrEaKCurrent and proposed first-step programs are diverting vital resources from development of greenhouse gas-free methods that can actually improve the critical atmospheric gas levels.LiNeBrEaKConverting the world's economies to primary reliance on greenhouse gas-free technologies will be difficult and costly, but we see no other way to avoid the terrible impact of global climate change that nearly all atmospheric scientists are now predicting.LiNeBrEaKHoward Latin and Louis Raveson are law professors at Rutgers University School of Law, Newark.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   STATEandMETRO Edition	Focus: health and the environment  	VIEWS; Pg. 8B  	763 words  	Bumper sticker mentalityLiNeBrEaKI'm embarrassed to have a governor so out-of-touch with climate change. When he suggests that CO2 being a pollutant is a "bit of a stretch," it shows he doesn't even understand the issue. Governor, we're adding to the CO2 that naturally exists and, in so doing, making the bio system of the whole planet unstable. CO2 alone is no more a pollutant than is water - but too much of that and you drown.LiNeBrEaKJohn McCain said that global warming was troubling 30 years ago, alarming 20 years ago and outright dangerous today. The current president said that climate change is a result of our "addiction to oil." The U.S. Geological Survey and Columbia University say we are playing with a "near permanent drought developing in the American Southwest" (Earthweek, 12/26/2008). This should alarm anyone concerned with Texas. I know it alarms Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. Frankly, if she runs for governor, I think she'll prevail among cerebral Republicans. LiNeBrEaKAs to the green-friendly advocates throughout Texas, I'm not embarrassed at all, but I am concerned that they often put the "cart before the horse." I always read of the solutions to the problem (conservation, alternate energy, etc) - but as evidenced by people like the governor, I think restating the "problem" is needed as well as addressing "solutions."LiNeBrEaKFace it, many people get their news through television only. This may be OK generally, but I don't want my governor to be so limited. After all, TV is to the news what bumper stickers are to philosophy.LiNeBrEaK-- Bill HurleyLiNeBrEaKIt's time for wise choicesLiNeBrEaKRe: "Texas must keep water taps flowing," (Other Views, Jan. 4):LiNeBrEaKMany cultures around the world have historically captured rainwater.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps this drought will prompt us to do likewise. However, we'll have to overcome a lack of education on this topic as illustrated by some local talk show hosts who stated that recapturing rainwater wouldn't be a good idea because it would prevent the aquifer from recapturing it, all the while ignoring the fact that the floods that we get end up with most of the water entering the sewer system, not the aquifer.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, most communities in the area don't allow cisterns for water storage on home properties due to rules written by the developer. Do we need the dreaded legislative process to require communities to allow capturing of rainwater similar to the newly submitted bill to the Texas Legislature that requires communities to allow solar panels? Or, as citizens, could we just go ahead and make wise decisions that will provide for the current need and certainly solve the future water problem of a growing population in a dry environment?LiNeBrEaK-- Sandra MoodyLiNeBrEaKWhat's the outlook?LiNeBrEaKI enjoyed Forrest Mims' column ("One day closer to next rain," Jan. 5) about the current drought.LiNeBrEaKThere's "good news and bad news" - is the glass half full, or is it half empty? It's attitude, right? Ranchers know this story:LiNeBrEaKTwo ranchers were talking across the fence, standing in the mud after a deluge.LiNeBrEaK"Nice rain," says the optimist.LiNeBrEaK"Yep," says the other. looking to the clearing sky. "That's just the way the last drought started."LiNeBrEaK-- Clay McGaughyLiNeBrEaKFirst-hand dangerLiNeBrEaKPlease help us, City Council. Manslaughter is in progress. I represent (cough) the majority of (cough, cough) San Antonians who don't inhale toxic fumes into our lungs for enjoyment (by the way, lungs are meant to breath clean air). We love to frequent restaurants, and we also enjoy dance clubs (cough), but we are unwillingly being exposed to "second-hand smoke" by the minority of inconsiderate smokers in this (cough-cough) city.LiNeBrEaKDozens of major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, have adopted bans on smoking in bars and restaurants. So why hasn't San Antonio taken action yet? Studies in these cities have proven there is no significant negative impact on the (hack-hack) economy of these establishments, so why haven't you acted on behalf of the health of all of us here?LiNeBrEaKOur outside air is bad enough, and having to (cough) inhale toxic fumes in restaurants and bars is killing us all slowly, but surely. Conventions will still come, people can smoke outside and the city will still make its (hack-cough) money. It's a crime, honestly, that you put money above the health of each one of us. Think of the millions/billions saved in health care (less heart attacks).LiNeBrEaKWake up, City Council. Act now. The next target after (cough-cough) fixing this problem: obesity. Another health problem. Suggestion: Organize a "Biggest Loser Contest in San Antonio" with a prize of $50,000. Imagine the result.LiNeBrEaK-- J.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	For California, new clout in Obama's tech-friendly administration  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1096 words  	Jan. 18--WASHINGTON -- Barbara Boxer remembers the "dark days" when California and its issues were dismissed by official Washington with disdain and hostility.LiNeBrEaK"Dianne Feinstein and I joked that it was ABC -- anything but California, anyone but California," Boxer said, recalling when the two Democrats joined the Senate in 1993.LiNeBrEaKNow, as California Democrats pour into Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration, the state can claim a surge of influence in the new, tech-friendly administration. Congress, too, is looking westward, with Californians taking key positions of power. LiNeBrEaKTwo Californians were named to Obama's Cabinet -- Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu at the Energy Department and Rep. Hilda Solis at the Labor Department -- and Leon Panetta, former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, has been appointed to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.LiNeBrEaKObama also named a pair of Golden Staters to key White House posts: Christina Romer, a Berkeley economist, will chair the Council of Economic Advisers, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, will bring her experience as a state environmental regulator to the job of chairing the Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"These are superstar choices. California is 'in' right now, and we can remember when California was 'out,' " Boxer said. "There is a lot more respect for the state, especially on energy issues."LiNeBrEaKShift on tech, energyLiNeBrEaKOn a policy level, it's a shift from oil drilling to renewable energy, from sidestepping the issue of global warming to dealing with it aggressively, from a pro-industry stance to greater sympathy for organized labor.LiNeBrEaKRep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat, measured the change this way: "I remember Gov. Jerry Brown coming to Washington talking about windmills, and people made fun of him. Now everybody is talking about wind energy and solar."LiNeBrEaKCalifornians with deep experience in tech and energy issues, particularly clean technology, have Obama's ear. That includes Eric Schmidt, &iuml;&raquo;&iquest;chief executive of Google, venture capitalist John Doerr, who is close to Al Gore, and John Thompson, the former Symantec CEO who may be a contender for commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKThat influence can be seen in major ingredients in the $825 billion stimulus package prepared by the House with the Obama team's input. Doerr, for example, lobbied for the $11 billion that would go toward modernizing the electricity grid. Tech groups pushed hard for $6 billion in grants to speed up broadband deployment. Wind-energy advocates secured a long-term extension of the production tax credit.LiNeBrEaKAnd California renewable-energy companies and investors, struggling with the frozen credit market, cheered when Obama announced his goal of doubling the production of renewable energy over the next three years.LiNeBrEaK"I think what the Obama administration intends to do is move the technology that has been pioneered in California across the country," said Cathy Zoi, CEO of Palo Alto-based Alliance for Climate Protection.LiNeBrEaKThe state's new clout should not be viewed in the traditional sense of more "pork" for California, said Norm Ornstein, an author and longtime analyst of government for the American Enterprise Institute. But it will play out in other ways.LiNeBrEaK"There will be a greater sensibility on issues that matter to California and drive the California economy," Ornstein said. "It helps that Obama puts a high priority about keeping the nation's edge on technology, and is listening to Silicon Valley on that."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia-friendlyLiNeBrEaKSome appointees are not from California but tend to view key issues in California-friendly ways. Carol Browner, a top Obama adviser on energy and the environment, supported the state's pioneering regulations as Environmental Protection Agency chief. And Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a graduate of Santa Clara University who has worked on border-state issues, has been named to head the Homeland Security Department.LiNeBrEaKObama is unlikely to cultivate as cozy a relationship with the state as Bill Clinton did, predicted Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College who worked for Republicans during the Reagan and first Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKBut he agrees that just as Reagan-style California conservatism was adopted in Washington in the 1980s, Obama is likely to embrace California-style progressivism.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the 1990s, when Clinton had to deal with a Republican majority in Congress, Democrats now control both branches, with state leaders well-represented -- starting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKLofgren, who chairs the immigration subcommittee in the House, knows she can get Napolitano on the phone if there's a problem with the immigration bureaucracy, or she can contact Solis on a labor issue.LiNeBrEaKLofgren chairs the delegation of 34 California Democrats in the House, which met last week and bid farewell to Solis.LiNeBrEaK"There in the room were the chairmen of the Energy Committee (Henry Waxman,) Education and Labor (George Miller), Foreign Affairs (Howard Berman), and Veterans Affairs (Bob Filner)," Lofgren said. "I thought, if you wanted to get something done, come to this room."LiNeBrEaKState labor leaders expect that with Solis in the Cabinet, they will have a friendly ear on minimum-wage and family-leave issues, and other concerns of an increasingly immigrant work force. Solis, from Los Angeles, is the daughter of immigrants and her father was a union worker.LiNeBrEaK"She is very well-connected and can help bridge the gap and the tensions between immigrant workers and other sectors of the community, including some unions," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.LiNeBrEaKBut Pitney, a veteran observer of Washington, warned that Californians looking for rapid change on energy, labor and other issues from Obama and other leaders they just elected may be disappointed.LiNeBrEaK"Electing officials is a lot like shopping online," Pitney said. "Everything looks better when you log on than when the package arrives at the door."LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Landfills generate 'green' cash in northern Utah  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	802 words  	Jan. 18--Massive piles of rotting garbage dumped in landfills over decades in Ogden and Layton are creating cash, foot by cubic foot.LiNeBrEaKWeber County and Wasatch Integrated Waste Management System not only make money by turning methane gas generated in the trash heaps into electricity, they're also selling carbon offset credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange.LiNeBrEaKWhile it's not a lot of money, it makes the green landfill projects even greener. LiNeBrEaKLast spring, Weber County made $102,000 selling carbon credits it was awarded by the Chicago Climate Exchange for reducing greenhouse gases in 2005, 2006 and 2007, said Gary Laird, the county's solid-waste manager.LiNeBrEaKLaird sold at the top of the market, when carbon credits were worth $6. 30 to $7 each. Friday on the Chicago Climate Exchange, the credits were down to $1. 95 each.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated sold about $14,000 worth at a lower $2 market rate, but is holding onto more than 88,000 credits, figuring the price will rise with demand when the government gets around to regulating greenhouse gas emissions, said Wasatch's Executive Director Nathan Rich.LiNeBrEaK"It's sure worked out neat so far," he said.LiNeBrEaKChicago Climate Exchange is one of dozens of markets that have cropped up worldwide in recent years as pressure as mounted on countries and companies to reduce greenhouse.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated, which burns and puts into landfills almost all the waste in Davis County and all of Morgan County's,LiNeBrEaKjoined in January 2007; Weber County joined that spring.LiNeBrEaKEach had begun capturing methane natural gas generated in their capped trash heaps a few years earlier, mainly to keep it from migrating and, later, exploding.LiNeBrEaKThe gas is piped to nearby electrical generating stations. Weber County owns its station and sells power to Rocky Mountain Power -- a source that gave the county a tidy $240,000 last year. Wasatch Integrated's methane goes to a plant over the fence at Hill Air Force Base. Sales last year amounted to $40,000 for Wasatch.LiNeBrEaKWhile energy and environmental activists applaud such efforts, some are not so enthusiastic about the markets, like Chicago Climate Exchange, that let those curbing emissions trade on their own good deeds.LiNeBrEaKOne, Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of the book Hell and High Water: Global Warming -- the Solution and the Politics -- and What We Should Do, calls them carbon "rip-offsets."LiNeBrEaKHe doesn't like that the Chicago Climate Exchange rewards companies or governmental agencies for past greenhouse-gas reductions.LiNeBrEaK"If I'm going to put up money, I want my money to go to a project that wouldn't otherwise happen," Romm said.LiNeBrEaKHe also believes there isn't enough scrutiny of the projects that earn the credits, likens the market to the mortgage-backed securities market now in shambles.LiNeBrEaK"The offset business is unregulated and voluntary, and it doesn't take a genius to see unregulated markets tend to attract a lot of dubious players," said Romm, who is also editor of the Web site www.climateprogress.org.LiNeBrEaKRich disagreed.LiNeBrEaK"I've been through the verification process, and it's crazy, very detailed," he said. "If you're buying these credits, they're real."LiNeBrEaKThe Chicago Climate Exchange uses independent engineers to verify emission reductions and Wasatch, which is a full member of the exchange, also is scrutinized by auditors who verify that it is reducing emissions at its burn plant, as promised when it became a full exchange member.LiNeBrEaKWasatch agreed to reduce burn plant emissions by 6 percent by 2010.LiNeBrEaKRich also defended the market's practice of rewarding credits for past good work.LiNeBrEaK"What's wrong with rewarding people for good behavior?" he said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Wasatch didn't expect to make a bundle of money, selling carbon offset credits can help new green projects pencil out, he said.LiNeBrEaKLaird said the sale of carbon credits was part of Weber County's calculation all along.LiNeBrEaK"This was what made our project feasible," he said.LiNeBrEaKkmoulton@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKWhat's a carbon credit?LiNeBrEaKIt's a marketable security, traded like a corporate stock or futures contract. New markets, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, have emerged to award companies or government agencies "credits" for projects that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. They sell the credits, via the exchange, to individuals or companies that want to offset their own carbon emissions -- or to appear more "green." The value of each credit fluctuates, as in any market.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Team Bush changes rules in final stretch  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1011 words  	Jan. 18--WASHINGTON -- President George W. Bush and his team have made last-ditch efforts to leave their mark on American policy before Bush cedes control of the federal government and takes that last flight from the White House lawn.LiNeBrEaKIn a series of highly partisan and often-controversial decisions, the Bush administration has created new rules impacting abortion, oil drilling and the fragile economy. LiNeBrEaKFar from rare, these 11th hour regulations have become "a long-standing tradition," according to Allan Lichtman, a presidential expert at American University. He says every president wants "his final stamp on policy" and when the transition is between parties, the decisions normally take on a strong ideological bent.LiNeBrEaKPower plant emissions OKLiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration issued a decision in mid-December saying there is no reason to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of power plants -- a move that directly affects a proposed Utah coal-fired power plant.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency, in a memo, had granted a permit for a coal-fired plant on the Ute Indian Reservation in eastern Utah and then decided that approval was not subject to the impact of climate change from the plant's emissions. At least one U.S. senator has asked the Justice Department to step in and force the EPA to consider the federal Clean Air Act with regard to new coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaKBailout cash for loanLiNeBrEaKto automakersLiNeBrEaKAmid criticism from his own Republican ranks, Bush moved in December to tap a Wall Street bailout fund to loan $17 billion to two troubled automakers. Utah car dealers, some of whom had lobbied Congress for the loans, cheered the move as a way to save millions of jobs, including thousands in the Beehive State.LiNeBrEaK"It's a shot in the arm to take us to the next level, and will help make us profitable in the future," said St. George car dealer Stephen Wade.LiNeBrEaKBut Bush's move brought jeers from several conservatives who said he took a big swipe at free-market capitalism.LiNeBrEaKOil and gas leasesLiNeBrEaKA rushed sale of oil and gas leases near some of Utah's most iconic wilderness lands prompted an outpouring of criticism and even an act of civil disobedience. The Bureau of Land Management wanted to sell leases on 149,000 acres of land near Arches and Canyonlands National Park. The sale was announced on Election Day and took place the Friday before Christmas over the objections of environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKObama transition team members have criticized the sale and hinted they may buy the leases back once he takes office.LiNeBrEaKOn Saturday, a federal judge issued an injunction blocking the leases.LiNeBrEaKTim DeChristopher, a University of Utah student, attempted to foil the sale. He bid on the leases, winning 13 parcels and driving up the price on others. Originally, he said he had no intention of paying, but recently he raised $45,000.LiNeBrEaKGuns in national parksLiNeBrEaKAt the request of the National Rifle Association and Republican senators -- including Utah's Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett -- the Bush administration signed off on a new regulation allowing people to carry loaded, concealed guns in national parks.LiNeBrEaKThe old rule, adopted under President Ronald Reagan, required people to stow their unloaded firearms before entering the parks, almost all of which ban hunting.LiNeBrEaKA number of National Park conservation and former ranger groups said the new rule will result in more poaching, while proponents like Utah's senators say the regulation will help people protect themselves.LiNeBrEaKThe issue may ultimately be decided in court. Before the rule could go into effect, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence filed suit to block its implementation.LiNeBrEaKReproductive health and conscienceLiNeBrEaKOutgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt sees it as an issue of conscience, while many abortion rights supporters see it as an outrage.LiNeBrEaKThe new regulation, approved by Leavitt, former Utah governor, bolsters the right of health care workers to refuse to provide treatment or even a referral for something they morally object to, namely abortion.LiNeBrEaKLeavitt calls it the "provider conscience" rule, which highlights existing laws and creates new ways to investigate complaints and punish hospitals that don't allow doctors to refuse care. The rule, which sought to redefine abortion, stirred controversy when an early version was leaked. The final rule is more tempered but still causes plenty of anger. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it "a direct assault on women's health care."LiNeBrEaKLast-minute pardonsLiNeBrEaKAs is typical with outgoing presidents, Bush has handed out several pardons and commutations in recent months, including to a Utah man convicted of looting an archaeological site 16 years ago.LiNeBrEaKBush, using his executive power, pardoned David Lane Woolsey, of St. George, of his felony under the 1979 U.S. Archeological Resources Protection Act. Woolsey and another man, who were photographed digging at a protected site, were the first to be prosecuted in Utah under the act.LiNeBrEaKBush also commuted the sentence of a convicted drug dealer at the urging of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who said that although rapper John Forte was caught with two briefcases filled with $1. 4 million worth of liquid cocaine, he was a musical genius and no risk to society. Forte spent eight years in prison. Hatch defended that request despite criticism he had not reached out to help Utahn Weldon Angelos, who was sentenced to 55 years for selling pot while carrying a gun.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush last-minute policy decisionsLiNeBrEaKTeam Bush has been busy in its final weeks, opening national parks to loaded guns, easing pollution standards on power plants and more. The new rules and policies could have a life well beyond the Bush presidency.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	What an Obama presidency means for Utah and the West  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1619 words  	Jan. 18--WASHINGTON -- Months ago, Barack Obama became the first person in a century to accept a major-party presidential nomination in a Mountain West setting.LiNeBrEaKThat occasion in Denver shows the growing political might of the region and how issues long important to the West are gaining national prominence: Energy development, land use, climate change.LiNeBrEaKObama has promised sweeping policy changes on these and a whole host of other issues ranging from economic policy to health care reform that will profoundly impact -- for better or worse -- Utah and the West.LiNeBrEaKHe's pledged change from the pro-development policies of his predecessor with renewed attention to protecting the environment and weaning America off foreign oil through development of alternative energies. LiNeBrEaKHe's committed to turn around the ailing economy with a quick and massive investment in rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and public buildings. And he's vowed to end the war in Iraq, which has claimed the lives of 40 Utahns, while ramping up the war in Afghanistan, in which seven Utahns have died.LiNeBrEaK"The biggest difference will be the government will not be seen as the enemy but will be seen hopefully as a partner in solving the economic and environmental and domestic and international multiple problems," says Utahn Pat Shea, who headed the Bureau of Land Management under President Clinton.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of being driven by a cheerleading 'drill, baby, drill' attitude, we'll be thinking about what's sustainable in the future and what actions do we take in 2009 that will benefit our grandchildren in 2049," Shea says.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the environment, the incoming Obama administration is expected to diverge from Bush policies on an array of issues important to Utah, from mine safety to health care to a new House seat for the Beehive State.LiNeBrEaKThe economy -- Obama's top priority is a huge stimulus bill -- including a large tax cut -- which he hopes will be a lifeline for an economy sinking in layoffs, foreclosures and bankruptcies.LiNeBrEaKHe wants to spend around $775 billion on the package, with the goal of getting it done next month. But it won't happen without a fight. Republicans are complaining about the price tag and some Democrats question his $300 billion tax cuts. The new president will have a hard time swaying some of Utah's skeptical members of Congress. New Rep. Jason Chaffetz has already promised to fight the bill.LiNeBrEaKBut many Utah residents have high expectations for Obama. A plurality -- 46 percent -- say they expect his actions will improve the economy, while only 29 percent expect those actions to make the situation worse.LiNeBrEaKState leaders also are embracing the Obama strategy.LiNeBrEaKGov. Jon Huntsman Jr. has sent the Obama team a $14. 4 billion wish list that includes major road projects like a widening of I-15 in Utah County and new buildings, such as courthouses and veterans nursing homes. Utah's cities also have their hands outs, saying they have some 100 projects ready to go if the federal money became available.LiNeBrEaKWar and peace &Acirc;&raquo;Obama built his winning campaign on a promise to quickly withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq. With a precipitous drop in violence there over the past year, the incoming administration appears to have a simple path toward making good on that pledge. Changes in military detention policies in both Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the imminent closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay -- may also reduce the number of deployments for units that have been cross-trained to conduct prison operations, as many Utah units have over the past three years.LiNeBrEaKBut although reservists can expect fewer tours of duty in Iraq, an increase in violence across Afghanistan may keep Beehive State military units buzzing for years to come. Several Utah outfits with military specialties needed there -- including transportation, medical and aviation units -- are in line for second war rotations. Meanwhile, active duty and reserve units from Hill Air Force Base -- particularly those from the base's fighter wings -- can expect a continuation of the steady deployment pace of the past several years. That's because the Iraqi and Afghan militaries still don't have the weapons or expertise necessary to conduct and support air operations.LiNeBrEaKThe net effect for Utah's military families may be a gradual decrease in the rigorous pace of training and deployments of the past seven years, with emphasis on "gradual."LiNeBrEaKUtahns appear optimistic Obama will succeed in the managing the two wars and in ensuring the nation's security. A majority --53 percent -- say they are very or somewhat confident about the president-elect's prospects.LiNeBrEaKOil shale exploration -- Energy developers were excited when Congress in October dropped its opposition to selling leases on federal lands for oil shale exploration.LiNeBrEaKBut it may be short lived, if Obama's pick for Interior Department secretary is any indication. Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo, has blocked a rush to develop oil shale, which supporters say is a vast source of domestic energy. Salazar and environmentalists argue that more time is needed to study the ramifications, since no company has yet found a way to commercially produce energy from the shale in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKJeff Hartley, a Utah energy consultant and pro-oil shale advocate, says he's hopeful the Obama administration will take time to listen to oil companies before shutting the door to a major economic engine in the West.LiNeBrEaK"There's kind of a wait and see, fingers-crossed attitude among energy developers, hoping that Obama will recognize the need for domestically produced energy," he says.LiNeBrEaKHealth care -- The Obama team, led by Health and Human Services-designee Tom Daschle, will attempt a major overhaul of the American health care system. The lofty goal is to insure everyone and reduce costs -- not an easy task.LiNeBrEaKFormer President Clinton tried to reform health care, but failed famously. Bush's plan, pushed by former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, never gained traction.LiNeBrEaKBut a number of key groups, including insurance companies and doctors' organizations, have promised to work with Obama. Even Republicans and Democrats have sought middle ground.LiNeBrEaKUtah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch is working with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., on what might become the final proposal, while Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have their own bill that would separate health insurance from employment.LiNeBrEaKExpect some smaller bills to come first, including one of Hatch's favorites.LiNeBrEaKBush repeatedly vetoed the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, saying Democrats were using it as a way to shift families from private insurance to a publicly provided plan. A new CHIP bill will most likely be one of the first that Obama signs.LiNeBrEaKMine safety -- After the deaths of six miners and three would-be rescuers at the Crandall Canyon Mine, critics argued that in the Bush administration mine safety has taken a back seat to the corporate interests. Subsequent investigations have mainly faulted the mine's owner, though the Mine Safety and Health Administration took a beating for lax oversight.LiNeBrEaKThe United Mine Workers of America says it expects that under Obama, mines in the country will be safer and administrators will be stronger watchdogs for mine workers.LiNeBrEaKPhil Smith, a spokesman for the union, says that mining oversight under Bush wasn't "particularly good," though MSHA has boosted inspections and mine deaths were actually trending down in 2008.LiNeBrEaKFourth House seat for Utah -- A bill that would grant the District of Columbia its first full-voting member of Congress and give Utah a fourth House seat failed after Bush advisers recommended a veto.LiNeBrEaKBut the bill is expected to make a quick comeback with Obama in the White House. Obama co-sponsored the bill in the Senate and continues to support it. Paired with a larger Democratic majority in both congressional chambers, he could help Utah get another House member in 2010. But even if it passes, the measure could be held up in the courts.LiNeBrEaKPublic lands -- Environmental groups tired of the constant scuffles with the Bush administration are hoping for better relations with and significant policy changes from Obama and Salazar, his designee for Interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKThey were buoyed when members of the transition team criticized the Bureau of Land Management for the sale of oil and gas lease in Utah's red rock country.LiNeBrEaKIssues of energy will most likely dominate the public lands debate under an Obama administration, overwhelming other issues such as the use of ATVs or the expansion of wilderness protection areas.LiNeBrEaKAfter his appointment was announced, Salazar almost exclusively focused on energy development, giving scant mention to the other aspects of his job.LiNeBrEaKBut groups like the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance hope to convince Salazar to reopen six land management plans in Utah that they believe included too many acres for all-terrain vehicles and other commercial uses.LiNeBrEaKMatthew D.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1113 words  	Jan. 18--Hollywood may have it's A-list parties, but so does the tech crowd. Here's where the digital glitterati want to be seen. Unscientific ratings based on buzz and how hard Mercury News reporters had to try to get into the party:LiNeBrEaKFive starsLiNeBrEaKThe Green Ball, Monday night: LiNeBrEaKThis enviro-star-studded party for foes of global warming is the hottest ticket in town for the green-tech crowd. Al Gore star attraction and attendees will walk down a green carpet, made of recyclable materials, of course. We're still waiting for our sources (we've hit up six different contacts so far) to deliver two tickets.LiNeBrEaKFour starsLiNeBrEaKThe Google ball, Tuesday night:LiNeBrEaKGoogle has become the de facto tech-industry party host after throwing successful bashes at both national party conventions over the summer. Google is shunning traditional ball etiquette, going for a lounge-like concept. And -- now this would be a first for an inaugural fete -- the company will be serving really good food, says one source. For that reason, we'll be heading here instead of the Western states ball, the official California event, where 11,000 are expected. And we've got tickets.LiNeBrEaKLINK-live Presidential Inaugural Gala, Tuesday night:LiNeBrEaKIt's billed as a party to celebrate technology serving humanity. Steven Chu Lawrence Berkeley's Nobel laureate physicist and Obama's choice for energy secretary, is slated to receive "the nature award." You can attendLiNeBrEaKvirtually via www.linklive.org. And you can join the celebration online using Twitter (name: linklive; address: #linklive2009), ScribbleLive, Ustream and Flickr. We think we've got tickets, and would hate to miss Chu, the Bay Area's hottest -- or is that coolest? -- scientist.LiNeBrEaKThree starsLiNeBrEaKNetroots Nation party, Monday night:LiNeBrEaKLiberal stars of the blogosphere come together to pat themselves on the back for helping Obama get elected. Among the co-hosts are Firedoglake and Fivethirtyeight.com. Guests can hang out in the Guitar Hero Lounge. If the event wasn't in Virginia, we'd consider giving it four stars. If we don't get Green Ball tickets, we'll be heading here.LiNeBrEaKFor San Jose man, family ties aren't enoughLiNeBrEaKRobert Wright, seventh-grade teacher at Morrill Middle School in San Jose, stumbled across a genealogical Web site this past summer that shows he and Obama share a distant ancestor, Obadiah Columbus Wright. He had named his son, 14, Obadiah after the ancestor but had no clue about Obama's connection until he did a routine search of the name. After Obama's victory, Wright figured the connection ought to get him an inauguration ticket. First, he approached the Obama inaugural planners. They sent back an e-mail informing him how to donate to the inaugural committee. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent a form e-mail telling him that he didn't make the cut. She had 60,000 ticket requests. He thought he had the ear of an aide to U.S. Rep Zoe Lofgen and even faxed over the family tree. But, alas, no tickets. "I guess my limb grew too far from the family tree." He'll be watching the inauguration with his students.LiNeBrEaKFeinstein to introduce the Rev. Rick WarrenLiNeBrEaKTune in to the inauguration ceremony and the first speech you will hear from the podium will come from California's own Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the congressional inaugural committee.LiNeBrEaKWhat will she say in the global spotlight? "It will be very formal and very brief," she told reporters at a preview of the main event. "This is a tightly scripted, very precise schedule."LiNeBrEaKFeinstein will introduce Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, to give the invocation. Obama's choice of Warren for that honor drew controversy because of the pastor's support for Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriages. Obama and Feinstein opposed Proposition 8.LiNeBrEaKBring the noise, toss the broomsLiNeBrEaKPrecision lawn-chair marching? The inaugural parade always features lots of traditional marching bands, but this year a few units stand out for different reasons.LiNeBrEaKThe Redwood Middle School Marching Band from Saratoga enjoys the distinction of being the only middle school band participating in the parade.LiNeBrEaKFor the first time, an openly gay group, The Lesbian and Gay Band Association, will march in an inaugural parade. The association performed at other events during Bill Clinton's two inaugurals.LiNeBrEaKThe World Famous Lawn Rangers from Arcola, Ill., toss unique "show" brooms into the air, and according to the official program, often catch them.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL Edition	Ex-49er Jerry Rice catches acting bug  	Pg. N22  	699 words  	Since retiring from football three years ago, Jerry Rice has been busy reinventing himself. He'd seen other former players who didn't know what to do next and became determined that that would not happen to him. So he appeared in commercials for Gatorade, Visa and Zaxby's restaurants.LiNeBrEaKThen he went on "Dancing With the Stars" and surprised everybody by coming in second using moves he didn't learn on a football field. LiNeBrEaK Now comes Rice the actor. He took a small role in "Without a Paddle: Nature's Calling," a direct-to-DVD sequel to the 2004 adventure comedy "Without a Paddle." Oliver James and Kristopher Turner star as friends in their 20s who disappear into the wilderness in search of a beautiful missing woman. In the wilds, they meet up with Hal Gore Rice, former vice president Al's unappreciated younger brother. Hal believes that he discovered Tipper and a solution to global warming first, and that Al's Oscar, Emmy and Nobel Prize rightfully should be his.LiNeBrEaKWe caught up with the world's greatest wide receiver and former San Francisco 49er and Oakland Raider when he was fresh from watching his 17-year-old son, Jerry Rice Jr., play an amateur all-star game. Rice, 46, said he didn't want his son to play football "because I know how vicious the game can be and I didn't want that pressure on him." But the teenager, who plays wide receiver and a little quarterback, appears determined to go into the family business. "I couldn't play quarterback because I couldn't throw the ball," Rice said.LiNeBrEaKNow the question is: Can he play Hal Gore or other parts that might come his way?LiNeBrEaKQ:How serious are you about this acting business?LiNeBrEaKA: I'm not looking to be the next Denzel Washington or Will Smith. But I like the challenge of acting. I think so many people are afraid of stepping out of their boundary and opening themselves up to criticism. I am a risk taker. If there is something I want to do, I am going to go for it and deal with the critics.LiNeBrEaKQ:What was the biggest challenge in making the movie?LiNeBrEaKA: I had to learn my lines in one day because it sort of fell into my lap. They wanted former quarterback great Terry Bradshaw, but he probably looked at it and said, "I'm not going to do this." There was no prompter or anything. You had to remember your lines and the other actors' lines, too, so you knew when to come in. The hardest part for me is right before the director says, "Action!" You are running lines over and over in your head, and suddenly he says "action" and I go, "Say, what is my line?"LiNeBrEaKQ:You appear in a floor-length fur coat that has clearly seen better days. How did you feel about wearing it?LiNeBrEaKA: When I first looked at it, I didn't want to put it on. I'm used to having my uniform be nice and neat and not having stuff dangling from the bottom. Then all of a sudden I had to wear this thing, which I found out was made of squirrel.LiNeBrEaKQ:I'm wondering if you know Al Gore and how you feel about playing his "brother."LiNeBrEaKA: I don't know him personally. But I thought it was hilarious that Hal Gore would think he had found the cure to global warming in the wilderness. To me, I had a chance to go crazy with it.LiNeBrEaKQ:When you were on "Dancing With the Stars," you approached it with the same vigor and strong work ethic that you had during your football career. Are you also giving acting your all?LiNeBrEaKA: Yes. When I commit to something, I feel I have to do it well because of my reputation and what I have built for myself. Once I had committed to "Dancing With the Stars," if I had gone on and was a bust I would have had to deal with the criticism. But I worked my butt off. I don't like coming in second place. We athletes are very competitive.LiNeBrEaKQ:So how do you rate your performance in the "Without a Paddle" sequel?LiNeBrEaKA: I'm going to watch it tonight and critique it the same way I did my "Dancing With the Stars" routines and the way I watched tapes of my games. You look at them and think, "Here is where I could have done better." That keeps you from getting complacent. I think the reason I had so much success in football was because I never got complacent.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL Edition	A failed presidency  	Insight; EDITORIALS; Pg. G2  	711 words  	It is hard to imagine that one U.S. presidency could leave more wreckage than George W. Bush's did during his eight years in the White House.LiNeBrEaKBy his own yardsticks, his administration was an abject failure. He was a divider, not a uniter. He was "the decider" who led the country into a war of choice on what proved to be false pretenses. His administration was neither compassionate nor conservative. It ran up record deficits while giving tax breaks to the wealthy and creating a culture of government neglect that left some Americans trapped in a netherworld of neglect after Hurricane Katrina, and continues to keep all of us gripped by the angst of an economic system that remains on the brink of collapse.LiNeBrEaKThis was a president whose election was assured only after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, settled the more than monthlong dispute over the Florida outcome. He immediately began to govern as if he had a ringing mandate. LiNeBrEaKThe defining event of the Bush presidency came on Sept. 11, 2001, when al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and turned them into missiles against the icons of U.S. financial and military might. More than 3,000 died that day, and the world was transformed. For a fleeting moment, the American people - and global sentiment - rallied around Bush. But that opportunity would soon be squandered.LiNeBrEaKFor the neocon factions within the Bush administration, the 9/11 attacks opened the opportunity for two goals it brought into office: To force a regime change in Iraq, and to expand the power of the executive branch. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney went on the stump in 2002 to sell the notion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had a connection to al Qaeda. Neither proved to be true. Still, America went to war, and American troops remain in battle to this day, many billions of dollars and more than 4,000 U.S. lives later.LiNeBrEaKThe threat of terrorism became the rationale for other Bush administration assaults on American values. The Bush White House pushed the limits of the law to establish warrantless wiretapping, military tribunals, indefinite detentions of suspected "enemy combatants," torture techniques on detainees and a legal no-man's land at Guantanamo Bay. Bush expanded and redefined the use of "signing statements" to effectively declare that he - as president - can pick and choose which laws he will enforce or ignore.LiNeBrEaKJust don't call Bush a conservative. The last Clinton administration budget had a surplus of more than $100 billion; the fiscal 2009 deficit could approach $700 billion.LiNeBrEaKBush was a disaster on the environment in many ways, but in none more critical than in his belated acknowledgment that climate change was real and was a serious threat to the planet. This nation essentially lost eight years in addressing the most profound issue of our time. In the final weeks of his presidency, Bush moved to undermine the Endangered Species Act. The Bush administration also let politics trump science in other ways, such as its resistance to stem cell research and myriad family-planning programs.LiNeBrEaKPolitics also pervaded this administration's oversight of the Department of Justice. Its attempt to fire nine U.S. attorneys appeared targeted at those who were not regarded as conservative enough.LiNeBrEaKWhen strong hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, what seemed to be a slow and disorganized response reflected badly on the Bush White House. The public relations damage was compounded when Bush toured Louisiana right after Katrina and commended Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael Brown for a "heckuva job." The awful hurricane aftermath, in which we saw hungry and frantic Americans scrambling through the chaos, became an indictment on the competence of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"He kept us safe" is the mantra of the Bush loyalists. Indeed, terrorists did not strike again after 9/11. But the Bush policies did, leading us into war, depriving our liberties, exploiting our natural resources and allowing the construction of financial houses of cards - while seizing new executive powers at every turn. This nation is deeper in debt, gloomier in outlook and weaker in global stature than when George W. Bush took office.LiNeBrEaKThis has been a disastrous eight years.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FINAL Edition	The world;  THE INAUGURATION OF BARACK OBAMA;  Global crises: Obama inherits more dire and serious troubles than any incoming U.S. president in decades, but the world seems to trust that he has the personal wherewithal to meet all challenges	Main News; Pg. W6  	1498 words  	President Barack Hussein Obama will arrive at the White House on Tuesday and inherit a world of troubles weighty enough to make Atlas groan.LiNeBrEaK"This is the toughest foreign policy in-box that any president has faced in 55 years," said Jessica Mathews, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "We are in a deep hole on a whole lot of issues where he's going to have to climb out of before he can even start to achieve."LiNeBrEaKImmediate crises such as the violence in Gaza, first-term priorities such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, long-term endeavors such as the American relationship with China and Russia, and epochal concerns such as globalization and global warming - Obama will face them all.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, the new president's supporters in this country and around the world are expecting a new era of effective multilateral diplomacy as radical and revolutionary, in its way, as the era of unilateral militarism it is replacing - at a time when an extraordinary financial crisis has sharply limited the new administration's ability to pay for new initiatives. LiNeBrEaKMore dire challengesLiNeBrEaK"I certainly don't know of any president who has come to the White House with more challenges - dire, serious, strategically threatening challenges - as Obama," said Abbas Milani, director of the Iranian Studies Program at Stanford University. LiNeBrEaKCriticized in the presidential campaign for a thin international dossier, the president-elect's Web site now promises to "renew America's security and standing in the world through a new era of American leadership," with goals including fighting global poverty, seeking Middle East peace, a comprehensive settlement with Iran, and a nuclear-free world.LiNeBrEaKBut in the real world of international affairs, setting goals is easy - a democratic Iraq, a Palestinian state, a halt to the killing in Darfur. Achieving them is hard. LiNeBrEaKObama outlined some of his foreign policy ideas in "The Audacity of Hope." He embraces multilateralism when possible and unilateralism when necessary; democratization and liberalization as goals but not as impositions; reforming inefficient international organizations, but setting a model through domestic reform.LiNeBrEaKSome foreign policy experts see in his moderate philosophy an exciting departure from the policies of past administrations.LiNeBrEaK"The Obama team is much more realist and - it seems paradoxical - much more idealist at the same time," Milani said. "That combination, I think, is a very potent combination."LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, the people Obama has selected to implement his policies - Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, Robert Gates as secretary of defense, Gen. Jim Jones as national security adviser - are not seen as revolutionaries, said George Friedman, founder of Stratfor, a geopolitical intelligence company.LiNeBrEaK"These are not radical thinkers," Friedman said. "Literally, he has positioned himself in the heart of the foreign policy establishment."LiNeBrEaKLess stick, more carrotLiNeBrEaKMany other foreign policy experts do expect changes - even dramatic ones - under Obama, who they say will use less stick and more carrot in dealing with allies and rivals alike.LiNeBrEaK"Obama has to say that the United States is the most important player in the world system, but we are going to cooperate with every other player," said Geoffrey Wiseman, director of the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. "The U.S. has more hard power than anybody else, and in some ways it has more soft power than anybody else. ... I think he is trying to strike a reasonable balance in the middle."LiNeBrEaKAs evidence of intent, many foreign policy experts point to Obama's retention of Gates, Bush's secretary of defense, who in the past year gave a series of speeches calling for a dramatic increase in American soft power.LiNeBrEaKThomas Barnett, author of the forthcoming "Great Powers: America and the World After Bush," said that by keeping Gates, Obama sent a message that he will rebalance American hard and soft power.LiNeBrEaK"By keeping Gates in there you have a guy who's really pushing for, 'Hey, let's get off this next-war-itis crap,' " said Barnett, using the term Gates coined to describe the defense establishment's obsession with a hypothetical war against some future superpower. LiNeBrEaKThe challenge for Obama, Barnett said, is not just to rebalance America's policy, but to move it away from a 20th century concept that views the world as a jumble of individual nations that require discrete policies and toward a 21st century perspective that sees the world as an interconnected network.LiNeBrEaKIn "Great Powers," Barnett uses this example: In the old model, placing economic sanctions on Iran while boosting trade with China made sense. The new model recognizes that by boosting China's economy through trade, the United States boosts China's energy needs. That sends China shopping for oil in Iran, meaning U.S. actions indirectly strengthen the Tehran regime.LiNeBrEaKRubik's Cube of issuesLiNeBrEaK"Hopefully Obama comes in with a sense of the horizontal connectivity between these issues," Barnett said. "He is very much looking at a Rubik's Cube - an interconnected puzzle, where how he deals with one situation is going to send early signals on a host of issues."LiNeBrEaKObama faces a thick package of interconnected issues. They range from the way the economic collapse may affect China's willingness to help tackle human rights issues in Africa to the manner in which tensions between India and Pakistan are causing Pakistan to shift military assets away from the Khyber Pass - America's route to Afghanistan. LiNeBrEaKSome analysts are skeptical about how a philosophy that embraces complexity and multilateralism will translate into speedy progress in the real world.LiNeBrEaK"At the level of rhetoric and diplomacy, it's going to be a much better environment than we've seen recently," said Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. "He is not Bush. That gives him a certain amount of time, a certain advantage going in. But nasty, substantive issues have a knack of intruding."LiNeBrEaKFew analysts expect or encourage Obama to resolve - or even to tackle - some of the biggest global issues right away. Instead, some say, Obama should seek out contained, nonideological issues where America shares interests with allies and rivals.LiNeBrEaKSuch issues offer the United States an opportunity to connect with friends and foes through familiar organizations - NATO, the United Nations - through existing organizations that the United States does not connect with as regularly - the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the League of Arab States - and through currently nonexistent organizations that the United States can help create to address specific issues, such as piracy in the Gulf of Aden or violence in East Congo, and then nurture as long-term diplomatic forums.LiNeBrEaKObama is a fan of small-scale cooperations - his chapter on foreign policy in "The Audacity of Hope" ends by spotlighting two such examples: the U.S.-led effort to secure nuclear materials set adrift by the collapse of the Soviet Union, and American participation in the global response to the 2004 East Asian tsunami.LiNeBrEaKThe world is chockablock with opportunities like those, analysts say - the challenge Obama faces is picking the right ones.LiNeBrEaKIronically, among the ripest opportunities Obama may inherit is what is broadly seen as his predecessor's greatest failure: Iraq.LiNeBrEaK"Almost all of the neighbors have an interest in what Iraq is going to be like going forward," Carpenter said. "That clearly means talking to countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, but it also means probably at some point bringing Iran and Syria into the process. I think Obama will be receptive to that sort of thing."LiNeBrEaKSkeptics note that while diplomacy has been unpopular in recent years, it's not like it hasn't been tried. But even some of them say Obama may have what it takes to break through the gridlock.LiNeBrEaKHe understands powerLiNeBrEaK"I think that Obama may well be a great president. Because I see him as a rather ruthless, calculating, unsentimental man who will sell you your own hat if you leave it on the table," said Friedman, admiringly. "He is a man who understands power."LiNeBrEaKOther, more optimistic analysts say that Obama's arrival might be a game-changer for a less Machiavellian reason: his name.LiNeBrEaK" 'Barack' is Arabic for 'grace of God,' 'Hussein' is the name of the Shiites' third imam, the symbol of their faith," said Milani. "The idea that someone can come from this background - a child of an African father and a single mother, a poor person who earns a scholarship, goes to Harvard, becomes the president of the United States - is so unlike every stereotypical conspiracy-tainted image of the United States, it does a great deal to undermine that false premise."LiNeBrEaKOther analysts agreed, saying Obama's personal story suggests he will have a longer global honeymoon than past presidents.LiNeBrEaK"This is a massive public diplomacy gift that the United States has been given - or the United States has given itself," Wiseman said.

It ran up record deficits while giving tax breaks to the wealthy and creating a culture of government neglect that left some Americans trapped in a netherworld of neglect after Hurricane Katrina, and continues to keep all of us gripped by the angst of an economic system that remains on the brink of collapse.LiNeBrEaKThis was a president whose election was assured only after the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, settled the more than monthlong dispute over the Florida outcome. He immediately began to govern as if he had a ringing mandate. LiNeBrEaKThe defining event of the Bush presidency came on Sept. 11, 2001, when al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners and turned them into missiles against the icons of U.S. financial and military might. More than 3,000 died that day, and the world was transformed. For a fleeting moment, the American people - and global sentiment - rallied around Bush. But that opportunity would soon be squandered.LiNeBrEaKFor the neocon factions within the Bush administration, the 9/11 attacks opened the opportunity for two goals it brought into office: To force a regime change in Iraq, and to expand the power of the executive branch. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney went on the stump in 2002 to sell the notion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had a connection to al Qaeda. Neither proved to be true. Still, America went to war, and American troops remain in battle to this day, many billions of dollars and more than 4,000 U.S. lives later.LiNeBrEaKThe threat of terrorism became the rationale for other Bush administration assaults on American values. The Bush White House pushed the limits of the law to establish warrantless wiretapping, military tribunals, indefinite detentions of suspected "enemy combatants," torture techniques on detainees and a legal no-man's land at Guantanamo Bay. Bush expanded and redefined the use of "signing statements" to effectively declare that he - as president - can pick and choose which laws he will enforce or ignore.LiNeBrEaKJust don't call Bush a conservative. The last Clinton administration budget had a surplus of more than $100 billion; the fiscal 2009 deficit could approach $700 billion.LiNeBrEaKBush was a disaster on the environment in many ways, but in none more critical than in his belated acknowledgment that climate change was real and was a serious threat to the planet. This nation essentially lost eight years in addressing the most profound issue of our time. In the final weeks of his presidency, Bush moved to undermine the Endangered Species Act. The Bush administration also let politics trump science in other ways, such as its resistance to stem cell research and myriad family-planning programs.LiNeBrEaKPolitics also pervaded this administration's oversight of the Department of Justice. Its attempt to fire nine U.S. attorneys appeared targeted at those who were not regarded as conservative enough.LiNeBrEaKWhen strong hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, what seemed to be a slow and disorganized response reflected badly on the Bush White House. The public relations damage was compounded when Bush toured Louisiana right after Katrina and commended Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael Brown for a "heckuva job." The awful hurricane aftermath, in which we saw hungry and frantic Americans scrambling through the chaos, became an indictment on the competence of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"He kept us safe" is the mantra of the Bush loyalists. Indeed, terrorists did not strike again after 9/11. But the Bush policies did, leading us into war, depriving our liberties, exploiting our natural resources and allowing the construction of financial houses of cards - while seizing new executive powers at every turn. This nation is deeper in debt, gloomier in outlook and weaker in global stature than when George W. Bush took office.LiNeBrEaKThis has been a disastrous eight years.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday  Correction Appended  	Sturgeon on the bite in Bay, San Luis  	Sporting Green; OUTDOORS NOTEBOOK; Pg. C9  	430 words  	FINAL EditionLiNeBrEaKIn the best success by kayak-anglers in years, a flotilla of eight kayakers all caught the elusive sturgeon last weekend. The fish averaged five feet long, pulled the boats on a "magic sleigh ride," and when finally brought alongside, all but a few were released. LiNeBrEaKThis occurred in the China Camp/Rat Rock area of southwest San Pablo Bay, known as the southwest apex of the Sturgeon Triangle. The anglers used a mix of ghost shrimp and grass shrimp for bait.LiNeBrEaK"We saw more sturgeon last weekend than we have seen in the last two months combined.," said Keith Fraser at Loch Lomond Live Bait in San Rafael.LiNeBrEaKThe apparent key to the bite was an excellent cycle of outgoing tides that bottomed out with minuses. The next sequence of similar tides starts arriving in the coming week, with excellent prospects from Thursday through the following Tuesday Jan. 27, best each day in the afternoon. I'll probably end up fishing this cycle on Saturday afternoon.LiNeBrEaKOne lucky angler, Cliff Silva, reported landing five sturgeon in the 4- to 5-foot range last weekend, and released them all.LiNeBrEaKLearn how: Fraser's one-a-year seminar, "Sturgeon Fishing Bay Area Waters," one of the best fishing seminars in the business, is scheduled for 7: 15 p.m. Saturday Jan. 24 at the Marin Rod and Gun Club, located at the western foot of the Richmond Bridge. $5. 415 456-0321.LiNeBrEaKNow get this: In a shocking catch at San Luis Reservoir near Los Banos, a 6-foot, 8-inch sturgeon that's about 140 pounds was caught and released. The lucky angler was Earl Taniguchi of Fowler. The sturgeon was probably pumped 40 years ago as a fingerling out of the delta and arrived to San Luis via the California Aqueduct.LiNeBrEaKIt's not the trout: Scientists blame climate change for killing off frogs in high-elevation lakes in California, not trout, according to a new study published in Herpetological Conservation and Biology. The key is that frogs need water to live in for two to four straight years, so when small lakes dry up in late summer from lack of snowmelt, the tadpoles and frogs can die. Additionally, a weakening of the frogs' immune system leaves them vulnerable to chitrid fungus. Regardless, because DFG has not completed its own environmental studies, virtually all of the DFG's aerial trout stocks in Sierra wilderness are being stopped.LiNeBrEaKCommercial deer poaching: Fish and Game wardens said they arrested three men, including the owner of Samthong Meat Market in Sacramento, for illegally killing deer and selling the meat. In a raid at another suspect's house, game wardens said they found 19 squirrels and packaged bluegill.LiNeBrEaK San Luis, Jan. 18, Sports, C9LiNeBrEaKAn Outdoors Notebook mischaracterized a study on trout, climate change and the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog published in Herpetological Conservation and Biology. That study concluded: "Combined with the invasive fish that prevent frog breeding in larger lakes, lake drying may cause extinction of local fish populations."

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	What an Obama presidency means for Utah and the West  	POLITICS; News; State  	1555 words  	Washington &raquo; Months ago, Barack Obama became the first person in a century to accept a major-party presidential nomination in a Mountain West setting.LiNeBrEaKThat occasion in Denver shows the growing political might of the region and how issues long important to the West are gaining national prominence: Energy development, land use, climate change.LiNeBrEaKObama has promised sweeping policy changes on these and a whole host of other issues ranging from economic policy to health care reform that will profoundly impact -- for better or worse -- Utah and the West.LiNeBrEaKHe's pledged change from the pro-development policies of his predecessor with renewed attention to protecting the environment and weaning America off foreign oil through development of alternative energies. LiNeBrEaKHe's committed to turn around the ailing economy with a quick and massive investment in rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and public buildings. And he's vowed to end the war in Iraq, which has claimed the lives of 40 Utahns, while ramping up the war in Afghanistan, in which seven Utahns have died.LiNeBrEaK"The biggest difference will be the government will not be seen as the enemy but will be seen hopefully as a partner in solving the economic and environmental and domestic and international multiple problems," says Utahn Pat Shea, who headed the Bureau of Land Management under President Clinton.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of being driven by a cheerleading 'drill, baby, drill' attitude, we'll be thinking about what's sustainable in the future and what actions do we take in 2009 that will benefit our grandchildren in 2049," Shea says.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the environment, the incoming Obama administration is expected to diverge from Bush policies on an array of issues important to Utah, from mine safety to health care to a new House seat for the Beehive State.LiNeBrEaKThe economy &raquo; Obama's top priority is a huge stimulus bill -- including a large tax cut -- which he hopes will be a lifeline for an economy sinking in layoffs, foreclosures and bankruptcies.LiNeBrEaKHe wants to spend around $775 billion on the package, with the goal of getting it done next month. But it won't happen without a fight. Republicans are complaining about the price tag and some Democrats question his $300 billion tax cuts. The new president will have a hard time swaying some of Utah's skeptical members of Congress. New Rep. Jason Chaffetz has already promised to fight the bill.LiNeBrEaKBut many Utah residents have high expectations for Obama. A plurality -- 46 percent -- say they expect his actions will improve the economy, while only 29 percent expect those actions to make the situation worse.LiNeBrEaKState leaders also are embracing the Obama strategy.LiNeBrEaKGov. Jon Huntsman Jr. has sent the Obama team a $14. 4 billion wish list that includes major road projects like a widening of I-15 in Utah County and new buildings, such as courthouses and veterans nursing homes. Utah's cities also have their hands outs, saying they have some 100 projects ready to go if the federal money became available.LiNeBrEaKWar and peace &raquo;Obama built his winning campaign on a promise to quickly withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq. With a precipitous drop in violence there over the past year, the incoming administration appears to have a simple path toward making good on that pledge. Changes in military detention policies in both Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the imminent closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay -- may also reduce the number of deployments for units that have been cross-trained to conduct prison operations, as many Utah units have over the past three years.LiNeBrEaKBut although reservists can expect fewer tours of duty in Iraq, an increase in violence across Afghanistan may keep Beehive State military units buzzing for years to come. Several Utah outfits with military specialties needed there -- including transportation, medical and aviation units -- are in line for second war rotations. Meanwhile, active duty and reserve units from Hill Air Force Base -- particularly those from the base's fighter wings -- can expect a continuation of the steady deployment pace of the past several years. That's because the Iraqi and Afghan militaries still don't have the weapons or expertise necessary to conduct and support air operations.LiNeBrEaKThe net effect for Utah's military families may be a gradual decrease in the rigorous pace of training and deployments of the past seven years, with emphasis on "gradual."LiNeBrEaKUtahns appear optimistic Obama will succeed in the managing the two wars and in ensuring the nation's security. A majority --53 percent -- say they are very or somewhat confident about the president-elect's prospects.LiNeBrEaKOil shale exploration &raquo; Energy developers were excited when Congress in October dropped its opposition to selling leases on federal lands for oil shale exploration.LiNeBrEaKBut it may be short lived, if Obama's pick for Interior Department secretary is any indication. Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo, has blocked a rush to develop oil shale, which supporters say is a vast source of domestic energy. Salazar and environmentalists argue that more time is needed to study the ramifications, since no company has yet found a way to commercially produce energy from the shale in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKJeff Hartley, a Utah energy consultant and pro-oil shale advocate, says he's hopeful the Obama administration will take time to listen to oil companies before shutting the door to a major economic engine in the West.LiNeBrEaK"There's kind of a wait and see, fingers-crossed attitude among energy developers, hoping that Obama will recognize the need for domestically produced energy," he says.LiNeBrEaKHealth care &raquo; The Obama team, led by Health and Human Services-designee Tom Daschle, will attempt a major overhaul of the American health care system. The lofty goal is to insure everyone and reduce costs -- not an easy task.LiNeBrEaKFormer President Clinton tried to reform health care, but failed famously. Bush's plan, pushed by former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, never gained traction.LiNeBrEaKBut a number of key groups, including insurance companies and doctors' organizations, have promised to work with Obama. Even Republicans and Democrats have sought middle ground.LiNeBrEaKUtah GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch is working with Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., on what might become the final proposal, while Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have their own bill that would separate health insurance from employment.LiNeBrEaKExpect some smaller bills to come first, including one of Hatch's favorites.LiNeBrEaKBush repeatedly vetoed the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, saying Democrats were using it as a way to shift families from private insurance to a publicly provided plan. A new CHIP bill will most likely be one of the first that Obama signs.LiNeBrEaKMine safety &raquo; After the deaths of six miners and three would-be rescuers at the Crandall Canyon Mine, critics argued that in the Bush administration mine safety has taken a back seat to the corporate interests. Subsequent investigations have mainly faulted the mine's owner, though the Mine Safety and Health Administration took a beating for lax oversight.LiNeBrEaKThe United Mine Workers of America says it expects that under Obama, mines in the country will be safer and administrators will be stronger watchdogs for mine workers.LiNeBrEaKPhil Smith, a spokesman for the union, says that mining oversight under Bush wasn't "particularly good," though MSHA has boosted inspections and mine deaths were actually trending down in 2008.LiNeBrEaKFourth House seat for Utah &raquo; A bill that would grant the District of Columbia its first full-voting member of Congress and give Utah a fourth House seat failed after Bush advisers recommended a veto.LiNeBrEaKBut the bill is expected to make a quick comeback with Obama in the White House. Obama co-sponsored the bill in the Senate and continues to support it. Paired with a larger Democratic majority in both congressional chambers, he could help Utah get another House member in 2010. But even if it passes, the measure could be held up in the courts.LiNeBrEaKPublic lands &raquo; Environmental groups tired of the constant scuffles with the Bush administration are hoping for better relations with and significant policy changes from Obama and Salazar, his designee for Interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKThey were buoyed when members of the transition team criticized the Bureau of Land Management for the sale of oil and gas lease in Utah's red rock country.LiNeBrEaKIssues of energy will most likely dominate the public lands debate under an Obama administration, overwhelming other issues such as the use of ATVs or the expansion of wilderness protection areas.LiNeBrEaKAfter his appointment was announced, Salazar almost exclusively focused on energy development, giving scant mention to the other aspects of his job.LiNeBrEaKBut groups like the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance hope to convince Salazar to reopen six land management plans in Utah that they believe included too many acres for all-terrain vehicles and other commercial uses.LiNeBrEaKMatthew D. LaPlante contributed to this article.LiNeBrEaKmcanham@sltrib.com Alt Heads:LiNeBrEaKPresidentObama whathe means to Utah Obama's agendaLiNeBrEaK1 Pump hundreds of billions into the economy, including funding 'shovel-ready' road-building, bridge and other projects.LiNeBrEaK2 Draw down troops in Iraq and beef them up in Afghanistan.LiNeBrEaK3 Abandon 'Drill baby, drill mentality and start moving the country to alternative, renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama gestures during a news conference at his transition office in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2009, where he introduced Nancy Killefer, not shown, to the newly created position of chief performance officer.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Team Bush changes rules in final stretch  	POLITICS; News; State  	941 words  	Washington &raquo; President George W. Bush and his team have made last-ditch efforts to leave their mark on American policy before Bush cedes control of the federal government and takes that last flight from the White House lawn.LiNeBrEaKIn a series of highly partisan and often-controversial decisions, the Bush administration has created new rules impacting abortion, oil drilling and the fragile economy. LiNeBrEaKFar from rare, these 11th hour regulations have become "a long-standing tradition," according to Allan Lichtman, a presidential expert at American University. He says every president wants "his final stamp on policy" and when the transition is between parties, the decisions normally take on a strong ideological bent.LiNeBrEaKPower plant emissions OKLiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration issued a decision in mid-December saying there is no reason to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of power plants -- a move that directly affects a proposed Utah coal-fired power plant.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency, in a memo, had granted a permit for a coal-fired plant on the Ute Indian Reservation in eastern Utah and then decided that approval was not subject to the impact of climate change from the plant's emissions. At least one U.S. senator has asked the Justice Department to step in and force the EPA to consider the federal Clean Air Act with regard to new coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaKBailout cash for loan to automakersLiNeBrEaKAmid criticism from his own Republican ranks, Bush moved in December to tap a Wall Street bailout fund to loan $17 billion to two troubled automakers. Utah car dealers, some of whom had lobbied Congress for the loans, cheered the move as a way to save millions of jobs, including thousands in the Beehive State.LiNeBrEaK"It's a shot in the arm to take us to the next level, and will help make us profitable in the future," said St. George car dealer Stephen Wade.LiNeBrEaKBut Bush's move brought jeers from several conservatives who said he took a big swipe at free-market capitalism.LiNeBrEaKOil and gas leasesLiNeBrEaKA rushed sale of oil and gas leases near some of Utah's most iconic wilderness lands prompted an outpouring of criticism and even an act of civil disobedience. The Bureau of Land Management wanted to sell leases on 149,000 acres of land near Arches and Canyonlands National Park. The sale was announced on Election Day and took place the Friday before Christmas over the objections of environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKObama transition team members have criticized the sale and hinted they may buy the leases back once he takes office.LiNeBrEaKOn Saturday, a federal judge issued an injunction blocking the leases.LiNeBrEaKTim DeChristopher, a University of Utah student, attempted to foil the sale. He bid on the leases, winning 13 parcels and driving up the price on others. Originally, he said he had no intention of paying, but recently he raised $45,000.LiNeBrEaKGuns in national parksLiNeBrEaKAt the request of the National Rifle Association and Republican senators -- including Utah's Orrin Hatch and Bob Bennett -- the Bush administration signed off on a new regulation allowing people to carry loaded, concealed guns in national parks.LiNeBrEaKThe old rule, adopted under President Ronald Reagan, required people to stow their unloaded firearms before entering the parks, almost all of which ban hunting.LiNeBrEaKA number of National Park conservation and former ranger groups said the new rule will result in more poaching, while proponents like Utah's senators say the regulation will help people protect themselves.LiNeBrEaKThe issue may ultimately be decided in court. Before the rule could go into effect, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence filed suit to block its implementation.LiNeBrEaKReproductive health and conscienceLiNeBrEaKOutgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt sees it as an issue of conscience, while many abortion rights supporters see it as an outrage.LiNeBrEaKThe new regulation, approved by Leavitt, former Utah governor, bolsters the right of health care workers to refuse to provide treatment or even a referral for something they morally object to, namely abortion.LiNeBrEaKLeavitt calls it the "provider conscience" rule, which highlights existing laws and creates new ways to investigate complaints and punish hospitals that don't allow doctors to refuse care. The rule, which sought to redefine abortion, stirred controversy when an early version was leaked. The final rule is more tempered but still causes plenty of anger. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it "a direct assault on women's health care."LiNeBrEaKLast-minute pardonsLiNeBrEaKAs is typical with outgoing presidents, Bush has handed out several pardons and commutations in recent months, including to a Utah man convicted of looting an archaeological site 16 years ago.LiNeBrEaKBush, using his executive power, pardoned David Lane Woolsey, of St. George, of his felony under the 1979 U.S. Archeological Resources Protection Act. Woolsey and another man, who were photographed digging at a protected site, were the first to be prosecuted in Utah under the act.LiNeBrEaKBush also commuted the sentence of a convicted drug dealer at the urging of Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who said that although rapper John Forte was caught with two briefcases filled with $1. 4 million worth of liquid cocaine, he was a musical genius and no risk to society. Forte spent eight years in prison. Hatch defended that request despite criticism he had not reached out to help Utahn Weldon Angelos, who was sentenced to 55 years for selling pot while carrying a gun.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush last-minute policy decisionsLiNeBrEaKTeam Bush has been busy in its final weeks, opening national parks to loaded guns, easing pollution standards on power plants and more. The new rules and policies could have a life well beyond the Bush presidency.

Spokesman-Review (Washington)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	OPINION: Smart Bombs: Knowledge is cool  	COMMENTARY  	515 words  	Jan. 18--Math Is Cool is a statewide program designed to get kids excited about an area of study that has been traditionally tagged as a niche for nerds. Selected students form teams that compete against other schools. The most interesting part is the college-bowl-style face-offs, complete with buzzers. It can be humbling to watch. Yes, your children can answer questions you can't. LiNeBrEaKBut math isn't the only subject in need of a public relations boost. How about:LiNeBrEaKCivics Is Cool. Students would get a closer look at topics such as government, politics, legislation and voting, with the idea that they will become more engaged citizens. Much of that has gone by the wayside as schools drill their students on the topics that are covered by standardized tests. The Federal Way School District would be a prime target. Students there have to get permission from their parents to watch the inauguration of President Obama, according to KING-TV. Rather than using the event as a teachable moment, the district is treating it as a hassle. This is the same district that placed a moratorium on screening the global warming documentary "An Inconvenient Truth."LiNeBrEaKScience Is Cool. The Bush administration was rough on science, preferring to downplay, edit or bury empirical evidence that didn't comport with preferred policy choices. Whether the topic was global warming, evolution, stem cells, emergency contraceptives or endangered species, researchers who passed rigorous peer review still faced a gantlet of towel-snapping ideologues with no use for objective knowledge. Hopefully, the new administration can face down the bullies and help make science safe again for the truly inquisitive.LiNeBrEaKJournalism Is Cool. Self-serving? You betcha! Newspapers are in deep trouble and so is society. Web-savvy consumers have gotten used to free information. So what happens when the information providers fold and the freebies vanish? Some people say citizen journalists will fill the void, but are they really going to change out of their jammies and trudge off to cover city councils, school boards, police departments and legislatures? If so, how will readers know where to find their reports or which ones to trust? What if public agencies blow off their phone calls or refuse their legitimate records requests? Are they really going to file expensive lawsuits? How many bloggers can stand up to powerful interests alleging libel? It's something teachers and their students ought to be talking about.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	Rough Road Ahead Obama takes office Tuesday facing domestic and foreign challenges. We look at the most urgent problems and examine what he'll do.  	NEWS; Pg. A1  	381 words  	WASHINGTON - With Southern states bolting from the Union in 1861, Abraham Lincoln had to sneak into Washington for his inauguration.LiNeBrEaKFranklin Roosevelt took his first oath in 1933 at the height of the Great Depression, when one in every four Americans was out of work. LiNeBrEaKAnd when Missouri's Harry S Truman became president after Roosevelt's death, he hadn't received a decent war briefing and didn't have a clue that we were building the atomic bomb.LiNeBrEaKSo the scope of challenges awaiting Barack Obama after he is sworn in as president Tuesday is far from unprecedented.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, historians say Obama's burdens will be great. Last year's mortgage meltdown and stock market plunge have left the republic shaky financially, with the worst unemployment in two decades. One war, in Afghanistan, is sure to escalate, while another, in Iraq, winds down slowly in a region that remains dangerously unstable. And volatile gas prices, global warming and spiraling health care costs also threaten.LiNeBrEaKObama is fond of saying that a president ought to be able to do more than one thing at a time. He'd better be right about that.LiNeBrEaK"It's not unusual for there to be something that draws a new president right away, but this time it seems to be like a double or triple whammy," said Richard Brody, professor emeritus at Stanford University and the author of a half-dozen books on the presidency and politics.LiNeBrEaKBy any historical measure, Obama has an extraordinary array of challenges. To meet them, says historian Douglas Brinkley, Obama brings a new approach.LiNeBrEaK"It's a new generation taking hold," said Brinkley, who, at 48, is a year older than Obama. "We have gotten sick of the baby boomer split-screen fight between right and left. We don't like the acrimony. We're looking for healing and health food. It's a new mentality."LiNeBrEaKThere's little doubt Obama will delay or break some of his campaign promises. Efforts to reform immigration laws, raise taxes on the rich and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement all have vocal constituencies that sooner or later will complain.LiNeBrEaKBut the depth of the nation's economic woes, along with other pressing challenges domestically and overseas, will require much of the Obama administration's attention.LiNeBrEaKTuesday, Jan. 20, 2009 the challenges obama will face.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	OUR NATION IS READY TO BE SMART AGAIN  	PERSPECTIVE; Pg. 5P  	676 words  	As President Bush takes a valedictory lap, touting asserted victories and barely acknowledging things done wrong, he leaves office deluded into thinking that history will vindicate him.LiNeBrEaKAs destructive as the Bush presidency has been in the short term, its true catastrophic impact won't be realized for years and perhaps decades. Just like the gray and wrinkled president himself, the Bush presidency will not age well.LiNeBrEaKBush claims that his greatest achievement as president was in keeping our nation safe from another terrorist attack. But Bush leaves office having allowed his Iraq folly to distract him from the al-Qaida threat. LiNeBrEaKSince 9/11, terror attacks in Britain and Spain, and American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hand of al-Qaida, demonstrate that the group remained viable throughout his presidency. Bush's invasion of Iraq gave al-Qaida an opportunity to infiltrate that country - where it had not been before - attracting angry Muslim men to its cause from around the world.LiNeBrEaKThen, by putting the Iraq war on a credit card and diverting troops and materiel from Afghanistan, Bush created an intractable mess. Barack Obama will have to address a resurgent al-Qaida and Taliban in Afghanistan and now Pakistan with a broken American military and a multitrillion-dollar bill for the Iraq war that will eventually come due.LiNeBrEaKAll of which makes us less safe.LiNeBrEaKFor all his boasting, Bush didn't dispatch the key al-Qaida terrorists - Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are very much alive. Instead, Bush created more enemies for us. The administration's torture and detention policies were the best recruitment tool since Uncle Sam. For every prisoner we waterboarded, stripped naked, sexually humiliated and nearly froze into hypothermia, we inspired dozens to join the other side.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the real beneficiary of Bush's Iraq adventurism is our nemesis Iran, which had its Sunni mortal enemy Saddam Hussein eliminated and now has a copacetic Shiite-dominated Iraq government next door.LiNeBrEaKBush's geopolitics were a disaster, but what we may never fully know is how destructive the culmination of his anti-intellectual, antiworker and antiscience policies will prove to be.LiNeBrEaKWe have lost eight precious years that we should have been devoting to reducing our dependency on fossil fuels, addressing global climate change and investing in American human capital. The future belongs to those who invent. But the only enthusiasm the Bush administration demonstrated in the realm of science was in subverting it.LiNeBrEaKBush's lack of interest in pushing America toward innovation has made us feel like a country in suspended animation run by a guy who likes his gas guzzler and Uncle Miltie.LiNeBrEaKBush's vision for America was to keep us as the world's consumers: indulgent, wasteful and gluttonous, living on borrowed money like a wastrel. Could it be something in his upbringing that made him comfortable with that condition?LiNeBrEaKBush was unconcerned that America was losing millions of manufacturing jobs and had stopped exporting much of anything beyond exotic securities. He didn't care that the national debt ballooned, our personal savings rate fell to zero and our trade deficit hit record after record.LiNeBrEaKHis priorities were in protecting tax cuts for the rich and expanding global trade policies that moved capital and jobs overseas. That, and making sure no newly created embryos the size of a pinpoint would be used to advance medical cures for diseases afflicting millions of people.LiNeBrEaKSo when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells NPR that the coming economic stimulus plan can be described in four words - "science, science, science and science" - she is expressing a great pent-up demand for America to start being smart again and energetic and start fixing problems rather than creating them, with government as a partner.LiNeBrEaKBush is trying to leave the Oval Office with a smattering of polite applause and claims of some future redemption. But history will not be kind to Bush. His fingerprints will be on the ruins of too much.LiNeBrEaKAmerica has survived Bush - but just barely.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	OBAMA'S VISIT WILL FOCUS ON ENERGY  	NATIONAL; THE CANADA REPORT; Pg. 16A  	747 words  	Environmental concerns and the need for clean, secure energy for North America top the agenda for President-elect Obama's visit to Canada.LiNeBrEaKPrime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed the visit will take place "soon" after Obama's inauguration on Tuesday, but no date had been set.LiNeBrEaKThis will restore a long-standing tradition abandoned eight years ago by President Bush when he went to Mexico to meet with then-President Vicente Fox to improve ties and talk about an immigration deal. LiNeBrEaKNewly elected U.S. presidents from the days of Warren Harding in 1923 and Franklin D. Roosevelt 1933 have typically made Canada their first international visit.LiNeBrEaKHarper and Obama are expected to talk about climate change and cross-border pollution concerns as well as energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKCanada has vast oil and gas resources, while the United States is "an energy-deficient country, with enormous security needs and issues," Harper said.LiNeBrEaK"There is no more reliable and secure supply of energy than from Canada," he added.LiNeBrEaKHarper said he's "delighted" Obama decided to make Canada his first official foreign visit as it shows the close, fraternal relationship between the two countries.LiNeBrEaKAvalanches' toll risesLiNeBrEaKThe death toll continues to rise from avalanches in western Canada.LiNeBrEaKThe 14th death was that of a hiker. An avalanche swept him away near Banff National Park in Alberta.LiNeBrEaKLast weekend, two men snowmobiling were killed in separate incidents near Enderby and Chetwynd in British Columbia.LiNeBrEaKAll but the latest fatality have been in British Columbia in conditions often rated as extremely dangerous with warnings issued. Eight snowmobilers died late last month in three avalanches near Fernie.LiNeBrEaKNews in briefLiNeBrEaK-Nortel Networks Corp. is expected to survive under bankruptcy protection but faces huge hurdles to become viable again, analysts say. The Toronto-based telecom equipment manufacturer filed for bankruptcy protection with billions of dollars in debt. It employs about 30,000 people, down from 95,000, and its stock has plunged to just pennies from a high of $100 (U.S.) in 2000.LiNeBrEaK-Deal or No Deal star Howie Mandel spent a night in St. Michael's Hospital while visiting his hometown of Toronto. Mandel, 53, was rushed from the Sheraton Center Hotel to the hospital over what turned out to be an irregular heartbeat. He was in Canada to work on his latest TV show, Howie Do It, that's a cross between Candid Camera and Punk'd.LiNeBrEaK-Sixteen employees and Clublink Corp., which runs the posh Lake Joseph Club in Muskoka north of Toronto, face charges related to overserving liquor and allowing drunkenness. This is in connection with the deaths of three young men last summer when a car plunged into the Joseph River after they left the club. Ontario Provincial Police said alcohol and speed were factors.LiNeBrEaKFacts and figuresLiNeBrEaKCanada's dollar drifted lower to 80. 12 U.S. cents Friday while the U.S. greenback returned $1. 2481 Canadian, before bank exchange fees.LiNeBrEaKThe Bank of Canada's key interest rate is unchanged at 1. 5 percent, while the prime lending rate is 3. 5 percent.LiNeBrEaKCanadian stock exchanges are lower, with the Toronto composite index at 8,937 points and the TSX Venture exchange at 853 points.LiNeBrEaKLotto 6-49: (Wednesday) 20, 35, 36, 37, 39 and 49; bonus 38. (Jan. 10) 11, 17, 18, 25, 27 and 34; bonus 19. Super 7: (Jan. 9) 8, 12, 24, 26, 31, 37 and 41; bonus 2.LiNeBrEaKRegional briefsLiNeBrEaK-Lower commodity prices and weakened demand are blamed for the loss of 1,000 jobs at Mosaic Co. in Saskatchewan. The potash and fertilizer producer, based in Minnesota, said the layoffs will start Feb. 15 for 700 workers in Esterhazy and 300 in Colonsay. Last month, Potash Corp. laid off 940 workers for eight weeks, while Agrium cut 380 jobs in the province.LiNeBrEaK-Brent Parent, 40, of Langley, British Columbia, was arrested in the road rage death last year of Silas O'Brien, 21, of Abbotsford. At the time, O'Brien and two friends were driving to the airport for a Hawaiian vacation. Their vehicle was forced into a ditch by a pickup truck whose driver returned and swerved into O'Brien, who was looking at the damage.LiNeBrEaK-Hundreds of Atlantic Canadians are enjoying some fun in the sun at no cost. They booked vacations through an Itravel2000 promotion that guaranteed free trips if more than 5 inches of snow fell in Halifax on New Year's Day. A blizzard blew in, dumping 5. 35 inches of snow. Stuart Morris of the online travel agency said the lost billings are covered by a special insurance policy.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	ONCE A GEM, NOW AN EYESORE  	CLEARWATER TIMES; Pg. 3  	498 words  	Step onto the "golf course'' at Timber Oaks and the brown grass crackles beneath your feet. Weeds grow where putts once rolled true on manicured greens.LiNeBrEaKEver visit a ghost town? The feeling is similar, even without tumbleweeds. LiNeBrEaKThirty years ago, U.S. Home took full advantage of the Florida Dream in marketing its sprawling west Pasco retirement subdivision: vibrant seniors playing games at the community center, couples laughing it up on the emerald fairways. It was safe here, and cheap. Tampa and St. Pete were just down the road if you needed a city fix.LiNeBrEaKFor the most part, that hasn't changed. The clubhouse remains popular, neighbors still look after each other, deed restrictions protect property values. But the golf course, once the symbol of an active senior lifestyle, is now an eyesore.LiNeBrEaKIn a state where unsuspecting investors once poured their money into swamps that couldn't be developed, the Timber Oaks golf course covers more than 60 acres, much of which goes underwater during major rainstorms. Developers intended it to be the community's drainage answer, and state regulators approved their plans. But several times over the years the ponds proved insufficient. Golf holes went underwater and only aggressive pumping spared the more vulnerable homes.LiNeBrEaKAll this seems hard to believe these days when rainfall is scarce and cypress trees fall over in the dust. It's kind of like freezing folks in Chicago this week dismissing global warming theories. But the same kind of floods that hit in 1988 and 2004 will return. Timber Oaks, as residents learned many years after the developer was done with the 1,999 homes and gone with the wind, is situated in what is called a "closed basin.'' Water has nowhere to go.LiNeBrEaKSuzanne Pace bought the course in 1998 after years as a club professional in Bradenton. She did her best to generate interest and make a profit, but there were many obstacles and competition. After the flood, she almost had the course sold to developers who wanted to build condos, but homeowners objected and the county's experts said the project would exacerbate flooding in the area.

And Stella would have a better shot at financial help with insulating her house or installing energy efficient windows.LiNeBrEaKThe governor proposes subsidies for electric cars, incentives for solar energy, tougher building codes, help for residential and commercial energy efficiency projects and other measures designed to reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaKThat would give industry and power plants more breathing room, Kulongoski says, particularly since the caps don't take effect until 2012.LiNeBrEaKThe whole package would cement Oregon's standing as a green leader, the thinking goes, and give Oregon companies a jump-start if the U.S. Congress passes a national cap.LiNeBrEaK"The governor is not going to approve a proposal that's going to damage the Oregon economy," said Brian Shipley, Kulongoski's deputy chief of staff for energy, climate change and natural resources.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists warn that political pressure from business could lead to a looser cap that doesn't end up reducing emissions. That appears to be what happened the past few years in Europe.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, if the emissions cap stays tight, critics are skeptical that energy efficiency improvements can nab enough emissions savings to prevent a big economic hit.LiNeBrEaKThe Northwest's population is expected to grow. So are the numbers of electronic gizmos.LiNeBrEaKMark Nelson, a high-profile Salem lobbyist, is leading Oregonians for Balanced Climate Policy, which questions Kulongoski's approach. Its members include groups representing Realtors, paper mills, loggers, industry, cattlemen, dairy owners, farmers, metals industries, food processors and builders.LiNeBrEaKThe group agrees emissions need to come down, Nelson says, and strongly supports other measures to boost energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases. It also isn't absolutely opposed to an emissions cap, Nelson says.LiNeBrEaKBut he doesn't sound too enthused.LiNeBrEaK"We'd almost prefer a carbon tax, which we think is a hell of a lot more straightforward," he said. "The economic damage is so incredible (to reach the state's emissions reduction targets). You only do it by shutting down industry."LiNeBrEaKLabor, a big supporter of the Democrats in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, is shaky on the proposal. If a plan included protections for workers affected by the cap, says Elana Guiney of the Oregon AFL-CIO, "We definitely would consider supporting it."LiNeBrEaKMany of Oregon's public and private electric utilities, including PGE and PacifiCorp, say any carbon caps or carbon taxes should be adopted at the federal level, not by states.LiNeBrEaKA state system prompts manufacturers to move to states without regulation and lower their costs by doing so, said Scott Bolton, PacifiCorp's West Coast lobbyist.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental groups aren't ceding the economic high ground.LiNeBrEaKPutting a gradually tightening cap on emissions is the smartest way to wean the economy off fossil fuel that is volatile in price, questionable in source and diminishing in quantity, said Eric de Place, senior researcher with the Sightline Institute, a Seattle-based environmental think tank.LiNeBrEaK"It is not a winning strategy to need huge amounts of energy to generate a buck," de Place said. "If an Oregon steel plant uses a ton of power, the best strategy to protect those jobs is to make it the cleanest, meanest, most efficient steel plant there is."LiNeBrEaKEnergy price hikesLiNeBrEaKThe Western Climate Initiative, which last year designed a cap system for Oregon and other Western states, predicts residential electricity rates would rise 13 percent over base levels by 2020 if the cap focused on industry and utilities.LiNeBrEaKIndustrial electricity prices would rise by more than a third, the group predicts, though the number would drop dramatically if emissions from cars, trucks and building heating get capped, too. A broader system would boost gasoline prices from 7 percent to 17 percent, the WCI says.LiNeBrEaKThe Electric Power Research Institute says West Coast electricity price hikes could be more dramatic in the early years of a cap --in the range of 40 percent --because utilities couldn't just flip to less carbon-intensive sources.LiNeBrEaKThe only Oregon-specific estimate so far comes from Portland's Cascade Policy Institute, which opposes a cap.LiNeBrEaKAbsent an alternative energy breakthrough, a cap system based on Oregon's greenhouse gas reduction goals would chop economic growth to 2020 in half, the study projected.LiNeBrEaKKulongoski has commissioned an Oregon-specific study. David Van't Hof, the governor's sustainability and renewable energy adviser, said initial results don't show a big hit to industrial jobs.LiNeBrEaKIf global warming predictions pan out, Oregon could be short of water in the summer, get more damaging storms and endure more extreme temperatures, driving electricity use up.LiNeBrEaK"The broader issue," Van't Hof said, "is what's the cost of not taking action."LiNeBrEaKScott Learn: 503-294-7657; scottlearn@news.oregonian.com		NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (92%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (91%); UTILITY RATES (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); RECESSION (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); APPROVALS (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); LEGISLATORS (78%); POWER PLANTS (77%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (77%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (76%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (76%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (74%); TAX LAW (73%); SOLAR ENERGY (72%); TAXES and TAXATION (70%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (70%); MOTOR VEHICLES (65%)  			TED KULONGOSKI (85%)  	WEST USA (94%); OREGON, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%); INDONESIA (79%)  	January 19, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Sunday Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	SCOTT LEARN, The Oregonian

The Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)  	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	OPINION: We should allow time, history to decide who compares best to President Lincoln Richard L. Connor Opinion  	COMMENTARY  	1041 words  	Jan. 18--IT'S EASY TO make comparisons between President-elect Barack Obama and former President Abraham Lincoln. We have the Illinois connections and then the hovering, dark clouds of war, a nation divided and in crisis, and other similarities that provide a historic link. Drawing a line between the two men -- Obama as an African American and Lincoln with his legacy of ending slavery -- is as emotionally charged as it is inspirational.LiNeBrEaKBut as we await the historic inauguration of Obama on Tuesday, there is another parallel with Lincoln and perhaps even one with Sir Winston Churchill. That parallel is awaiting the historic analysis of President George W. Bush. LiNeBrEaKBush leaves office with approval ratings lower than the prices you hear some auto dealers offering to hesitant buyers.LiNeBrEaKI can find only one person on record still devoted to Bush, and she denies her loyalty has anything to do with the baby gift she received from him when her daughter was born.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless -- and this may knock me off some Christmas card lists -- I can see a case for history being kinder to Bush than might seem imaginable now.LiNeBrEaKYes, there are any number of better decisions he could have made. Foremost among them would have been to bring a quick and decisive end to the war in Iraq shortly after it began.LiNeBrEaKAnd yes, he appears to have been soft on big business, especially the oil and energy sector. He has not broken new ground in one of the most vital areas of government policy -- the environment, climate change, and the entire green movement. The handling of some war prisoners has been questionable. His administration failed in response to the crisis in New Orleans and Mississippi following Hurricane Katrina. He fired the people who made the blunders but his personal culpability is that the disaster and accompanying problems happened on his watch.LiNeBrEaKThe dismissal of seven U.S. attorney generals appears to have had a political agenda and resulted in the resignation of many senior staff from the department of justice. The controversy continues to be a black mark for the White House.LiNeBrEaKThere are areas, though, where Bush has excelled.LiNeBrEaKHe has faced a number of crises that few if any presidents have had to confront. First, he was President when the United States was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001. He was decisive in his response and showed admirable leadership both at home and abroad. His establishment of the Office of Homeland Security and creation of a cabinet post is historic and shows vision to the changing world order and the danger that now exists on our shores.LiNeBrEaKThe nation now appears headed for disastrous financial calamity, the worst since the Great Depression. The Bush administration has been forceful in trying to bring calm and to allocate money to industries fighting to survive.LiNeBrEaKAnd the economic woes of this country -- just like other monumental, sea-change problems -- did not simply appear one day. Nor will they go away the next. Sure, this happened under his watch but the seeds for our mortgage, home loan crisis and those of the domestic automobile industry collapse were sown long before Bush took office.LiNeBrEaKHis administration rid a nation, region and the world of Saddam Hussein, a despot whose sordid, tortuous crimes against humanity are well documented.LiNeBrEaKHe paved the way for democracy in Iraq and other countries. It is still too early to tell if democracy will stick in any of those countries, but people who have never voted are voting and among others, women, have new found rights to education and liberation.LiNeBrEaKIf we begin to expect that a chief executive of anything -- be it a country or a Fortune 500 company -- cannot make a mistake or two among the hundreds, perhaps, thousands of decisions they make, then our standards have reached the point of ridiculousness.LiNeBrEaKLooking at Lincoln and Churchill and how they were viewed both in and out of office indicates how difficult it is to pre-judge history's final assessment of a leader.LiNeBrEaKBoth men were criticized for making quick and sometimes impulsive decisions against the advice of advisers. At times both were pilloried for decisions regarding war.LiNeBrEaKLincoln bore the brunt of criticism for war casualties. More soldiers died at the Civil War battle at Antietam in one day -- more than 7,000 -- than the number of American soldiers who have been killed in the war in Iraq. That number is about 4,500 which is not to imply those deaths are inconsequential or without great heartaches to their families.LiNeBrEaKLincoln was criticized, as Bush has been, for running afoul of the Constitution and civil liberties. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus, which allows imprisoned persons to challenge the legality of their arrests. And there were more than 10,000 "arbitrary arrests" while Lincoln was in office.LiNeBrEaKBush lacks the eloquence of both men.LiNeBrEaKChurchill was not only a galvanizing and witty speaker, he also wrote "The History of the Second World War," a book which won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953. Lincoln earned immortality with his address at Gettysburg.LiNeBrEaKWe know for virtual certainty that Bush's speeches will not go down in history. He will not be known for a public display of intellectual depth. What we do not know, however, is how he will be ultimately judged. We know there has not been a foreign attack on our land since 9/11. Is it because of Bush's policies?LiNeBrEaKIf it is proven he kept our nation safe, we will begin to see him differently as a leader.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, only time will tell if he will be viewed as a failure or if, like Lincoln and Churchill, his legacy will grow and expand and shine in the reflected light of history. In the end, it may be Bush -- and not Obama -- who will be found to have more in common with the great President Lincoln.LiNeBrEaKRichard L. Connor is editor and publisher of The Times Leader.

The Washington Post 	January 18, 2009 Sunday   Met 1 Edition	Study: Electricity Usage Is Down;  Weather, Rates May Be Factors In 2% Drop in '08 	METRO; Pg. C01  	896 words  	Last year, as gas prices broke $4 a gallon and the U.S. economy put a wheel in the ditch, the Washington region did something improbable.LiNeBrEaKIt became slightly friendlier toward the climate.LiNeBrEaKSlightly.LiNeBrEaKA new Washington Post analysis shows that local homes and businesses used about 2 percent less electricity in the first nine months of 2008 than they did in 2007. That's a small drop, but for Washington, any drop is significant: Electric power is the region's largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions, and in recent years power use has grown rapidly.LiNeBrEaKThe news cheered local officials, many of whom have promised to cut emissions sharply. LiNeBrEaKBut it also illuminates the work they still have, cajoling or forcing residents to change old behaviors. Last year, a spike in fuel prices, a spell of mild weather and a historic recession barely dented the region's problem.LiNeBrEaK"Things may get worse before they get better," Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett (D) said earlier this week at a news conference announcing new proposals to shrink the county's carbon footprint. "But someone has to start."LiNeBrEaKThe Washington Post estimated recent trends in the region's carbon dioxide emissions using sales data from electric utilities and government figures for miles driven on local roads. Together, these two sources account for about 70 percent of local emissions, leaving out things such as methane from local cows, airplanes and oil-burning furnaces.LiNeBrEaKThe analysis, using methods from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, appears to offer the first glimpse of regional emissions since 2005.LiNeBrEaKIt shows that for two years -- even as local governments promised to reduce greenhouse gases -- the region was pumping out more and more of them. Emissions from the two sources grew 1. 2 percent per year on average in 2006 and 2007.LiNeBrEaKThat was slower than the growth of the region's emissions in the booming first years of this decade. But it was still about 50 percent higher than the national rate for 2005 to 2007. Local emissions still appear to have been borne upward by bad traffic, centers for computer servers, extensively wired suburban houses and a steady, government-centered economy.LiNeBrEaKThen came 2008, and a glimmer of good news about electricity. Vehicle-travel figures from last year are not available yet.LiNeBrEaKLocal leaders said the drop in power usage last year might be a sign that their save-the-climate efforts are working.LiNeBrEaKAlready, they said, Montgomery's commercial buildings are using less power. Dominion has sold 2 million energy-efficient light bulbs. And more than 20,000 people have logged on for energy-saving tips at the Pepco Web site.LiNeBrEaK"I'm certainly encouraged by it," said Stan Edwards, who oversees climate programs in Montgomery. "And I hope it's something we're doing."LiNeBrEaKBut those who sell the electricity saw other possible reasons. At Pepco, which serves the District and Maryland suburbs, officials also blamed a rate hike that increased customers' bills, by about $2 a month on average in Maryland and about $21 a month on average in the District.LiNeBrEaK"There is no way to really identify how much of it is ethically motivated and how much of it is budget-motivated," said Kemm Farney, an analyst at Pepco Holdings, the utility's parent company.LiNeBrEaKAnd in Virginia, Dominion officials said the change was probably just related to the weather. Last year was milder, and customers needed less power to heat and cool their homes. Power usage decreased all along the East Coast last year, and utility experts believe the weather and the economy were largely behind it.LiNeBrEaKWhen you filter out the effects of weather, Dominion spokesman Chet Wade said, "we're still seeing growth in Virginia."LiNeBrEaKSo this good news is also bad news, a warning about how hard it is to slash emissions. Will the decline in power use vanish if this summer is hotter, or if the region booms again?LiNeBrEaK"We know that the task is huge," said John Morrill, Arlington County's energy manager.LiNeBrEaKMontgomery, Arlington and Fairfax counties have committed to stopping the growth of overall emissions by next year. The District has set a target of reducing emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.LiNeBrEaKBut local governments don't have the federal government's power over such major emissions sources as autos and power plants. And now their options are diminished by tight budgets.LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday, a panel in Montgomery proposed measures including solar panels on county buildings, bike paths for carbon-free commutes and interest-free loans for homeowners who want to give their houses a green overhaul.LiNeBrEaKBut Leggett, the county executive, said he had not yet decided which ideas the cash-strapped government would take on.LiNeBrEaKIn Arlington, the government had begun funding energy audits of county homes. The county paid an expert about $300 to examine Andrew D'Uva's Clarendon townhome for energy-leaking drafts; the expert recommended that he buy a more efficient heating and cooling system.LiNeBrEaKBut the county didn't make D'Uva buy the system. And it didn't buy it for him.LiNeBrEaK"Really, I didn't want to waste any more energy than I needed to," D'Uva said. But his purchase of a new system won't pay for itself for years: "I had to invest $8,000 to save $700 a year" on lower utility bills, D'Uva said.LiNeBrEaKNow, even the audits have stopped, halted last summer when the budget ran out.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Finding right fit key for LEGO teams: Teams of youngsters throng UI campus for competition among LEGO robots  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	600 words  	Jan. 18--MOSCOW -- Just like any good LEGO construction, putting together a winning LEGO League team is all about joining the right pieces.LiNeBrEaK"We work really well together, and we don't fight a lot," said Drew Doughty, 12, of Park City, Utah, during a break Saturday afternoon at the FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) LEGO League competition at the University of Idaho Kibbie Dome.LiNeBrEaKAbout 400 third- through eighth-graders from around the Northwest swarmed the dome to pit their autonomous LEGO robots against a tabletop course designed to mimic problems associated with global climate change. LiNeBrEaKDoughty -- whose team name, Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia, means the fear of really long words -- said teamwork wasn't the only key to building a good robot.LiNeBrEaK"We're having a lot of fun," she said.LiNeBrEaKAnd that fun factor is, in turn, one of the keys to getting kids interested in science and engineering, said Tim Ewers, assistant professor in the UI College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.LiNeBrEaK"The kids are having a blast, so we take advantage of that," Ewers said, adding that when youngsters set foot on a college campus, their chances of getting a higher education increase dramatically.LiNeBrEaKIdaho public schools Superintendent Tom Luna said LEGO League helps kids connect book learning to real-life experiences.LiNeBrEaK"This is one of the programs that help students realize the relevance of what they're learning," said Luna, who attended his first competition last year in Idaho's Treasure Valley and had so much fun he came to Moscow for this year's event.LiNeBrEaKLuna said he was also encouraged by the large number of girls on the 41 LEGO League teams.LiNeBrEaK"As they get older, they tend to shy away from math and science, and that ought not to be."LiNeBrEaKEwers said sponsors are crucial to the continued growth of LEGO League since robotics kits cost between $500 and $600. The teams raise a lot of their own money, but they're assisted by groups like 4-H (Ewers' specialty), the Idaho Robotics Opportunities for K-12 Students (Idaho ROKS), the NASA Idaho Space Grant Consortium, the Idaho National Laboratory and private donors, he said.LiNeBrEaKOnce the teams have their kits, they set about building their robot and programming it to perform a set list of tasks, which generally consists of moving various LEGO pieces around the game table.LiNeBrEaKDuring the first round of competition Saturday afternoon, the Moscow team of the Circuit Breakers scored 215 out of 405 possible points, good enough to put them in first place for a while. Robot operators and siblings David Bowman, 15, and Martha Bowman, 11, said robotics is the perfect way to get them hooked on technology.LiNeBrEaK"It's actually really great for the scientific and technical stuff," David Bowman said. "It teaches us about computers and computer engineering, and the physical side of the robot."LiNeBrEaKMartha Bowman said the fun of the experience made her more curious about subjects like math. "The way they do it, I get more interested."LiNeBrEaKHer brother was even more enthusiastic.LiNeBrEaK"It's a blast," David Bowman said. "Give us LEGOs and we're just set. We'll do anything."LiNeBrEaKMills may be contacted at jmills@lmtribune.com or (208) 883-0564.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 18, 2009 Sunday 	Mid-Atlantic not ready for sea-level rise  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	688 words  	Jan. 18--Maryland and other Mid-Atlantic states need to do a better job of preparing for sea-level rise if climate change is as intense as scientists think it will be, according to a new federal report.LiNeBrEaKOn the last business day of the Bush Administration on Friday, the federal government issued the report, "Coastal Sensitivity to Sea Level Rise: A Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region." LiNeBrEaKThe lengthy report -- it is 784 pages long -- assesses the possible effects of sea-level rise and offers suggestions for how coastal states should adapt.LiNeBrEaKMaryland has a double challenge. As sea levels rise because of expanding warmer oceans and melting glaciers, the land also is gradually sinking. States aren't adequately prepared to deal with the effects of the land sinking and the rising seas, according to the report.LiNeBrEaK"Most coastal regions are currently managed under the premise that sea-level rise is not significant and that shorelines are static or can be fixed in place by engineering structures," the report states. "The new reality of sea-level rise due to climate change requires new consideration in managing areas to protect resources and reduce risk to humans."LiNeBrEaKThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a panel of scientists from around the world, has predicted that coastal areas could see 1 meter or more of sea-level rise by the end of this century (1 meter is about 3. 3 feet).LiNeBrEaKPotential effects include flooding in low-lying areas, shoreline erosion, wetlands being swallowed up by water, saltwater intrusion into underground aquifers that are sources of drinking water and more.LiNeBrEaKJust 50 centimeters (1. 65 feet) of sea-level rise could destroy most of the Chesapeake Bay's wetlands, according to the report.LiNeBrEaKAreas on the Western Shore of the Chesapeake vulnerable to flooding include downtown Annapolis, Baltimore along the harbor, the Deale/Shady Side area and North Beach. Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary already has seen changes in marshes that stress birds, and beaches could be eaten away all along the Western Shore, according to the report.LiNeBrEaKThough Maryland has some plans for dealing with sea-level rise, such as limits on building along the shoreline, it lacks a comprehensive plan, the report states.LiNeBrEaK"The report reveals how widespread and complicated the impacts would be," said Dr. Donald Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. "It isn't just someone's beach washing away. It's infrastructure. It's roads, railroads, ports. Downtown urban areas are going to be subjected to greater risks."LiNeBrEaKDr. Boesch, an oceanographer, didn't work on this report, but he works on the Maryland Commission on Climate Change and the U.S. Climate Change Science Program, which coordinates federal work on the issue.LiNeBrEaKDr. Boesch said it's important to address climate change from two directions: we should reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and we need to be prepared for the consequences of global warming, such as sea-level rise.LiNeBrEaKEven if greenhouse-gas emissions are slashed, it likely won't be enough to block all of the negative effects of global warming, he said.LiNeBrEaK"We have to both think seriously about reducing emissions, but also be prepared for a range of conditions," Dr. Boesch said.LiNeBrEaKHe said President-elect Barack Obama's forthcoming stimulus package, which is expected to focus on public works and infrastructure projects, is an opportunity to work on flood prevention and other controls to deal with sea-level rise.LiNeBrEaK"You want to make sure the infrastructure you're investing in is going to increase our resilience to sea-level rise and not make the built environment more vulnerable," he said.LiNeBrEaKHighlights from the report are posted at http://sealevelreport.com.

The Boston Globe 	January 17, 2009 Saturday   THIRD EDITION	`RECYCLING' AT THE DUMP  	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. A10  	735 words  	Landfills holdLiNeBrEaKpotential for powerLiNeBrEaKRE "FINDING a sustainable future at the dump" (Op-ed, Jan. 12): Jeffrey Surma totally ignored the remarkable progress that has been made in turning landfill gas into low-cost, renewable energy, and misrepresented as fact that America's landfills are "close to capacity." The country currently has about 20 years of landfill disposal capacity overall. LiNeBrEaKUS waste-based energy projects provide enough clean, lower-cost, renewable energy to light and heat more than 3 million homes. Major firms such as Dell and BMW are using power generated from landfill gas to run offices and manufacturing sites. And the University of New Hampshire at Durham recently installed a pipeline from a neighboring landfill that is expected to provide the school with as much as 80 to 85 percent of its energy needs. LiNeBrEaKThe use of landfill gas reduces global warming because it captures methane. The EPA estimates that using methane as renewable, "green" energy has the annual environmental and energy benefits equivalent to preventing the use of almost 271 million barrels of oil.LiNeBrEaKThe promise of existing and emerging technologies is essential for advancing the beneficial use of waste products. However, these facilities are still in the pilot stage. What the general public needs to know is that solid waste companies using existing technology are converting landfill gas into clean, renewable energy, helping reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKBruce J. ParkerLiNeBrEaKWashington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKThe writer is president and CEO of the National Solid Wastes Management Association.LiNeBrEaKRecycling is stillLiNeBrEaKour best optionLiNeBrEaKJEFFREY SURMA uses terms like "recycling" and "sustainable" to describe a process that is anything but. Once our wastes are turned into energy, they are gone, up in smoke, not able to be renewed or recycled. His column reflects a lack of understanding of these terms and of environmental principles, and is a prime example of greenwashing.LiNeBrEaKContrary to Surma's claims, genuine recycling is the environmentally preferable, sustainable way to manage waste. It precludes the need to mine new resources, reduces pollution, and uses less water and energy to make new products. According to a recent study by the Tellus Institute that was commissioned by the state, recycling saves much more energy than is generated by turning waste into energy, and creates fewer greenhouse gas emissions and particulates. Plus, it employs many more people.LiNeBrEaKMarkets for recyclables are depressed because of the economy. So are all commodities. Commodity markets are cyclical and will rebound - likely well before a plasma-enhanced melter plant is built.LiNeBrEaKThe only thing renewable about garbage is that we keep making it. Some components may be renewable (paper, food) but others are not (metals, plastics, glass). To claim that turning these materials into energy is renewable, recycling, environmental, or sustainable is, well, rubbish.LiNeBrEaKAmy PerlmutterLiNeBrEaKCambridgeLiNeBrEaKMarkets will recoverLiNeBrEaKREADERS OF Jeffery Surma's op-ed might be misled into believing that plasma gasification provides the ideal solution to the problem of how to find value in the 6 million tons of waste Massachusetts generates every year, but recycling is still the better solution. Though the current financial crisis has had a negative effect on recycling markets, when the economy recovers, so will these markets.LiNeBrEaKThe highest use for what Surma describes as "familiar solid-waste products" is still recycling. There is no need to find an alternative disposal option for materials such as paper - which six months ago was the country's leading export by volume - soda bottles, milk jugs, tin cans, scrap metal, etc. Demand for these products historically has been very strong and will undoubtedly recover before too long.LiNeBrEaKThe most important benefit of recycling is that it decreases the demand for natural resources used to manufacture new products. Recycling paper saves trees, water, and energy. Recycling aluminum reduces the need to extract aluminum from the earth and uses 95 percent less energy than creating a can from virgin materials.LiNeBrEaKThe state needs to stay true to its commitment to capture the recyclables in its waste stream. Only once we have diverted as much as we can for true recycling should we consider alternative disposal options for what is left over.LiNeBrEaKAnn DorfmanLiNeBrEaKNewtonLiNeBrEaKThe writer is on the executive board of MassRecycle.

The Denver Post 	January 17, 2009 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	EDITORIAL With one move, Bush an environmental champion  	Pg. A-30  	217 words  	President George W. Bush is not likely to be accused of being overly friendly to the environment, but his decision creating three new marine national monuments in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii deserves praise. LiNeBrEaKHis move means 195,274 square miles of marine environment, which includes some of the more pristine coral reef ecosystems in the world, will be protected.LiNeBrEaKIt's a surprising move from a president who has dragged his heels on global warming issues and declared open season on large tracts of public land in the West for oil and gas drillers.LiNeBrEaKWith the designation, Bush will have protected more ocean than anyone in history. The cynical view is that it's a last-minute effort at legacy building - but we'll take it.LiNeBrEaKThe protected areas include the Marianas Trench, undersea volcanoes and thermal vents, and a series of atolls that are home to a variety of seabirds, endangered turtles and hundreds of species of fish.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Bush created what was then the largest marine sanctuary by designating 140,000 square miles of ocean and islands near Hawaii as protected.LiNeBrEaKWe're glad to see the president making an effort to save what are unique and fragile parts of the ocean ecosystem.LiNeBrEaKIt's just too bad he didn't see fit to extend that laudable sentiment to more policy areas during his eight years in office.

The Hartford Courant (Connecticut)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Despite The Cold, The Heat's Still On  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	371 words  	Jan. 17--So what ever happened to global warming?LiNeBrEaKThe question might pop up as we try to insulate ourselves from this week's chill.LiNeBrEaKThe short answer is, it's January at 42 degrees latitude. Arctic temperatures -- in the teens with a wind chill down to zero to 5 below -- will be around at least through tonight, the National Weather Service says. LiNeBrEaKThe longer answer: Weather is not the same as climate. The short-term fluctuations of temperature and precipitation we're used to in New England are just part of a long-term picture of averages and means.LiNeBrEaKWeather: An early frost kills off the last of your tomatoes.LiNeBrEaKClimate: Since 1990, the Connecticut shoreline has shifted from Plant Hardiness Zone 6 to the warmer Zone 7.LiNeBrEaKClimate is driven by many fluctuations, ranging from decades-long shifts in ocean currents to changes in the Earth's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years (hence, the ice ages). But within the typical climate shifts of our own era, all of our fossil-fuel burning seems to be having an impact.LiNeBrEaKAnd while it's cold right now, 2008 ranked worldwide as the eighth warmest year on record, tied with 2001, according to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That's based on land and ocean surface temperatures going back to 1880.LiNeBrEaKHalf the globe has warmed at least one-half of one degree Fahrenheit in the past 30 years, and a quarter of the planet has warmed at least a full degree, the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville reported last month.LiNeBrEaKThat doesn't seem like much. But signs of spring come earlier; snow cover is shrinking.LiNeBrEaKSea levels are inching up from the expansion of warmer water and melting glaciers and ice caps.LiNeBrEaKStill feeling cold? At least you're not in Minnesota, where the temperature this week dropped to 37 below zero.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	GREENHOUSE GASES: Debate flares over how to cut greenhouse gases  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1499 words  	Jan. 17--Attacking climate change through a complex greenhouse gas trading system is a centerpiece of the incoming Obama administration's energy policy.LiNeBrEaKBut economists and energy analysts of all ideological stripes are saying a better approach to getting a cleaner atmosphere might involve a political dirty word -- tax.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide, already operating in Europe and contained in some proposed U.S. energy legislation, would aim to reduce greenhouse gases by setting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions, issuing emissions permits and allowing companies to trade them in an open market. Over time, the number of permits would drop, forcing companies to lower emissions.LiNeBrEaKA tax, on the other hand, would simply impose a fee for every ton of CO2 produced by users of fossil fuels, like power plants and refineries. Over time the tax would increase, again encouraging companies to find alternatives. Both options give companies incentives to lower emissions, and both would result in higher energy prices for consumers. LiNeBrEaKBut proponents of a tax on CO2 emissions say it would be less complicated and less expensive to administer and monitor. And the cost would be more predictable to businesses and consumers than a trading system, in which prices can fluctuate greatly.LiNeBrEaKGregory Mankiw, the former head of the Bush administration's Council of Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office, among others, have touted a CO2 tax as a better path. Energy industry executives have too, including former Duke Energy Chief Executive Paul Anderson, Dynegy CEO Bruce Williamson and Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson, who said this month that a tax would be "a more direct and transparent approach."LiNeBrEaK"There seems to be a pretty good consensus among economists in support of a tax, which is surprising given the admiration most have for the strength of markets," said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.LiNeBrEaKBut getting a new tax passed could be a long shot, despite growing public support for climate change legislation and a Democratic administration and Congress that are more inclined to support taxes on industry than Republican predecessors.LiNeBrEaK"So even if a tax is better, can a tax actually get passed by Congress?" asked Francisco Padua, a trader at Amerex Brokers in Sugar Land, which is active in existing emissions markets. "Why even talk about it?"LiNeBrEaKMomentum buildsLiNeBrEaKThe momentum for a cap-and-trade program continued to build last week, as a coalition of business and environmental groups ranging from ConocoPhillips and General Electric Co. to the Natural Resources Defense Council provided a detailed plan to Congress.LiNeBrEaKNo matter how CO2 is regulated in the U.S., it will have a large effect on Texas, and Houston in particular.LiNeBrEaKHarris County ranks No. 1 in the country for tons of CO2 emitted per year at 18. 6 million tons, according to a Purdue University study released last spring. That's because of the concentration of refineries in the area, combined with more than 3 million cars and trucks. CO2 legislation likely would raise costs for local industry.LiNeBrEaKBut a cap-and-trade system also could also create a business opportunity. CO2 trading could top $3. 1 trillion by 2020, double the size of the current global commodities derivatives market, according to Point Carbon, an emissions market advisory firm. A U.S. market would be the largest, worth about $2. 3 trillion.LiNeBrEaKHouston is home to many large commodity trading operations, so it would be a natural place to locate CO2 traders.LiNeBrEaKCap-and-trade programs enjoy strong support for many reasons.LiNeBrEaKSuch a program has been used for more than a decade to cut acid rain in the U.S. by reducing the amount of sulfur dioxide power plants produce. The program assigned a cap on emissions from coal-fired power plants and then created a trading system for allowances that lets companies decide whether it's more cost effective to reduce emissions or buy allowances to pollute.LiNeBrEaKOver time, the number of available allowances was lowered. This made it more expensive to buy emission allowances than to install cleaner technologies at the power plants -- so plants installed more equipment to clean emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe acid rain program cut sulfur dioxide emissions more than 30 percent below 1990 levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, in a way that was predictable and cost-effective to businesses. A similar program aimed at reducing nitrogen oxides, a key component of smog, helped cut those emissions 74 percent below 1990 levels in 20 Eastern states.LiNeBrEaKMuch more complexLiNeBrEaKHow much CO2 might decline under a U.S. cap-and-trade program would depend upon how it was structured, what caps were set and other factors.LiNeBrEaKBut success with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides trading won't necessarily translate to CO2.LiNeBrEaKThose trading schemes were applied only to a segment of one industry -- certain coal-fired power plants. CO2 trading would apply to all power plants and many other industries, so it would be more complex and require more oversight.LiNeBrEaKPower plants also have several relatively easy options for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides reductions, such as switching the type of fuels burned or adding smokestack scrubbers. For CO2, there are currently few easy options, highlighting a need for new methods.LiNeBrEaKAnd the early results for Europe's CO2 cap-and-trade system -- which is many times larger than the U.S. sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides programs -- are seen by some as less than stellar.LiNeBrEaKThe first round of emission credits were free, allowing some emitters to sell permits at big profits without actually lowering their CO2 output.LiNeBrEaKAnd too many credits were issued, leading to a steep crash in carbon credit prices in 2006.LiNeBrEaKAnother component of the system that has raised questions is a United Nations-run market that issues tradable carbon credits from projects that trap or destroy carbon emissions, such as restoring carbon dioxide absorbing forests. Stanford University researchers found some Chinese chemical companies actually increased their output of a refrigerant because destroying a byproduct of the process creates a carbon credit they could then sell.LiNeBrEaKBrice Lalonde, France's special ambassador in charge of climate change, defends the European Union's trading scheme, saying early problems will resolve themselves as the market develops.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see that many missteps," Lalonde said. "We had an experimental phase to start with, and we are trying to learn by doing. The main outcome is that the cap-and-trade system works."LiNeBrEaKSpecial interestsLiNeBrEaKThe Baker Institute's Jaffe has misgivings because a cap-and-trade system creates a large commodity market designed by the U.S. Congress under the influence of competing special interests.LiNeBrEaK"The lobbying over the design will be intense, and there are a lot of aberrations that can be created when you design a market through the political process," she said.LiNeBrEaKAnd just like any large commodity market, CO2 prices could be highly volatile, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston who is co-teaching a graduate-level carbon trading class this semester.LiNeBrEaK"Banks like the volatility and complexity, because the more volatile and complex, the more money they could make," Pirrong said. "But volatility may make companies put off investing in cleaner technology because they can't get an accurate estimate on the costs."LiNeBrEaKSome resistance to cap and trade also stems from the current economic downturn, triggered in part by failures on the part of market participants and regulators.LiNeBrEaK"I think cap-and-trade is unpoliceable," said S. David Freeman, a former executive with several large utilities around the country, including Texas' Lower Colorado River Authority. He now spends much of his time crusading against nuclear power.LiNeBrEaK"You could plant a bunch of trees for a credit, but someone has to make sure you don't cut them down five years later," Freeman said. "There seems like a lot of chances to manipulate."LiNeBrEaKStill, some leading environmental groups prefer cap-and-trade. The Environmental Defense Fund has favored trading, in part because it sets limits on carbon emissions and a tax sets only a price.LiNeBrEaKAnd many are skeptical that the government would make good use of tax proceeds. Various proposals call for the money to go directly back to consumers or to pay for research in low-carbon energy technology, but some worry that the money could just be used for other, un-related projects.LiNeBrEaK"The private sector would do a better job using that value," Amerex's Padua said.LiNeBrEaKtom.fowler@chron.com		EMISSIONS (94%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (91%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); COMPUTER TRADING SYSTEMS (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); LEGISLATION (89%); ECONOMIC POLICY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (78%); STOCK EXCHANGES (78%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (77%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (77%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (76%); POWER PLANTS (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (70%)  	DUKE ENERGY CORP (90%); EXXON MOBIL CORP (84%); CONOCOPHILLIPS (84%); GENERAL ELECTRIC CO (61%); DYNEGY INC (58%); TELENT LTD (50%)  	COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS (54%); CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (54%)  	BARACK OBAMA (91%); REX W TILLERSON (54%); BRUCE A WILLIAMSON (54%)  	HOUSTON, TX, USA (79%) TEXAS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (92%)  	January 17, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Houston Chronicle   	Tom Fowler, Houston Chronicle  		DUK (NYSE) (90%); XOM (NYSE) (84%); COP (NYSE) (84%); GNE (PAR) (61%); GEC (LSE) (61%); GEB (BRU) (61%); GE (NYSE) (61%); DYN (NYSE) (58%) NYSE:DUK, NYSE:DYN, NYSE:XOM, NYSE:COP, NYSE:GE, NASDAQ-OTCBB:AEXG  	SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (90%); NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING (84%); NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES (84%); NAICS211111 CRUDE PETROLEUM and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (84%); NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE and ENGINE PARTS MANUFACTURING (61%); NAICS335222 HOUSEHOLD REFRIGERATOR and HOME FREEZER MANUFACTURING (61%); NAICS335211 ELECTRIC HOUSEWARES and HOUSEHOLD FAN MANUFACTURING (61%); NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (58%); NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION (58%); NAICS211112 NATURAL GAS LIQUID EXTRACTION (58%); SIC1321 NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (58%) Crime/law  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090117-HO-GREENHOUSE-GASES-0117  	HO  									
The New York Times 	January 17, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	Study Warns of Threat to Coasts From Rising Sea Levels  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16  	414 words  	Sea level rise fueled by global warming threatens the barrier islands and coastal wetlands of the Middle Atlantic States, a federal report warned on Friday. LiNeBrEaK  The report, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Geological Survey and other agencies, is one of a series examining the potential effects of a rising sea level on the nation's coasts. LiNeBrEaK  The rise in sea level is accelerating, the report said, because warmer water occupies more space and because of runoff from melting inland glaciers and ice sheets. The Middle Atlantic States are particularly vulnerable because the rates of rise are ''moderately high'' there, the region is subject to storms, it is densely populated and much of its infrastructure is in low-lying areas.LiNeBrEaK  The report, which is available at climatescience.gov, says that in the 20th century, rates of erosion in the region varied from 2. 4 millimeters to 4. 4 millimeters a year, or about a foot over 100 years. In the future, the report said, ''it is virtually certain'' that coastal headlands, spits and barrier islands will erode faster than they have in the past.LiNeBrEaK  If sea level rises at a rate of seven millimeters a year or about two feet per century, ''it is likely that some barrier islands in this region will cross a threshold,'' and begin to break up, the report said. The islands forming the Outer Banks of North Carolina are particularly threatened.LiNeBrEaK  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations climate effort, estimated in its most recent report that sea level might rise by about as much as two feet by 2100. Many experts regard the estimate as optimistic. LiNeBrEaK  Even a modest acceleration of sea level rise will have a negative effect on the region's coastal wetlands, the report says, adding, ''It is likely that most wetlands will not survive'' a two-foot rise.LiNeBrEaK  In natural environments, wetlands survive rises in sea level by shifting inland to higher ground. But in the Middle Atlantic States, the report notes, valuable infrastructure like buildings and roads stands in their way.LiNeBrEaK  The report said public officials should consider the vulnerability of coastal areas and take action when necessary, for example, by limiting development in vulnerable areas. But it noted that there was great uncertainty about the timing and extent of the effects of sea level rise and that the region had conducted ''only a limited number of analyses and resulting statewide policy revisions'' to address the issue. 	http://www.nytimes.com  	ISLANDS and REEFS (92%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (90%); COASTAL AREAS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); WETLANDS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (77%); POPULATION DENSITY (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (64%)  		UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (84%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (54%)  		NORTHEAST USA (94%); NORTH CAROLINA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 17, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By CORNELIA DEAN  															
The New York Times 	January 17, 2009 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	The Films Are Green, but Is Sundance?  	Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 1  	988 words  	If it were possible to cleanse the planet by watching a movie, this would be the place to do it.LiNeBrEaK  In 2006 this city's showcase event, the Sundance Film Festival, forged what promises to be an enduring link between the cinematic arts and things environmental with a debut screening of ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the Al Gore documentary about global warming that went on to win an Academy Award.LiNeBrEaK  This time around the festival -- which opened on Thursday and runs through Jan. 25 -- has a schedule that's greener than Fifth Avenue on St. Patrick's Day. At least seven movies with strong environmental themes are set for world premieres here, culminating with the closing-night film, ''Earth Days.'' LiNeBrEaK  A documentary by the director Robert Stone, ''Earth Days'' is billed by festival programmers as ''the history of our environmental undoing,'' seen through the eyes of nine people who helped to initiate the modern eco-movement, including Stewart Udall, the former secretary of the interior, and the biologist Paul Ehrlich.LiNeBrEaK  Still, a stroll here this week down Main Street -- where a dozen idling trucks were unloading supplies and equipment, while an oversize band bus, with trailer in tow, spewed fumes outside a soon-to-be-busy party site -- framed the obvious quandary: how can you cram some 46,000 people, roughly equivalent to a fifth of Hollywood's total work force, into a pretty little mountain town without contributing mightily to the problems your films hope to solve?LiNeBrEaK  The airlift alone should give pause to the likes of Mr. Udall, or to the makers of ''No Impact Man,'' a documentary about the effort by a New Yorker, Colin Beavan, and his family to live for a year without making a net environmental impact. LiNeBrEaK  ''I think one of the lessons I learned in making this film is, I don't think there is such a thing as being truly green,'' Justin Schein, who directed ''No Impact Man'' with Laura Gabbert, said while standing outside its first Sundance screening on Friday morning. ''It's about asking the questions.''LiNeBrEaK  Los Angeles to Park City is about 692 miles by the old wagon route, though most visitors seem to come by air through Salt Lake City -- many by private jet. According to a report last year by Flight Options, a transit firm based in Cleveland, the Sundance festival helped make Salt Lake City the nation's No. 2 destination for fuel-guzzling private flights, behind West Palm Beach, Fla.LiNeBrEaK  Even freeloading journalists could take a charter flight this year: Expressjet was offering a select group of reporters free rides on a 41-seat plane from Los Angeles on Friday.LiNeBrEaK  If Expressjet found takers, the flight would get its passengers here in plenty of time for the Sunday evening screening of ''Crude,'' about the struggle between Ecuador's indigenous people and the Chevron Corporation over toxic oil waste left behind by the makers of petroproducts like those that fly the planes, not to mention those fueling the limousines and rental cars that make the nearly 40-mile run to Park City from the Salt Lake airport.LiNeBrEaK  Utility officials said there was no way to determine how much extra wattage was being poured into the valley for the festival's spotlights and the strings of colored bulbs lining Park City's streets. ''Pinpointing use for one city,'' said Margaret Oler, an information officer with Pacificorp, which provides power to the area, ''can be pretty difficult.''LiNeBrEaK  Outside the Filmmakers Lodge, a central gathering spot for Sundance participants, a sign assured festivalgoers: ''Electricity used for all venues and theaters is offset by clean, renewable wind energy.''LiNeBrEaK  It explained that the energy for the festival's official screenings comes through Rocky Mountain Power's Blue Skies program, which provides wind-powered electricity.LiNeBrEaK  On Sunday evening, green.msn.com and Self magazine plan to join Greenhouse, a New York City nightclub using environmentally sustainable materials, in sponsoring what they called a big, ''ecofriendly'' party for ''Crude'' at the Sky Lodge in Park City.LiNeBrEaK  In what could be seen as a bit of excess, ''Crude'' is actually being celebrated by two such gatherings. The other was a Friday night tent party  sponsors billed as ''the biggest eco-bash in Sundance history.''LiNeBrEaK  Supposedly, Sting, Danny DeVito and Lindsay Lohan were among those scheduled to enjoy the ''full open bar all evening,'' in honor of four films: ''Crude''; ''The End of the Line,'' about fished-out oceans; ''Dirt! The Movie,'' about the exhaustion of our soil; and ''Big River Man,'' about an endurance athlete who sets out to swim the Amazon, braving predators and toxic waste.LiNeBrEaK  ''The Cove,'' about environmental watchdogs dogging dolphin wranglers in Japan, is to get its own party on Sunday, under the sponsorship of Ben Silverman, the co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, among others.LiNeBrEaK  But on Wednesday, before a single party began, ecofriendly or otherwise, the dirt was already piling up here.LiNeBrEaK  The crew of one truck along Main Street was peeling big packing sheets off what appeared to be even bigger plasma television screens, brought in to brighten the festival proceedings.LiNeBrEaK  The foam packing would offset more than a few of the plastic water bottles festival sponsors hope to eliminate with a new program by the Brita and Nalgene companies, which are providing reusable bottles to be refilled at ''hydration stations.''LiNeBrEaK  If that doesn't work, Fiji Water was offering its conventional bottles of water at one of the many promotional boutiques on Main.LiNeBrEaK  A new concept car from Honda -- a hydrogen-powered vehicle -- sat inside the walls of a just-completed plexiglass tent at the corner of Seventh and Main Streets in the heart of downtown Park City, promoting the green pleasures of its energy conservation. Also inside, a young woman was asked how she was able to keep warm in the frigid mountain air. LiNeBrEaK  ''We have heaters,'' she said. ''Big, electric heaters blowing some heat in here.''	http://www.nytimes.com  	FILM (91%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (90%); ARTS FESTIVALS and EXHIBITIONS (90%); FESTIVALS (90%); EARTH DAY (90%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); ENTERTAINMENT and ARTS AWARDS (72%); AIR CHARTER SERVICES (60%); FILM DIRECTORS (78%)  			AL GORE (57%)  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (92%); SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (92%) UTAH, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); FLORIDA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 17, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: Main Street in Park City, Utah, was filled with traffic and construction on Wednesday, ahead of the Sundance Film Festival.(PHOTOGRAPH BY GEORGE FREY/EUROPEAN PRESSPHOTO AGENCY)                                             		Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By MICHAEL CIEPLY  	PARK CITY, Utah   														
Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	NASA chief Michael Griffin won't return, says his goodbyes: NASA chief isn't staying, says goodbye  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	997 words  	Jan. 17--WASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKAn unusually soft-spoken Michael Griffin told NASA employees Friday that he would not remain as administrator when Barack Obama becomes president next week, ending almost four years as head of an agency he had hoped to lead back to the moon.LiNeBrEaK"Today is my last chance to visit with everyone," said Griffin, who will be temporarily replaced by Associate Administrator Christopher Scolese. "I have no idea what I'm doing next. It's really hard to hunt for a job when you're running NASA." LiNeBrEaKObama's NASA transition team -- with whom Griffin publicly sparred -- has reportedly suggested three names as possible replacements. Two are said to be scientists, but none of the names has been released.LiNeBrEaKNone of the names floated publicly -- retired Air Force Gen. J. Scott Gration, Earth scientist Charles Kennel and former astronaut Charles Bolden -- is considered a sure bet by the political or space community, sources said.LiNeBrEaKGriffin had lobbied fiercely to continue as administrator. But the often-combative engineer hurt his chances when he publicly upbraided Lori Garver, head of the transition team, as "not qualified" to evaluate the Ares I moon rocket that he championed.LiNeBrEaKInstead, his resignation -- required of all appointees of President George W. Bush -- will be effective at noon Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKGriffin's legacy at riskLiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration has begun reviewing the Constellation program, which includes Ares I and the new Orion capsule and is meant to return astronauts to the moon by 2020. The program has been nagged by technical and financial problems, and its fate is likely to determine Griffin's legacy.LiNeBrEaK"It is totally tied to Constellation," said Roger Launius, curator at the National Air and Space Museum and a NASA historian for 12 years. "He has repeatedly worked to protect that particular approach. He has criticized and sometimes belittled those who leveled criticism against the program."LiNeBrEaKGriffin, NASA's 11th administrator, leaves behind an agency at the crossroads.LiNeBrEaKThe space shuttle is scheduled to retire in 2010, and Constellation won't launch before 2015. In the interim, America will have to rely on Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft to get to the international space station, and 3,500 jobs at Kennedy Space Center could disappear.LiNeBrEaKObama also has urged more emphasis on science missions -- including research about climate change and global warming -- which NASA's rocket scientists fear will divert money from its manned space program.LiNeBrEaKGriffin, 59, was named administrator by Bush in 2005, shortly after the president set a goal of returning to the moon and eventually flying to Mars. But the space community complained that Bush and Congress never gave the $17 billion agency enough money to do the job.LiNeBrEaKGriffin settled on Constellation in 2005. The shuttle-derived spacecraft was intended to cut costs because it would require fewer personnel to launch and maintain it -- a major concern for KSC workers, who prepare the shuttle for flight.LiNeBrEaKBut one recent study warned that Constellation could cost $7 billion more than expected if it is to fly by its target date of March 2015. The Ares I rocket also faces engineering challenges, such as violent shaking during liftoff that could kill astronauts.LiNeBrEaKStill backs ConstellationLiNeBrEaKGriffin, who acknowledged having "difficult user interface" with others, rejected all alternatives, including extending the shuttle past 2010 or mounting a new crew capsule aboard military rockets. He insisted Constellation was the safest and cheapest option.LiNeBrEaK"If I have one regret," he said Friday, "the one I would say, honestly, is that I could not manage to persuade an even higher percentage of people that the things we were doing were the right things."LiNeBrEaKGriffin's other noteworthy controversy erupted in 2007 when he questioned whether global warming was a problem.LiNeBrEaK"I am not sure that it is fair to say that is a problem we must wrestle with," he told National Public Radio. An internal NASA watchdog later concluded political appointees in NASA's media office either "marginalized or mischaracterized" climate studies from 2004 to 2006.LiNeBrEaKGriffin generally avoided controversies in his farewell address, which was televised live to NASA facilities across the country. Instead, he spent nearly an hour thanking employees and encouraging them to cooperate with Obama. "Try to find common ground with the new leadership," he said.LiNeBrEaK"NASA will look great whether we are asked to return to the moon and . . . go to Mars, as I think we ought to be asked to do. Or whether we are asked to carry out some other task," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe said his top achievement was returning the shuttle to flight after the 2003 Columbia accident grounded the fleet for two years.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in the world is harder than picking yourself up after a cataclysm like that," Griffin said.LiNeBrEaKGriffin 'very successful'LiNeBrEaKJohn Logsdon, a former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Griffin's "careful stewardship of the shuttle" would stand as a lasting achievement.LiNeBrEaK"He has been very successful of managing the risks of a risky program," he said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who heads the Senate's NASA oversight committee, praised Griffin as "a good man [who] was a good administrator."LiNeBrEaKBut Nelson, who supports ex-astronaut Bolden to replace Griffin, also sent a veiled warning to Obama.LiNeBrEaK"I am hopeful," he said, "that the administration's selection to replace him has similar experience and knowledge of the space program as Mike does."

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Perspectives in carbon  	COMMENTARY  	316 words  	Jan. 17--A Harvard physicist says doing two Google searches has about the same carbon footprint as boiling a kettle for a cup of tea.LiNeBrEaKTo be precise, a Google search generates about 7 grams of CO2, figures Alex Wissner-Gross, while boiling a kettle of water generates about 15 grams. Breathing for 10 minutes by a human produces 6 grams. LiNeBrEaKMr. Wissner-Gross doesn't hate Google or information technology, which accounts for 2 percent of the globe's greenhouse gases, about equal to the airline industry.LiNeBrEaKBut because he's trying to save the planet from the mythical global warming bogeyman -- man himself -- he is trying to guilt-trip the greens at Google into operating their many huge, power-hungry data centers more efficiently.LiNeBrEaKGoogle contends the true pain to the planet of one of its searches is a mere 0. 2 grams of CO2, about one-thousandth as much as a one-kilometer drive in the average car.LiNeBrEaKWhatever the true CO2 figure is, we get Wissner-Gross' annoying point: Even searching the Internet -- a techno-miracle earthlings take for granted and do an estimated 200 million times a day -- has a environmental cost.LiNeBrEaKBut so does everything modern humans do in the real world of scarcity and trade-offs.LiNeBrEaKComputers and servers, like battery-powered electric cars and everything else we plug in, don't run on pixie dust. They run on energy that must be produced by someone, somewhere, somehow -- usually by burning stuff.LiNeBrEaKEven cavemen left carbon footprints.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 17, 2009 Saturday   Metro Edition	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B9  	717 words  	President Bush leaves disaster in his wakeLiNeBrEaKThis nation and others around the world were breathing great sighs of relief as an unrepentant George W. Bush held his final news conference. From the outset, he was absolutely the wrong person to be our president. He lacked an understanding of history, a vision for the role of the United States in the 21st century and the temperament to unite the country in a common agenda.LiNeBrEaKAstonishingly, he takes no responsibility for his disastrous eight years, with evidence of devastation all around him. The highest federal and trade deficits in history and the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression might have been avoided or lessened if a concerned leader had been at the nation's helm. LiNeBrEaKThe great "decider" increased divisions in government, ignored expert advice and punished dissenters throughout. He appointed incompetents whose only qualifications were that they agreed with him. Meanwhile, Bush ignored global warming and reduced protections for consumers in the service of corporate profits. During eight years, he proposed nothing to increase the availability or reduce the costs of health care.LiNeBrEaKI would disagree with Bush that we must await his death to judge his legacy.LiNeBrEaKRichard M. EislerLiNeBrEaKBlacksburgLiNeBrEaKExpect Bush, Cheney to take the evidenceLiNeBrEaKWhen President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney leave Washington, we can be assured that they will take the transcripts and films of the "enhanced" interrogation methods such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other forms of violations of the Geneva Convention that they have employed in the interrogation of alleged terrorists.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the FBI and other intelligence agencies determined such means of torture have not produced any credible information, the Bush administration insists that its interrogation methods protect the American homeland from terrorist attack. The truth is the attacks were switched to Iraq, where thousands more Americans, coalition forces and Iraqi citizens were killed and maimed than were affected on 9/11, and an enormous attack was made on our world credibility and finances.LiNeBrEaKPatrick KilleenLiNeBrEaKMonroeLiNeBrEaKFree to call God by any nameLiNeBrEaKAnyone in the U.S. should have the freedom to pray in Jesus' name or any name, no restrictions. Individuals entering our country, legally or illegally, come here to live because we are a free country established under God. I commend Roanoke Vice Mayor Sherman Lea's prayer.LiNeBrEaKWould anyone here understand the reason we are the one country nearest to being a free country left in the world? It is that Jesus and God are the foundation on which we built this great nation. It will continue to exist only if we defend and guard it that way.LiNeBrEaKWhen we take God and Jesus from our way of life, we lose the reason for all those young men and women who gave their lives in battle to assure us that God will always be there. If the nonbelievers are so certain there is no God or Jesus, why do they spend so much time fighting against them?LiNeBrEaKBelieve what you want concerning your religion, but don't try to take my living God from me. You cannot make me worship the ones you do, because he is the only God. Give him the praise, in Jesus' name.LiNeBrEaKJim Fleshman Sr.LiNeBrEaKBoones MillLiNeBrEaKLoss of prayer is hurting the countryLiNeBrEaKI want to applaud Vice Mayor Sherman Lea's prayer. I also want to applaud Irene Chapman for standing up and speaking out on her faith and Christian beliefs ("Lea should be free to pray in Jesus' name," Jan. 7 letter). Our country was established on Christian principles.LiNeBrEaKOur country was doing a lot better before the antagonists started to take God and Jesus out of everything. If only people would look back a few years ago when prayers, God and Jesus were still in our country. We didn't have all these murders in schools, malls and churches and all these killings of parents and children, because people believed in God.LiNeBrEaKJust look at our world since our prayers have been stopped. People don't even want to believe in Jesus' birth or have Christ in Christmas anymore. I would love to be told how Jesus' birth or Christ in Christmas has hurt anyone. Christians, please stand up for God.LiNeBrEaKI am with Chapman. If people don't want to worship our God, then leave our country and go to one where you can worship false gods.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Blumner: Judgment of Bush presidency will only grow harsher  	OPINION; Columnists  	689 words  	As President Bush takes a valedictory lap, touting asserted victories and barely acknowledging things done wrong, he leaves office deluded into thinking that history will vindicate him.LiNeBrEaKAs destructive as the Bush presidency has been in the short term, its true catastrophic impact won't be realized for years and perhaps decades. Just like the gray and wrinkled president himself, the Bush presidency will not age well.LiNeBrEaKBush claims that his greatest achievement as president was in keeping our nation safe from another terrorist attack. But Bush leaves office having allowed his Iraq folly to distract him from the al-Qaida threat. LiNeBrEaKSince 9/11, terror attacks in Britain and Spain, and American deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hand of al-Qaida, demonstrate that the group remained viable throughout his presidency. Bush's invasion of Iraq gave al-Qaida an opportunity to infiltrate that country -- where it had not been before -- attracting angry Muslim men to its cause from around the world.LiNeBrEaKThen, by putting the Iraq war on a credit card and diverting troops and materiel from Afghanistan, Bush created an intractable mess. Barack Obama will have to address a resurgent al-Qaida and Taliban in Afghanistan and now Pakistan with a broken American military and a multitrillion-dollar bill for the Iraq war that will eventually come due.LiNeBrEaKAll of which makes us less safe.LiNeBrEaKFor all his boasting, Bush's strategy didn't dispatch the key al-Qaida terrorists -- Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are very much alive. Instead, Bush created more enemies for us. The administration's torture and detention policies were the best recruitment tool since Uncle Sam. For every prisoner we waterboarded, stripped naked, sexually humiliated and nearly froze into hypothermia, we inspired dozens to join the other side.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the real beneficiary of Bush's Iraq adventurism is our nemesis Iran, which had its Sunni mortal enemy Saddam Hussein eliminated and now has a copacetic Shiite-dominated Iraq government next door.LiNeBrEaKBush's geopolitics were a disaster, but what we may never fully know is how destructive the culmination of his anti-intellectual, anti-worker and anti-science policies will prove to be.LiNeBrEaKWe have lost eight precious years that we should have been devoting to reducing our dependency on fossil fuels, addressing global climate change and investing in American human capital. The future belongs to those who invent. But the only enthusiasm the Bush administration demonstrated in the realm of science was in subverting it.LiNeBrEaKBush's lack of interest in pushing America toward innovation has made us feel like a country in suspended animation run by a guy who likes his gas guzzler and Uncle Miltie.LiNeBrEaKBush's vision for America was to keep us as the world's consumers: indulgent, wasteful and gluttonous, living on borrowed money like a wastrel. Could it be something in his upbringing that made him comfortable with that condition?LiNeBrEaKBush was unconcerned that America was losing millions of manufacturing jobs and had stopped exporting much of anything beyond exotic securities. He didn't care that the national debt ballooned, our personal savings rate fell to zero and our trade deficit hit record after record.LiNeBrEaKHis priorities were in protecting tax cuts for the rich and expanding global trade policies that moved capital and jobs overseas. That, and making sure no newly created embryos the size of a pinpoint would be used to advance medical cures for diseases afflicting millions of people.LiNeBrEaKSo when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tells NPR that the coming economic stimulus plan can be described in four words -- "science, science, science and science" -- she is expressing a great, pent-up demand for America to start being smart again and energetic and start fixing problems rather than creating them, with government as a partner.LiNeBrEaKBush is trying to leave the Oval Office with a smattering of polite applause and claims of some future redemption. But history will not be kind to Bush. His fingerprints will be on the ruins of too much.LiNeBrEaKAmerica has survived Bush -- but just barely.LiNeBrEaKYou can respond to Robyn's column at blumner@sptimes.com		TERRORISM (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); IRAQ WAR (90%); TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (90%); MUSLIMS and ISLAM (89%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK (75%); SCIENCE POLICY (69%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (68%); ARMED FORCES (66%); SCIENCE NEWS (60%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (60%); CLIMATE CHANGE (60%); COLD INJURIES (62%)  		AL-QAEDA (94%)  	GEORGE W BUSH (94%); BARACK OBAMA (55%); SADDAM HUSSEIN (52%)  	UNITED STATES (95%); IRAQ (94%); AFGHANISTAN (93%); PAKISTAN (79%); IRAN (79%); SPAIN (79%)  	January 18, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  	By Robyn Blumner The St. Petersburg Times  															
The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Landfills generate 'green' cash in northern Utah  	NEWS; State  	733 words  	Massive piles of rotting garbage dumped in landfills over decades in Ogden and Layton are creating cash, foot by cubic foot.LiNeBrEaKWeber County and Wasatch Integrated Waste Management System not only make money by turning methane gas generated in the trash heaps into electricity, they're also selling carbon offset credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange.LiNeBrEaKWhile it's not a lot of money, it makes the green landfill projects even greener. LiNeBrEaKLast spring, Weber County made $102,000 selling carbon credits it was awarded by the Chicago Climate Exchange for reducing greenhouse gases in 2005, 2006 and 2007, said Gary Laird, the county's solid-waste manager.LiNeBrEaKLaird sold at the top of the market, when carbon credits were worth $6. 30 to $7 each. Friday on the Chicago Climate Exchange, the credits were down to $1. 95 each.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated sold about $14,000 worth at a lower $2 market rate, but is holding onto more than 88,000 credits, figuring the price will rise with demand when the government gets around to regulating greenhouse gas emissions, said Wasatch's Executive Director Nathan Rich.LiNeBrEaK"It's sure worked out neat so far," he said.LiNeBrEaKChicago Climate Exchange is one of dozens of markets that have cropped up worldwide in recent years as pressure as mounted on countries and companies to reduce greenhouse.LiNeBrEaKWasatch Integrated, which burns and puts into landfills almost all the waste in Davis County and all of Morgan County's, joined in January 2007; Weber County joined that spring.LiNeBrEaKEach had begun capturing methane natural gas generated in their capped trash heaps a few years earlier, mainly to keep it from migrating and, later, exploding.LiNeBrEaKThe gas is piped to nearby electrical generating stations. Weber County owns its station and sells power to Rocky Mountain Power -- a source that gave the county a tidy $240,000 last year. Wasatch Integrated's methane goes to a plant over the fence at Hill Air Force Base. Sales last year amounted to $40,000 for Wasatch.LiNeBrEaKWhile energy and environmental activists applaud such efforts, some are not so enthusiastic about the markets, like Chicago Climate Exchange, that let those curbing emissions trade on their own good deeds.LiNeBrEaKOne, Joseph Romm, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of the book Hell and High Water: Global Warming -- the Solution and the Politics -- and What We Should Do, calls them carbon "rip-offsets."LiNeBrEaKHe doesn't like that the Chicago Climate Exchange rewards companies or governmental agencies for past greenhouse-gas reductions.LiNeBrEaK"If I'm going to put up money, I want my money to go to a project that wouldn't otherwise happen," Romm said.LiNeBrEaKHe also believes there isn't enough scrutiny of the projects that earn the credits, likens the market to the mortgage-backed securities market now in shambles. LiNeBrEaK"The offset business is unregulated and voluntary, and it doesn't take a genius to see unregulated markets tend to attract a lot of dubious players," said Romm, who is also editor of the Web site www.climateprogress.org .LiNeBrEaKRich disagreed.LiNeBrEaK"I've been through the verification process, and it's crazy, very detailed," he said. "If you're buying these credits, they're real."LiNeBrEaKThe Chicago Climate Exchange uses independent engineers to verify emission reductions and Wasatch, which is a full member of the exchange, also is scrutinized by auditors who verify that it is reducing emissions at its burn plant, as promised when it became a full exchange member.LiNeBrEaKWasatch agreed to reduce burn plant emissions by 6 percent by 2010.LiNeBrEaKRich also defended the market's practice of rewarding credits for past good work.LiNeBrEaK"What's wrong with rewarding people for good behavior?" he said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Wasatch didn't expect to make a bundle of money, selling carbon offset credits can help new green projects pencil out, he said.LiNeBrEaKLaird said the sale of carbon credits was part of Weber County's calculation all along.LiNeBrEaK"This was what made our project feasible," he said.LiNeBrEaKkmoulton@sltrib.com What's a carbon credit?LiNeBrEaKIt's a marketable security, traded like a corporate stock or futures contract. New markets, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange, have emerged to award companies or government agencies "credits" for projects that reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. They sell the credits, via the exchange, to individuals or companies that want to offset their own carbon emissions -- or to appear more "green." The value of each credit fluctuates, as in any market.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	For California, new clout in Obama's tech-friendly administration  	BREAKING; Politics; News; National; State; Business  	1010 words  	WASHINGTON   Barbara Boxer remembers the "dark days" when California and its issues were dismissed by official Washington with disdain and hostility.LiNeBrEaK"Dianne Feinstein and I joked that it was ABC   anything but California, anyone but California," Boxer said, recalling when the two Democrats joined the Senate in 1993.LiNeBrEaKNow, as California Democrats pour into Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration, the state can claim a surge of influence in the new, tech-friendly administration. Congress, too, is looking westward, with Californians taking key positions of power. LiNeBrEaKTwo Californians were named to Obama's Cabinet   Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu at the Energy Department and Rep. Hilda Solis at the Labor Department   and Leon Panetta, former President Bill Clinton's White House chief of staff, has been appointed to lead the Central Intelligence Agency.LiNeBrEaKObama also named a pair of Golden Staters to key White House posts: Christina Romer, a Berkeley economist, will chair the Council of Economic Advisers, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, will bring her experience as a state environmental regulator to the job of chairing the Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"These are superstar choices. California is 'in' right now, and we can remember when California was 'out,' " Boxer said. "There is a lot more respect for the state, especially on energy issues."LiNeBrEaKShift on tech, energyLiNeBrEaKOn a policy level, it's a shift from oil drilling to renewable energy, from sidestepping the issue of global warming to dealing with it aggressively, from a pro-industry stance to greater sympathy for organized labor.LiNeBrEaKRep. Zoe Lofgren, a San Jose Democrat, measured the change this way: "I remember Gov. Jerry Brown coming to Washington talking about windmills, and people made fun of him. Now everybody is talking about wind energy and solar."LiNeBrEaKCalifornians with deep experience in tech and energy issues, particularly clean technology, have Obama's ear. That includes Eric Schmidt,  chief executive of Google, venture capitalist John Doerr, who is close to Al Gore, and John Thompson, the former Symantec CEO who may be a contender for commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKThat influence can be seen in major ingredients in the $825 billion stimulus package prepared by the House with the Obama team's input. Doerr, for example, lobbied for the $11 billion that would go toward modernizing the electricity grid. Tech groups pushed hard for $6 billion in grants to speed up broadband deployment. Wind-energy advocates secured a long-term extension of the production tax credit.LiNeBrEaKAnd California renewable-energy companies and investors, struggling with the frozen credit market, cheered when Obama announced his goal of doubling the production of renewable energy over the next three years.LiNeBrEaK"I think what the Obama administration intends to do is move the technology that has been pioneered in California across the country," said Cathy Zoi, CEO of Palo Alto-based Alliance for Climate Protection.LiNeBrEaKThe state's new clout should not be viewed in the traditional sense of more "pork" for California, said Norm Ornstein, an author and longtime analyst of government for the American Enterprise Institute. But it will play out in other ways.LiNeBrEaK"There will be a greater sensibility on issues that matter to California and drive the California economy," Ornstein said. "It helps that Obama puts a high priority about keeping the nation's edge on technology, and is listening to Silicon Valley on that."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia-friendlyLiNeBrEaKSome appointees are not from California but tend to view key issues in California-friendly ways. Carol Browner, a top Obama adviser on energy and the environment, supported the state's pioneering regulations as Environmental Protection Agency chief. And Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a graduate of Santa Clara University who has worked on border-state issues, has been named to head the Homeland Security Department.LiNeBrEaKObama is unlikely to cultivate as cozy a relationship with the state as Bill Clinton did, predicted Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College who worked for Republicans during the Reagan and first Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKBut he agrees that just as Reagan-style California conservatism was adopted in Washington in the 1980s, Obama is likely to embrace California-style progressivism.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the 1990s, when Clinton had to deal with a Republican majority in Congress, Democrats now control both branches, with state leaders well-represented   starting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKLofgren, who chairs the immigration subcommittee in the House, knows she can get Napolitano on the phone if there's a problem with the immigration bureaucracy, or she can contact Solis on a labor issue.LiNeBrEaKLofgren chairs the delegation of 34 California Democrats in the House, which met last week and bid farewell to Solis.LiNeBrEaK"There in the room were the chairmen of the Energy Committee (Henry Waxman,) Education and Labor (George Miller), Foreign Affairs (Howard Berman), and Veterans Affairs (Bob Filner)," Lofgren said. "I thought, if you wanted to get something done, come to this room."LiNeBrEaKState labor leaders expect that with Solis in the Cabinet, they will have a friendly ear on minimum-wage and family-leave issues, and other concerns of an increasingly immigrant work force. Solis, from Los Angeles, is the daughter of immigrants and her father was a union worker.LiNeBrEaK"She is very well-connected and can help bridge the gap and the tensions between immigrant workers and other sectors of the community, including some unions," said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.LiNeBrEaKBut Pitney, a veteran observer of Washington, warned that Californians looking for rapid change on energy, labor and other issues from Obama and other leaders they just elected may be disappointed.LiNeBrEaK"Electing officials is a lot like shopping online," Pitney said. "Everything looks better when you log on than when the package arrives at the door."LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at mostrom@mercurynews.com or (415) 477-3794.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama announces his CIA Director-designate Leon Panetta, left, during a news conference at his transition headquarters in Washington, Friday, Jan. 9, 2009.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Dan Walters: California's future looks bleak  	NEWS; Opinion  	495 words  	Defense spending in the 1980s, high-tech startups in the 1990s and housing-fueled consumer spending in the 1990s   all were California economic bubbles that burst spectacularly, leaving recession and government deficits in their wake. LiNeBrEaKWhat, if anything, will come next to pull us out of recession and return California to prosperity? Some think it will be biotechnology, services to baby boomer retirees or solving global warming.LiNeBrEaKLurking in the background, however, is a nagging worry that there won't be anything, that the state's endemically high costs, political dysfunction and long list of unresolved dilemmas, from transportation to water to education, have made us uncompetitive in a global economy. Just last week, a new federal survey found that California has the nation's highest adult illiteracy rate.LiNeBrEaKWe have tended to take the future for granted. No matter how moribund the economy may be at the moment, we think, we have the weather, the entrepreneurial spirit and the strategic location to regroup and prosper.LiNeBrEaKWe may have. But then again, maybe we aren't so special. Maybe we're not immune to the societal afflictions that have beset other states. Maybe we are a rust-belt-to-be on the left coast, a Michigan with winter sunshine.LiNeBrEaKA clue to potential decline may be found in what had been one of the state's stellar sectors in recent years, international trade. California's airports and seaports, especially the latter, became the portal for rapidly expanding trade with Asia. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach became the nation's busiest with Oakland just a few notches down the list.LiNeBrEaKAt its high point, a quarter of the nation's international cargo, imports and exports, was passing through California, including 40 percent of container traffic, despite high costs, traffic congestion and relatively inefficient cargo-handling systems.LiNeBrEaKThe global recession cut into that traffic sharply, as one might expect, but California port officials are forecasting big increases when the economy improves and are planning expensive facility upgrades.LiNeBrEaK"The forecasts are hogwash," says Jack O'Connell, an international trade expert with the University of California. He doubts whether consumer demand for Asian goods will return to former levels because of new wariness about personal debt, and he believes that competition will compel shippers to seek cheaper avenues.LiNeBrEaKIn the fall, as Californians were waiting to vote for a new president and fill other offices, an election was held several thousand miles to the south, in Panama. Panamanians approved a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Panama Canal that by the middle of the next decade will allow the biggest container ships   those that have been forced to offload in California   to sail all the way to American ports on the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.LiNeBrEaKWhat has been an economic strength for California, in other words, may join a growing list of weaknesses.LiNeBrEaKDan Walters is a Sacramento Bee columnist.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Who's Hot, Who's Not at the Inauguration  	NEWS  	1283 words  	ROYAL TURNOUTLiNeBrEaKSeen at U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein's well-attended Saturday night reception at the Library of Congress: Queen Noor of Jordan, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer and movie star Angela Bassett. Also making the rounds among the numerous California congressional delegation members was Obama's pick for Labor Secretary, Rep. Hilda Solis.LiNeBrEaKWHERE TECHIES WANT TO BE SEENLiNeBrEaKHollywood may have it's A-list parties, but so does the tech crowd. Here's where the digital glitterati want to be seen. Ratings are purely unscientific based on buzz and how hard Mercury News reporters had to work to get into the party. LiNeBrEaKFive stars.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Ball, Monday night.LiNeBrEaKThis enviro-star studded party for foes of global warming is the hottest ticket in town for the green-tech crowd. Al Gore is the star attraction and attendees will walk down a green carpet, from made of recyclable materials, of course. We're still waiting for our sources (we've hit up six different contacts so far) to deliver two tickets.LiNeBrEaKFour stars.LiNeBrEaKThe Google ball, Tuesday night.LiNeBrEaKGoogle has become the de facto tech-industry party host after throwing successful bashes at both national party conventions over the summer. Google is shunning traditional ball etiquette, going for a lounge-like concept. And, this would be a first for an inaugural fete, they will be serving really good food, says one source. For that reason, we'll be heading here instead of the western states ball - the official California inauguration night event - where 11,000 are expected. And we've got our Google tickets.LiNeBrEaKFour stars.LiNeBrEaKLINK-live Presidential Inaugural Gala, Tuesday nightLiNeBrEaKIt's billed as a party to celebrate technology serving humanity. Steven Chu, Lawrence Berkeley's Nobel laureate physicist and Obama's choice for energy secretary, is slated to receive "the nature award". You can attend virtually via www.linklive.org . And you can join the celebration online using Twitter (name: linklive; address: #linklive2009), ScribbleLive, USTREAM and Flickr. We think we've got tickets, would hate to miss Chu, the Bay Area's hottest --or is that coolest -- scientist.LiNeBrEaKThree stars.LiNeBrEaKNetroots Nation party, Monday nightLiNeBrEaKLiberal stars of the blogosphere come together to pat themselves on the back for helping Obama get elected. Among the co-hosts are Firedoglake and Fivethirtyeight.com . Guests can hang out in the Guitar Hero Lounge. If the event wasn't in Virginia, we'd probably give it four stars. If we don't get Green Ball tickets, we'll be across the Potomac.LiNeBrEaKThree stars.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia "Fly me to the Moon" party, Sunday nightLiNeBrEaKA retro title, but can you think of a better place for Californians to convene than the Smithsonian's air and space museum? The state Democratic Party-sponsored bash is not really a tech event. But hey, in their day, the Kitty Hawk and Spirit of St. Louis were the cat's meow. We're going.LiNeBrEaKThree starsLiNeBrEaKBytes and Books Inaugural Ball, Tuesday nightLiNeBrEaKStar Wars meets Hamlet. George Lucas will be honored at the Bytes and Books Inaugural Ball in a bid to raise the profile of technology in the classroom. Sponsors include Apple and Intel. We're sure the Bard is thrilled the Folger Shakespeare Library is the site of the party.LiNeBrEaKOBAMA TO BE TOASTED WITH CALIFORNIA VINTAGESLiNeBrEaKOregon Pinot take this. A California Pinot Noir from Anderson Valley has been selected to be served at Tuesday's inaugural luncheon, the new president's sit-down lunch with 230 dignitaries following the swearing in.LiNeBrEaKGoldeneye Pinot Noir 2005 will be served with the second course, duck and pheasant served with sour cherry chutney and molasses sweet potatoes. It's produced by Napa Valley's Duckhorn Vineyards whose 2007 Sauvigon blanc will be served with a first course of fish stew.LiNeBrEaKWho came up with the pairings? Obama's first meal as president is similar to the foods Abraham Lincoln would have eaten. And the planners, notably U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein who heads up the congressional committee planning the lunch, insisted on California vintages.LiNeBrEaKWine Spectator and Wine Enthusiast both give the pinot 92 points and it retails for $55 a bottle. And for the champagne toast? Korbel in the Russian River Valley is producing a "special inaugural cuvee.'' This marks the seventh inauguration for Korbel. But it's Duckhorn's first.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the inaugural lunch committee said they would pay for 10 cases of the wines, Duckhorn was so honored they decided to donate them.LiNeBrEaKThe luncheon menu is the most visited part of the congressional inaugural committee website. To check it out go to: www.inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/LiNeBrEaKSAN JOSE OBAMA RELATIVE LEFT OUT IN THE COLDLiNeBrEaKRobert Wright, seventh grade teacher at Morrill Middle School in San Jose, stumbled across a genealogical website last summer that shows he and Barack Obama share a distant ancestor, Obadiah Columbus Wright, on Obama's mother's side. He had named his son, 14, Obadiah after the ancestor but had no clue about Obama's connection until he did a routine search of the name. After Obama's victory, Wright figured the connection ought to get him an inauguration ticket.LiNeBrEaKFirst, he approached the Obama inaugural planners. They sent back an email informing him how to donate to the inaugural committee. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent a form email that he didn't make the cut. She had 60,000 ticket requests. He thought he had the ear of an aide to U.S. Rep Zoe Lofgen and even faxed over the family tree. But, alas, no tickets. "I guess my limb grew too far from the family tree,'' said Wright. So he'll be watching the inauguration with his students.LiNeBrEaKFEINSTEIN RESPECTS CHOICE OF WARRENLiNeBrEaKTune in to the inauguration ceremony and the first speech you will hear from the podium will come from Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the congressional inaugural committee.LiNeBrEaKWhat will she say in the global spotlight? "It will be very formal and very brief," she told reporters at a preview of the main event. "This is a tightly scripted, very precise schedule."LiNeBrEaKFeinstein will introduce Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Cal., to give the invocation. Barack Obama's choice of Warren for that honor was controversial because of the pastor's support for Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriages. Obama and Feinstein opposed Prop 8.LiNeBrEaK"I respect the president-elect's choice, because he wants to bring people together," Feinstein said. "I don't know Pastor Warren, but I believe the American people will be very respectful because of the specific nature of this event. It's not political."LiNeBrEaKBRING THE FUNK, TOSS THE BROOMSLiNeBrEaKPrecision lawn-chair marching? The inaugural parade always features lots of traditional marching bands, but this year a few units stand out for different reasons.LiNeBrEaKThe Redwood Middle School Marching Band from Saratoga enjoys the distinction of being the only middle school band participating in the parade. Sure hope they make that midnight bus to D.C. The young musicians are staying in a hotel three hours from the Capitol.LiNeBrEaKFor the first time, an openly gay group, San Francisco-based Lesbian and Gay Band Association, with members nationwide, will march in an inaugural parade. The association performed at others events during Bill Clinton's two inaugurals, but never in the official parade.LiNeBrEaKThe World Famous Lawn Rangers from Arcola, Ill., toss unique "show" brooms into the air, and according to the official program, often catch them.

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Wildlife officals opposes coal plant: Opposition mounts to proposed Santee Cooper facility  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	395 words  	Jan. 17--The chief of the National Wildlife Federation is criticizing Santee Cooper's plan to build a coal-fired power plant near Florence.LiNeBrEaKPresident Larry Schweiger said the state-owned utility's plan is increasingly at odds with many power companies, which are dropping plans to build traditional coal plants. Schweiger, in South Carolina on Friday, said Santee Cooper should do the same in Florence County. LiNeBrEaKSchweiger is the third national conservation leader to visit the state in the past two weeks to speak against the $2. 2 billion project along the Great Pee Dee River.LiNeBrEaK"We can avoid this choice and avoid spending a lot of money wrongly,'' Schweiger said in a conference call with reporters. "It seems to me your best opportunity is to go in a new direction.''LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired power plants are a major concern for wildlife, he said.LiNeBrEaKChief among the concerns is mercury, a highly toxic metal released into the air from coal plants. Because of mercury pollution, some fish in the Great Pee Dee and other Lowcountry rivers are tainted by mercury. The state has issued health advisories against routinely eating some types of fish.LiNeBrEaKSantee Cooper spokeswoman Laura Varn said the company needs the plant to supply power, but she also said the facility will "be built in a way that is protective of the environment.''LiNeBrEaKSchweiger said South Carolina should concentrate more on using alternative sources of energy to provide power. He noted the Santee Cooper plant also would contribute greenhouse gases, a major source of global warming. President-elect Barack Obama is likely to take a harder line against coal plants. New taxes on carbon emissions are expected, he said.LiNeBrEaKLast week, the head of the national Sierra Club's coal campaign and a representative of Physicians for Social Responsibility also spoke in South Carolina against the facility. Schweiger was in South Carolina to attend a meeting of the state Wildlife Federation today in Columbia.LiNeBrEaKReach Fretwell at (803) 771-8537.

Ventura County Star (California)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	New rules made for Channel boaters: First plan since '83 tackles issues  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	793 words  	Jan. 17--Much has changed in the natural world since the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary last drafted a management plan in 1983.LiNeBrEaKInvasive species that can alter the environment are more of an issue. Whales dying from ship strikes in the Santa Barbara Channel have became a huge concern. And then there are global warming, aquaculture, sewage discharge and myriad other challenges that have come up in the 26 years since the last plan was drafted.LiNeBrEaKA new plan, released Friday, addresses those issues and others that may pop up in the oversight of the 1,470 square miles of protected area that circle the Channel Islands. LiNeBrEaK"It's a blueprint for how we manage the sanctuary for the foreseeable future," said Sanctuary Manager Chis Mobley. "Since it hadn't been done since 1983, a lot of effort went into engaging the public about what we want to do in the future."LiNeBrEaKThough much of the document offers loose guidelines on future management -- such as expanding education, restoring ecosystems and promoting more science -- there are some concrete changes that affect boaters motoring or sailing through the channel.LiNeBrEaKA new regulation clarifies that any discharge of untreated sewage in the sanctuary is prohibited. Mobley said a number of boats that can carry up to 30 people only have sewage storage, not treatment capabilities, onboard.LiNeBrEaKUntreated sewage can cause marine mammals to become ill and lead to algal blooms in the ocean, which can decrease oxygen levels in the sea.LiNeBrEaKAnother new regulation doesn't allow large ships to dump gray water stored in the ballast into the sanctuary for fear it could contain exotic species such as zebra mussels.LiNeBrEaKOne thing not addressed in the report is if the sanctuary could expand its boundaries in the future. But Mobley said given current financial issues, it's a challenge to manage the existing sanctuary.LiNeBrEaK"Given that reality, we are not in a big hurry to change our boundaries," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe document also details plans for a new headquarters, which will be built in about a year on the UC Santa Barbara campus. The university also is constructing a new building, the Outreach Center for Teaching Ocean Science, which will be next to the sanctuary's new headquarters.LiNeBrEaKOn the NetLiNeBrEaKhttp://channelislands.noaa.govLiNeBrEaKCommentsLiNeBrEaKPosted by janusjuris on January 17, 2009 at 5: 17 a.m. (Suggest removal)LiNeBrEaKWhat a load!

Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Virginia)  	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	EPA study warns of rising seas along Virginia coast  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	635 words  	Jan. 17--After more than three years of study, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a report Friday on the potential effects of climate change and sea-level rise on Virginia and the rest of the mid-Atlantic.LiNeBrEaKThe conclusions: not very good. LiNeBrEaKUsing conservative estimates, the EPA says the eight-state region from New York to North Carolina is an area that "will likely see the greatest impacts due to rising waters, coastal storms, and a high concentration of population along the coastline," according to an agency summary.LiNeBrEaKThe report finds that low-lying areas in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and Norfolk and on the Peninsula, where port terminals, railroads, sewage plants and military bases can be found, face real threats from rising seas.LiNeBrEaKThe 786-page document also describes Virginia's Eastern Shore as "uniquely vulnerable," especially its vast salt marshes and barrier islands, which are key habitat for fish, shellfish, migratory birds and other wildlife.LiNeBrEaKPrevious studies have painted similar scenarios in recent years, but the report Friday represents the federal government's official word on global warming and its possible consequences to the Chesapeake Bay and other Virginia ecosystems.LiNeBrEaK"It's an important document, no doubt," said Carl Hershner, the sole Virginia scientist who worked on the project and a wetlands expert at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Hershner said he was "disappointed and a little frustrated" that the final EPA report did not contain specific data and mapping that appeared in earlier drafts and depict a much fiercer threat.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, because the research effort took so long, he said, some estimates about the pace and extent of sea-level rise and the potential effects are dated and "probably underestimated, at best."LiNeBrEaKThe report was authored by the EPA, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and includes scientific research compiled since 2005 from myriad state, federal and international sources.LiNeBrEaKIt finds that global warming is real and that sea levels are rising faster -- and can be expected to keep rising faster -- because of human activity and the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and gas.LiNeBrEaK"Increasing atmospheric concentrations, primarily from human contributions, are very likely warming the atmosphere and oceans," the report says.LiNeBrEaKThe report concludes that sea levels rose globally about 1. 7 millimeters per year through the 20th century -- on the heels of a period of little change during the previous 2,000 years, back to the last Ice Age.LiNeBrEaK"The rate has increased over natural rise due to burning of fossil fuels," according to the report.LiNeBrEaKThe mid-Atlantic has seen an even quicker rise, the study says, because sections of the coast -- especially in Virginia -- are physically sinking, a process called subsidence.LiNeBrEaKThe authors urge state and local officials to change their mind-set about global warming and start planning for rising sea levels today.LiNeBrEaK"Most coastal regions are currently managed under the premise that sea-level rise is not significant and that shorelines are static and can be fixed in place," the report reads.LiNeBrEaK"The new reality of sea-level rise due to climate change," it continues, " requires new considerations in managing areas to protect resources and reduce risk to humans."LiNeBrEaKScott Harper, (757) 446-2340, scott.harper@pilotonline.com		ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (91%); COASTAL AREAS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (90%); OCEANOGRAPHY (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); OCEANS (89%); RESEARCH (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); ISLANDS and REEFS (78%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (78%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (78%); WETLANDS (78%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (78%); WEATHER (78%); BIOLOGY (72%); BIRDS (67%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%)  		VIRGINIA BEACH, VA, USA (79%) VIRGINIA, USA (94%); NORTH CAROLINA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 17, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Virginian-Pilot   	Scott Harper, The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, Va.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 17, 2009 Saturday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Rebirth for right-wing radio Rebirth for right-wing radio  	LOCAL; Pg. B7  	546 words  	BRACE YOURSELF . The right-wing radio barkers are about to enter a golden era. Not to hear them tell it, of course.LiNeBrEaKWith the dire paranoia in which they revel, and by which they keep their listeners in a turmoil of anxiety, the goofy right's mouthpieces have been shouting for months that with a Democratic president and Congress, Washington will shut down their fulminations. LiNeBrEaKThe mechanism would be a restoration of the Fairness Doctrine, by which, back in the bad days before Reagan, the Federal Communications Commission required that broadcast commentary actually be fair and balanced -- rather than just saying it is.LiNeBrEaKThe broadcasters' mock grumbling at the time aside, the rule provided them with the cover they wanted to avoid any profitless political programming.LiNeBrEaKBut talk radio, all but universally right wing, salvaged AM radio from technology's trash heap, and now a powerful business lobby backs its reign of madness.LiNeBrEaKThe pitchmen and pitchwomen of the right have been deterred not one whit from their frisson of self-fright by the fact that President-elect Barack Obama has said he doesn't favor reviving the doctrine or that no legislation to do so shows any breath of life in Congress.LiNeBrEaKThe radio talkers, poor babies, have suffered cruelly through the last eight years. George W. Bush was never their drink of choice, but they have had to gag it down on the premise that anything Bush did was better than anything any Democrat would do.LiNeBrEaKThe talkers have had to swallow historic budget deficits, federal involvement in public education, help for African AIDS victims, all offensive to rightist dogma. They have been reduced to taking refuge in situational ethics.LiNeBrEaKNow the wraps are off and you can already hear the joy abounding. Two pop outrages of the moment herald the future.LiNeBrEaKThe trumpets of the right have it that Al Franken has stolen the U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota from incumbent Norm Coleman in a crooked recount.LiNeBrEaKShocking premise indeed, but no evidence backs it up. Independent observers have praised the recount for its transparency and care.LiNeBrEaKThe five-member recount board, which was bipartisan and included top jurists, found a 225-vote lead for Franken. Coleman is suing, so it's wait and see, but all the board's key rulings were unanimous and its deliberations were public.LiNeBrEaKAnd it turns out that Obama's pick as his chief adviser on global warming, Carol Browner, President Clinton's EPA director, was recently listed on the Web site of the Socialist International as one of 14 members of its Commission for a Sustainable World Society.LiNeBrEaKThe international is an umbrella for democratic socialist parties. Israel's and Britain's Labor Parties are members. So is Canada's New Democratic Party. It is a center for the same sort of reformist impulses to which we owe workers' compensation, child labor laws and other progressive policies.LiNeBrEaKBut maybe we better keep an eye on the Browner person after all. Next thing you know, like the people of Western Europe, we, too, might be borne down under the soul-sapping burden of universal health coverage and really good public transit.LiNeBrEaKCarry on, talk radio. But for you, Lenin's Tomb would be moved to Washington.LiNeBrEaKTom Teepen is a columnist for Cox Newspapers. He is based in Atlanta. E-mail him at teepencolumn@ earthlink.net.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 17, 2009 Saturday 	Manure-to-energy plant faces red tape  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	675 words  	Jan. 17--Mount Vernon company needs state to relax solid-waste rulesLiNeBrEaKMOUNT VERNON -- A local business looking to create renewable energy from cow manure has broken ground on a power-generation plant southwest of here but may be derailed by what dairy farmers say is unnecessary government regulation.LiNeBrEaKFarm Power Northwest's manure digester at the end of Beaver Marsh Road will be viable only if the state Department of Ecology is willing to exempt the facility from existing solid-waste rules, company co-owner Kevin Maas said. Once completed, the digester will convert a mixture of manure and food waste into enough electricity to light the town of La Conner. LiNeBrEaKMaas, who owns Farm Power along with his brother Daryl, said he needs to be optimistic that Ecology will not require a solid-waste permit.LiNeBrEaKThose in the manure digesting business have been meeting with Ecology for more than a year, looking for a way to create a permit exemption for digesters. Farmers don't need a solid-waste permit simply for storing manure, but digesters aren't effective unless a relatively small amount of food waste -- about 5 or 10 percent of the total -- is mixed in.LiNeBrEaKIf a digester runs on manure alone it produces about half the electricity it would with the right mixture of food waste, Maas said. Investors aren't willing to buy into his $3. 5 million project if it yields that kind of result, he said.LiNeBrEaK"In effect, we're betting the company that this will be resolved," Maas said.LiNeBrEaKIt doesn't make sense to dairy farmer Jason Vander Kooy, who will supply manure to Farm Power, that the state would want to make it more difficult to produce something as popular as renewable energy. Another regulation would be redundant, he added, because manure and feed on dairy farms are already tightly regulated.LiNeBrEaK"To add another layer of rules and regulations on us, for renewable energy, ... we're just doubling up," Vander Kooy said.LiNeBrEaKLaurie Davies, Ecology's solid-waste program manager, told a senate agriculture committee on Thursday she remained optimistic that a new permit rule could be written by June.LiNeBrEaKBut the Maas brothers also testified Thursday before the senate Agriculture and Rural Economic Development Committee, seeking legislation to create the exemption, because there is concern that negotiations with Ecology aren't going anywhere.LiNeBrEaK"There are people in the digester community who are losing hope. ... In meetings where we thought we made progress, it was clear we hadn't," Maas said.LiNeBrEaKDavies told the committee she sees the value of manure digesters as both a renewable energy source and as a way to reduce global warming. The digesters eliminate methane, an especially potent greenhouse gas.LiNeBrEaK"I think we're all in agreement that there are incredible benefits that can be happening," Davies told the committee.LiNeBrEaKHowever, two main hurdles must be overcome before Ecology can relax permit requirements, Davies said. For one, the department wants to make sure all digesters, not just those operating on farms, are given the same exemption.LiNeBrEaKThere's also a public health issue, Davies said. As in any solid-waste facility, Ecology would expect manure digesters to protect ground water and control odor and vermin.LiNeBrEaK"It isn't just a pound of solid waste that they want to bring in. It's a huge amount of waste they want to bring in," Davies said.LiNeBrEaKFarm Power will begin operations in early August, Daryl Maas said, with or without the cooperation of the state government.LiNeBrEaK"By the time we're done (with construction), either we'll have a rule or we'll just operate," he said.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 16, 2009 Friday   Online Edition	Jay Bookman;  Obama pledges entitlement reform too 		314 words  	Friday, January 16, 2009, 12: 40 PMLiNeBrEaKWell, this ought to be interesting:LiNeBrEaK"President-elect Barack Obama pledged yesterday to shape a new Social Security and Medicare 'bargain' with the American people, saying that the nation's long-term economic recovery cannot be attained unless the government finally gets control over its most costly entitlement programs. LiNeBrEaKThat discussion will begin next month, Obama said, when he convenes a 'fiscal responsibility summit' before delivering his first budget to Congress. He said his administration will begin confronting the issues of entitlement reform and long-term budget deficits soon after it jump-starts job growth and the stock market.LiNeBrEaK'What we have done is kicked this can down the road. We are now at the end of the road and are not in a position to kick it any further,' he said. 'We have to signal seriousness in this by making sure some of the hard decisions are made under my watch, not someone else's.'"LiNeBrEaKThe Social Security trust fund is actually in pretty good shape as long as the federal government honors its pledge to pay back the many billions it borrowed from the fund to run the rest of government.LiNeBrEaKThe real issue is Medicare, as Obama himself acknowledged.LiNeBrEaK"Social Security, we can solve," he told the Post edit board. "The big problem is Medicare, which is unsustainable... . We can't solve Medicare in isolation from the broader problems of the health-care system."LiNeBrEaKObama keeps pledging major efforts to address almost every big problem we face, from the Middle East to global warming to the budget and of course the economy. And he's right --- we can't keep avoiding those problems. That's in part how we got into this mess in the first place.LiNeBrEaKBut the scope of the changes he claims to seek are mind-boggling nonetheless.LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/bookman/entries/2009/01/16/obama_pledges_entitlement_refo.html		SOCIAL SECURITY (90%); MEDICARE (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); BUDGET (89%); BLOGS and MESSAGE BOARDS (86%); US SOCIAL SECURITY (77%); EMERGING MARKETS (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (77%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (76%); HEALTH CARE (70%); TRUST ARRANGEMENTS (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); OBAMA HEALTH CARE REFORM (78%) Blogs  			BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	UNITED STATES (92%); MIDDLE EAST (79%)  	January 28, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspapers  	2009 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   	JAY BOOKMAN; Staff  															
The Bakersfield Californian  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Global Hawk to soar this spring  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	514 words  	Jan. 16--EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE -- The next generation of airborne science research debuted at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center Thursday.LiNeBrEaKThe Global Hawk is a high-altitude, long endurance unmanned aircraft system. LiNeBrEaKIt can stay in the air for about 30 hours and reach 65,000 feet, and its long-range capabilities will help scientists validate data from satellites, understand climate change and track hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKThe initial six missions soaring above the Pacific Ocean may start in March, and those flights will take off and land at Dryden. They are the first non-military hops the Global Hawk has performed.LiNeBrEaKInside, the plane with the bulbous, whale-like nose is loaded with specialized instruments, both remote and "in situ," that require an entire team of scientists to operate and interpret.LiNeBrEaKTechnology includes sampling capabilities that could suck air into a bottle, allowing scientists to analyze hundreds of gases, said Paul Newman, project scientist. He'll plan the flights and manage a team of really smart people.LiNeBrEaKNewman calls the Global Hawk a "satellite/aircraft hybrid." Unlike a satellite that passes over a specific target once or twice a day, the plane can capture data every second or so, which yields "unbelievable operations."LiNeBrEaKThe planes are from Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. of Rancho Bernardo. They arrived at NASA Dryden in September 2007 because the U.S. Air Force had newer production models to use. Because they are prototypes, NASA wasn't charged for them, according to Northrop Grumman. The instrumentation and sensors, though, could run about $2 million to $4 million per year, depending how many missions are flown, said Kevin Petersen, Dryden's director.LiNeBrEaKGlobal Hawk is at Dryden because of its partnership with the defense contractor, and the two entities will share the ground control station, maintenance facilities and the two NASA Global Hawks. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Department of Energy are involved in research, and so are other NASA flight centers.LiNeBrEaKDavid Fahey, a project scientist at NOAA, said Wednesday the planes can help acquire temperature information about the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"We think that region is warming unduly from human-caused climate change. Because of its remoteness, we really lack quality data in terms of No. 1, really knowing what's going on, (and) No. 2, having the data to test your theories about why it's changing," he said.LiNeBrEaKStorm tracking is another asset the Global Hawk brings.LiNeBrEaK"Hurricane scientists would like to know more about what's going on in thunderstorms, early stage and late stage -- where it's going to go, what it's going to do when it gets there," Fahey said.

The Boston Herald 	January 16, 2009 Friday   ALL EDITIONS	THE BETTOR`S EDGE;   THE BET BOX;   Raid on Pats knows no end	SPORTS; Pg. 060  	449 words  	NFL rivals raiding the Patriots for coaching and front office personnel are now going a bit too far.LiNeBrEaKYesterday, the team's most experienced ballboy took a better offer from the Miami Dolphins. The 10-year veteran, now 58 years old, did it for the climate change, citing being sick of racing across football fields in rain, snow, wind, hail, sleet and cold to pick up a kicking tee. LiNeBrEaKNext went the waterboy, brought to Cleveland by new Browns coach Eric Mangini. Sources say this so enraged Pats coach Bill Belichick he threatened to not only never shake Mangini's hand again but to put a bear hug on the former Pats assistant and dump him into Lake Erie. The Pats also lost their assistant equipment manager to the Kansas City Chiefs in a bidding war with 22 other teams. All he would say was he needed a change of logos.LiNeBrEaKNext to go was Bob Kraft's limo driver. Tired of Route 1 traffic and finagling his way through Patriot Place to find the Stadium At The Mall, the chauffeur took off for Green Bay, shouting he'll never ever see a traffic jam there.LiNeBrEaKThe Pats will lose their physical therapist today. He ain't going nowhere, he just quit. With all the injuries this season, the workload simply became overwhelming.LiNeBrEaKThe cheerleader director then took off, going to the Denver Broncos, even though she had two years left on her contract. The Patriots filed tampering charges and reportedly are seeking as compensation three blonds, two brunettes and one blue-eyed redhead.LiNeBrEaKAlso rumored to be leaving Foxboro for better opportunities are the field superintendent, director of operations (football, not surgical), video director, 13 scouts and the executive director of food and beverages.LiNeBrEaKWho would have thought a team that didn't even make the playoffs would suffer such loss in personnel. What happens if the Pats ever do win another Super Bowl?LiNeBrEaKGillette Stadium? It's a-goner.LiNeBrEaKDon't pay attention to these:LiNeBrEaKPhiladelphia (-4) at Arizona - Time to forget trying to figure out the NFC, especially after the top seeds, the Giants and Panthers, proved big-time frauds. (Wished you figured that out earlier, eh?) So now we're left with the back-from-the-dead Eagles and the ``we-lost-47-to-7-to-the-Pats'' Cardinals. No way should Arizona be anywhere near a Super Bowl. Eagles, 30-24.LiNeBrEaKBaltimore (+6) at Pittsburgh - Remember that recent who-don't-you-want-to-win-the-Super-Bowl diatribe? Well, the Steelers are the only team of the preferred vanquished still to be standing. So, guess it's the Ravens in a certain battle of defenses on a certain night of cold, snow and bluster that will see the Steelers not grab victory . . . nevermore.

The Bradenton Herald (Florida)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	FPL wants zoning changes  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	502 words  	Jan. 16--PARRISH -- They want to grow mirror-like reflectors instead of tomatoes on land adjacent to the Florida Power and Light Co. plant in east Manatee. LiNeBrEaKThe company, which operates an existing power plant near Parrish that burns natural gas to generate electricity, is proposing to add a solar thermal facility that collects energy from the sun.LiNeBrEaKFPL has asked the county to re-zone 620 acres of land adjacent to its existing power plant from an agricultural classification to one designated "planned development/public interest," said Rae Dowling, FPL's area manager for external affairs.LiNeBrEaKOfficials told visitors at a neighborhood meeting Thursday about the possibility that the company would add solar generating capacity to the plant.LiNeBrEaKIf the project comes to fruition, the site where rows of mirror-like reflectors would be installed to trap the sun's heat would be spread across what is now a tomato field, said Paul Rutledge, a retired equipment operator who lives near the property.LiNeBrEaK"I might get sunburn," he joked.LiNeBrEaKStill, he was OK with the idea, he said, adding, "I guess it would be a big help."LiNeBrEaKThe company is considering a number of sites, but re-zoning is the first step, said Dowling, adding, "Without that, we can't go any further."LiNeBrEaKA preview meeting with county commissioners is slated for 1: 30 p.m. Tuesday, where the company will explain its proposal, said Laurie E. Suess, principal planner for the county planning department.LiNeBrEaKIt is slated to go before the Planning Commission for formal approval in March, she said. If FPL decides to build the project here, it would be the first large-scale solar generating facility ever built in Manatee County, she said.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal calls for a hybrid system in which concave reflectors gather heat from the sun's rays, which would be converted to steam that would produce electricity in existing turbines, said John C. Gnecco IV, FPL's manager for project development. "With free energy from the sun, we consume less fossil fuel," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe solar thermal system would produce no greenhouse gases, he noted.LiNeBrEaK"It's absolutely incredible," said Joan Hodges, vice president of the Parrish Civic Association. "We would be so fortunate to have it in our area. It's a win-win. What would be the negative?"LiNeBrEaKNeil Spirtas, representing the Manatee Chamber of Commerce, was impressed with the plan's environmental virtues and hoped it would bring jobs, too.LiNeBrEaK"We've been working with a green business initiative, working with companies to become aware what it means to improve the environmental effects in their businesses," he said.LiNeBrEaK"This is a perfect example."

Buffalo News (New York) 	January 16, 2009 Friday   CENTRAL EDITION	EandE 'looks good' for fiscal 2009  	BUSINESS; Pg. D7  	477 words  	Kevin Neumaier isn't sure how the financial crisis will affect Ecology and Environment six months from now, but he's pretty confident the Lancaster environmental services firm will be in good shape two years from now. LiNeBrEaK"Usually you have good vision for six months, and you can't see so well out two years," said Neumaier, EandE's president and chief executive officer. "Now, it's the opposite."LiNeBrEaKThe recession and a severe credit crunch that is making it harder for many of EandE's clients to obtain financing for their environmental projects is adding "uncertainty" to the company's outlook, Neumaier said.LiNeBrEaKBut Neumaier said he takes heart that many of EandE's government projects already are funded and he expressed optimism that the financing difficulties wouldn't significantly delay the advance work, such as environmental impact statements and permitting assistance, that the company does for many projects.LiNeBrEaK"This quarter is going good, and from what we can see, it looks good [for the rest of the fiscal year], he said Tuesday, following the company's annual shareholder's meeting. "We just don't know for sure."LiNeBrEaKBehind Neumaier's optimism is the ongoing push to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase the use of renewable energy.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change and energy independence are major drivers for our markets going forward," Neumaier said. "If we don't do something about it, . . . we're in for something a whole lot worse than the financial crisis."LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050 could spur renewable energy projects, from wind and solar energy to hydroelectric and advanced coal projects, like the one proposed for Jamestown, he said.LiNeBrEaKObama's economic stimulus plan, released Thursday by House Democrats, includes more than $20 billion in renewable energy tax cuts and a tax credit for research and development on energy conservation, energy efficiency and renewable energy. It also includes a multiyear extension of the renewable energy production tax credit for wind, hydropower, geothermal and bioenergy.LiNeBrEaKIn the long run, the efforts to combat climate change and global warming should lead to more work on renewable energy projects and other initiatives, Neumaier said, even if the short-term outlook is less certain.LiNeBrEaKNeumaier said the company's conservative financial position also should help EandE weather the economic crisis. The company has $14 million in cash and only a little more than $2 million in debt.LiNeBrEaKThe company got even stronger in the first quarter, with profits almost tripling. The company also bought back 197,000 shares of its stock from a free-falling hedge fund, Tontine Associates, that needed to sell its shares in August, a move that is expected to add to EandE's earnings per share.LiNeBrEaK"We've been operating pretty well in this financial crisis," Neumaier said.LiNeBrEaKe-mail: drobinson@buffnews.com		ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL INDUSTRY (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (86%); SOLAR ENERGY (86%); TAXES and TAXATION (86%); CLIMATOLOGY (86%); TAX LAW (85%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING and CONSULTING (78%); BIOMASS (78%); CREDIT CRISIS (78%); RECESSION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (73%); LEGISLATORS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (70%); SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS (69%); ENERGY RESEARCH (65%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (63%); COAL INDUSTRY (50%); CORPORATE TAX (50%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (78%); US PRESIDENTS (76%) BUSINESS FORECASTS OUTLOOK  			BARACK OBAMA (82%)  		January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Derek Gee/Buffalo News Ecology and Environment President and CEO Kevin S.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Duke joins plan to lower emissions  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	813 words  	Jan. 16--Duke Energy was among a rare group of household-name corporations and environmental groups that rolled out a plan Thursday to sharply lower greenhouse gas emissions as President-elect Obama assumes office.LiNeBrEaKThe plan, developed over two years, was an attempt to present the new president with a consensus of leading players in the debate over regulation of carbon dioxide. The gas is linked to climate change.LiNeBrEaKTheir recommendations would place national limits, dropping over time, on how much carbon dioxide may be released. Emitters like Duke could trade "allowances" -- permission slips to release carbon -- to stay under that cap. LiNeBrEaKBut the industry plan differs from Obama's, who also supports carbon caps, on a key starting point. The U.S. Climate Action Partnership, which crafted the plan, says companies like Duke should initially get allowances free. Obama has said he wants the companies to buy them at auction.LiNeBrEaKIt's a critical difference, because the value of the allowances is expected to soar into the trillions of dollars by 2050. The industry plan envisions reducing carbon releases 80 percent, compared to 2005, by that date. Interim targets were set for 2012, 2020 and 2030.LiNeBrEaK"If (free allowances) were removed from the mix entirely, I would say that it was one of the cards that could make the (plan) fall down very quickly," said Keith Trent, Duke's chief strategy and policy officer.LiNeBrEaKTrent said the costs of buying auctioned allowances would pass to customers, estimating that Duke's customers would see a 25 percent to 30 percent rate increase. He had no comparable estimate for free allowances, but said they would put money directly to work cleaning up plants.LiNeBrEaKIt's too much to make customers pay for auctioned allowances in addition to the costs of "decarbonizing" power plants, Trent said.LiNeBrEaKElectric utilities emit 40 percent of the nation's greenhouse gases. Duke Energy, one of the largest U.S. utilities, with 4 million electric customers, releases 100 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, third-highest among U.S. utilities.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups not involved with the partnership slammed free allowances and said the plan wasn't aggressive enough in calling for a 14 percent to 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"Giving away too many allowances for free would distort the market and could result in windfall profits for polluters," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.LiNeBrEaKInvesting in technologyLiNeBrEaKThe partnership includes 26 corporations -- among them DuPont, GE, PepsiCo and the Big Three automakers -- and high-profile advocates such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaKThe group cast its recommendations as a politically palatable stimulus to investment in low-carbon technologies and a way to start ratcheting down carbon emissions at the lowest cost to consumers.LiNeBrEaK"The health of our economy and the safety of our climate are inextricably linked, except nature doesn't do bail-outs," said Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, a partnership member. "If the diverse membership of (the partnership) can find common ground, Congress can agree on effective legislation."LiNeBrEaKIt's uncertain how rapidly legislation could be passed, given Obama's focus on the crumbling economy and two wars. The longer the wait for climate action, the partnership said, the higher the costs.LiNeBrEaKDuke CEO Jim Rogers, testifying Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce committee, said that "by starting now we have a better chance to smooth out and minimize the inevitable cost increases that will be imposed on U.S. consumers."LiNeBrEaKThe committee chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said he will move "quickly and decisively" to push greenhouse-gas legislation out of his committee before Memorial Day. Waxman said inaction will make it harder for the economy to pull out of recession.LiNeBrEaK"U.S. industries want to invest in a clean energy future," he said, "but uncertainties about whether, when and how greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced is deterring these vital investments."LiNeBrEaKBut Illinois Republican Rep. John Shimkus warned his committee colleagues to "be prepared for battle." He called the partnership plan "a shell game" to hide the cost from taxpayers.LiNeBrEaK"Let's develop a trading floor for U.S. emissions, and let's let the big-money folks at Goldman Sachs control it," Shimkus joked. "Is that a good idea?"LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press and Bloomberg News contributed.

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	City receives suggestions toward sustainability  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	577 words  	Jan. 16--A 123-page report released Thursday by the Chattanooga Green Committee includes 47 initiatives the city could take to make itself more green, including creating an Office of Sustainability in city government.LiNeBrEaKThe report acts as a road map for Chattanooga on how to become more sustainable and sets benchmarks for the years 2012, 2020 and 2050 on how to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKKaren Hundt, director of Planning and Design at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Regional Planning Agency, said some of the ideas had monetary costs, some did not. LiNeBrEaK"Some could be implemented right away," she said. "Some are long term."LiNeBrEaKCommittee officials said they did not have a dollar figure on how much enacting the potential items could cost. But they said they would be moving almost immediately to implement some items, such as the Office of Sustainability.LiNeBrEaKMayor Ron Littlefield, who attended the report's release, held at the green/spaces building on East Main Street, said afterward he thought the city could afford to open the Office of Sustainability. Several people inside his organization already have expressed interest in the job and could be shifted into the position, he said.LiNeBrEaK"I'm very much in favor of it," Mr. Littlefield said. "I already know how to do it."LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Littlefield said he would not start implementing the new office until after the March 3 city election. He's running for re-election against Rob Healy and Joe Lance.LiNeBrEaKSome of the green report's suggestions include making it easier for residents to recycle, making Chattanooga a leader in sustainable industry and also making sustainable building mainstream in the city.LiNeBrEaKThe report also made recommendations on reducing community waste, creating more alternative transportation and setting sights on a comprehensive public education campaign.LiNeBrEaKMs. Hundt said the committee used data from the Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement in 2006 and found the city's overall greenhouse gases had increased by 25 percent. City government's carbon footprint had increased 10 percent, she said.LiNeBrEaKCity Forester Gene Hyde, chairman of the green committee, said it would take more than just government pulling together to decrease those levels.LiNeBrEaK"Is this going to be an easy or a difficult journey?" he asked. "It's going to be difficult."LiNeBrEaKCommittee members worked on the report for a year, hosting a public forum and holding more than 160 meetings. Committee member Jim Frierson said the report is meant to provide a way to educate and focus the public, businesses and government.LiNeBrEaK"It's not about regulations; it's not about casting blame," he said.LiNeBrEaKMs. Hundt said many of the ideas that cost money still can be done while the nation is in a recession because, in the long term, many of the suggestions can save money.LiNeBrEaK"It is a cost up front," she said.LiNeBrEaKRick Gehrke, an environmental and sustainability consultant who lent his expertise to the committee, said now is the time to enact some of these ideas.LiNeBrEaK"There's no better time," he said. "These are all efficiency measures."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Green Scene: Going green from clothes to meat  	ENVIRONMENT; News; Business; Lifestyle; Home and Garden  	576 words  	Last week, I wrote about some of the many small things we can do to hop aboard the Green Scene train. With so much info out there about global warming, eco-friendly this and that, it can be a bit much. But it can also be easy and rewarding to help out Mother Earth. Here are a few more tips to get you on track.LiNeBrEaKEverything old is new again LiNeBrEaKVintage (yep, I mean secondhand) clothing is ecologically sound. By buying a piece of used clothing, you avoid the energy used in producing and shopping for a new one.LiNeBrEaKEvery item of clothing you own has an impact on the environment. So, hit the thrift and consignment shops; buy new clothing you really need (not just want); try a closet swap with some pals or donate your no-longer worn duds. In these economic times, this is not only eco-friendly but wallet-friendly.LiNeBrEaKReach for the starLiNeBrEaKBefore you buy that next big appliance, check out its Energy Star rating, a system devised by the Environmental Protection Agency. Approved products can be pricier but cost less to use. By using Energy Star appliances, you can reduce a utility bill by as much as 30 percent.LiNeBrEaKSteak outLiNeBrEaKWeird but true   a burger actually contributes to global warming. Who knew something so tasty could be bad for the Earth?LiNeBrEaKThe international meat industry generates about 18 percent of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions   even more than transportation   according to a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization report. If you can't bear to say adios to your steak forever, simply cut back.LiNeBrEaKCozy upLiNeBrEaKImproving your home's efficiency can be as simple as giving your hardworking water heater a warm hug via an insulated blanket (about $10-$20).LiNeBrEaKMost water heaters older than five years are constantly losing heat, thus wasting energy. If the surface feels warm to the touch, get your heater an extra blankie.LiNeBrEaKFarm aidLiNeBrEaKFruit, veggies, meat and milk produced closer to home rack up fewer petroleum miles than those trucked cross-country. Search www.localharvest.org by ZIP code for farmers markets, green grocers and food co-ops in your area.LiNeBrEaKThink inside and out of the boxLiNeBrEaKAll those foam peanuts and plastic CD cases cost energy to manufacture and deliver. Reduce the amount of excess packaging by buying in bulk and pass up packages within packages.LiNeBrEaKFor example, buy a big bag of chips, instead of a box containing 6 little bags. Avoid grabbing a handful of napkins at a restaurant when you really just need a couple. Take your own reusable cup when visiting a favorite coffeehouse (some even give you credit).LiNeBrEaKWear greenLiNeBrEaKGreen makeup may only be for the Wicked Witch but eco-green beauty products are becoming quite fashionable. Ask for organic or natural products at your favorite cosmetics counter. The choices available are quite eco-beautiful.LiNeBrEaKGood 'car-ma'LiNeBrEaKYes, I know, the hybrid is in your future, just not the near future. Still, your old-school auto doesn't have to be evil. Just giving your ride a tuneup and keeping tires properly inflated or replacing a clogged air filter can improve gas mileage and efficiency.LiNeBrEaKIf you can boost your car performance from 20 to 24 mpg, Old Reliable will put 200 fewer pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere each year.LiNeBrEaKLast, but so not leastLiNeBrEaKI culled much of this info from the Time magazine/CNN online report "The Global Warming Survivor Kit." While I've given you just a few eco-kick starts, the story listed 51 things.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	House Democrats' stimulus plan features energy efforts that could help Texas  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1020 words  	Jan. 16--WASHINGTON -- House Democrats unveiled an $825 billion stimulus package Thursday that aims to save millions of jobs while jump-starting party priorities such as expansion of renewable energy and health insurance for the poor.LiNeBrEaKThe bill reserves $41 billion in grants for local school districts, $40 billion for highway and transit projects, $32 billion for improvements to the electric grid, and $6 billion for broadband Internet. It proposes tax relief of $500 for individuals and $1,000 for families through a reduction in Social Security withholdings. LiNeBrEaKTexas would get $2. 3 billion for highways, $370 million for transit, and $277 million for clean-water projects, based on federal funding formulas.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats say unemployment could still rise as high as 9 percent, even with the stimulus.LiNeBrEaK"You have to look at this bill not as the salvation for the economy by any means," said House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, D-Wis. "What it is: simply the largest effort by any legislative body on the planet to try to take government action to prevent economic catastrophe."LiNeBrEaKRepublicans have balked at the stimulus' price tag and criticized specific measures they think are beyond the scope of emergency relief, such as $400 million to be spent on climate-change research at NASA.LiNeBrEaKHouse committees will consider the legislation next week. Democrats hope to approve a bill by Jan. 28.LiNeBrEaK"The plan released this morning by congressional Democrats was developed with no Republican input and appears to be grounded in the flawed notion that we can simply borrow and spend our way back to prosperity," said House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio.LiNeBrEaKA portion of the funds would flow to North Texas public schools, highway projects and public transit. Poorer Texans would get an increase in food-stamp benefits and laid-off workers would have access to health insurance for longer periods of time.LiNeBrEaKBusinesses would be allowed to claim tax refunds by applying current losses to past profits, a provision that has been a lobbying priority for homebuilders such as Dallas-based Centex and Fort Worth-based D.R. Horton.LiNeBrEaKState officials wanted the stimulus to provide a bounty for highway and transit projects. But the House plan deploys less for infrastructure than some hoped.LiNeBrEaK"I am a little concerned that the overall number -- at about $30 billion -- sounds like a lot of money but isn't really that much when you spread it around to 50 states," said Texas Department of Transportation Commissioner William Meadows. "Even one large interstate interchange could be $300 million all by itself."LiNeBrEaKTexas has made no final decision about how the funds it gets will be distributed. Meadows said Congress would likely require a certain amount -- perhaps 45 percent -- to flow directly to regional planning agencies.LiNeBrEaKDallas Area Rapid Transit officials said they're considering projects that may qualify for stimulus funds, including a $230 million Blue Line rail extension to Rowlett. "That's a project we could go pretty quickly with," said DART president Gary Thomas. DART may also seek funds to cover some of the $250 million it intends to spend on 537 new buses.LiNeBrEaK"Texas could be a major beneficiary of the stimulus programs," said Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco.LiNeBrEaKMr. Edwards, chairman of House Appropriations' subcommittee on military construction and veterans affairs, said he pushed to include more than $10 billion for defense installations, military housing and veterans hospitals. A significant amount will flow to Texas, which has 16 military bases, 11 veterans hospitals and 44 veterans clinics.LiNeBrEaK"It addresses the two goals -- stimulating job growth and also building high-priority, lasting projects," Edwards said.LiNeBrEaKThe package also contains assistance for specific industries that appear poised to benefit from Democratic control of Congress, including green energy.LiNeBrEaKTexas has more wind power capacity than any other state, thanks to federal and state incentives.LiNeBrEaKThe bill would create a new one: $8 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy power generation and transmission projects. Texas could apply to such a program to help cover the cost of its $4. 93 billion effort to extend transmission from West Texas -- where wind farms are concentrated -- to urban areas such as Dallas and Houston.LiNeBrEaKThe legislation also would reserve $2. 4 billion for the unproven technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emitted by coal power plants. Some of that money may fund a $1. 5 billion demonstration plant in President-elect Barack Obama's home state of Illinois, which lost federal funding last year.LiNeBrEaKIllinois officials have lobbied to include funding for the project, known as FutureGen, in the stimulus.LiNeBrEaKSome geologists think Texas could become a national laboratory for storing carbon underground, since energy companies are practiced at shooting it into old oil wells to boost production.LiNeBrEaK"The credit crisis has dried up money for new wind and solar projects, and this is a place to get money," said Jim Marston of the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKAn even larger pot of money, $32 billion, is reserved for improvements to the country's electric grid. Obama called for a "smart grid" during the campaign.LiNeBrEaKOncor, a unit of Energy Future Holdings that operates power lines in North Texas, is already spending $690 million to update electric meters. But the company thinks it would be hard for Oncor on its own to get stimulus funds.LiNeBrEaK"Individual companies trying to compete in their own interests are probably going to be trampled by organizations that can put together region-specific requests," said Oncor spokesman Chris Schein.LiNeBrEaKStaff writers Elizabeth Souder and Michael Lindenberger contributed reporting from Dallas.

The Daily Independent (Ashland, Kentucky)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	What kids want from a president  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	710 words  	Jan. 16--ASHLAND -- President-elect Barack Obama may think he has enough to wrestle with already: A tanking economy, two wars that have been dragging on for years, a broken health care system, global warming and a still-polarized Congress.LiNeBrEaKBut some students at Crabbe Elementary were more than willing to add a few more imperatives to his list. LiNeBrEaKThe Independent asked pupils in the first, third and sixth grades for some suggestions about what Obama could do for children. Here's what they came up with.LiNeBrEaKFirst gradeLiNeBrEaK"He should be nice to (kids) and let them know what they're supposed to do." Dauntier MarseyLiNeBrEaK"The new president should do for kids to care for them and tell them how they should act." Adrianna RiggsLiNeBrEaK"The new president should show the kids how to be good." Riley RiggsLiNeBrEaK"He should make other kids mind." Aries LauhonLiNeBrEaK"He's for the poor man." Tyler KnoxLiNeBrEaK"Make papers and books for our school." Lachlan FanninLiNeBrEaK"I want him to help us do stuff and homework." Keagan BaierLiNeBrEaKOther first-graders thought maybe Obama could help them learn to read and fix the puzzles in their classroom. They also came up with some good names for the dog Obama has promised his daughters: Rover, Max, Brownie, Cupcake, Jake or George Washington.LiNeBrEaKThird gradeLiNeBrEaKSome of the studetns in third grade were interested in checkbook issues while others kept the focus on school.LiNeBrEaK"I want him to put taxes down.

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Bike, pedestrian advocates smile at Obama package  	LOCAL; Pg. A5  	499 words  	As President-elect Barack Obama travels to the Cleveland area today, Jan. 16, to unveil his economic stimulus package, many are hoping that the greenest of the transportation projects don't get buried under freeway concrete. LiNeBrEaKDavid Goldberg, spokesman for Transportation For America, said his organization wants to see a "dramatic rethinking" of transportation policy, both in the stimulus package and the federal transportation bill that will need to be reauthorized this year. LiNeBrEaK"We've been living with this sort of Eisenhower highway era, 1950s transportation program," Goldberg said. "And there are all kinds of reasons to think we've hit a dramatic turning point, from the worries over oil dependence and volatile gas prices to recognition of the climate change issue."LiNeBrEaKThe recent collapse of the housing market, particularly in the exurbs, is showing the problems with "building places that maximize our driving," he said. Driving and fuel consumption have also dropped over the last several months.LiNeBrEaK"So all this points to the need to rethink what we've been doing," he said. "The stimulus ought to be starting us on that path instead of a last gasp of a dying system."LiNeBrEaKGoldberg, who was working to digest the details of the proposal late Thursday afternoon, said one possible bright spot was language requiring part of the highway money to go to "enhancements" such as bike and pedestrian facilities, and to metropolitan planning organizations such as the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission.LiNeBrEaKWhile the vast majority of the highway funds would go directly to the states, Goldberg said, a preliminary analysis indicates that $1. 35 billion would go to safety projects nationwide, another $1. 35 billion to enhancements and $6. 75 billion to metropolitan planning organizations. If it happens that way, it would be good news for bike and pedestrian advocates.LiNeBrEaKCaron Whitaker, campaign director for a coalition of eight major national pedestrian and bicycling groups called America Bikes, said her group is "very pleased" to see money going to enhancements and the local organizations.LiNeBrEaK"When we went into this battle," Whitaker said, "the original language we were hearing about included none." LiNeBrEaKMembers of America Bikes have identified more than $2. 5 billion in bike and pedestrian projects that are ready to build - a major requirement for stimulus package money. Their incomplete list includes $3 million for the Dayton region's Great Miami River Recreation Trail.LiNeBrEaK"What's great about these projects is that most of them are small," Whitaker said, "so they are things that could be on the ground and getting done before some of the major road projects could even get started."LiNeBrEaKIn addition, she said, they employ local small businesses. And they give people a way to save money while improving their health and reducing carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKIt's the proverbial win-winwin-win scenario. And, if you ask me, we could use a few wins.LiNeBrEaKContact this reporter at (937) 225-2393 or kmccall@DaytonDaily News.com.

The Denver Post 	January 16, 2009 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Debate over: It's freezing  	Pg. B-11  	631 words  	The carbon footprint of Barack Obama's inauguration could exceed 575 million pounds of CO2. According to the Institute for Liberty, it would take the average U.S. household nearly 60,000 years of naughty ecological behavior to produce a carbon footprint equal to the largest self-congratulatory event in the history of humankind.LiNeBrEaKThe same congressfolk who are now handing out thousands of tickets to this ecological disaster only last year mandated the phased elimination of the incandescent light bulb - a mere carbon tiptoe, if you will. The whole thing seems a bit unfair. LiNeBrEaKAnd, on the day millions of Americans were freezing their collective backsides off, new Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman announced that Congress would fast-track climate change legislation. Waxman claimed "inaction on the climate issue is causing uncertainties that make it more difficult to emerge from the recession," according to The Associated Press.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's methane emission would merely reek if it weren't so catastrophically sad. I learned long ago that any dissent on climate alarmism will be met with unflinching fury, but is there anyone who can genuinely argue that inaction on "climate issues" (formerly known as global warming) has had a fundamental impact on the economic downturn?LiNeBrEaKOur plight will, in actuality, likely be exacerbated if Waxman gets his way. Playing on the public's fear of climate change, we are about to almost certainly see a nationalized energy policy and price controls through cap and trade.LiNeBrEaKThe late economist and journalist Henry Hazlitt once wrote that those who attempt "to lift the prices of particular commodities permanently above their natural market levels have failed so often, so disastrously and so notoriously" that no one admits to wanting to try it. Then again, in those heady days, the Energy and Commerce chairman's job was actually assisting Americans with their energy needs, not making it more expensive.LiNeBrEaKI've been informed, quite forcefully, that "climate change" can induce weather to warm, make it colder and, miraculously, produce whatever climate condition we happen to be experiencing at that very moment. So I wholeheartedly concur with my environmentalist friends: Climate does indeed make weather fluctuate.LiNeBrEaKThe day Waxman delivered his statement, the National Weather Service issued a warning for Chicago about wind chill somewhere in the vicinity of 25 to 40 below zero. In Maine, citizens expected something around 40 below zero. And Iowans were warned that temperatures could drop as far as 27 below. In many places across the nation, there was record-setting cold.LiNeBrEaKSo, in other words, Waxman expects these unfortunate glacial souls to pay higher energy prices to shield themselves from Arctic chills in the name of global warming?LiNeBrEaKThat's quite a trick.LiNeBrEaKStill, politically, the time is right for progressives to pass any legislation they please. But Democrats may also be setting themselves up for failure. This kind of central planning, after all, has a winning record envied only by the Detroit Lions.LiNeBrEaKConserving energy, acting responsibly and cultivating technological advances are positive, whether global warming is as dangerous as the alarmists claims or not. But implementing ideas conjured up in the environmentalist's imagination could bring massive economic consequences.LiNeBrEaKYou've told me the debate over climate change is over. But even if I concede it is, the debate over the worthiness, practicality, feasibility and tradeoffs necessary to live in a vibrant and free economy should not be over.LiNeBrEaKIs 0. 74 degrees Celsius warming over the past 100 years really enough to make us panic? I mean, we could probably make that up canceling the inauguration.LiNeBrEaKReach columnist David Harsanyi at 303-954-1255 or dharsanyi@denverpost.com		CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); WEATHER (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (88%); EMISSIONS (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); METHANE (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); ENERGY REGULATION (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (74%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (74%); PRICE MANAGEMENT (74%); ENERGY DEMAND (74%); OIL and GAS PRICES (74%); POLITICAL PARTIES (74%); ECONOMIC NEWS (73%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (73%); RECESSION (73%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (69%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (65%)  			HENRY WAXMAN (93%); BARACK OBAMA (91%)  	IOWA, USA (74%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Column  	Newspaper  	2009 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  	David Harsanyi  															
Duluth News-Tribune (Minnesota)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	BRIEF: Duluth below-zero spell ends at 90 hours  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	272 words  	Jan. 16--The official National Weather Service thermometer at Duluth International Airport finally crawled above zero at about 1: 30 this afternoon, the first time it had been positive territory since about 8 p.m. Monday. LiNeBrEaKThe warm-up ended a nearly 90-hour stretch below zero, far from a record but more than enough for cold-weary Northlanders.LiNeBrEaKThe punishing cold week saw daily low temperature records set at International Falls, a reading of 47 below zero in Embarrass and four days of 20 below zero or worse across Duluth and most of the Northland.LiNeBrEaKCoupled with biting winds, the cold temperatures were enough to cancel school across much of the region Thursday and today.LiNeBrEaKThe warm-up came fast today, after a morning that was nearly the coldest day of the week. Temperatures dropped to 46 below in Embarrass this morning, 41 below in International Falls and 23 below in Duluth before moving up.LiNeBrEaKNow, a January Thaw or near thaw is expected, with temperatures into the 20s above zero by Sunday and near or above freezing by Tuesday and Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKA couple of inches of snow are possible tonight.LiNeBrEaKDon't sell your longjohns, though. Another blast of polar air will descend on the region just in time for next weekend.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	ENERGY;  Balanced solution 	Pg. B-6  	549 words  	Oil companies were taking a beating when gas prices were at $4 a gallon.LiNeBrEaKWhere is the applause now that prices have dropped below $2 a gallon?LiNeBrEaKThe reason: They are scapegoats. LiNeBrEaKInvestor-owned oil companies don't control oil prices.LiNeBrEaKLet that sink in.LiNeBrEaKInvestor-owned oil companies like ConocoPhillips and Exxon only control about 7 percent of the world's oil supply. Nationalized oil companies control most of the supplies, like those in Venezuela or Saudi Arabia.LiNeBrEaKOil prices surged to $4 due in large part to huge worldwide demand, especially from the booming economies of the world's two most populous countries, China and India.LiNeBrEaKOil prices have plunged in large part due to the worldwide recession, said Luc Messier, senior vice president of project development and procurement for ConocoPhillips.LiNeBrEaKHe recently visited the Times-Union to share his energy company's perspectives.LiNeBrEaKAmong his points:LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is fact: ConocoPhillips was the first energy company to join the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a group of about 30 major corporations that have called on the federal government to enact significant action to reduce greenhouse gases. Other members include Shell, Duke Energy and PGandE Corp.LiNeBrEaKThose companies want firm, consistent direction from the federal government so they can justify the billion-dollar investments required for the next generation of energy technology.LiNeBrEaKCarbon taxes or a cap and trade program must be high enough to justify action, but not so high to make it difficult for companies to invest. That fine balance is difficult, but key to a successful transition to a green energy sector.LiNeBrEaKMessier's keys to a new energy future:LiNeBrEaKDiversify sources. No single source of energy is a panacea. All will be needed.LiNeBrEaKEfficiency. Conservation will help stabilize energy prices and buy time for the new sources to come on line.LiNeBrEaKNew technology. There are all kinds of developments in the works, from breakthroughs in batteries; to converting coal to a gas; to even extracting oil from ice. But there has to be a market for it.LiNeBrEaKProtecting environment. Oil drilling can be done without harming the environment, for instance. That must remain a key consideration of any new energy source.LiNeBrEaKNational security is the elephant in the room of the oil industry, however. When oil is the dominant revenue source of a nation, it seems to lead to tyrannical or unstable behavior of its leaders. Venezuela, for instance, has expropriated the investor-owned oil assets.LiNeBrEaKOnly a comprehensive energy strategy that gives businesses the assurance that they won't be left in the lurch can change this nation's addiction to oil.LiNeBrEaKLet's hope the new administration and Congress are pragmatic. Our nation's economic future depends on it.LiNeBrEaKON GLOBAL WARMINGLiNeBrEaKAn energy company's position: ConocoPhillips recognizes that human activity, including the burning of fossil fuels, is contributing to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that can lead to adverse changes in global climate."LiNeBrEaKDual challenges: "Meeting the twin challenges of taking action on climate change and providing adequate and reliable supplies of energy will require technical innovation, resource commitments and responsible stewardship by energy producers and consumers alike."LiNeBrEaKSource: Climate Change Position on www.conocophillips.com		OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (93%); OIL and GAS PRICES (92%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); PRICE CHANGES (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (89%); CRUDE OIL and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (89%); OIL and GAS EXTRACTION (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (88%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (88%); EMISSIONS (79%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (79%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (79%); OIL EXTRACTION (79%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); NATIONALIZATION (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (78%); RECESSION (75%); ECONOMIC NEWS (75%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); PRICE INCREASES (73%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (68%); NATIONAL SECURITY (60%)  	CONOCOPHILLIPS (95%); PGandE CORP (91%); DUKE ENERGY CORP (90%)  			FLORIDA, USA (92%) VENEZUELA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); SAUDI ARABIA (79%); INDIA (79%); CHINA (79%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Florida Times-Union   			COP (NYSE) (95%); PCG (NYSE) (91%); DUK (NYSE) (90%)  	NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (91%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (91%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (90%)  												
The Garden City Telegram (Kansas)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Sunflower plan would employ Kansans  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	551 words  	Jan. 16--Sunflower Electric Power Corp. hasn't been given the go-ahead on its proposed plant expansion at the Holcomb site.LiNeBrEaKIt's uncertain whether the go-head will ever come. LiNeBrEaKBut Sunflower is looking toward the day it does. This week, the corporation announced its plans to work with the Central and Western Kansas Building and Construction Trades Council on labor agreements for construction of the planned Holcomb expansion project. Among other things, the collaboration would give Kansas contractors priority in constructing the plants.LiNeBrEaKSunflower's fight for an air quality permit that would clear the way for its proposed expansion of two additional coal-fired power plants at the Holcomb site is carrying into the new year as it seeks a ruling from the Kansas Supreme Court in the case.LiNeBrEaKThe corporation still is holding out for the permit to be issued for the project after it was denied in October 2007 by Kansas Department of Health and Environment Secretary Rod Bremby because of concerns the plants' carbon dioxide emissions would worsen global warming. The Kansas Office of Administrative Hearings in December upheld the state regulator's denial of the air quality permit, making way for the state Supreme Court to take up the issue.LiNeBrEaKIn the meantime, Sunflower and the building and construction trades council have signed a memorandum of understanding stating Sunflower will include in the contract with its general contractor and/or construction manager a specification the Holcomb project is built compliant with the terms in the Project Labor Agreement. Those terms give priority to union contractors/subcontractors having appropriate labor agreements with local Kansas labor organizations.LiNeBrEaKThe memorandum ultimately gives priority for employment to craft personnel living in Kansas, according to Sunflower.LiNeBrEaK"Kansas workers are the backbone of our economy, so an agreement that puts our contractors to work will benefit all Kansans," said Rich Taylor, business manager for the council.LiNeBrEaKThe council collectively represents about 10,000 members in central and western Kansas. During construction, the expansion project is set to create more than 2,400 Kansas jobs, earning more than $78 million per year and generating more than $9 million a year in taxes.LiNeBrEaKThe memorandum expires July 1 unless the Kansas Legislature passes legislation in the 2009 session "that provides directly or indirectly for the issuance of a construction air permit for the project" by KDHE, according to Sunflower.LiNeBrEaK"Sunflower and the council share a common desire to put Kansans to work and to utilize the expertise of Kansas contractors," Sunflower CEO and President Earl Watkins said. "This agreement fits with our desire to not only provide reliable, affordable power to central and western Kansans but also to ensure that Kansas workers have access to the jobs available during the project construction."

Grunion Gazette (Long Beach, California)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Port Air Quality Efforts Make Significant Gains  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	580 words  	Jan. 16--Air quality has shown signs of overall improvement around the Port of Long Beach, according to a new study.LiNeBrEaKThe port's latest Air Emissions Inventory has reported that ships, trains, trucks and other goods-movement machinery produced less pollution in 2007 than in previous years, following the port's passage of a Clean Air Action Plan. Nick Sramek, vice president of the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners, said that pollution from several types of sources had dropped to 2004 and earlier levels in the yearLiNeBrEaKA 2008 report for air quality is slated for release midyear. LiNeBrEaK"We thought it was very promising for the first year of the program," he said.LiNeBrEaK"I was surprised that some of the numbers were down as much as they were."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the report, major pollutants were reduced due to fewer ships visiting the port; those that did visit usually were larger in size. Such toxins, including particulate matter from diesel exhaust, have been linked to environmental damage and public health problems.LiNeBrEaK"In recent years, it's become clearer that diesel pollution poses a serious health threat throughout the region," Assistant Director of Communications Art Wong said. "Diesel equipment at the port has been a major source, so we've taken initiatives to significantly reduce that. Ongoing inventories will show the extent of that progress."LiNeBrEaKThe drop in pollution also was attributed to compliance with a California Air Resources Board regulation on the use of low-sulfur fuels as well as participation in such efforts as the Green Flag Vessel Speed Reduction Program, where ships slow down voluntarily to cut pollutants. In addition, harbor craft, locomotives and heavy-duty trucks began operating off of ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel.LiNeBrEaK"It's the ships, the trucks, the trains -- all of the equipment working within the port," Wong said.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the PierPASS program reduced heavy-duty truck idling time from about 3. 8 million idling hours to 2. 5 million. Cargo-handling equipment that would otherwise emit more pollution has been replaced with cleaner alternatives.LiNeBrEaKStill, Wong said, the port has more work to do in terms of reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Those pollutants saw slight increases from 2005 to 2007. The Clean Air Action Plan does not include greenhouse gas reduction measures, but port officials said they have begun work on solutions.LiNeBrEaK"Things that will have to continue are the replacement of some older fuel so that we can see even more improvements," Wong said.LiNeBrEaKThe port produced the study as part of its Clean Air Action Plan, approved by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners in November 2006, following the enactment of its environmental protection Green Port Policy.LiNeBrEaKDespite economic challenges, port officials said they are looking to implement more sustainable measures. Shipping companies, Wong said, have provided much of the funding for such upgrades.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to do everything we can," Sramek said. "We're not going to let funding get in our way."LiNeBrEaKFor more information, visit www.polb.com/emissions.

The Herald (Sharon, Pennslyvania)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Dahlkemper gets spot on Agriculture committee  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	339 words  	Jan. 16--MERCER COUNTY -- Freshman Congresswoman Kathy Dahlkemper has her committee assignments in the U.S. House of Representatives, with the Committee on Agriculture at the top of her appointments. LiNeBrEaKMrs. Dahlkemper said she was thrilled with the appointment in a news release. She said it fits nicely with the 3rd District, which includes most of Mercer County. Agriculture is the county's number one industry.LiNeBrEaKShe said that the committee will lead the charge on energy independence and climate change initiatives.LiNeBrEaK"This committee will focus heavily on renewable energy, an area I believe offers great opportunity for our region," Mrs. Dahlkemper said in the release.LiNeBrEaKWhile not available for comment Thursday night, Mrs. Dahlkmper's interim communications chief Tammy Roche said the committee assignment could help the district.LiNeBrEaKWhen Mrs. Dahlkemper's predecessor, former Rep. Phil English, was elected in 1994, he was given a seat on the powerful tax-writing House Ways and Means committee. Asked how the Committee on Agriculture stacked up, Mrs. Roche said the two couldn't be compared.LiNeBrEaK"Any committee assignment is an important committee assignment," Mrs. Roche said. "I certainly feel it's up to the individual appointee to make the most of their committee assignments."LiNeBrEaKBesides renewable energy, Mrs. Dahlkemper said in her release the committee will focus on areas like hunger, obesity and child nutrition. Mrs. Roche said that was good fit for her boss, a licensed dietition.LiNeBrEaKMrs. Dahlkemper will also serve on the House Committee on Small Business and the Committee on Science and Technology, as well as a number of subcommittees.

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	What's happened to Delhi's winter?  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	416 words  	Jan. 16--NEW DELHI -- The India Meteorological Department (IMD) turned 134 on Thursday. And it seemed as befuddled as an entity that old might be expected to be. LiNeBrEaKThe 'thing' confounding the Met is the last 12 months' erratic weather: first, an unusually long winter, then a rather cool summer, followed by a heavier- than-expected monsoon and now, a rather warm winter.LiNeBrEaKDecember of 2008 was the fifth warmest in the last 107 years. January, which is usually the coldest month, has also been more than usually warm in 2009.LiNeBrEaKThe IMD wants to study the pattern more before declaring the changed weather pattern is here to stay.LiNeBrEaK"We will not jump the gun saying it is climate change. We need to study the patterns more, which we are doing," said Ajit Tyagi, Director General, IMD, after the Foundation Day function on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKIn the last decade, eight of the 10 coldest days have occurred in the first half of January. At this time, last year, Delhi was reeling under a cold wave with temperatures plummeting to 2. 6 degrees, 2 degrees and then even 1. 9 degrees Celsius. This winter, the mercury has not dipped below 4 degrees Celsius. In fact, nine of the first 15 days saw warmer-than-normal temperatures. Even on the other six days, the fall from normal was marginal.LiNeBrEaK"The above-normal temperatures can be attributed to change in wind patterns, which is based on Western Disturbances. The warm nights have been mostly caused by approaching Western Disturbances (a wind system)," said SC Bhan, Director of the Safdarjung unit of IMD.LiNeBrEaKIf this trend continues, this could well be one of the warmest winters in Delhi.LiNeBrEaKIn the past one year, Delhi saw a remarkably cool summer, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing the signature 40-degree Celsius mark.LiNeBrEaKThe previous winter had extended till March, making it one of the coolest ever. In monsoon, on the other hand, rainfall was around 40 per cent in excess of the expected, normal amount.LiNeBrEaKThe Met predicts Friday will be warmer, with the minimum rising to 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum at 24 degrees -- both three degrees above normal.

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	NGRI collaborates with Norway for extracting more oil using carbon dioxide  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	404 words  	Jan. 16--NEW DELHI -- With scientific collaboration with Norway the  National Geophysical Research Institute plans to start a project to extract more oil from the existing heavy oil fields in India using green house gas carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaKTalking to the Hindustan Times Director NGRI VP Dimri said, "India is able to extract only 27 per cent of its available oil --  one of the major reason being the oil is extremely viscous or heavy. The viscosity of this oil can be reduced using carbon dioxide which would lead to enhanced oil recovery."LiNeBrEaKThere will be a "double advantage",he said,  as it would reduce carbon dioxide emission which is  a threat to environmental pollution and a cause for  global warming as also lead to increased oil recovery. India being the sixth largest emitter of carbon dioxide is concerned about to carbon dioxide  sequestration (capturing carbon and storing it at a safe place),he added.LiNeBrEaKOil is available in the sedimentary basins in India  about 4 to 5 kilometers below the earth but  about  50 per cent of the available oil is heavy and cannot be extracted with primary (automatic) pressure, secondary pressure injecting water  ,steam and some chemicals or even by firing the front of the oil to make it less viscous and light, Dimri added.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide chemically reacting with the heavy oil reduces the viscosity of the heavy oil to a greater extent and makes it light for being extracted easily, he said.LiNeBrEaK"The process is already being practiced in Norway and Canada. Both the countries extract about  60 per cent of their available oil.  Now NGRI in collaboration with Sintef Group in Trondhiem, Norway, has agreed to start a new project on carbon dioxide sequestration for increasing oil recovery. We will get in touch with all the stake holders involved and may start the project in Cambay basin heavy oil field soon," he added.LiNeBrEaKWe have the technology to transport the carbon dioxide which we would need from thermal power plants to be injected  in the heavy oil fields, he added.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 16, 2009 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Emissions limits sought;  Group wants Congress to act on greenhouse gases 	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	478 words  	WASHINGTON - Business and environmental leaders on Thursday asked Congress to enact a mandatory timeline for slowing and eventually reversing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe blueprint advanced by a consortium called the U.S. Climate Action Partnership includes a mandatory cap-and-trade system, under which oil refineries, power plants and other industrial operations could stay within federal limits for greenhouse gas emissions by buying and selling allowances to release pollutants blamed for global warming. LiNeBrEaKPolluters would have to meet new limits for greenhouse gas emissions, which would be capped at 58 percent of 2005 levels by 2030 and 20 percent of 2005 levels by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe incoming Obama administration backs a cap-and-trade approach and Democratic leaders in Congress have promised to fast-track energy legislation. Corporate leaders who believe stepped-up greenhouse gas regulation is inevitable are eager to play a role in shaping it.LiNeBrEaK"Regulatory uncertainty is postponing investment," said James Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy Corp., a major electricity distributor.LiNeBrEaK26 businessesLiNeBrEaKThe coalition, which comprises five environmental groups and 26 businesses, outlined the proposal in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ConocoPhillips, BP America and Shell, which have U.S. headquarters in Houston, are the major oil companies involved in the consortium. Some other oil companies, including Irving-based Exxon Mobil Corp., favor a carbon tax over cap-and-trade.LiNeBrEaKRep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, said the companies face a dilemma.LiNeBrEaK"They are reluctant to invest in old, polluting technologies because they know that tougher regulations are inevitable, but they can't invest in new, cleaner technologies until they know what Congress is going to require," Waxman said.LiNeBrEaKUnder the cap-and-trade program envisioned by the consortium, a new Carbon Market Board would be tasked with setting annual limits on the amount of emissions allowances companies could use.LiNeBrEaKHigher costs seenLiNeBrEaKThe plan drew criticism from conservatives, who said it would lead to slower economic growth and higher energy costs.LiNeBrEaKRep. Joe Barton, R-Ennis, predicted that any move to clamp down on emissions during a recession would lead to further economic declines.LiNeBrEaKAnd Houston Democratic Rep. Gene Green said he has concerns that the prices for emissions allowances would be too volatile under a cap-and-trade program.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, some environmentalists said the proposed greenhouse gas limits would be undermined by the USCAP's proposal for a "safety valve" that would kick in whenever the price for emission allowances spiked. Then, under the coalition's plan, the government could allow companies to use more offsets to meet the emissions limits.LiNeBrEaKComing sunday: Some say a tax would work better than a cap- and-trade system.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	NV Energy confirms interest in building coal plant at Valmy  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	451 words  	Jan. 16--NV Energy Inc., which has endured criticism from environmentalists over development of the $5 billion Ely Energy Center, confirmed Thursday it is interested in building another coal-fired power plant similar in size to the 1,500-megawatt power plant at Ely. LiNeBrEaKDavid Sims, director of project development for the utility company, acknowledged that the Public Utilities Commission directed NV Energy to update information on the possibility of building another coal-fired plant at Valmy Generating Station, 130 miles northwest of Reno.LiNeBrEaK"We are interested (in building another unit at Valmy) as is the commission," Sims said. NV Energy, the holding company for electric utilities in Nevada, sees a third unit at Valmy as an additional plant rather than an alternative to the Ely facility, he said.LiNeBrEaKCharles Benjamin, director of the Nevada office of environmental group Western Resource Advocates, said the Nevada commission is reviewing alternatives in preparation for a three-year review of the Ely center and other NV Energy projects this summer.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not going to be too concerned about what's called the Valmy option until we get into the triennial review," Benjamin said.LiNeBrEaKValmy is an existing brownfield site for coal-fired generation and dates back to the 1980s while the Ely center is a greenfield site on undeveloped land.LiNeBrEaK"While the Valmy site is a brownfield site, a coal plant at that site still raises the same concerns that the other coal plants have for Nevada," Benjamin said.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired power plants throw off twice the carbon dioxide per unit of electricity as natural gas-fired plants, and scientists say that carbon dioxide leads to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIdaho Power and NV Energy each own half interests in Valmy units one and two. In a December letter to NV Energy, Idaho Power Senior Vice President James Miller said the Idaho utility has no plans for a coal-fired power plant "in the near term" and wouldn't be willing to participate in a detailed feasibility study of a third power unit at Valmy.LiNeBrEaKMiller added: "However, we do wish to preserve our options to expand coal-fired production in the future, possibly when 'clean coal' technology is commercially available."LiNeBrEaKBy clean coal technology, Miller said he meant technology for capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Economy holds back carbon-gas trade plan: Tough economic times have seriously slowed worldwide efforts to battle global warming, experts said Thursday in South Florida.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	789 words  	Jan. 16--The globe may be getting dangerously warm, but the movement to reverse the trend has been hit hard by the recession.LiNeBrEaK"There's no doubt the economy has changed the nature of the debate," said Steve Fine, a veteran climate-change consultant, at the second annual meeting of Carbon Markets North America, which opened Thursday in Coral Gables.LiNeBrEaKSevere economic pressures are expected to postpone efforts in the United States to reduce greenhouse gases, and they're causing problems worldwide with attempts to agree on a plan to replace the Kyoto program, which expires at the end of 2012. LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, programs already planned to reduce emissions around the world are now having trouble getting funded.LiNeBrEaKAll of this is happening despite the strong commitment by the incoming Obama administration to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKMany of the proposals -- which would penalize the biggest producers of carbon dioxide and other gases -- would ultimately be paid for by consumers, particularly users of electricity, who would see the results in their monthly utility bills.LiNeBrEaK"Can we really do that in this environment?" asked George Sorenson, chairman of FE Clean Energy Group, of Darien, Conn.LiNeBrEaKAbout 100 persons listened to the morning sessions of the conference. About 150 had registered, said Graham Cooper of Environmental Finance Publications, the event's main sponsor. Last year about 200 attended, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration plans to support "green jobs" -- making wind turbines, remodeling buildings to make them energy efficient -- as part of the economic stimulus package, but more far-reaching measures, installing policies to penalize the major producers of greenhouse gases, are likely to be postponed.LiNeBrEaKFine, a vice president of ICF International, of Fairfax, Va., predicted that it will be 2015 before the United States implements a cap-and-trade program, which would set limits on emissions and if companies didn't meet those limits, they would have to trade with other companies to get credits for gas reductions.LiNeBrEaKEven so, some panelists hope that at least the House of Representatives can pass some kind of bill before December, when an international gathering in Denmark will grapple with a replacement for Kyoto.LiNeBrEaK"What we need from the U.S. is a clear signal that the era of doing nothing is over," said Franz Litz of the World Resources Institute, referring to the eight years of the George W. Bush administration, which refused to join the Kyoto effort to stop climate change.LiNeBrEaKThose meeting in Denmark will have to struggle with several challenges, panelists said. One will be getting China, which rivals the United States as the world's top emitter, to start doing its share of the cleanup. Another is getting money from the industrial world to help finance efforts in places like Brazil and Mexico to reduce emissions. .LiNeBrEaKMarco Monroy of MGM International, a Miami company that develops projects worldwide to reduce emissions, said in an interview such efforts are "now having a hard time finding financing," amid the credit crunch affecting many other businesses.LiNeBrEaKPanelists discussed at length the start last fall of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast, where states have created a carbon trading market that might be similar to an eventual national effort. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and other state leaders have been looking to the RGGI model as a possible solution.LiNeBrEaKBut RGGI started carbon trading by allocating more credits for carbon than the region was producing. That strategy muffled complaints from utilities about the program, but it means that carbon started trading at extremely low levels -- about $3 a ton, far below the $17 price on European markets.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, it's below the $6 or so a ton that some American companies pay in the voluntary U.S. market to show they're good corporate citizens, said Wiley Barbour, founder of the American Carbon Registry.LiNeBrEaKThe RGGI pricing is similar to what happened initially in Europe, in which so many credits were given away at first that they did essentially nothing to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKMany organizations have good intensions, the experts said, but that doesn't translate into reducing emissions. "At the end of the day, the environment doesn't care if we are earnest or not," said Sonia Hamel, a climate action specialist from the United Kingdom.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Economy puts green pioneers in holding pattern  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	592 words  	Jan. 16--Delays in dealing with global warming are making it increasingly hard for entrepreneurs in the United States and around the world to know how to plan for the regulations that they know are going to come.LiNeBrEaK"If we knew what carbon was going to be worth -- $20 or $80 -- we'd be a lot farther along," said Mark Trexler of EcoSecurities, a global consulting service. LiNeBrEaKTrexler was speaking at the second annual conference of Carbon Markets North America, which started Thursday in Coral Gables.LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that regulators have not made long-term plans. The United States, far behind the rest of the developed world, has yet to pass a cap-and-trade policy to limit carbon emissions. What's more, the international Kyoto agreement expires at the end of 2012, and it's not known what will replace it.LiNeBrEaKEntrepreneurs are reluctant to put money -- sometimes hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars -- behind efforts if they don't know how much regulators are going to penalize a ton of carbon dioxide, which is a shorthand measure for greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKOne example: American Electric Power is now working on a pilot to clean up coal by using chilled ammonia, then storing the sequestered carbon underground. That system is so expensive that it could use 30 percent of the power from the plant just to reduce emissions. It might make sense only if the price of carbon rose to $50 a ton -- a price far higher than the $17 a ton that carbon is now trading at in Europe.LiNeBrEaKOther technologies might make sense if carbon were $10 a ton, or $15, or $20. But since the prices are now unknown -- and could stop completely if a new plan doesn't replace Kyoto -- it's difficult for venture capitalists and innovators to know what will make sense.LiNeBrEaKWith all these uncertainties, said Ian Carter of Direct Energy, trying to forecast carbon prices is almost as bad as throwing darts at a board.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, the carbon trading market is unlike any other -- governments define both the supply and demand, panelists said. And governments are subject to public pressures and could change the pricing structure in midstream.LiNeBrEaKSteve Fine of ICF International pointed out that an earlier cap-and-trade system, to remove sulfur dioxide from the air, had worked very well and became a model for the system now used in Europe. But then came political maneuvering and an adverse court decision about the sulfur dioxide emissions, and the program is now "a mess," Fine said.LiNeBrEaKEven with all the negative comments, many panelists said progress was being made. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast, where states have created a carbon trading market, has had considerable start-up problems, "but RGGI is real, RGGI is alive," said Franz Litz of the World Resources Institute.LiNeBrEaKThe process is started, and that is the most important fact, Litz said.LiNeBrEaKWhile the economic downturn has slowed the environmental movement worldwide, it has also caused many factories to cut back production, and people are using less electricity. "So there are going to be fewer emissions for a while," said Graham Cooper of Environmental Finance Publications, which sponsored the meeting.

The New York Times 	January 16, 2009 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Skaters Rush to Icy Canals in a Rare Deep Freeze That Warms the Dutch Soul  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; NIEUWERKERK AAN DEN IJSSEL JOURNAL; Pg. 10  	991 words  	-- For the first time in 12 years, the Netherlands' canals froze this month, bringing the Dutch, who like their tulips in neat rows, a heady mix of pandemonium and euphoria.LiNeBrEaK  Hundreds of thousands of skaters, their cheeks as red as apples in the subzero temperatures, took to the ice, and hospital wards were filled with dozens of people with fractured arms, sprained ankles and broken legs. LiNeBrEaK  Train engineers were ordered to go slowly to avoid hitting skaters who clambered over railway tracks to get from one frozen canal to another. Even the minister of defense, an avid skater, fell and broke his wrist. His ministry announced that the national defense remained in safe hands, even if one of them was in a cast. LiNeBrEaK  In the 19th century, when Hans Brinker, the hero of the novel in which he tries to win a pair of silver skates, coasted along Holland's ice, the canals froze almost every year. But water pollution and climate change have made this so rare that today a boy of 15, Brinker's age, may never have seen a frozen canal, or at least remember one. Until, that is, this year.LiNeBrEaK  ''For us, it's in our genes,'' said Gus Gustafsson, 68, a retired insurance executive, explaining why he and his wife rushed out to buy new skates and take to the ice under a cloudless blue sky. ''It was like a frenzy that came over people, including lots of kids, like my granddaughter, who is 5.'' With thousands of others, they skated northeast toward Utrecht, then toward the cheese capital, Gouda.LiNeBrEaK  With an influx of immigrants, the country has been struggling to maintain what it considers its Dutch soul, and Mr. Gustafsson was one of many here who thought the skating experience enabled the Dutch to reconnect with their identity. ''There were only Dutch people on the ice,'' he went on. ''I saw no people of Arab descent.''LiNeBrEaK  But Andre Bonthuis, who has been mayor in this town of 23,000 people for the past 20 years, said he saw Indonesians and Moroccans, among other newcomers to the Netherlands, on the ice. ''It's rather new for people from Morocco,'' he said. But he agreed there was something very Dutch about canal skating, which is depicted in paintings by Dutch masters as early as the 17th century.LiNeBrEaK  ''Water is our friend, and 10 percent of our area is water,'' he said. ''From the oldest days, in very little villages, people could skate to each other.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Bonthuis, 59, said he skated with friends recently but also spent a lot of time just skating meditatively alone, leaning slightly forward, arms crossed behind the back. ''It's nice to skate when there is a beautiful view of the fields,'' he said. ''You see a lot of people skating alone.''LiNeBrEaK  Asked whether the skating frenzy had an economic impact, or perhaps had helped the Dutch forget the  downturn, he replied: ''Everybody took days off.'' He added: ''A lot of Dutch canceled ski holidays, so that hurt the economy, at least in the ski resorts.''LiNeBrEaK  But over at Haitsma, a big hardware and skating supply store, Henk Haitsma, 62, the owner, was not complaining. His shelves were swept clean. ''I sold 3,000 to 4,000 pairs of skates in the last 10 days,'' he said. In that time frame he would have sold several hundred in other years. LiNeBrEaK  The Dutch, famed for their champion speed skaters, like to go first class on the ice. The most expensive pair Mr. Haitsma sells, fancy skates with hinged blades, retails for $1,190. Other expensive models have removable linings that are put in a microwave oven, then pulled over the skater's foot, where they shrink to the perfect size. Many of the store's skates have removable blades, enabling skaters to walk off the ice without damaging their blades.LiNeBrEaK  Monique Matze says she just hopes skaters stay off the railroad tracks. She is the spokeswoman for ProRail, which operates the Dutch railway tracks, and she was troubled by the numbers of skaters crossing the rails, many wearing bulky skates. LiNeBrEaK  ''When our tracks run over water and people want to get from one side to the other, they just climb over,'' she said. There had been no accidents, she said, but she added: ''This weekend there were a lot, lot of skaters, and we had no means to facilitate crossings, so the only thing we could do was to caution them.''LiNeBrEaK  There may have been no railway accidents, but there were plenty of other mishaps. The defense minister, Eimert Van Middelkoop,  ''fell on a rough spot on the ice,'' according to a statement by the ministry. This week he was back at his desk, with his arm in a cast.LiNeBrEaK  ''He's over 60; he shouldn't have been skating,'' said Henk Van Engelenburg, a retired architect, with a laugh. Mr. Van Engelenburg, 74, who makes his home in a restored 17th century windmill, said his wife, who loved to skate, had a problem hip. ''She cried because she couldn't skate,'' he said. But his 6-year-old grandson was on the ice, pushing a chair to avoid falling, the traditional Dutch way of teaching children to skate.LiNeBrEaK  By this week, the rain and clouds of the usual Dutch winter were back. Weather experts said that the cold snap that brought the ice earlier in the month was caused by cold air that came rolling in from the east, across Germany and into the Netherlands. It was ''favorable weather for skating,'' said Harry Geurts, a spokesman for the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute, in nearby De Bilt. ''Lots of sun, little wind, really incredible.'' LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Geurts said he did not skate. ''I just like to walk in the woods,'' he said. ''When you have freezing fog, it's fantastic.''LiNeBrEaK  Oddly, though, the cold swept across only the southern Netherlands and not the north. That mattered because this year is the 100th anniversary of the first race across frozen canals through 11 cities in the north, and it has been repeated every year in the past century when there has been ice.LiNeBrEaK  Will there be another cold snap to freeze the canals of the 11 cities tour? ''Not in the coming weeks,'' Mr. Geurts said. ''At the earliest, in February.''	http://www.nytimes.com  	CANALS and WATERWAYS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (75%); MAYORS (73%); HOSPITALS (57%)  				NETHERLANDS (95%); MOROCCO (90%); INDONESIA (77%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: Canals in the Netherlands no longer freeze every winter, so the chance to ice-skate outdoors  created a frenzy in Kinderdijk and elsewhere in the south.

North County Times (Escondido, California)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	North San Diego County group seeks green focus in economic recovery plan  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	612 words  	Jan. 16--SAN MARCOS -- An environmental group held several news conferences around the state Thursday, including one in North County, to release a report that calls on President-elect Barack Obama and Congress to invest $142 billion in green energy and transportation.LiNeBrEaK"Big Oil, King Coal, the road builders and other polluting interests want to dominate the economic recovery program," Andrew Bauer, state field director for Sacramento-based Environment California, said in a news conference outside the San Marcos Civic Center. LiNeBrEaKInstead, Bauer said, much of the money in the Obama administration's economic stimulus plan should be pumped into sun and wind power projects and buses and trains that are much cleaner than fossil-fuel plants and cars.LiNeBrEaK"If we continue on business as usual with dirty energy and highways to nowhere we will be laying the groundwork for decades of global warming pollution," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut the group's report asserts that a $142 billion investment in a green future would slash emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming by 10 percent nationwide, while creating 3 million jobs -- roughly the amount lost in 2008.LiNeBrEaKBauer said his group scheduled the local event for San Marcos to call attention to the city's plans to change out an old climate control system at the Civic Center with an efficient one that substantially reduces energy use. That's the kind of project, he said, that should be the focus of the economic stimulus plan.LiNeBrEaKAsked whether the group considered San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s Sunrise Powerlink transmission line as an example of a green project the nation should be promoting, Bauer said no.LiNeBrEaK"We are not opposed to power lines in general," he said. "In fact, we support them. I mean, we need to get that green power to the people. But the Sunrise power line was bad on multiple fronts."LiNeBrEaKThe $1. 9 billion Sunrise Powerlink has been billed as a tool for shipping green electricity from solar and wind plants in Imperial Valley to San Diego County, and the California Public Utilities Commission cited the state's goal to ramp up investments in green energy when it approved the project last month.LiNeBrEaKHowever, environmental groups opposed the 123-mile power line on the grounds it would harm the backcountry environment and Cleveland National Forest while increasing the risk of wildfire.LiNeBrEaKThe report recommends investing:LiNeBrEaK--$62. 3 billion in green, renewable energy such as sun, wind and geothermal power. That would generate 833,000 jobs, the group says. Whereas California has set a goal of putting solar panels on the rooftops of 1 million homes statewide, the group wants to see panels on 10 million roofs nationwide. It also wants to see a national mandate that 25 percent of the nation's electricity come from green sources by 2025. California has set a goal of 33 percent by 2020.LiNeBrEaK--$21 billion in energy efficiency programs. The goal is to retrofit office buildings, factories and homes so that they stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter, resulting in less energy use. This, the group says, would create 430,000 jobs.LiNeBrEaK--$59 billion in public transportation, such as buses and commuter trains, and clean automobile fuels. According to the group, this strategy would create 1. 5 million jobs.

The Oregonian  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Smart appliances will figure out how to save you energy  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1005 words  	Jan. 16--If you could save energy, would you?LiNeBrEaKA new generation of home energy monitors and intelligent appliances that can respond to signals from the grid, saving power when it's priciest, are slowly creeping into homes in the Pacific Northwest. They may now be only a few years away from becoming commonplace, utility leaders and energy efficiency experts say.LiNeBrEaKThey will give consumers more power over their power. The question is how quickly consumers will adopt them and start using them. LiNeBrEaKSuper-efficient Energy Star appliances have already become the standard in new homes. The next step is to adjust the way the appliances behave -- when they burn power and when they don't -- in ways that save both energy and money.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, clothes dryers might get a signal to switch off their heating elements when energy is at a premium -- continuing to tumble clothes -- and then back on when demand eases. Air conditioners might wait a few minutes before cycling back on -- although consumers could override the delays if they want to.LiNeBrEaKRight now many dishwashers have delay features, allowing users to set them to run in the middle of the night when electricity is plentiful. But few people use that feature, said Mike Beyerle, a marketing manager at General Electric. A "smart" dishwasher could do that on its own, or at the signal of a utility trying to control power demands.LiNeBrEaK"What we're finding is that people will accept the delay," he said. "They don't oppose it. They just don't want to deal with it themselves."LiNeBrEaKHe says it's likely that within a few years, such intelligent appliances will be as commonplace as energy-saving Energy Star appliances are today. It may mean a shift in behavior for people, too: for instance, people might spread their laundry over a few days, accommodating their dryer's slower schedule, rather than a single "laundry day."LiNeBrEaKThey wouldn't necessarily have to, but doing so could save them money.LiNeBrEaKThe more "smart appliances" appear in homes, the more could respond to signals to ease up on their power consumption at key peak times when electricity is at a premium. That would make the whole energy grid smarter and more efficient, and help utilities such as Portland General Electric avoid building new generators that burn fossil fuel and emit greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of building a power plant to serve those few hours of peak demand, we'd rather work with customers to limit the demand," said Joe Barra, PGE's director of customer energy resources.LiNeBrEaKIt takes a step toward the "Smart Grid" concept promoted by President-elect Barack Obama, to make the national energy system make better use of increasingly stretched power supplies.LiNeBrEaK"A Smart Grid has little or no value without smart appliances attached to it," said Tom Reddoch, executive director of energy utilization at the Electric Power Research Institute. He said the main hurdle is standardizing systems so smart appliances all understand a common language.LiNeBrEaKRight now digital monitors that cost around $100 and sit on your kitchen counter can tell you exactly how much electricity you're burning at any given moment, and how much it's costing you. The idea is that knowledge is -- quite literally -- power and that you'll behave accordingly when you can watch a kind of odometer for your home. When you see your money ticking away because you left the lights on, you'll be more careful about turning them off.LiNeBrEaK"When you have the water heater on, you're less likely to leave the water running when you're doing the dishes," said Nick O'Neil, a planning engineer at Energy Trust of Oregon, who has had one of the monitors in his home for close to a year.LiNeBrEaKEnergy Trust offered more than 100 of the monitors to residential energy customers for the discounted rate of only $30 and most were snapped up in less than an hour. Energy Trust has no more, but they can be purchased online at www.bluelineinnovations.com.LiNeBrEaKSo-called "smart homes," where appliances operate automatically or respond to a button on your cell phone have been on the horizon for years. But what might finally make them reality is the increasing drive to save energy and not build power plants that contribute additional greenhouse gases. More utilities are moving toward "tiered pricing" -- charging more for power at times of peak demand.LiNeBrEaK"When people are faced with the prospect of having higher electric bills, they will look for ways to save," said Beyerle of General Electric, which is introducing new smart appliances this year. "The big motivations are going to be energy cost and energy scarcity."LiNeBrEaKMany appliances have some of the needed intelligence built into them. It's a small step for a dishwasher to go from deciding how much grime there is on dishes to deciding when to back off energy consumption, said Carl Imhoff, who manages the commercial energy market sector at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash. The laboratory has run pilot tests of smart appliances in Portland and Washington's Olympic Peninsula and found that 80 percent to 90 percent of homeowners liked the technology and would use it again.LiNeBrEaKAbout 10 percent of power generation capacity and 25 percent of smaller distribution lines, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, is used only about 400 hours a year -- those times of peak demand, such as cold snaps or heat waves, when electricity is in intense demand, he said. That makes such power especially expensive to bring online.LiNeBrEaK"If you can just take advantage of a little bit of intelligence in the appliance, it can sometimes be cheaper and greener than the alternative of bringing new generation online," Imhoff said.

Two groups also said they would file another lawsuit in 60 days, alleging violations of the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKThe WOPR emerged as part of a settlement between the Bush administration and the timber industry after timber interests sued, saying too much federal land in the Coast Range had been set aside as reserves for sensitive species. The BLM finalized the plan after receiving 30,000 public comments opposing the increases in logging.LiNeBrEaKBudget-strapped timber counties receive a share of logging revenue and supported the increases, however.LiNeBrEaKThe lawsuits allege violations of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. The groups said the increases in logging would harm wildlife and water quality.LiNeBrEaKOregon will join California and seven other states today in a lawsuit seeking to block changes the Bush administration made in endangered species rules.LiNeBrEaKThe states say the changes weaken protections for endangered species. The changes, enacted by the Bush administration in December, make it difficult to use the federal Endangered Species Act as legal leverage to curb pollution that contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689; michaelmilstein@LiNeBrEaKnews.oregonian.com		ENDANGERED SPECIES (91%); LOGGING INDUSTRY (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); FORESTRY and LOGGING (90%); COASTAL AREAS (90%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); SUITS and CLAIMS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); WILDLIFE (89%); THREATENED and SENSITIVE SPECIES (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (76%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); SETTLEMENT and COMPROMISE (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE (69%); FORESTRY and LOGGING SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%)  		BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (57%)  		OREGON, USA (99%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	January 17, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	MICHAEL MILSTEIN, The Oregonian

Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	NASA administrator stepping down; no successor named  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	981 words  	WASHINGTON _ An unusually soft-spoken Michael Griffin told NASA employees Friday that he would not remain as administrator when Barack Obama becomes president next week, ending almost four years as head of an agency he had hoped to lead back to the moon.LiNeBrEaK"Today is my last chance to visit with everyone," said Griffin, who will be temporarily replaced by Associate Administrator Christopher Scolese. "I have no idea what I'm doing next. It's really hard to hunt for a job when you're running NASA." LiNeBrEaKObama's NASA transition team _ with whom Griffin publicly sparred _ has reportedly suggested three names as possible replacements. Two are said to be scientists, but none of the names has been released.LiNeBrEaKNone of the names that have been floated publicly _ retired Air Force Gen. J. Scott Gration, earth scientist Charles Kennel and former astronaut Charles Bolden _ is considered a sure bet by the political or space community, sources said.LiNeBrEaKGriffin had lobbied fiercely to continue as administrator. But the often-combative engineer hurt his chances when he publicly upbraided Lori Garver, the head of the transition team, as "not qualified" to evaluate the Ares 1 moon rocket that he championed.LiNeBrEaKInstead, his resignation _ required of all appointees of President Bush _ will be effective at noon on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration has begun reviewing the Constellation program, which includes Ares 1 and the new Orion capsule and is meant to return astronauts to the moon by 2020. The program has been nagged by technical and financial problems, and its fate is likely to determine Griffin's legacy.LiNeBrEaK"It is totally tied to Constellation," said Roger Launius, curator at the National Air and Space Museum and a NASA historian for 12 years. "He has repeatedly worked to protect that particular approach. He has criticized and sometimes belittled those who leveled criticism against the program."LiNeBrEaKGriffin, NASA's 11th administrator, leaves behind an agency at the crossroads.LiNeBrEaKThe space shuttle is scheduled to retire in 2010 and Constellation won't launch before 2015. In the interim, America will have to rely on Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft to get to the international space station, and 3,500 jobs at Kennedy Space Center could disappear.LiNeBrEaKObama has also urged more emphasis on science missions _ including research about climate change and global warming _ which NASA's rocket scientists fear will divert money from its manned space program.LiNeBrEaKGriffin, 59, was named administrator by Bush in 2005, shortly after the president set a goal of returning to the moon and eventually flying to Mars. But the space community complained that Bush and Congress never gave the $17 billion agency enough money to do the job.LiNeBrEaKGriffin settled on Constellation in 2005. The shuttle-derived spacecraft was intended to cut costs because it would require fewer personnel to launch and maintain it _ a major concern for KSC workers, who prepare the shuttle for flight.LiNeBrEaKBut one recent study warned that Constellation could cost $7 billion more than expected if it is to fly by its target date of March 2015. The Ares 1 rocket also faces engineering challenges, such as violent shaking during liftoff that could kill astronauts.LiNeBrEaKGriffin, who acknowledged having "difficult user interface" with others, rejected all alternatives, including extending the shuttle past 2010 or mounting a new crew capsule aboard military rockets. He insisted that Constellation was the safest and cheapest option.LiNeBrEaK"If I have one regret," he said Friday, "the one I would say, honestly, is that I could not manage to persuade an even higher percentage of people that the things we were doing were the right things."LiNeBrEaKGriffin's other noteworthy controversy erupted in 2007 when he questioned whether global warming was a problem. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that is a problem we must wrestle with," he told National Public Radio. An internal NASA watchdog later concluded that political appointees in NASA's press office either "marginalized or mischaracterized" climate studies between 2004 and 2006.LiNeBrEaKGriffin did not bring up any controversies in his farewell address, which was televised live to NASA facilities around the country. Instead, he spent nearly an hour thanking employees and encouraging them to cooperate with Obama. "Try to find common ground with the new leadership," he said.LiNeBrEaK"NASA will look great whether we are asked to return to the moon and ... go to Mars, as I think we ought to be asked to do. Or whether we are asked to carry out some other task," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe said his top achievement was returning the shuttle to flight after the 2003 Columbia accident grounded the fleet for two years.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in the world is harder than picking yourself up after a cataclysm like that," said Griffin.LiNeBrEaKJohn Logsdon, a former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Griffin's "careful stewardship of the shuttle" would stand as a lasting achievement. "He has been very successful of managing the risks of a risky program," he said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who heads the Senate's NASA oversight committee, praised Griffin as "a good man (who) was a good administrator."LiNeBrEaKBut Nelson, who supports ex-astronaut Bolden to replace Griffin, also sent a veiled warning to Obama.LiNeBrEaK"I am hopeful," he said, "that the administration's selection to replace him has similar experience and knowledge of the space program as Mike does."LiNeBrEaKVisit the Sentinel on the World Wide Web at http://www.orlandosentinel.com/.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	January 16, 2009 Friday   Final Edition; All Editions	Web site devoted to Great Lakes reports climate change a top issue  	METRO; Pg. B2  	492 words  	ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKWhat's the most important issue facing the Great Lakes?LiNeBrEaKThat's the question Daniel Wendt at Great Lakes Country, a new Web site at greatlakescountry.com, asked in late 2008. LiNeBrEaKThe answer: invasive aquatic species and climate change - at least according to the readers of Wendt's site.LiNeBrEaKWe first told you about greatlakescountry.com in April 2008, not long after it debuted. Wendt, now an international-trade law attorney in Washington, D.C., grew up in Michigan and has eased his homesickness by putting a Web site together to aggregate news about the five lakes and surrounding region.LiNeBrEaKNot sure what to make of this, but Wendt's findings also showed that participating journalists and Canadian citizens ranked climate change No. 1 over invasive species.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps we news types ranked it highest (as I did) because it is the overarching issue from which many of the others spring - and maybe Canadians are seeing more dramatic changes than we are so far.LiNeBrEaKSo what do you think?LiNeBrEaKWe'll certainly be writing about this and related matters a lot in the coming months, so let us know where you stand on climate change or any other Great Lakes issue.LiNeBrEaKNew green group: In an age of marketing and mass media, it's nice to still see environment groups springing up from the grass-roots side of things.LiNeBrEaKThe Cleveland Going Green group, founded by Val Lobas of Cleveland, has since grown to 46 members, or "treehuggers," as they're labeled at meetup.com/clevelandgoinggreen.LiNeBrEaKEarly meetings focused on sustainable-food options, and Tuesday at 7 p.m., members will gather at Johnny Mango restaurant, 3120 Bridge Ave., Cleveland, to talk about green cleaning products.LiNeBrEaKYou can get more information or contact Lobas by e-mail through the Web site.LiNeBrEaKNew Summit trail planned: Summit County Metroparks have a new trail planned - the Freedom Secondary Trail.LiNeBrEaKThe park system will hold a public meeting from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday at the Tallmadge Community Center, 80 Community Road, Tallmadge.LiNeBrEaKVisitors can browse graphic displays, talk to park staff and consultants and make comments and suggestions.LiNeBrEaKThe trail is proposed to start at the Portage Hike and Bike Trail in Kent, follow an unused railroad corridor, connect to the Tallmadge Trail and continue west to the Towpath Trail at the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad's Northside Station in downtown Akron.LiNeBrEaKA second section of the trail could link to the Summit park district's 33. 5-mile Bike and Hike Trail in Munroe Falls.LiNeBrEaKLake parks director change: Lake Metroparks named Steve Madewell to serve as interim executive director at the beginning of the year. Madewell takes over for David Noble, who is retiring after 16 years atop the park system.LiNeBrEaKMadewell has been with Lake Metroparks 20 years and has been deputy director since 1990.LiNeBrEaKLake Metroparks, which has some of the most stunning vistas in Northeast Ohio in some of its rural parks in eastern Lake County, consists of 42 parks, facilities and properties covering 7,675 acres.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Brown researchers discover ties between environment, plant behavior  	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	487 words  	PROVIDENCE   A team led by Brown University researchers says it has unraveled some of the complex genetic signals that integrate temperature and sunlight measurements to tell a plant the best time to flower. LiNeBrEaKThe research, published today by the journal Science, could guide future breeding programs of important crops to help expand their range, and could help predict how plants will react to a changing climate.LiNeBrEaK People have looked at all these environmental signals separately, but we really wanted to know how plants integrate the response from these combined signals to come up with a good decision of when to flower,  said Amity M. Wilczek, postdoctoral research associate in ecology and evolutionary biology at Brown and chief author of the study.LiNeBrEaKThe work was done on the weed species Arabidopsis thaliana, sometimes called mouse-ear cress, which is related to canola, cabbage and broccoli.LiNeBrEaKBut how a plant actually behaves in the wild depends on how those genes interact. The genes looking at different environmental signals may be releasing chemicals that give conflicting messages. Other genes weigh that input, then send out chemical signals of their own to control flowering.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers have come up with a way to assess that balancing act in a lab piled high with boxes containing the dried remains of 55,000 of the plants, each individually wrapped and labeled, grown at five sites in Finland, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom from 2006 to this past fall.LiNeBrEaKWorkers examine each plant, measuring it, and going through the tedious process of counting the thousands of tiny fruits and pin-hole-size seeds on each, using them as a gauge of how well it grew in that climate and how likely it was to produce offspring.LiNeBrEaKBecause the plants have varying genetic makeups   some lack a gene that responds to how long the sun is up, for example   the researchers can develop a computer model simulating how the various genes interact, leading to success or failure in a particular climate.LiNeBrEaKWilczek said that is equivalent to being able to predict how rapidly any car will be able to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph based on knowledge of its internal characteristics such as engine size and type of carburetor, and environmental factors such as the type of fuel and roughness of the test track.LiNeBrEaKThis plant was studied, she said, not because it has any value, but because its genetic blueprint has already been mapped, making it easier to see how it operates so, hopefully, the knowledge can be applied elsewhere.LiNeBrEaK The bad news is, it s a weed,  she said.  The hopeful news is that because other plants have a similar genetic architecture, which is the same way these pathways integrate environmental information, we have high hopes we can transfer this over to other crop species,  such as wheat and barley.LiNeBrEaKAnd even when a plant has different genes that control the action, said Wilczek,  the pathways work in a similar way.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Obama can learn from  Old Europe   	COMMENTARY; Pg. 6  	828 words  	WASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKTHE INAUGURATION of the 44th president next Tuesday is starting to look like the most dramatic debut since the Beatles arrived in America for the first time, in 1964. But soon it will be time for Team Obama to produce results. For three of the president-elect s top priorities   energy and climate change, health care and jumpstarting the economy   President Obama would do well to look toward  Old Europe  for guidance.LiNeBrEaKEurope recently displayed its global leadership by enacting its 20-20-20 Plan: agreeing to cut human-produced carbon emissions that contribute to global warming by at least 20 percent by 2020. It will do this by ramping up renewable-energy technologies to 20 percent of its energy use, and by enacting the world s most ambitious carbon- trading program. And the richest European nations have agreed to do more toward combating climate change than the poorer nations, an important principle for any global climate agreement. LiNeBrEaKIn a friendly challenge to the president-elect, European Union Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said,  Our message to our global partners is: Yes, you can . . . especially to our American partners. LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration also should learn from how Europe has enacted universal health coverage and quality care at an affordable price. European nations are rated by the World Health Organization as having the best health-care systems in the world, spending on average far less than the United States for better results. France has the top-rated health-care system, while the U.S. is ranked 37th   just ahead of Cuba and Slovenia.LiNeBrEaKYet contrary to stereotype, France, Germany and most other European countries do not use government-run,  socialized medicine.  They have figured out a third way   a hybrid with private insurance companies, short waiting lists for treatment and individual choice of doctors.LiNeBrEaKThis third-way hybrid is based on the principle of  shared responsibility  among workers, employers and the government, all contributing their fair share to guarantee universal coverage. Participation for individuals is mandatory, not optional, just as you must have a driver s license to drive.LiNeBrEaKThese health-care plans are similar to what Massachusetts recently enacted, but with two significant differences. In France and Germany, the private insurance companies are nonprofits. Doctors and nurses are paid well, but you don t have corporate health-care CEOs making hundreds of millions of dollars. The profit motive mostly has been wrung out of the system.LiNeBrEaKThe second key difference is in cost controls. In France and Germany, fees for services are negotiated among the health-care professionals, the government, patient-consumer representatives and the private nonprofit insurance companies. As in our Medicare system, together they establish a national agreement for treatment procedures, fee structures and rate ceilings that prevent costs from spiraling out of control. This is good for European businesses, too, because it doesn t expose them to the soaring health-care costs that have plagued American businesses.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration also could take notes from how the Europeans are jumpstarting their economies. Europe sometimes is criticized for its lack of unity, but at times that multi-headed hydra lets each nation act as a laboratory for the others, learning from each other s successes and shortcomings.LiNeBrEaKFor example, during the recent financial meltdown, as markets reeled and the U.S. announced a $700 billion bailout plan, each European country initially tried its own bailout formula. Within two weeks the British strategy under Prime Minister Gordon Brown emerged as the most effective. The rest of Europe quickly adopted it, as did the U.S. eventually, since the American plan had been so ineffective.LiNeBrEaKThe European plan also includes stricter controls over the bailout money, and equity in the banks, reductions in dividends and concessions from the bankers, all of which were lacking from the U.S. bailout. And Europe already has enacted a fiscal stimulus worth hundreds of billions of dollars at the continental and national levels, while Americans still await Obama s plan.LiNeBrEaKWith half a billion people, Europe is the world s largest, wealthiest trading bloc, producing nearly a third of the global economy   as large as the U.S. and China combined. While its critics have derided Europe as a land of  creeping socialism,  Europe has more Fortune 500 companies than the U.S., China or Japan.LiNeBrEaKLike the U.S., Europe is fighting against the rising economic floodwaters. But something about Europe and its  social capitalism  seems particularly well-suited to this make-or-break century challenged by a worldwide economic slump, global warming and new geopolitical tensions. Team Obama would do well to take notes.LiNeBrEaKSteven Hill is director of the Political Reform Program at the New America Foundation. His book Europe Rising will be published by the University of California Press this year.

Redlands Daily Facts (California)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Local environmentally concerned citizens meet  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	863 words  	Jan. 16--REDLANDS -- A diverse group of environmentally concerned citizens met this week to plan how the city and its residents can reduce their impact on the environment.LiNeBrEaKThe first meeting of Redlands' Climate Action Task Force was Jan. 14 at the city's council chambers. The 21 members of the task force sat at a long table headed by Mayor Jon Harrison, Quality of Life director Gary Van Dorst and task force chairman Jan Hudson.LiNeBrEaKHarrison, who invited members to join the new task force, has made green development and sustainability a city priority. LiNeBrEaKThe task force will develop a list of actions to recommend to the city to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Redlands, looking at possibilities in both the public and private sectors.LiNeBrEaKHarrison told the task force that globally, urban areas contribute a majority of the earth's greenhouse gases, but cover only a small percentage of the Earth's surface.LiNeBrEaK"What can we do with our 37 square miles to make a difference?" Harrison said.LiNeBrEaKThe members are:LiNeBrEaKTim Krantz, associate professor of environmental studies at the University of RedlandsLiNeBrEaKRenea Wickman, Redlands residentLiNeBrEaKGlenna Wiseman, director of marketing for HelioPowerLiNeBrEaKMarvin Hudson, owner of Viewpoint Financial Development Co.LiNeBrEaKLee Young, retired engineerLiNeBrEaKBill Jury, professor of environmental science at University of California, RiversideLiNeBrEaKMichael TenEyck, municipal utility managerLiNeBrEaKfor the city of Rancho CucamongaLiNeBrEaKDan Rendler, regional director for Southern California EdisonLiNeBrEaKGregg Schneider, vice president of CaseworksLiNeBrEaKPaul Foster, assistant medical group administrator for Kaiser Permanente in the Inland Empire counties, past president of the Redlands Chamber of Commerce and the incoming president for the Redlands Planning CommissionLiNeBrEaKMichael Westerfield, West Coast director for Dart Container Corp.LiNeBrEaKLisa Teichgraeber of HMC Architects in OntarioLiNeBrEaKFrank Coyle of Michael Brandman Associates in San BernardinoLiNeBrEaKEric Shamp, architect, principal at Ecotype Consulting and member of the Redlands Planning CommissionLiNeBrEaKTraecey Anthony, senior planner for San Bernardino County Solid Waste Management DistrictLiNeBrEaKDavid Taylor, project manager Southern California Edison for its community partnership programLiNeBrEaKKatharine Havert, California regional environmental education community network Region 10 coordinator with the San Bernardino County Superintendent of SchoolsLiNeBrEaKJoe Aceto, maintenance operations manager for the Redlands Unified School DistrictLiNeBrEaKJan Hudson, director of business development of the Inland Empire Labor Management Cooperation CommitteeLiNeBrEaKRabbi Douglas Kohn of Congregation Emanu El in San BernardinoLiNeBrEaKJonathan Baty, founder of www.bikecommuter.com.LiNeBrEaKAfter a lengthy discussion, the group chose to adopt the 10 environmental categories offered by the Institute for Local Government, the nonprofit research group affiliated with the League of California Cities and the California State Association of Counties. The 10 categories are part of the institute's list of ideas for cities.LiNeBrEaK"They gave us a footprint of everything we need to do for each one of these 10 categories," Gregg Schneider said. "It's already done. All we need to do is find the research to make recommendations on how the city can do these steps, and we can knock this thing out using this plan, which is a pretty good plan."LiNeBrEaKThe 10 categories the task force will focus on are efficient transportation, energy efficiency and conservation, water and wastewater systems, climate-friendly purchasing, renewable energy and low-carbon fuels, storing and offsetting carbon emissions, promoting community and individual action, green building, waste reduction and recycling, and land use and community design.LiNeBrEaKThe task force will split into subcommittees to study what could be done in certain environmentally minded areas. The group will focus on five categories for the next few months, with the committees reporting to the group at their monthly meetings.LiNeBrEaKThe task force also talked about what expertise the Climate Action Task Force could draw upon.LiNeBrEaK"What are our strengths as a community that we can build on?" Glenna Wiseman asked.LiNeBrEaKRedlands already has a strong recycling program through the waste management department. The task force agreed that Redlands also has strong intellectual expertise with the University of Redlands, ESRI and other companies and organizations.LiNeBrEaKTim Krantz introduced a group of University of Redlands students who could function as a research group for the task force and work with subcommittees.LiNeBrEaKThe next meeting of the Climate Action Task Force is 6 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 28, in the A.K. Smiley Public Library's Assembly Room. The group is slated to finish organizing subcommittees and begin research.LiNeBrEaKE-Mail Staff Writer Megan McClain at mmcclain@redlandsdailyfacts.com		CITIES (90%); COUNTIES (89%); TALKS and MEETINGS (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (89%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); GREEN BUILDING (78%); EMISSIONS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (74%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (74%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (72%); SANITATION DISTRICTS (72%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (71%); ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES (70%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (69%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (69%); BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT (66%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (66%); WASTE MANAGEMENT and REMEDIATION SERVICES (61%); CLERGY and RELIGIOUS (60%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (78%)  	KAISER PERMANENTE (66%); DART CONTAINER CORP (65%); SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON CO (54%)  	UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (54%)  	PAUL L FOSTER (54%)  	RIVERSIDE, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); WEST USA (79%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 17, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009    	MEGAN MCCLAIN, Redlands Daily Facts, Calif.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Possible deal in Hwy. 50 suit could remove one barrier in budget battle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	451 words  	Jan. 16--State highway officials and local environmentalists have tentatively settled a lawsuit, which could allow the state to move forward with plans for carpool lanes on Highway 50 in Rancho Cordova. LiNeBrEaKThe agreement, brokered this week by Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg, is to be reviewed by a Sacramento Superior Court judge this afternoon, those involved in the negotiations said.LiNeBrEaKIf the deal wins judicial approval, it would clear up a key sticking point in the state's ongoing budget battle.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has insisted that the Highway 50 carpool project be fast-tracked as part of a modest economic stimulus he wants included in the state budget.LiNeBrEaKLegislative Democrats had opposed the move because the project -- seven miles of new lanes from Sunrise Boulevard to Watt Avenue -- is tied up in an environmental lawsuit.LiNeBrEaKAs part of the brokered deal, Caltrans officials reportedly have agreed to provide $7 million to Sacramento Regional Transit to expand its light-rail service parallel to the freeway.LiNeBrEaKThe deal would allow RT to add limited-stop express service to and from downtown, extend every-15-minutes service to Hazel Avenue, and provide funds to help switch service to downtown Folsom from every 30 minutes to 15 minutes.LiNeBrEaKThe deal would include turning a railroad crossing over Highway 50 just west of Mather Field Road into a pedestrian walkway.LiNeBrEaKMark DeSio, spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, said Thursday that agency officials could not comment yet on the issue.LiNeBrEaKSteinberg's office also declined comment.LiNeBrEaKEric Davis of the Environmental Council of Sacramento, a plaintiff in the suit against Caltrans, said he is pleased with the agreement.LiNeBrEaK"We were always concerned about the impacts of widening this freeway," Davis said. "The most efficient way to mitigate those impacts is to improve transit service along the same corridor."LiNeBrEaKRT executive Mike Wiley said the tentative deal would allow the agency to cut seven minutes off run times for some trains into downtown.LiNeBrEaKThe agreement, however, does not fully comply with a court ruling issued last year.LiNeBrEaKJudge Timothy Frawley ordered Caltrans to study carpool lanes' potential impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, which have been linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Tony Bizjak, (916) 321-1059.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Mayan Nobel laureate calls racism a 'disease': U. of U. ? She lectured as part of Martin Luther King Jr. Day events.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	605 words  	Jan. 16--When 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu Tum gets a day off from advocating for peace and human rights worldwide, she likes to sleep in.LiNeBrEaKMenchu said the changes in climate and time zones wear on her during her travels. Once rested, she spends time with her husband of 17 years, Angel Canil; her 14-year-old son, Mash; and their three dogs. She also likes making jewelry, sewing, cooking and taking care of her plants.LiNeBrEaK"My house is a small jungle," she told The Salt Lake Tribune . "I like to be an ordinary person." LiNeBrEaKBut some folks who attended Menchu's hourlong lecture Thursday at the University of Utah said she was inspirational and down-to-earth.LiNeBrEaKIt was her first time in Utah, and more than 1,000 people showed up for the event, nearly filling Kingsbury Hall. Her keynote address -- it began and ended with a standing ovation, and had some laughs in between -- was one of several events this week at the U. in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday.LiNeBrEaKMenchu, 50, is a Mayan Indian from Guatemala who has spent her life fighting social injustice. She also ran unsuccessfully in 2007 for president of her Central American country. She has had her share controversy. For example, she has acknowledged that when she wrote a book about her life, she mixed her own testimony with experiences of other people during Guatemala's civil war that lasted from 1960 to 1996.LiNeBrEaKDuring her talk --LiNeBrEaKin Spanish and with an interpreter -- she told "young people" that there is no excuse for them not to be involved in challenging injustices. She encouraged them to initiate change in their communities because it doesn't happen on its own.LiNeBrEaK"Don't wait until you become a victim; you have your rights," she said.LiNeBrEaKMenchu said racism is a "disease" that affects people spiritually and emotionally when they are not content with themselves.LiNeBrEaKShe said it still exists in her homeland --but she has hopes that it will improve over time.LiNeBrEaK"Why can someone be against a brother who doesn't have the same skin color?" she said. "Prejudice has brought us apart."LiNeBrEaKShe said humans need to interact with humans who are different from them to experience various cultures. And if all people "respected" each other, they would be able to understand one another, despite their differences.LiNeBrEaK"The power of guns can never solve the problems of humanity," she said.LiNeBrEaKMenchu also said, "Human beings have abandoned our basic relationship with mother earth." She called on people to take responsibility for taking care of the environment.LiNeBrEaKAfter the event, Hanah Kim, a 22-year-old community college student, said Menchu "inspired me" to get more involved in human-rights issues.LiNeBrEaKFarah Melendez, a U. international studies sophomore, said Menchu's talk about fighting injustice reminded her of why she walked in Utah's historic immigrants rights march in 2006.LiNeBrEaK"It's an endless fight to making [things] better," she said.LiNeBrEaKjsanchez@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKDid you know?LiNeBrEaKThe names of Menchu's dogs are Sotz (bat), K'oi (monkey), Char (a type of bird).LiNeBrEaKAlthough she has experienced snow worldwide, Menchu has never tried any snow sports.LiNeBrEaKShe likes to visit cities' mercados (markets) when she travels.LiNeBrEaKMLK eventsLiNeBrEaKFor information about other MLK Jr. events, go to www.sltrib.com.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 16, 2009 Friday   FINAL Edition	Leah Garchik  	Datebook; LEAH GARCHIK; Pg. E2  	816 words  	Well, what else is there to think about?LiNeBrEaK-- I heard that the Dead had been invited to play the Mid-Atlantic Ball on inaugural night, and Mickey Hart says that's true. With respect for the majesty of the occasion, Hart's wife, environmental activist Caryl, and teenage daughter, Reya, will wear gowns, which are all ready to go. "It may be the first time I've seen everybody in black and white," says Hart.LiNeBrEaKThe drummer and Bob Weir are playing a luncheon for Al Franken two days before, too, and Hart's pretty excited about the whole shebang. "My only disappointment," he said, "is that I was overlooked for that CIA post." LiNeBrEaK-- As to that "Impeach Obama" bumper sticker, it was on a Chrysler convertible owned by Sausalito lawyer Stephen Fraser. He had the stickers printed up as a tongue-in-cheek gesture. "I supported McCain," he says, "but I had no real problems with Obama, except on foreign affairs." His objection, he says, is to "adulatory fawning, believing in a savior."LiNeBrEaKThe bumper stickers were "just to tweak the true believers, who frankly are a bunch of idiots. I put it on to goad the leftists of Marin." As to Obama, "I wish him well." LiNeBrEaK-- And as to that proposal for coast-to-coast bell-ringing at the time of Tuesday's inauguration, "My boyfriend doesn't have a bell," writes Hilde Carlson of Redwood City, "but he does have a beer truck. ... And he'll be on that air horn at 8: 30 a.m. Get ready, Menlo Park." If you live down there, don't plan on any whispered conversations between then and 9 a.m. LiNeBrEaK-- Berkeley-bred Peter Gage, 30, is "the top planner behind Obama's Inaugural Parade," says USA Today. He told that newspaper he had attended Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993 with his parents: John Gage who works on global warming issues at Kleiner Perkins and Linda Schacht Gage who teaches at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Peter Gage's enormous responsibilities for this part of the inauguration include the parade placement of the president and the portable toilets. LiNeBrEaK-- And Joy Montoya suggests that Americans pay homage to the Hawaii part of Obama's background by using the "shaka" hand symbol - three middle fingers folded down, thumb and pinkie spread wide - to mean "better times ahead." LiNeBrEaK-- Tuesday's celebration at the end of Bush Street brought to Jim Muth's mind a framed picture he has of Jimmy Carter holding up a photo of an "end Ford" street sign. This was taken in the late '70s, and the "Ford" referred to political rival Jerry, not Chrysler competitors. LiNeBrEaKThere was a private screening of the Lifetime cable movie "Prayers for Bobby" at KGO-TV on Tuesday night. The movie, which starts running Jan. 24, is based on the late Roy Aarons' book about a mother coming to terms with her gay son's suicide, and the screening was co-sponsored by the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.LiNeBrEaKOn hand was Mary Griffith of Walnut Creek, the real-life mother played by Sigourney Weaver in the movie, and Josh Boneh, who was Aarons' partner. Spy Randy Alfred says that not only was popcorn provided but also tissues, in rainbow-colored packages.LiNeBrEaK-- Joan Baez, who has performed in Teatro ZinZanni, invited pals to help celebrate her 68th birthday there last Friday, and indeed, they made up about half the audience, reports spy Joe Brennan. This time, in the audience rather than the cast, Baez circulated amid the tables.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 16, 2009 Friday  Correction Appended  	Partnership formed to slash emissions;  Corporations, environmental groups team up to propose trading system, carbon dioxide limits 	Business; Pg. C1  	827 words  	FINAL EditionLiNeBrEaKAn alliance of environmental groups and big corporations concerned about global warming released a detailed plan on Thursday to slash America's greenhouse gas emissions, hoping to shape legislation that President-elect Barack Obama and Congress have promised to pursue.LiNeBrEaKThe United States Climate Action Partnership - whose members include PGandE Corp., oil giant BP and the Natural Resources Defense Council - called for setting hard limits on the amount of carbon dioxide produced each year by the American economy, with the limits declining steadily over time. Companies would buy and sell credits to emit specific amounts of the gas, essentially setting a price on carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaK"We share the view that the time is now, and time is of the essence," said PGandE Chief Executive Officer Peter Darbee. "We firmly believe that climate change can be addressed in ways that create more economic opportunity than economic risk. The key is setting clear targets and timetables and then allowing the power of the market to find the best solutions."LiNeBrEaKThe 2-year-old group had already suggested such a system, but never in great detail. The plan released Thursday delves into the complexities of setting up a carbon market, staking out positions on deeply controversial topics. LiNeBrEaKFor example, the plan proposes giving away many of the carbon credits for free when the market first opens, an idea criticized by Obama during the presidential campaign. The partnership also insists that both coal and nuclear power have a role in America's energy future, a position many environmentalists hate. Carbon dioxide from coal plants should be captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored underground, an idea that has been tested but remains uneconomical.LiNeBrEaK"It's critical to use coal in the future, but it's critical that we have the technologies that reduce the carbon from the use of coal," said James Rogers, chief executive officer of Duke Energy, an electric utility that relies on coal-fired plants. "This is not, as some people have suggested, shutting down coal."LiNeBrEaKThe group hopes that its ability to reach a consensus will become a model for Washington. Environmentalists and corporate CEOs spent a year hammering out the details of a plan they could all support. Obama and congressional Democrats say they want to create a cap-and-trade system as soon as possible, but many Republicans remain leery.LiNeBrEaK"This is a game-changer," said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit group focused on solving environmental problems. "Just as we have come together, it is time for both parties to come together, move forward and pass legislation now."LiNeBrEaKEurope already has a carbon cap-and-trade system, although its rollout has been plagued with problems. California has been working to create a cap-and-trade system with six Western states and four Canadian provinces. Ten Northeastern states are creating their own carbon market. LiNeBrEaKAmong the plan's other details:LiNeBrEaK-- Within 10 years of creating a cap-and-trade system, greenhouse gas emissions would be, at most, 10 percent lower than they are today. Within 15 years, they would be 10 percent to 30 percent lower than current levels, and by 2050, they would be 20 percent to 40 percent lower than today.LiNeBrEaK-- Companies would be allowed to use "offsets," projects that trap greenhouse gases or prevent them from being released into the atmosphere. One example: planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK-- By the end of the year, Congress should establish a national greenhouse gas registry to take precise measurements of the country's emissions. LiNeBrEaK-- Companies that are already trying to cut their emissions should get some kind of credit for acting early. LiNeBrEaKIn a sign of just how much the global-warming debate has changed, some of the plan's most pointed criticism on Thursday came from environmentalists. LiNeBrEaKThe Union of Concerned Scientists praised the partnership for coming this far but took issue with some of the plan's key details. The emission cuts aren't big enough, said Alden Meyer, the union's policy director. Giving away pollution credits when the market opens will reward polluters, and allowing too many offsets would give companies an excuse to avoid making real cuts in their emissions, Meyer said.LiNeBrEaK"This proposed cap-and-trade program is a starting point," he said, "but it must be strengthened significantly to ensure that it's effective."LiNeBrEaKAnd there remain people opposed to the entire concept. Myron Ebell, energy policy director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute think tank, says a carbon cap-and-trade system will inevitably raise energy prices. LiNeBrEaK"It's a sneaky tax," said Ebell, whose organization has long opposed what it calls global-warming alarmism. "The proponents of energy rationing - of forcing us to use less oil, coal and natural gas - know it's not politically feasible to suggest a tax."LiNeBrEaKFor more information LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKTo read the U.S. Climate Action Partnership's proposal, go to www.us-cap.org 		EMISSIONS (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (91%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (91%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); LEGISLATION (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (86%); POWER PLANTS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); LEGISLATORS (77%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (77%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (77%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); CARBON OFFSETS (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (70%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (67%); COAL INDUSTRY (64%); US PRESIDENTS (90%) BUSINESS; GLOBAL WARMING; ORGANIZATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; AIR POLLUTION; ENERGY; REGULATIONS  	PGandE CORP (85%); BP PLC (84%); DUKE ENERGY CORP (58%) PGandE Corp.; BP  	NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL (57%)  	BARACK OBAMA (94%); PETER A DARBEE (56%); JAMES E ROGERS (53%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  	David R.

By 2030, emissions would fall to 58 percent of 2005 levels, and by 2050, emissions would be 20 percent of 2005 levels. The story also incorrectly stated that the partnership wants Congress to create a national greenhouse gas registry by the end of this year. The partnership wants a greenhouse gas registry but has not set a target date for it.

The world is falling apart.LiNeBrEaKThe world is also a fantastic place to be.LiNeBrEaKWith its oceans, its beautiful fields of grass, its amazing mountains and sunsets.LiNeBrEaKOur delicious fruits and vegetables. LiNeBrEaKIt truly is a beautiful world.LiNeBrEaKSoon we'll have a new leader - hopefully it will change the world.LiNeBrEaKHope is an amazing thing - it got Barack Obama where he is today.LiNeBrEaKI remember him when I think of hope.LiNeBrEaKWith Peace and Hope - Sincerely,LiNeBrEaKAddy Gesteland (age 8)LiNeBrEaKTo: President-Elect ObamaLiNeBrEaKFrom: Grandpa's Taxi Service LiNeBrEaKSubject: request for financial assistanceLiNeBrEaKSince retiring, I have become known far and wide as Grandpa's Taxi Service (herein known as The Company.) Being a senior citizen on a fixed income, I have been forced to provide service with a somewhat elderly pickup truck. This not acceptable for the quality of passengers served, has very poor fuel economy, is not good for emissions of greenhouse gases and leaves a very ugly CARBON FOOTPRINT.LiNeBrEaKPlease note that as CEO of The Company I provide these special services for a salary of $0. 00 dollars per year. The Company provides no pension plan, no health care and no Golden Parachute. I therefore feel it would be proper to upgrade my fleet. After extensive research, I have determined that the best vehicle for the purpose would be a Cadillac CTS. This would be beneficial in several ways. It would provide the comfort my special passengers are Entitled to, would improve fuel economy, reduce dependence on foreign oil, improve greenhouse gas emissions, help the struggling automakers and greatly improve the CARBON FOOTPRINT.LiNeBrEaKWhile I feel it is totally unconscionable to beg for charity and then use other people's money for a "RETREAT" at an expensive luxury resort, it should be noted that the passengers believe that the proper route from school to home goes through BASKIN ROBBINS, therefore I have added an extra $20. 00 to request, Strictly in the interest of passenger satisfaction.LiNeBrEaKI believe the increased fuel economy will offset the rise in insurance premiums, so you may rest assured I will not be back for more.LiNeBrEaKI therefore respectfully request a BAILOUT in the amount of $93,237. 19.LiNeBrEaKAnxiously waiting;LiNeBrEaKGary MechamLiNeBrEaKWoods Cross, UtahLiNeBrEaKSubject: Too little, too lateLiNeBrEaKAfter losing my job in September, I received a decent severance check. This payment increased our 2008 income quite a bit. Of course, this also increases our taxes. Even though this income is supposed to get us by for several months into 2009, we still have to pay taxes on it on our 2008 return. We usually get a refund each year, but now it looks like we will have to pay this year. I still have not found a job. It's great that we may be receiving some money back later in the year, but how do we come up with the cash to pay what is going to be due when we file our taxes right now? This money due will decrease the monies that we have set aside to keep us going until I am eligible for unemployment. How do we get by then? Do we pull money from our retirement accounts to get us by? Do we use our credit card and dig ourselves deeper into debt? Sure, to most, this is not a lot of money, but to someone who is unemployed, it is a great amount - it has to last until a new job comes along, which may be quite a while. I fear that help will not come soon enough for us - how many more people out there are in the same position, but with less than we have?LiNeBrEaKSandra TomlinsonLiNeBrEaKDear President Obama,LiNeBrEaKThe USA and the world economy is now in deep deep trouble for the time being. As such, it is very nice to see that you seem to be in the top of the issue, beside all the important task of transition. However, please remember, with todays' globalization, magnitude of problem need different approach, and this time around, this seemingly US-triggered economic problem will need your leadership of different paradigm. i.e. it needs World Wide Effort, all the countries in the world, to make a difference!!!!LiNeBrEaKThis world is interdependent world, you have to think, "What does it take to turn around the world economy?"LiNeBrEaKI believe with your talent, leadership, humanity, humility, if you take a world wide leading effort to turn around the economy, it will be a lot easier and it can be done, today's crisis, it's confidence crisis, its contracting in a unprecedented scale, and it will need all the leaders of the top 50 economies to generate an entirely different approach to make a different!LiNeBrEaKThat is the legacy awaiting you, it will not be easy, but Yes we can! Barrack H. Obama, you are destined to call a world wide effort to tackle this economic problem of such a scale and put down your self ego, get Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, George Bush Sr, Jimmy Carter, get the diplomats going, get the world to work together to get a overwhelming responce and then, the whole world will resolve this problem and crisis, together, yes, We can!LiNeBrEaKPlease, please do not solve this problem of USA alone as a nation, this is now a world wide problem, crisis of different dimension! You must think out of box, think out of the nation's border, "What does it take to fix the world economy? " let's sit down with the world leaders, and get the task moving, Yes, We can.LiNeBrEaKThanks and regards,LiNeBrEaKRonnieLiNeBrEaKMr. President Elect Obama,LiNeBrEaKTough times require sacrifices. Just as you and many of us are appalled at the excesses of the Financial, Corporate and Public Sector executives, I cannot believe the costs and the risks of this train trip are at all appropriate even for the President of the United States at this time in our Nation's History.LiNeBrEaKPlease set the correct tone for fiscal responsibility and common sense, for the beginning of your presidency. I view this trip no different than the AIG "Seminars"!LiNeBrEaKI read the Audacity of Hope a year ago. I voted for you because of it. This trip could be viewed as the Audacity of Stupidity.LiNeBrEaKPlease reconsider this reckless and costly self indulging "PERK".LiNeBrEaKRichard R.LiNeBrEaKMr President,LiNeBrEaKWe build the Panama Canal and keep it running with dredging crews, so why don't we spend more time with preventive measures such as dredging so that when heavy rains and snow show up, our infrastructure won't be waterlogged, what to do with the dredged material is use it as fill in, and recycle all the usable things found bikes tires etc., seems simple but why have I heard of no one doing this my any areas that are constantly flooded ?LiNeBrEaKDear Mr. President-Elect,LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the most troubling things we have seen in the past sixteen years is the rapid expansion of presidential powers. One of the changes we desperately need is for this power to be rolled back to the levels outlined in the Constitution. Though it would be tempting to keep these policies in place to aid in the implementation of your agenda, we need to look at the effect this will have on future Presidents. Let us learn from the past, too much power in the hands of a corrupt individual can be devastating for a nation.LiNeBrEaKTwo qualities more than anything else will be required to accomplish the rollback of presidential power: humility and leadership. The founding fathers understood the importance of the system of checks and balances, it will require much humility to admit to yourself that preservation of the overall system is more important than implementation of any particular policy you wish to be in place. This expansion of powers would not have been possible if congress had not allowed their power to be usurped by the past Presidents. The fact that this power was relinquished willingly means you will need to convince the legislative branch to take back the authority and responsibility they have given away.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama, please exercise the humility and leadership that will be required to take the United States of America into the future within the bounds set forth in the Constitution.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKNick DuclosLiNeBrEaKDear President Obama,LiNeBrEaKI want you to know how much I admire and respect you. I feel confident for the first time in many many years that our country is in good hands. I trust you to help us get back on a rational and stable course, both financially and politically.LiNeBrEaKThe state of Utah is $1 billion dollars in the red because of tax shortfall. If the federal government could give this state the money it needs to recover from this shortfall, we would be able to save thousands of jobs. People would be able to keep their houses. They would be able to spend money from which the state could collect taxes and the federal government would collect substantially more income tax. In addition, there would be less drain on state money because fewer people would be on unemployment and welfare. I teach at a university. I have been there for over 25 years. Now we are hearing that hundreds of jobs will be cut this year. Our neighbor university is cutting 660 jobs. This type of cutting is going to spiral us down into a crisis of enormous severity which will take the government years and years to recover from.LiNeBrEaKIf we could have the money to balance our budget we could go on and the economy would start to recover. I believe the people of this state are willing to go the extra mile and pitch in to help out. If we have hope we can volunteer to work on projects without pay to repay the loan or grant from the federal government. The people of this state are industrious, civic minded people who are willing to work very hard to save the economy of this state and help the nation. We are proud to be American. All we need is hope through financial help, and knowing what we can do. We can organize ourselves if we just know what needs to be done or what can be done. LiNeBrEaKI am very appreciative of this opportunity to write you. May God bless you and keep you and your family happy and healthy.LiNeBrEaKWith respect,LiNeBrEaKGiana CurtisLiNeBrEaKDear President Obama,LiNeBrEaKI am writing to ask that your administration take a strong position against Israel's violation of human rights in Gaza. Through its blockade and shelling of civilian areas, Israel is collectively punishing the Palestinian people for the military tactics of Hamas. Please work to find a diplomatic solution to the fighting in the Middle East - there is no military solution that will lead to peace there.LiNeBrEaKThe other concern I have is that major corporations in the United States are treating the U.S. Treasury as their personal ATM machine. Please use any bailout grants and loans to ensure long-term economic development in the best interest of our country, including preservation of heavy manufacturing ability, construction of 21st century clean transportation networks, solar and wind power, and equal educational opportunity for all regardless of their social and economic class.LiNeBrEaKThank you for your consideration of these ideas.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKRachel WhiteLiNeBrEaKSalt Lake CityLiNeBrEaKDear Mr. PresidentLiNeBrEaKBernard DeVoto once wrote that public lands policy is one of the few areas where our government can make an irretrievable mistake, one that cannot be corrected later on. Please do everything in your power to save our dwindling wildlands from degradation. Once lost, they are gone for generations, if not forever.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush, catering to the "drill baby drill" crowd, made oil and gas leasing the top priority for the Bureau of Land Management. This was yet another example of his malfeasance, part of the worst presidency in our history. These leases cannot be undone, but immediate action is needed to reverse direction. The first step should be to order a moratorium on further leasing until land management plans can be rewritten to place roadless areas off limits. This will not affect the nation's oil supply because of the enormous backlog of undrilled leases. Also, require the BLM to place no-surface-occupancy stipulations on all drilling permits for leases in environmentally sensitive areas.LiNeBrEaKLast month, Tim DeChristopher courageously took nonviolent direct action to save some of Utah's wilderness-quality BLM lands from the Bush administration's final, and most disastrous, oil and gas auction. Mr. DeChristopher did the right thing, while our government was abusing its power to do the wrong thing. If he is charged with a crime, please issue an immediate presidential pardon. Thank you.LiNeBrEaKLike most Americans, I am very grateful that we finally have a new President and a new Congress dedicated to restoring peace and prosperity in America and the world. I wish you luck, and if you need help just ask. We'll be there for you.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKRichard M. WarnickLiNeBrEaKDraper, UtahLiNeBrEaKI am only one of thousands that depend on our SSDI's. It hurts when a office of the government treats you like a plague.LiNeBrEaKI got my SSDI dropped because of selling a house in 2007. The house wasn't even mine but my guardian's. When she passed away I had to sell the house for her children. Most of the money went to pay off the mortgage. The money it left was divided between her two girls but Social Security in California would not listen to my reason. Why can't the government give us a break?LiNeBrEaKDaisy JonesLiNeBrEaKMr. President. . .LiNeBrEaKI am one of your loyal supporters. And I ask now for your help. Here in Utah, we have a man serving a 55-year sentence for selling a not large amount of marijuana. If ever there were an unjust sentence, this is one.LiNeBrEaKUnderstanding the enormous pressures of your position, I still must beg you to help this man. You are the only one who can. His name is Weldon Angelos.LiNeBrEaKGod bless you Mr. President.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKKeith Colledge, SLC, UT.LiNeBrEaKDear Mr. President,LiNeBrEaKIn the movie "Forrest Gump," one of the most memorable lines was, "I'm not a smart man." As it turned out he was a very smart man. He surrounded himself with smart people, he watched over and cared for the people in his life and he made a huge difference in the world. I realize this movie is Hollywood at its best and yet if we examine the movie, much can be learned.LiNeBrEaKMy husband is among the 16% of Americans who have lost their jobs. He is a trainer, has trained in many countries, and yet he lost his job. Why? If companies aren't growing, they aren't hiring, thus no need for a trainer. Lane is extremely wise, he has an amazing intellect. In the evening after searching for a job he will spend hours on the computer filling out applications all over the world. We need to find him a job. Putting the economy back into Americans' hands is critical. I realize you have many projects, so if along the way you need someone with an amazing intellect, please consider my husband.LiNeBrEaKBlessings,LiNeBrEaKCindy WinwardLiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City, UtahLiNeBrEaKDear Mr. President-elect:LiNeBrEaKTo simply say "congratulations" is almost inane, however, if that is how literally changing history; reversing the old "it can't be done" mind-set, and developing a workable system (perhaps in the first time of the U.S. history) is defined, so be it.LiNeBrEaKBest wishes for the times ahead,LiNeBrEaKGeorge Novak - voter.LiNeBrEaKDear Mr. President,LiNeBrEaKArticle 2, Section 1 of the Constitution that you are going to swear and oath the support and defend says that "only a natural-born citizen" may be President. I urge you to come clean about your birth status. You say you were born in Hawaii but your grandmother says you were born in Kenya to a Kenyan father and an underage mother. Why have you hired three law firms to conceal your college records? Why won't you provide a valid birth certificate? Why do your Indonesian school records show your name as Barry Soetoro? How were you able to travel to Pakistan in 1981 when it was illegal at the time for American citizens to travel there?LiNeBrEaKHow were you able to enroll in school in Indonesia when only Indonesian citizens are allowed to go to school there? If you won't even follow this simple portion of the Constitution now then what is there to make the American people believe that you will abide by the oath of office you will be taking? It is my belief sir that you do not meet the "natural-born" requirement and that is why you are doing everything in your power to conceal that fact and unfortunately you appear to be a fraud. Please step down or show the proof that you indeed meet the requirement of being "natural born" as required by the Constitution of which you are supposed to be committed to uphold.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKJJ SurpriseLiNeBrEaKSandy, UtahLiNeBrEaKDear Mr. PresidentLiNeBrEaKFirst off, Congratulations to our new President. You have my 100% support. Take your time on many new and important issues and America will once again prosper and be respected in the world. I am retired after 21 years in the US Army and teaching JROTC at East High School for 21 years. Not bad for an immigrant that came to Utah at age 21 from Germany. I have a recommendation for a stimulus for Seniors.LiNeBrEaKAllow us to withdraw $ 10,000. 00 from our IRA, my wife's and mine, with a 10% tax . That would cost me $ 1000. 00, but do not tax that amount with my annual tax statement. Our combined income is about $ 53,000. 00, withdrawing $ 10,000. 00 would cost me an additional $2,500. 00 to $ 3,000. 00. Allowing this stimulus would not cost the government much, but give seniors a break and they could make needed purchases or pay bills.LiNeBrEaKSecond, when giving large amounts of our taxpayer money to bail out companies , put a restriction on its use that would restrict CEOs using that money for their large pay and bonuses. After all, these managers have mismanaged their company and are partially at fault for the trouble the economy is in.LiNeBrEaKAgain, I give you my support and thank you for the unbelievable job you have ahead of you. May god give you the strength and courage to do what is ahead of us.LiNeBrEaKSincerelyLiNeBrEaKHenry L. Vogel.LiNeBrEaKDear Mr. President:LiNeBrEaKIt would help the Seniors If we would eliminate or reduce the taxing of Social Security, State and Federal retirement income for retired persons 65 or older or at certain income levels.LiNeBrEaKSincerelyLiNeBrEaKL E. Staley/ DJ StaleyLiNeBrEaKDear President Obama -LiNeBrEaKWhy not mandate that all ARM mortgages revert to their teaser rates?

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Winds have changed at ports  	OPINION  	546 words  	Hard numbers are replacing good intentions and hopeful optimism. The facts are in, and the results are clear: The air downwind of Long Beach and Los Angeles is safer to breathe. LiNeBrEaKA study released this week shows declines in five of eight categories of pollutants from activity at the Port of Long Beach. The Port of L.A. reported similar improvements in December. The air quality is getting better, and it looks like the next batch of numbers should be even better.LiNeBrEaKHere's the most important result: Diesel emissions are down 21 percent. These are the nasty by-products of diesel-powered ships, trucks, trains and equipment responsible for higher rates of cancer, heart disease and asthma in neighborhoods near the ports.LiNeBrEaKHere's another: Sulfur oxides are down even more sharply: 36 percent. These are the pollutants that, when combined with the natural moisture of our lungs, turn into sulfuric acid. Sulfate particulates also are not good for the lungs.LiNeBrEaKThe efforts of the two ports have made a huge difference. For example, the dirtiest trucks on the road, those built in 1988 or before, no longer are allowed at the Port of Long Beach, and the L.A. port has less effective but similar restrictions. Bob Kanter, director of environmental planning at the Long Beach port, says the main reasons for success with the reductions of sulfur have been the slowing of ship 20 miles of port, and the use of low-sulfur fuel.LiNeBrEaKThe Long Beach port paid $1 million in incentives to encourage the slower ship speeds, but the use of low-sulfur fuels makes a different point. Federal regulations mandated cutting sulfur in diesel fuel from 500 parts per million to 15 parts, and state regulations adopted the same rules for ships, although the state's efforts got overruled by a federal judge. (Many shippers have continued to use low-sulfur fuel thanks to port financial incentives.)LiNeBrEaKThe lesson is that the ports alone can make a huge difference in cleaning up pollution, but it takes federal and state regulation to do the complete job. The two ports are the biggest single source of diesel pollution in Southern California, but overall, they are responsible for just 20 percent of it. There are thousands more trucks, buses and trains to clean up.LiNeBrEaKTwo categories of emissions have increased. Nitrogen oxides, an ingredient of smog, rose slightly, from 16,720 tons to 16,923 tons, and carbon dioxide has gone up 7 percent. Carbon dioxide isn't toxic (we mammals exhale it with every breath and trees depend on it) but it is an ingredient in the atmospheric canopy related to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThere is a related issue. Shipping volume has declined recently along with the general economy, and some economists speculate that because of long-term changes in consumer behavior and increased competition from other ports, some of that business may not come back. This might lessen future problems, but it doesn't change the fact that the poisonous by-products of transporting goods must be cleaned up locally. The ports deserve credit for taking this on.LiNeBrEaKBut the statewide, national and global challenges remain, and will take not just the continually sidetracked efforts of state agencies, but a change of attitude by the federal government. For those solutions, we should look to the new administration.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	CLIMATE THE LOSER IN TUNNEL CHOICE  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A13  	598 words  	We believe Gov. Chris Gregoire, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels and King County Executive Sims made the wrong choice in selecting the deep-bore tunnel to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct.LiNeBrEaKOur commitment to real climate solutions is the loser in this decision.LiNeBrEaKYou don't have to be a climate change expert to understand the role transportation investments play in shaping travel habits, energy consumption and growth patterns. We had an opportunity to press forward with a package of new transit, street improvements and a better Interstate 5 that would have met our future transportation needs. LiNeBrEaKThe Surface/Transit/I-5 solution, vetted in the recent planning process, tested beautifully in the computer models. Modeling showed that we already have plenty of pavement if we use it more efficiently. This solution represents an approach that has proven effective repeatedly in other cities: London, San Francisco, Seoul, Paris, Copenhagen, New York, Vancouver.LiNeBrEaKReorienting priorities around transit, compact growth, street connectivity, and providing people real alternatives to driving works for urban mobility, freight mobility and economic development. Spending $2 billion or more on tailpipe capacity with deep-bore tunnel - the most expensive option - is not a step toward a better future.LiNeBrEaKThe tunnel being planned by the state will be the largest diameter bored tunnel in the world. With only 1 percent of the design work complete and the funding plan unfinished, there are many unanswered questions about its feasibility. Details on the full cost, constructability, schedule and funding will likely swipe the bloom right off the rose. We anticipate another chance to reevaluate its cost/benefit in the near future.LiNeBrEaKAs Washington State Department of Transportation is figuring that out, where do the rest of us go from here?LiNeBrEaK- The viaduct is unsafe, and the promise to close and remove it in 2012 should be kept. The citizens of Seattle are bearing the risk, and the city should hold the governor accountable to this commitment.LiNeBrEaK- With the separation of project responsibilities, the city and county are now free to pursue the smart investments that actually will increase our local alternatives to driving: new transit, a First Avenue streetcar, a parking tax, transit incentives, as well as local street improvements. These projects are the critical path to closure of the viaduct in 2012. Elected leaders should finalize the funding plan and propose the new taxes immediately, and we should all work together to get these under way.LiNeBrEaK- With the state ceding authority for the waterfront back to Seattle, we can get started now envisioning the best use of this valuable public land. The opportunity to create a civic heart for our city - with parks, event spaces, a four lane urban street and active edges integrated into a functional shore ecology - is safely back in our collective (local) hands.LiNeBrEaK- It's time to embrace tolling - it's the best strategy available to reduce congestion and maximize the efficiency of our existing roads and highways. Tolls can also be an important revenue source to address our region's backlog of maintenance needs and to provide additional transit service.LiNeBrEaKOur elected officials missed an opportunity to make a cost-effective decision to move us toward a lower carbon and economically resilient future. There are still many decisions to be made, and future generations are counting on us to act boldly for the long-term health of the region.LiNeBrEaKCary Moon is director of the People's Waterfront Coalition. Mike O'Brien is chair of the Cascade Chapter of the Sierra Club.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 16, 2009 Friday   SECOND EDITION	LETTERS FROM READERS YOUR VIEWS  	EDITORIAL; Pg. C8  	1454 words  	Let Legislature figure out how to pay for new plantsLiNeBrEaKThe editorial "Short circuit" (Jan. 11), regarding proposed legislation that would allow Missouri utilities an alternative way to finance power plant construction, was shortsighted. It nitpicked on technicalities and overlooked the real issues.LiNeBrEaKThe paper might be right that the bill's sponsor overreached in calling his bill a "job creation tool." Building a nuclear plant in Callaway County will produce the same number of jobs whether it is financed by Ameren's shareholders or by its customers.LiNeBrEaKBut the editorial's snarky approach to the legislative proposal ignored current realities. Because of Environmental Protection Agency regulations, America has not built a coal-fired plant in 20 years. Coal is under increasing pressure as a fuel for electric power because of global warming and because of accidents such as the one in Kingston, Tenn., several weeks ago. We may be at the point at which we either build a new nuclear plant or risk limited distribution of electricity in the future. LiNeBrEaKIn theory, the shareholders of Ameren could borrow the money and build a new nuclear power plant. But from whom would they borrow the money? With the collapse of the credit markets, it may be unrealistic to think that Ameren can just shop for a loan to build a nuclear plant. LiNeBrEaKIf we need a new plant to provide us with electricity in the future, and a utility can't borrow the money to build it, what should we do? I don't look forward to reading the Post-Dispatch in the dark. Personally, I'd be willing to pay a little extra on my bill each month rather than risk not having enough electricity for my family in the years ahead.LiNeBrEaKHow big is that risk? I'm not sure; it is a matter to investigate and debate. And where better than in a legislative arena? With all due respect to the Public Service Commission, it can't change the law it enforces. That's the Legislature's job. I'm not afraid to see our legislators revisit standards established in the 1970s. Let's keep the lights on.LiNeBrEaKJames F. Dowd III | Webster GrovesLiNeBrEaKOther heroesLiNeBrEaKThe Post-Dispatch unveiled John F. McDonnell as the Citizen of the Year in the story "Leaving corporate life, not the community" (Jan. 11). The winner was selected by a group of former winners. There is no question that Mr. McDonnell has earned his place among them.LiNeBrEaKThe paper's Talk of the Day blog ran an informal survey for readers to vote on their nominees for "St. Louis-area person of the year." More than 7,000 votes were cast, yet no mention was made in the print version of the paper. The majority of the votes went to Ryan Hummert, the firefighter killed in Maplewood, and to Randy Grim of Stray Rescue. Both men were cited as heroes by voters. In true hero fashion, Mr. Grim tipped his hat to Mr. Hummert, who made the ultimate sacrifice when he was killed in the line of duty.LiNeBrEaKHomage should have been paid to the efforts of both Mr. Hummert and Mr. Grim and attention brought to the number of votes each man received from what was not a select committee but the citizenry at large.LiNeBrEaKRachelle L'Ecuyer | Maplewood Maplewood Community Development DirectorLiNeBrEaKWaiting to see Obama's Middle East policyLiNeBrEaKFor Palestinians, it is a struggle for survival. For Israelis, it is an undertaking to break Hamas's back. But the battle in Gaza is of no less significance to the United States. What is at stake is the America's ability to reclaim its sovereignty in making foreign policy decisions based on its values and self-interests, including mending its strained relations with the Arab and Muslim worlds.LiNeBrEaKWhile the current administration lacked the will to alter the dynamics that produced the current conflict, the upcoming administration is determined to get engaged. President-elect Barack Obama kept his cards close to his chest while the onslaught in Gaza went on. If he delivers a fair resolution to the crisis, Arabs and Muslims will pardon his cautions posture while hundreds lost their lives under Israeli fire. If, on the other hand, he maintains the "Israel is our strongest ally" policy, then all bets are off.LiNeBrEaKRami Saffarini | Platte City, Mo.LiNeBrEaKCost of a wage hikeLiNeBrEaKWell, you just knew it was going to happen. The people who convinced voters to raise the minimum wage to unheard-of levels have reaped what they sowed. In her column "Minimum-wage jobs outsourced to Mexico" (Jan. 9), Susan Weich explained that 78 full-time jobs and 150 piece workers are history because the rising minimum wage has forced the owner of a factory to move the jobs to Mexico.LiNeBrEaKNo longer will these Missouri workers have a wage, health care and a 401(k), which the employer provided. Now they have unemployment benefits for 26 weeks. We were told this was going to be the result if this law passed, and it has come to pass. I hope the people who supported this law are satisfied.LiNeBrEaKI suspect that this is just the beginning. They got their higher minimum wage, and now they get the unemployment that goes right along with unconscionable increases in that wage. Did these workers benefit from the rise in the minimum wage? You make the call.LiNeBrEaKMarc Schoenfeld | ChesterfieldLiNeBrEaKWho's next in line?LiNeBrEaKWho are we trying to bail out with billions of tax dollars? The theory is that the federal government gives money to business, and business allows us to keep our jobs and keep paying for our houses and cars. Banks and credit card companies will relax their death grips, and we'll all breathe more easier at the cash register.LiNeBrEaKSounds a lot like the discredited "trickle down" economic theory, wherein "what's good for business is good for the consumer." We gave tax breaks and incentives to bankers and CEOs with the idea that the benefits would trickle down to ordinary mortgage-paying, car-buying, grocery-shopping Americans. Instead, corporate profits went up, CEOs got huge bonuses and more dividends were declared for people wealthy enough to own stock.LiNeBrEaKI don't foresee any trickle-down effect happening with the bailout either. Bankers and executives will get the bailouts, businesses will hold onto the cash to ease their liquidity and credit issues, and the job cuts, wage freezes and "cost containments" will continue.LiNeBrEaKThe business community is about profits and growth, not about beneficence toward consumers or employees. From a business perspective, passing the government's largesse down to ordinary workers is counterproductive, not in the best interests of the business.LiNeBrEaKI'm tired of "fixes" for which I get to pay taxes but from which I never see any benefit. Who are we bailing out next? How many governors now have their hands out? How many mayors? What other industry will my taxes rescue?LiNeBrEaKJ. L. Hickman | Fairview HeightsLiNeBrEaKBail out inmates, tooLiNeBrEaKMisosuri's inmates could use some of the bailout money. If we got a bailout, Missouri could let go of some 11,000 employees and save $650 million a year. (I don't know what the Department of Corrections spends that money on, but it's not food. The food is awful. And the medical care is almost nonexistent.)LiNeBrEaKThere are too many young men here, taking up space. They will have a tough time getting and keeping jobs. The courts should have an alternative plan.LiNeBrEaKBut maybe we are too small to save, not like the big banks that were "too big to fail."LiNeBrEaKJames "Tony" Shivers | Bowling Green, Mo.LiNeBrEaKThe untouchablesLiNeBrEaKThe rush by the Democratic Party and the media to immediately and off-handedly exonerate Timothy Geithner, President-elect Barack Obama's nomination for Treasury secretary, for his tax evasions is incredible, in the literal sense of the word, and astoundingly offensive to the sensibilities of the average American.LiNeBrEaKThis purportedly is a man of immense financial intellect. Are we to believe that he "honestly" made these mistakes - not once but over the course of several years? If he can make mistakes of such a simple nature regarding basic tax policy, can he even remotely be qualified to be our Treasury secretary, called upon to make policy decisions of enormous complexity, especially given the current economic crisis? The answer has to be a resounding "no." You simply can't have it both ways. The reality is that if Timothy Geithner were a Republican, nominated by a Republican president, the Democrats and the media would go nuts - and rightly so. But, because he is Mr. Obama's man, he appears untouchable.LiNeBrEaKMike Macauley | BallwinLiNeBrEaKThat's politicsLiNeBrEaKA recent letter claimed that Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is no Caroline Kennedy, who is seeking an appointment to the U.S. Senate from the New York governor. The letter writer was correct.LiNeBrEaKMs. Palin has been elected to public offic three times by a majority of her constituents; Caroline Kennedy hasn't seen fit to even vote about half of the time.LiNeBrEaKKerry Recker | South St. Louis County		POWER PLANTS (92%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (92%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (91%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); POWER and COMMUNICATION SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); LEGISLATORS (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (78%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (78%); JOB CREATION (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (77%); INVESTIGATIONS (77%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (77%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (76%); SHAREHOLDERS (75%); CIVIL SERVICES (75%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (74%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (74%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); BLOGS and MESSAGE BOARDS (64%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (58%) {DOC SEPARATOR}  	AMEREN CORP (92%)  			SAINT LOUIS, MO, USA (58%) MISSOURI, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  		LETTER  	Newspaper  	2009 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Nation and World briefing  	NATIONAL  	791 words  	WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Friday blocked a bill that would have delayed until June 12 the nationwide shutdown of analog TV signals, but Democrats vowed to bring the measure back for a vote next week. President-elect Barack Obama urged lawmakers to postpone the Feb. 17 transition amid mounting concerns that too many Americans who rely on analog TV sets to pick up broadcast channels won't be ready. But some Senate Republicans fear a delay would confuse people and burden public safety agencies waiting for wireless spectrum that will be freed up by the switchover. The opponents also said a delay would be costly for television broadcasters that have spent several years preparing for the analog shutoff. 2008 is eighth warmest yearLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Last year was the eighth warmest year on record, according to the National Climatic Data Center. The world's temperature in 2008 tied that of 2001, according to the center, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Preliminary calculations show the world's average temperature for 2008 was 0. 88 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57 degrees. The ranking means all of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1997.Kellogg recalls 16 products LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Kellogg Co. is recalling 16 products containing peanut butter, citing possible salmonella contamination. President and CEO David Mackay announced the voluntary recall late Friday. He said it is needed as part of its commitment to keep consumers safe. The recall includes Austin and Keebler branded Peanut Butter Sandwich Crackers, as well as snack-size packs of Famous Amos Peanut Butter Cookies and Keebler Soft Batch Homestyle Peanut Butter Cookies. It comes after federal officials confirmed salmonella contamination at a Georgia facility that ships peanut products to 85 food companies. Three arrested in church fireLiNeBrEaKSPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Three white men were arrested Friday in connection with the torching of a predominantly black church hours after Barack Obama won the presidential election. The Nov. 5 fire destroyed the Macedonia Church of God in Christ, which was under construction. The suspects, Benjamin Haskell, 23, Michael Jacques, 24, and Thomas Gleason, 21, were expected to be arraigned in federal court in Springfield later Friday. The men were charged with violating a civil rights conspiracy statute that makes it illegal to injure, threaten or intimidate anyone from exercising their civil rights. It wasn't immediately clear whether the men were being charged with setting the fire.Violent protests hit LithuaniaLiNeBrEaKVILNIUS, Lithuania -- Violent political protests sweeping parts of Eastern Europe spread Friday to Lithuania, where police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at a rock-throwing mob attacking Parliament. Fifteen people were injured and more than 80 detained in several hours of street fighting between angry protesters and helmeted riot police. The violence followed similar riots this week in Bulgaria and Latvia amid a wave of discontent over economic woes, difficult reforms and government corruption. Putin: EU sides with UkraineLiNeBrEaKBERLIN -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin accused the European Union on Friday of siding with Ukraine in the highly charged dispute that has kept Russian natural gas from reaching Europe for 10 days. The forceful Russian prime minister said that by apportioning equal blame for the energy crisis between Moscow and Kiev, the EU was supporting Ukraine's energy blackmail of Russia. He insisted that Russia would no longer tolerate Ukraine's blocking Russian gas from reaching Europe by not moving the gas over Ukraine's pipelines. Putin also said European energy companies and Russia are close to creating a consortium that would finance the purchase of the so-called "technical gas" that Ukraine needs to pump Russian gas supplies west to Europe over its vast pipeline network.Cholera death toll hits 2,225LiNeBrEaKHARARE, Zimbabwe -- The death toll from a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe rose to 2,225 Friday, and the head of the U.N. children's agency toured a hospital where weakened victims of the waterborne disease were receiving international help. UNICEF Executive Director Ann Veneman, on a three-day visit to the southern African nation, also met Friday with President Robert Mugabe. No details of their meeting were released, but it came the same day the United Nations urged Zimbabwe to speed up the delivery of humanitarian supplies. The United Nations said 42,675 people are infected and 1,550 new cases are reported every day. The U.N. also said a lack of clean water and proper hygiene was causing re-infection after treatment, and added there was an "urgent need" for funds to pay Zimbabwean health workers.LiNeBrEaK-- Associated Press 		PRODUCT RECALLS (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); FOOD INDUSTRY (89%); CIVIL RIGHTS (89%); PROTESTS and DEMONSTRATIONS (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (89%); RIOTS (86%); ARSON (85%); ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (78%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (78%); LEGISLATORS (78%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (78%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (73%); FOOD and BEVERAGE (72%); SNACK FOODS (71%); MEN (70%); BACTERIA (70%); CLIMATOLOGY (68%); RELIGION (67%); ARRESTS (67%); BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS (65%); FIRES (62%); BROADCASTING INDUSTRY (58%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (58%); US PRESIDENTS (77%)  	KELLOGG CO (83%)  	NATIONAL OCEANIC and ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (84%); DAVID MACKAY (54%)  	MINNESOTA, USA (79%); MASSACHUSETTS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%); LITHUANIA (94%); MACEDONIA (79%); EUROPE (73%); LATVIA (65%); EASTERN EUROPE (52%); BULGARIA (50%)  	January 21, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved  	Pioneer Press  		K (NYSE) (83%)  	NAICS311412 FROZEN SPECIALTY FOOD MANUFACTURING (83%); NAICS311230 BREAKFAST CEREAL MANUFACTURING (83%); SIC2043 CEREAL BREAKFAST FOODS (83%); SIC2038 FROZEN SPECIALTIES, NEC (83%)  												
Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Big Stone II coal plant gets PUC's approval: But after a four-year battle and with limits placed on the $1. 3 billion plant in South Dakota, the decision leaves no one happy.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	546 words  	Jan. 16--One hundred eleven miles of power lines -- the core of a contentious, four-year battle over coal power -- were cleared for construction Thursday by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, after an all-day meeting to a packed house. The 5-0 decision dropped the last regulatory obstacle to construction of Big Stone II, a coal-fired power plant that would sit just across the border near Milbank, S.D., but needs those lines to carry nearly half its generated electricity to Minnesota customers. LiNeBrEaKFive environmental groups indicated a likely court appeal on the same grounds they have used for years fighting the plant: that coal is a major source of climate-changing carbon emissions, and that this plant violates recent state statutes giving preference to conservation and renewable energy to meet future power needs.LiNeBrEaK"Minnesota has just been condemned to an additional 4 million tons of carbon dioxide a year," said Beth Goodpaster, attorney for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, which has argued against approvals.LiNeBrEaKBut the five regional utilities collectively seeking the $1. 3 billion plant were also unhappy, because of conditions the commissioners imposed along with their approval. In response to criticism that the utilities lowballed their expected expenses -- to compare favorably to other energy alternatives -- the commission took the unusual step of specifying dollar caps on the plant's construction costs and any future costs of carbon regulation, such as a tax or a cap-and-trade system. Anything above those caps could not be charged to ratepayers; instead, shareholders would have to bear them.LiNeBrEaK"While we appreciate that they saw the need for the lines, we have to decide if those are conditions we can live with," said Dan Sharp, spokesman for the Big Stone II utilities.LiNeBrEaKFergus Falls-based Otter Tail Power, the lead utility, was also directed to close an existing coal plant, Hoot Lake, with its 145 megawatts of generation, by 2018. Otter Tail has a 20 percent stake in the 500-to-580-megawatt Big Stone II, which would come online in 2015.LiNeBrEaKThe commission's unanimous approval Thursday was a shift from divided opinions expressed in a meeting last June. Then it appeared they were headed for a 2-2 call, with newcomer Dennis O'Brien the swing vote, so the commission asked for one more, independent cost analysis of the project. That report, delivered in October by East Coast-based Boston Pacific Co., concluded that most of the utilities' cost calculations were low, understating future expenses. It was that conclusion, several commissioners said on Thursday, that convinced them of the need to take steps to "manage" cost risks with the caps. The commissioners also praised emissions controls planned for Big Stone II, which would deliver substantial reductions in sulfur dioxide and mercury.LiNeBrEaKH.J.

Believe."LiNeBrEaKOver the past year, the 47-year-old Tampa resident logged more than 50,000 miles in his green recreational vehicle and has hiked, biked and paddled in every one of the Lower 48 states. This weekend he will have his Wonder machine at the Florida RV Supershow at the Florida State Fairgrounds.LiNeBrEaK"I wanted to do more than just recycle old newspapers and tin cans," said Brawdy, a former police officer from upstate New York. "So I decided to do what I can to get more people outdoors. I believe that the more people we have who go out and enjoy nature, the more people will want to protect it." LiNeBrEaKBrawdy began his journey more than 20 years ago, after his father's suicide.LiNeBrEaK"I had a hard time dealing with my father's death," he said. "The only solace I could find was when I was by myself out in the middle of nowhere."LiNeBrEaKThe road warriorLiNeBrEaKSo Brawdy quit his job and traveled the country, eventually ending up in Colorado, where he worked as a meditation instructor, helping people focus through this timeless Eastern discipline.LiNeBrEaK"I discovered pretty quickly that the mind was a powerful thing," he said. That led to a similar post in Chicago, where he picked up a part-time position at an outdoors outfitter.LiNeBrEaK"I wanted to go camping," he said.LiNeBrEaKThen, in 2000, a local TV station called the shop looking for a survival expert. "I showed them how to build an igloo," he said. "That was the beginning of my television career."LiNeBrEaKIn the years that followed, Brawdy eventually became a traveling outdoors survival expert, filming more than 1,500 segments, including appearances on Good Morning America and the Today Show.LiNeBrEaKThe eco-RVLiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Brawdy found himself in Tampa, recovering from surgery to remove skin cancer (the byproduct of a lifetime outdoors). Global warming was a hot topic on the news shows, but Brawdy knew there was an alternative to traditional fuels. So he decided to develop a mobile base camp, partially powered by non-petroleum-based energy sources.LiNeBrEaK"Just look around you," he said as he stood in front of his RV on Gandy Beach. "We have the sun, wind and rain. Why not use it?"LiNeBrEaKHe started from the wheels up. A 2008 Lance Camper is the control center of his operation. It sits atop a Ford F-350 Super Duty 4x4 (power stroke V8 turbo engine uses Ford's clean diesel technology). The camper, tough and spacious, allows him to rough it without really roughing it. "It's got a queen-sized bed," he confessed. "But it allows me to go off road and off grid."LiNeBrEaKSun and windLiNeBrEaKWith a 60-gallon fuel tank filled with biodiesel, Brawdy can get to remote places, where he harnesses the energies of the wind, sun and rain. His 12-volt/200-watt AirBreeze Wind Turbine, the most powerful wind generator in its class, six, 85-watt solar electric panels and four 100-amp Lifeline Deep Cycle batteries, power all the comforts of home, including an air conditioner, microwave, refrigerator and two satellite dishes, which keep him connected to the outside world.LiNeBrEaK"This is my mobile base camp," he said. "With this, I can go anywhere."LiNeBrEaKNewly designed on-board rain gutters and a Katadyn water filtration system, allow him to collect and store rainwater for drinking and washing. Twin Garmin GPS units with Nexrad weather antennas keep him from getting lost. And just in case of emergency, he has a Superwinch with 16,500 pounds of pulling power to help extricate him from sticky situations.LiNeBrEaKTread lightlyLiNeBrEaKBrawdy's goal is to stay off the gird and have as little environmental impact as possible.LiNeBrEaK"I'll have the WonderExploreBelieve Base Camp at the RV show to demonstrate that there is an alternative," he said. "You have to remember that this was just an idea a little over a year ago."LiNeBrEaKOn the front of his green RV, which he estimates took $130,000 out of his own pocket to put together, is mounted a custom license plate that reads "MindUps."LiNeBrEaK"They are mental exercises, like pushups or sit-ups, except they condition the mind ..." he said, "... because adventure is the sign of a healthy mind."LiNeBrEaKFor more, visit www.brianbrawdy.com.LiNeBrEaKFAST FACTSLiNeBrEaKFlorida RV SuperShowLiNeBrEaKWhen/where: Today through Sunday; Florida State Fairgrounds, 4800 N.

The Times (Munster, Indiana)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	U.S. steel industry reduces its energy use  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	264 words  	Jan. 16--The American Iron and Steel Institute has reported the U.S. steel industry achieved a new milestone in energy efficiency by reducing its energy intensity per ton of steel shipped by about 33 percent since 1990. LiNeBrEaKThe measure demonstrates that the industry has surpassed the target reduction in greenhouse emissions called for in the Kyoto Protocol, the association said. The protocol called for a 7 percent average reduction between 1990 and 2012.LiNeBrEaKThe 33 percent reduction in the industry's greenhouse gas emissions shows even greater improvement than the 29 percent reduction the institute announced in 2006. The industry's aggregate carbon dioxide emissions per ton of steel shipped also have been substantially reduced, according to the institute.LiNeBrEaKOn average, 1. 14 tons of carbon dioxide was emitted in 2007 for every ton of steel produced in the United States, the group concluded.LiNeBrEaK"This improvement in energy efficiency is evidence of the steel industry's long-standing commitment to sustainability," said Thomas J. Gibson, institute president and chief executive officer. "This commitment has brought our processes almost to the limit of energy efficiency.

Times-Standard (Eureka, California)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Governor calls for unity in crisis  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1034 words  	Jan. 16--The crux of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's State of the State address Thursday was simple: The state is on the verge of insolvency, it's the Legislature's fault and it's now up to those same lawmakers to work together to fix the situation.LiNeBrEaKWith the state's budget deficit expected to reach $42 billion in the next 18 months, Schwarzenegger delivered a terse, 12-minute speech in front of the state Legislature imploring lawmakers to set aside partisan ideologies to broker a deal to bring the state's massive budget into balance. The speech was a far cry from the norm, as the State of the State is generally seen as an opportunity for governors to laud their accomplishments and outline grandiose visions for the future. LiNeBrEaKThose in attendance saw none of that Thursday.LiNeBrEaK"It doesn't make any sense for me to ... stand in front of you and talk about education or infrastructure or water or health care reform and all of those things when we have this huge budget deficit," Schwarzenegger said. "I will talk to you about my vision for all those things and much more as soon as we get the budget done."LiNeBrEaKNorth Coast representatives Assemblyman Wesley Chesbro and Sen. Patricia Wiggins had slightly differing views on the governor's address, with Wiggins applauding the address and Chesbro taking a more cautious approach.LiNeBrEaK"It was not a bad speech as far as it went," Chesbro said from Sacramento, "but I'm waiting to try to determine which Gov. Schwarzenegger we're going to be dealing with: the governor who negotiated landmark global warming legislation with us and negotiated bipartisan support for infrastructure bonds for transportation and education, or the governor that just last week vetoed our $18 billion budget package."LiNeBrEaKThe $18 billion budget deal Chesbro referred to was a Democrat-backed proposal that combined cuts and tax increases.LiNeBrEaKWiggins said Schwarzenegger's address said little she could disagree with.LiNeBrEaK"His remarks were measured, respectful, complimentary but prodding -- and they were delivered in a tone that was cautionary and firm, but not alarming," Wiggins said in a statement. "We are in the midst of a fiscal crisis, which we have yet to resolve after months of negotiations. I agree with him that each and every one of us must reach across the aisle now to avoid a fiscal disaster, a disaster we may face if we don't get this budget dilemma resolved soon."LiNeBrEaKIn his address, the governor didn't seem to hesitate to lay responsibility for the current fiscal crisis squarely on the shoulders of legislators, who Schwarzenegger said have let rigid partisan ideology dominate state government, rather than the best interests of Californians. The governor even invoked imagery from one of his movies to make the point.LiNeBrEaK"It is not that California is ungovernable: it is that for too long we have been split by ideology," he said. "Conan's sword could not have cleaved our political system in two as cleanly as our own political parties have done."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger went on to say that the Legislature has at times engaged in civil war, and that the needs of its constituents sometimes become secondary.LiNeBrEaKWiggins and Chesbro strongly disagreed with that statement.LiNeBrEaK"This is simply not true," Wiggins said. "Each of us does have the people's interest in mind. But, let's not forget, we all represent different constituencies. What people want in Sonoma County is not always the same as what people want in Tulare County."LiNeBrEaKChesbro had a similar take, saying the governor seems to be very good at blaming the Legislature, but not so good at turning that critical eye inward.LiNeBrEaK"He's not assuming his share of the responsibility for his failure to act," Chesbro said. "Every time the Democrats have negotiated or responded to a budget compromise from him, he's failed to deliver support. As a Republican governor, I think it's really his responsibility to get the Republican legislators to compromise, and he's really shown no ability to do that."LiNeBrEaKThe sticking point in budget negotiations so far has been raising taxes. Schwarzenegger and Democrats have proposed raising a variety of taxes, but have not agreed on the form those should take. Meanwhile, Republicans have reportedly refused to budge on their pledge to oppose any state tax increases.LiNeBrEaKThe governor's latest budget plan, released on New Year's Eve, proposes $17. 4 billion in spending cuts, $14. 3 billion in tax increases and $10 billion in borrowing to close the deficit through June 2010.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal has already drawn fire from the California Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of Teachers, which claim the proposal cuts education funding by more than $7 billion. This comes on the heels of the California Teachers Association's announcement earlier in the week that California has slipped to 47th in the nation in per-pupil funding.LiNeBrEaKMoving forward, Wiggins said she believes the situation is truly dire, but is confident the problem will be addressed before the end of the month.LiNeBrEaKChesbro said he's also hopeful a compromise can be reached quickly, but reiterated his intent to protect public education from cuts and to make sure health care funding isn't reduced any more than necessary.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger ended his address by complimenting California's firefighters, who earlier this year managed to extinguish more than 2,000 fires that were burning at once. He called on the Legislature to show the same courage, and to act quickly to strike a budget deal.LiNeBrEaK"Addressing this emergency is the first and most important and greatest thing that we must do for the people of California," he said. "The $42 billion deficit is a rock upon our chest and we cannot breathe until we get it off."LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Times-Tribune (Scranton, Pennsylvania)  	January 16, 2009 Friday 	State advances aid for alternative energy projects Guidelines to spend $25M approved  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	564 words  	Jan. 16--HARRISBURG -- State aid to finance a wide variety of alternative energy projects is starting to enter the pipeline.LiNeBrEaKA state authority approved guidelines Tuesday for the distribution of $25 million in grants, loans and loan guarantees for wind energy and geothermal projects, an emerging industry in Northeast Pennsylvania and other parts of the state. LiNeBrEaKWith the Pennsylvania Farm Show's energy exhibits as a backdrop, Gov. Ed Rendell announced Thursday the state will mandate that diesel fuel sold in the state contain at least 2 percent biodiesel content, starting in January 2010.LiNeBrEaKBiodiesel producers in Pennsylvania have met a target to produce 40 million gallons annually, a necessary threshold before the fuel content mandate could be announced. Biodiesel producers who use soybean and animal fat stepped up production after the state started providing a 75-cents-per-gallon subsidy.LiNeBrEaKThe two developments are the first significant signs that state laws enacted six months ago to spur alternative energy investment and provide the biodiesel production subsidy are yielding results.LiNeBrEaKOverall, the investment program will provide $650 million in state aid to help develop alternative energy plants and help consumers reduce energy use. The state will pay for the program by borrowing $500 million over two years and spending $150 million in appropriations over eight years.LiNeBrEaKThe biodiesel subsidy is authorized for three years, with up to $5. 3 million in subsidies available each year.LiNeBrEaK"We've taken a major step to energy independence," said Mr. Rendell as he announced the biodiesel production target has been met. "Forty million gallons is just the tip of the iceberg."LiNeBrEaKThe governor said it's important for the nation to wean itself off dependence on foreign oil despite the wide fluctuations in gasoline prices during the past year. While gas prices are currently around $1. 75 a gallon, Mr. Rendell predicted that gasoline prices will reach $3 a gallon by summer.LiNeBrEaKMr. Rendell said applicants can start applying in March and April for state aid to help finance wind and geothermal projects.LiNeBrEaKIn Northeast Pennsylvania, wind turbines are located along the ridges at several locations, while the trillions of gallons of water in abandoned anthracite mines are being eyed as a potential geothermal source to heat or cool buildings.LiNeBrEaKThe guidelines approved by the Commonwealth Financing Authority set $5 million as the maximum loan and $1 million as the maximum grant for projects.LiNeBrEaKApplicants are to estimate the number of jobs created, how the project will reduce the state's reliance on conventional energy sources and potential environmental benefits such as the tons of air emissions from greenhouse gases that could be avoided.LiNeBrEaKThe funds can be used to buy land and buildings, build or renovate buildings and purchase and install equipment.LiNeBrEaKThe state has yet to enter the bond market to sell energy bonds to investors.LiNeBrEaKContact the writer: rswift@timesshamrock.com		ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (92%); BIOFUELS (92%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); OIL and GAS PRICES (89%); GRANTS and GIFTS (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); POWER and COMMUNICATION SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION (89%); WIND ENERGY (89%); GASOLINE PRICES (88%); BONDS (87%); POWER PLANTS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (78%); APPROVALS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); GOVERNORS (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); APPROPRIATIONS (78%); DIESEL FUEL (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE (75%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROGRAMS (75%); BOND MARKETS (72%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (71%); JOB CREATION (68%); GASOLINE MARKETS (68%); BUILDING RENOVATION (60%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (50%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (50%); ANTHRACITE MINING (50%)  			ED RENDELL (84%)  	HARRISBURG, PA, USA (91%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (96%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009    	Robert Swift, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.

The Washington Post 	January 16, 2009 Friday   Suburban Edition	Americans, Feeling the Love;  With Obama's Election, Expatriates Say, There's a New Attitude Abroad. Instead of Challenges on Iraq and WMDs, They're Met With Hugs and Good Wishes. 	FOREIGN; Pg. A12  	1029 words  	As Micha Wyatt plans an inaugural bash at the Chicago Rib Shack in London, she is basking in the new warmth toward Americans overseas.LiNeBrEaKIt's cool to be an American again, Wyatt said. "Finally! I'm tired of pretending I'm Canadian."LiNeBrEaKFrom Jakarta to Johannesburg, Americans who travel or live abroad are finding that instead of being scolded about the Iraq war, the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or U.S. climate change policy, they are being hugged when strangers hear their accent. LiNeBrEaK"People would question me: 'Where are the weapons of mass destruction? What is America doing?' " said Wyatt, 38, a San Francisco native who said she does not align herself with any party but comes from a Republican family.LiNeBrEaKSince Barack Obama's election, she said, people want to hang out at American parties and talk about the latest news from Washington: "There is a buzz about America now."LiNeBrEaKMany Americans interviewed in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe said that for years they have felt "targeted" by critics of U.S. policies. They said they often did not volunteer that they were American, and several said they even dropped the word "Ottawa" into conversations to try to avoid confrontations.LiNeBrEaKNow, even in countries such as Japan and Australia, where Americans were generally not taken to task over Bush policies as they were in Europe, Americans interviewed said they suddenly have new cachet. Some compared the feeling to the heady days after the fall of communism.LiNeBrEaK"It was cool to know an American" in the early 1990s, said Tanya Pampalone, a Los Angeles native who has long lived abroad and resides in Johannesburg.LiNeBrEaKBut the Bush era has been tough, she said, as many saw the United States playing the "bad guy" role in the world. She, like others interviewed, said she hesitated waving the red, white and blue in public.LiNeBrEaKBut as goodwill toward Americans has returned, she recently allowed her 5-year-old daughter to bring a little American flag she had been waving in the car to a restaurant.LiNeBrEaK"A week before, I would have said to her, 'Just put the flag in the car. Let's not draw attention to ourselves,' " Pampalone said. But this time, she told her daughter, " 'Great, take the flag,' and when she walked around saying, 'Yes, we can!' everyone in the restaurant was smiling.' "LiNeBrEaKOrganizations of expatriates, including Democrats Abroad, say there have never been so many, and such large, celebrations outside the United States to mark the swearing-in of an American president.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to sold-out balls in capitals around the globe, many other Obama bashes are planned. In Cambridge, England, people are gathering to listen to Obama's speech at a Hawaiian luau, a nod to Obama's roots in that state. In Antigua, Guatemala, Americans have hired a disc jockey to play Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan and other tunes Obama keeps on his iPod. In Jakarta, Indonesia, where Obama spent time as a boy, students from his former elementary school will perform a traditional dance at a party featuring some of his old classmates.LiNeBrEaKDavid St. Onge, 57, a John McCain supporter who works in the pharmaceutical industry and was in Moscow this week, said he has noticed a change in how his Russian clients treat him.LiNeBrEaK"They seemed to think better of Americans because we elected a black man as president," he said as he walked through Red Square. "They think we're more enlightened now."LiNeBrEaKAndrew Leik, 40, an architect from Michigan living in Cologne, Germany, said that along with "it definitely being much easier now to be an American" overseas, he has noticed that German friends who had refused even to visit the United States are planning vacations there.LiNeBrEaKIn France, Rick Parks, 64, a retired New York City public school teacher, said he has noticed gestures of friendship and "definitely a change in attitude" toward the United States. Gone are the days when relations with France were so testy that french fries were briefly renamed "freedom fries" in U.S. House cafeterias.LiNeBrEaKParks said North African souvenir merchants at the landmark Sacre Coeur basilica in Paris smiled at him and hailed Obama's election as a victory for them all, saying: "You are our people."LiNeBrEaKMany people said they have been surprised that a new president in the White House would have such a direct impact on their lives thousands of miles away.LiNeBrEaKBrandon Luker, 26, a PhD student from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is in India researching Islamic issues, said Muslim scholars have given him slightly better access since Obama's election.LiNeBrEaKJennifer Granger, 34, a teacher from New York who lives in Prague, said she no longer hesitates to say she is American.LiNeBrEaK"Thank God! It feels better," she said. "The people I work with give me high-fives and say things like 'You can be proud to be from your country again.' "LiNeBrEaKPerhaps as a sign of the eagerness for a new era, a wax figure of President Bush with his packed bags was placed on the sidewalk outside Madame Tussauds wax museum in Amsterdam on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKIn London, as part of the promotions related to Obama taking office, U.S. citizens can get into Madame Tussauds free on Inauguration Day, instead of paying entrance fees that start at $18. About 300,000 Americans live in Britain and any of those, along with any visitors showing up with their passports, will be waved in.LiNeBrEaKAll week, Krispy Kreme doughnut shops in Britain have been offering free cafe Americanos to those -- American or not -- who walk up to the counter and say Obama's trademark slogan, "Yes, we can!"LiNeBrEaKKit Maloney, a Boston native who for the past eight years has lived on and off in London, said strangers have begun to quiz her on all aspects of American life and on how a country could elect a black liberal intellectual, something people tell her they can't imagine happening in Britain any time soon.LiNeBrEaK"For the first time in a long time, it's cool to be an American," she said.LiNeBrEaKCorrespondents Karin Brulliard in Johannesburg, Edward Cody in Paris and Emily Wax in New Delhi, and special correspondents Karla Adam in London, Shannon Smiley in Berlin, Brian Byrnes in Buenos Aires, Akiko Yamamoto in Tokyo, Gabriela Martinez in Mexico City and Sarah Schafer in Moscow contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 	January 16, 2009 Friday   Suburban Edition	At Hearing, Obama's U.N. Pick Decries Disunity  	A-SECTION; Pg. A16  	543 words  	United Nations Ambassador-designate Susan E. Rice said yesterday that she would seek to improve what she called "an indispensable if imperfect institution" while seeking "strong international partnerships" on a range of issues. LiNeBrEaK"The United States will address all these challenges unencumbered by the old divisions of the 20th century," Rice said in her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "We cannot afford to be burdened with labels such as 'rich' or 'poor,' 'developed' or 'developing,' 'north' or 'south,' or the 'non-aligned movement.' In the 21st century, these false divisions rarely serve anyone's interests."LiNeBrEaKThe 44-year-old foreign policy veteran promised a major shift on climate change policy from that of the Bush administration, saying the incoming administration would "engage vigorously" in U.N. climate talks.LiNeBrEaKShe also said the administration of President-elect Barack Obama would work closely through the United Nations to prevent "the spread and use of nuclear weapons" and improve the organization's ability to manage complex peace operations.LiNeBrEaKRice said it is "unacceptable" that the peacekeeping force for the conflict in Sudan's troubled Darfur region -- a situation the Bush administration has described as genocide -- is at half its authorized strength. But she said U.N. peacekeeping is "a deal compared to what we would spend if we did it ourselves," estimating that a similar U.S. mission would cost about eight times more.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Rice appeared skeptical about a proposed peacekeeping force for Somalia, backed by the Bush administration, saying the incoming administration would have to take "a very careful and close look" at the plan.LiNeBrEaKRice, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, was one of Obama's chief foreign policy aides during the presidential campaign. She served in a similar role for the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, John F. Kerry (Mass.), when he was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004. Rice, no relation to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, was an assistant secretary of state for Africa and a White House aide during the Clinton administration.LiNeBrEaKShe was greeted warmly by the senators, and there appeared to be no obstacles to a speedy confirmation.LiNeBrEaKThe committee yesterday also overwhelmingly backed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) to be the next secretary of state. The panel voted 16 to 1 to send her nomination to the Senate floor, where she is not expected to face any roadblocks to full confirmation. The former first lady fielded few tough questions at her confirmation hearing Tuesday, as Democrats and Republicans alike praised her intellect and abilities.LiNeBrEaKThe sole negative vote was from Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), who said he was concerned about the overseas charitable fundraising activities of her husband, former president Bill Clinton. He decried the former president's foundation as a "multimillion dollar minefield of conflicts of interest."LiNeBrEaKIn a deal with the transition team, the former president agreed to annually release the names of overseas donors. Sen. Clinton shrugged off calls from some committee members to amend the agreement in order to provide greater and more timely disclosure of overseas contributions during her tenure as secretary.

The Washington Post 	January 16, 2009 Friday   Suburban Edition	Disposal of Coal Ash Rises As Environmental Issue;  Recent Spill Spurs Proposals for Tighter Controls 	A-SECTION; Pg. A04  	915 words  	In less than a month, the question of how to dispose of coal combustion waste has gone from a largely ignored issue to a pressing national environmental concern that has already sparked legislative proposals and the prospect of new regulation.LiNeBrEaKSince the Dec. 22 coal ash spill at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant, which poured a billion gallons of toxic material over 300 acres, lawmakers and regulators have said that the federal government should revisit an issue it has deliberated on for three decades. Although President-elect Barack Obama has identified climate change as one of his top policy priorities, addressing coal ash may come first. LiNeBrEaKBurning coal produces more than 129 million tons annually of combustion waste -- a concentrated ash that includes toxic elements such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, selenium and mercury -- but federal authorities have yet to establish uniform standards for handling it.LiNeBrEaK"The threats are out there, and we know it now. And we also know how we need to address them," said House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.), who introduced legislation this week calling for tighter controls on coal ash ponds, which are piles of combustion waste suspended in water. "As we often see in the coalfields across the country, it takes a disaster before we see decisive action."LiNeBrEaKCongress initially raised the prospect of regulating coal ash as a hazardous waste in 1980, but regulators moved slowly until March 2000, when the Environmental Protection Agency said it planned to designate it a "contingent hazardous waste." After electric utilities protested that such a move would cost billions, however, then-EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner reversed herself and determined that coal ash amounted to a solid waste. The agency pledged to issue regulations on the matter nonetheless, but it failed to do so in the eight years since President Bush took office.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of coal combustion waste produced each year has increased by nearly a third since 1990, and there are now as many as 1,300 coal ash ponds across the nation. According to a report issued yesterday by the environmental law firm Earthjustice, each year about 25 million tons of coal ash are dumped into active and abandoned mines, where it often goes directly into groundwater. The EPA determined last year that coal ash has contaminated water in 24 states.LiNeBrEaKLisa Evans, an Earthjustice attorney, said mining communities that already confront other environmental threats are faced with another source of contamination that may pollute their water for years.LiNeBrEaK"The last thing these communities need is a toxic waste dump where their mine was," said Evans, adding that in filling old mines with coal ash, "there's a very simplistic notion that you're returning coal to where it came from, so it's not going to cause any problems."LiNeBrEaKMatthew Hale, who directs the EPA's solid waste office, said that although the agency has yet to issue formal coal ash regulations, "we will be bringing this forward very quickly to reach a decision on the path forward, and that's the time when we'll be able to have a timetable. . . . Clearly, the dam failure at TVA puts a sense of urgency on the issue of addressing the stability of the dams."LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee and held a hearing last week on the issue, asked EPA administrator-nominee Lisa P. Jackson on Wednesday during her confirmation hearing what she would do to police coal ash ponds and other storage sites that have gone unregulated.LiNeBrEaKJackson pledged to conduct an immediate inventory of the deposits if confirmed and added, "The EPA currently has, and has in the past, assessed its regulatory options, and I think it is time to re-ask those questions."LiNeBrEaKThe EPA already has options at its disposal, said Earthjustice's Evans, who formerly was a lawyer in the agency's enforcement division, because the agency has the power to investigate any potential hazard to public health and the environment. Furthermore, she said, it can take action if it determines there is a threat of "imminent and substantial endangerment" from solid waste.LiNeBrEaKEven as lawmakers and regulators begin to contemplate how they can crack down on the storage sites -- Rahall's bill would impose a uniform federal design along with engineering and performance standards on new coal ash ponds, while groups such as Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project are calling for the elimination of the impoundments altogether -- industry officials say federal authorities should pause before classifying coal ash as hazardous.LiNeBrEaKDavid Goss, executive director of the American Coal Ash Association, said 43 percent of the material is currently recycled for purposes such as agricultural landfill and road projects, and designating coal combustion waste as hazardous could make that impossible.LiNeBrEaK"When it's managed properly, it doesn't pose a risk to the environment or public health," he said.LiNeBrEaKStill, officials of the utility industry recognize they may have to spend more to manage a byproduct they have stored cheaply for years.LiNeBrEaKEdison Electric Institute spokesman Dan Riedinger, whose association represents several major U.S. utilities, said his group opposes a hazardous waste designation for coal ash but added, "It's too early to rule out other options that can help utilities improve their management practices and provide the public with the reassurance it needs in the wake of TVA."

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 16, 2009 Friday 	Set greenhouse gas targets, lawmakers urged  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	548 words  	Jan. 16--Maryland's top environmental official urged lawmakers yesterday to pass a bill that will set greenhouse gas reduction targets, as the administration inches closer to a compromise with opponents to the measure. LiNeBrEaKAs she unveiled the final report of a state Commission on Climate Change, Environment Secretary Shari T. Wilson told members of a state Senate committee in Annapolis that putting the reductions into state law will help move actions forward.LiNeBrEaK"By putting in place a reduction target, it will increase our sense of urgency," Ms. Wilson told members of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee.LiNeBrEaKThe commission recommends cutting Maryland's greenhouse gases by 25 to 50 percent between now and 2020.LiNeBrEaKBills mandating those reductions have failed in the past two years, largely due to opposition from union and business groups. They've said the mandatory reductions might hurt businesses that can't afford pollution upgrades or that can't do business with reduced emissions.LiNeBrEaKBut administration and environmental officials have indicated they're close to a compromise with unions and business officials that will allow the bill to pass.LiNeBrEaKMs. Wilson noted that producing energy and transportation are far larger sources of greenhouse gases than manufacturing.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Paul Pinsky, D-Prince George's, who has sponsored climate change legislation, noted it's been difficult to get the bills through Annapolis.LiNeBrEaK"It's failed twice," he said. "Hopefully, this year will be the last."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the Maryland Department of the Environment, Marylanders could actually save up to $2 billion by taking 42 actions for reducing greenhouse gases listed in the climate change report. The actions range from conserving energy to buying local food to using switchgrass, a tall perennial grass, to make fuel.LiNeBrEaKMaryland already is reaping financial benefits from auctioning off carbon dioxide emissions credits, which started just a few months ago. Millions of dollars from the auctions will be poured into energy conservation and eventually, the carbon credit program -- called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative -- will reduce carbon emissions in Maryland and nine other eastern states.LiNeBrEaKThe MDE yesterday also issued a critical report from the Advisory Committee on the Management and Protection of the State's Water Resources.LiNeBrEaKThe committee found that Maryland is lacking in crucial information needed to manage the groundwater and reservoir supplies in the state. The report said $72 million needs to be spent over the next eight years to bring the state's monitoring and planning up to speed.LiNeBrEaKIf the state doesn't get moving, we could face water shortages in some areas due to poor planning, warned Dr. M. Gordon Wolman of Johns Hopkins University, who was the committee's chairman.LiNeBrEaK"We're behind, significantly behind, at the present time," he told senators.

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Arctic fishing?  	COMMENTARY  	403 words  	Jan. 15--As ice disappears from Alaska's arctic waters, North Pacific fishing fleets may be tempted to push into the newly opening area, seeking whatever fish they might find. But nobody knows very much about the region's marine environment, how the arctic warming trend is changing it, and what damage, if any, commercial fishing might inflict. LiNeBrEaKWhich is why the federal agency that manages Alaska's arctic waters wants to put a hold on any industrial fishing in the U.S. portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.LiNeBrEaKMonday, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council took a big step in that direction when it released a draft plan to close off fishing in Alaska's arctic waters. The council's official decision to close the area is expected next month.LiNeBrEaKAlaska's federal fishery managers deserve credit for getting ahead of any problems that industrial fishing might create in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKThis is "exactly the kind of precautionary action we need to protect Arctic Ocean ecosystem in the face of climate change," says Oceana, an international marine conservation organization with an office in Juneau. The closure is "among the largest-ever precautionary and preventative measures in fisheries management history."LiNeBrEaKOceana noted that Congress called for a precautionary arctic fishing closure last summer, in a resolution sponsored by Alaska's senator at the time Ted Stevens. In pushing that move, Sen. Stevens continued his long history of leadership on marine conservation issues.LiNeBrEaKAs Congress recognized, a "Cold Rush" is breaking out in the newly thawing arctic. Nations are jockeying for rights to oil, gas, shipping routes and other resources.LiNeBrEaKBut in arctic waters under U.S. government control, there won't be a Cold Rush for fish any time soon. The feds are going to protect it until the nation better understands whether the region can support sustainable large-scale fisheries.LiNeBrEaKBOTTOM LINE: Federal managers are getting ahead of any problems by saying "no" to industrial fishing in the Arctic right now.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Green push hypocrisy tarnishes Golden State  	COMMENTARY  	670 words  	Jan. 15--Even before Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, California staked its claim as an environmental darling. No regulation seemed beyond reach of the Golden State in search of a green legacy.LiNeBrEaKThe state's environmental regulations already compounded U.S. EPA requirements. Faddish alternative-energy mandates were imposed for years, to the envy of environmentalists elsewhere. Then the governor proudly pushed the so-called Global Warming Solution Act in 2006, raising the bar further with unparalleled environmental mandates.LiNeBrEaKAlas, reality is catching up. Gov. Schwarzenegger must be uncomfortable now, calling for waivers of environmental review for 10 huge highway projects he says are urgently needed to stimulate a sinking economy. Bypassing reviews could speed a $1. 2 billion economic infusion and create 22,000 jobs, he says. LiNeBrEaK"This is a stunning turnaround by the governor, and I am baffled by it," California League of Conservation Voters President Tom Adams told the Los Angeles Times.LiNeBrEaKStunning, perhaps. But not baffling. Shortly after the Legislature's approval of the Global Warming Solutions Act, we observed that these additional heavy-handed regulations only would add to an already devastating economic burden.LiNeBrEaKThe much-touted 2006 law seeks to reduce CO2 emissions on the theory that will reduce global warming, despite temperatures having declined even while emissions dramatically increased over the past decade. Of course, highway construction consumes vast amounts of cement, which produces great quantities of CO2 when manufactured, and also requires much heavy machinery, which gives off great amounts of genuine pollutants, as well as harmless CO2.LiNeBrEaKWe say harmless because CO2 is natural gas essential to life, even though it has greenhouse-gas properties. Until a misguided U.S. Supreme Court decision last spring, CO2 wasn't considered a pollutant. As a former director of the federal Office of Energy Research, physicist William Happer, puts it: "Every time you exhale, you exhale air that has 4 percent carbon dioxide. To say that that's a pollutant just boggles my mind. What used to be science has turned into a cult."LiNeBrEaKCult or not, California's environmental crusades have been more image than substance.LiNeBrEaK"A dirty secret about California's energy economy is that it imports lots of energy from neighboring states to make up for the shortfall caused by having too few power plants," Max Schulz, director of the Manhattan Institute's Center for Energy Policy and the Environment, wrote in an Orange County Register op-ed column last week.LiNeBrEaKA substantial portion of the state's power is imported from coal-burning plants in five other states, and from large-scale hydropower in three others. Schulz quoted James Lucier of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington, D.C.-area investment group: "California practices a sort of energy colonialism. They rely on Western states to supply them with power generation they are unwilling to build for themselves." As Schulz noted, that leaves other "states to deal with the resulting pollution."LiNeBrEaKNot coincidentally, California energy prices are among the nation's highest, aggravated by regulations requiring expensive renewable power sources. Consequently, heavy manufacturing and other energy-intensive industries have been fleeing.LiNeBrEaKNow Gov. Schwarzenegger wants to selectively waive some costly environmental reviews, making this state of laws instead a state of arbitrary men, where some are favored and others not. He also insists to do so won't ruin the environment. If that's the case, why were those laws necessary in the first place?

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Logue introduces greenhouse gas bill: Yuba assemblyman warns of 'massive' problems for businesses in state  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	402 words  	Jan. 15--Assemblyman Dan Logue on Wednesday introduced his first bill, which would roll back California's new greenhouse gas emission standards.LiNeBrEaKIn a letter to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Logue, R-Linda, said the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, or AB 32, will cause "massive economic disadvantages" to California businesses. LiNeBrEaKThe act will force businesses to bring emissions down to 1990 levels by 2020 and will be especially hard on farmers, truckers and others who rely on diesel engines, Logue said.LiNeBrEaK"I'm asking that we suspend AB 32 and allow the federal government to reverse the process," he said.LiNeBrEaK"California's economy cannot afford to bear the burden of serving as a testing ground for the nation," Logue said in the letter.LiNeBrEaKThe act will further cripple the state's economy, putting it behind China, India and the rest of the U.S., Logue said in an interview.LiNeBrEaK"If California complies (with the act) and the rest of the U.S. doesn't, we will never recover" from the current economic crisis, he said.LiNeBrEaKChina and India will build 600 new coal power plants, providing a manufacturing advantage over California and the U.S. Meanwhile, pollution from the plants drifts over California, negating the state's emission reductions, he said.LiNeBrEaK"As China builds two coal power plants a week, manufactures solar panels for pennies on the dollar and ships them to us on heavy tankers burning low-grade, high-pollution diesel fuel, federal action is a must," Logue said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's emission standards should be the same as the rest of the nation's. The difference, Logue said, is one reason businesses are leaving for Nevada, Texas, Colorado and Arizona, he said.LiNeBrEaKIn a related move, Logue asked Attorney General Jerry Brown for copies of all letters sent to businesses and local governments regarding lack of compliance with AB 32.LiNeBrEaKBrown is threatening legal action against noncompliant businesses, Logue said.LiNeBrEaKContact Appeal-Democrat reporter Rob Young at 749-4710 or at ryoung@appealdemocrat.com		EMISSIONS (92%); POWER PLANTS (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); LITIGATION (86%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (78%); DIESEL FUEL (78%); COPYRIGHT LAW (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (75%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (71%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (70%); ECONOMIC NEWS (69%); INTERVIEWS (67%); SOLAR ENERGY (66%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (62%); SUITS and CLAIMS (50%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (72%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (62%)  		ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (91%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (95%); TEXAS, USA (79%); COLORADO, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%); CHINA (93%); INDIA (92%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Appeal-Democrat   	Rob Young, Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.

The Bemidji Pioneer (Minnesota)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: No global warming, Ice Age here  	COMMENTARY  	520 words  	Jan. 15--"Climate change" is a buzzword of the 21st century. We are so much more attuned to our environment and the need to save it now, or lose it forever. LiNeBrEaKThat includes controlling so-called greenhouse gases, such as carbon-based gases, from entering our atmosphere where they threaten to raise the temperature globally. The Arctic and Antarctic are melting, and Greenland is becoming more and more green.LiNeBrEaKWe are now prompted to look at government policies to effect climate change to prevent these things from happening, now that the science has proven the greenhouse effect is valid.LiNeBrEaKOr is it?LiNeBrEaKThe Russian Pravda newspaper online reported this week that the Earth is on the brink of entering another Ice Age from what it called "a large and compelling body of evidence from within the field of climate science." It seems Earth's weather patterns are cyclic, and another cycle is ready to begin.LiNeBrEaKThe new data indicate "that the warm, 12,000-year-long Holocene period will rather soon be coming to an end, and then the Earth will return to Ice Age conditions for the next 100,000 years." Aiding this theory is a study of ice cores, ocean sediment cores, the geologic record and studies of ancient plant and animal populations which demonstrate a regular cyclic pattern. Add to that the tilt of the Earth which varies over a 41,000 year period, the shape of the Earth's orbit which changes over a period of 100,000 years, and the Earth's wobble which gradually rotates the direction of the planet's axis over a period of 26,000 years.LiNeBrEaKThe Pravda article pans the current global warming theories by saying that supporters "focus on evidence from only the past 1,000 years at most, while ignoring the evidence from the past million years -- evidence which is essential for a true understanding of climatology." Further, the global warming theory "is based on data that is drawn from a ridiculously narrow span of time and it demonstrates a wanton disregard for the 'big picture' of long-term climate change."LiNeBrEaKNow Western scientists were quick to dismiss the Russian report, saying it made some severe jumps in logic and was based on flawed interpretation of the data.LiNeBrEaKBut who are we to believe?LiNeBrEaKPravda notes that the winter of 2007-08 delivered the deepest snow cover to the Northern Hemisphere since 1966 and the coldest temperatures since 2001. And it notes that the current Northern Hemisphere winter of 2008-09 "will probably equal or surpass the winter of 2007-08 for both snow depth and cold temperatures."LiNeBrEaKGiven the number of below-zero days we've had since Thanksgiving, the snow cover and especially this week of tundra-like 20-plus below zero temperatures, we could argue the Ice Age has already come.

The Boston Globe 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	A reprieve for the trees  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A14  	461 words  	GENTLEMEN, start your bulldozers. The race to the end of the Bush administration has begun for the US Forest Service, whose leaders have spent much of the past eight years trying to undo President Clinton's protection of one-third of national forest acreage as forever roadless. In New Hampshire, the service wants to log 300 acres of the Kilkenny area in the White Mountain National Forest that were classified as roadless after 2001. The project should be put on hold until the Forest Service gets new leadership under President-elect Barack Obama, who supports the Clinton roadless rule. LiNeBrEaKKilkenny, one of the most isolated areas in the Northeast, is not a virgin forest untouched since the arrival of Europeans. But it has recovered from earlier timbering and now is home to moose, black bear, American marten, northern goshawk, and Canadian lynx. The area also includes a wild brook-trout fishery.LiNeBrEaKFor logging to occur in the Kilkenny area, the Forest Service would have to restore disused roads that have become overgrown. Katherine Stuart, Forest Service district ranger for the Androscoggin district, says that timber sales proceeds in her area have exceeded the costs of road work and administration. But in many such projects, the government actually loses money.LiNeBrEaKWith climate change forcing species to move northward or to higher elevations, conservationists say it is particularly important to protect intact, wild corridors that make this migration possible. Stuart says the cutting in Kilkenny would create an open habitat area for species that flourish in such areas and not in mature forests. She said she and her colleagues are not trying to rush the plan through before the change in administration and are prepared to work with new rules from Washington. Critics of the timbering say nearby open lands, including farms, already provide open habitat.LiNeBrEaKSuch disagreements between the service and conservationists could become less heated if the service submitted its logging plans to third-party review by an organization like the Forest Stewardship Council.LiNeBrEaKThe White Mountain National Forest isn't the only one to be facing last-minute actions. The former timber-industry lobbyist who oversees the Forest Service, Mark Rey, wanted to let a developer pave over rough national forest logging roads out West to improve access to residential subdivisions just outside forest areas. In the face of opposition from local officials, the developer has dropped its plan.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush's attempt to reverse the Clinton roadless rule, which had won overwhelming support from the public before it took effect, began in the first weeks of his term. Obama should act quickly to reinstate the rule and ensure the Forest Service acts as steward of the national forests.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Duke, other companies unveil climate plan  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	296 words  	Jan. 15--Duke Energy was among a group of household-name companies and environmental groups that rolled out a plan Thursday to sharply lower greenhouse gas emissions as President-elect Obama assumes office. LiNeBrEaKThe plan, developed over two years and announced in Washington, was an attempt to present the incoming president with a consensus of leading players in the debate over regulation of carbon dioxide. The gas is linked to climate change.LiNeBrEaKIt's based on a proposed system that would place limits, dropping over time, on how much carbon dioxide may be released. Emitters like Duke would trade "allowances" -- permission slips to release carbon -- that reward companies for reducing emissions.LiNeBrEaKBut the industry plan differs from Obama on a key starting point. The U.S. Climate Action Partnership, as it is known, says companies like Duke should be given those allowances. Obama has said he would make the companies buy them at auction.LiNeBrEaKIt's a critical issue, because the value of the allowances is expected to soar into the trillions of dollars by 2050. The plan envisions reducing carbon releases 80 percent, compared to 2005, by that date.LiNeBrEaK"If (free allowances) were removed from the mix entirely, I would say that it was one of the cards that could make the house fall down very quickly," said Keith Trent, Duke's chief strategy and policy officer.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	BRIEF: 2008 was eighth-warmest year on record  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	275 words  	Jan. 15--Last year finished in a tie with 2001 as the eighth-warmest on record, the Asheville-based National Climatic Data Center says.LiNeBrEaKThe center averaged global land and sea surface temperatures in drawing its conclusion, but cautioned that the assessment could change. NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, for example, ranks 2008 as ninth-warmest. LiNeBrEaKCombined land and sea temperatures for 2008 were 0. 88 degrees above the 20th-century average of 57. 0 degrees. Since 1880, when record-keeping began, global temperatures have increased at a rate of 0. 09 degrees per decade. That rate has increased to 0. 29 degrees a decade over the past 30 years.LiNeBrEaKOther 2008 tidbits from the Asheville center:LiNeBrEaKThe United States recorded 1,690 tornadoes, well above the 10-year average of 1,270 and second-highest since record-keeping started in 1953.LiNeBrEaKSnow in the Northern Hemisphere covered 16. 95 million square miles in December, 0. 17 million square miles above the 42-year average for the month. Snow cover had been below average for most of 2008.LiNeBrEaKArctic sea ice reached its second-lowest extent in September, when ice melts seasonally. The minimum of 1. 8 million square miles was 0. 80 million square miles below the 1979-2000 average.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Interior nominee vows `balanced approach' to energy and land-use policy  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	739 words  	WASHINGTON _ It was a classic Western script, with a Cabinet nominee taking the Gary Cooper role: a low-talking, boots-and-bolo-tie wearing former lawman pledging to clean up a federal agency gone amok.LiNeBrEaKNominated by President-elect Barack Obama to lead the Interior Department, Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., appeared on Thursday before a Senate committee that still technically counts him as a member _ and treated him more than sympathetically. LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department has drawn criticism from lawmakers and environmentalists in recent years over a sex and drugs scandal in one of its bureaus and an auditors' report saying employees manipulated endangered species decisions to advance a political agenda.LiNeBrEaK"I want to clean up the mess," Salazar said in his opening statement.LiNeBrEaKBut he offered only a few details on his plans and sidestepped several hot subjects, including federal protection for gray wolves, the relationship between global warming and the Endangered Species Act, and whether he would continue to allow guns and snowmobiles in national parks.LiNeBrEaKIn some areas he was more direct, promising to reform the nation's signature mining law and to consider a full plate of options for energy independence, including offshore oil drilling and, under the right conditions, oil-shale development.LiNeBrEaKHe pledged support for renewable energy development _ a cause he championed as senator _ and promised a "balanced approach" to energy and land-use policy. He emphasized his rural roots, having grown up on a ranch in Colorado's San Luis Valley. And he called for a new national youth conservation program putting young people to work in parks and public spaces.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans and Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee repeatedly told Salazar how much they admire his integrity and how they will miss him when he leaves the Senate. They called him brother, invited him to visit their states and, in the case of Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida, offered to arrange for him to wrestle alligators in the Everglades.LiNeBrEaK"This is on its way to being a full-fledged bouquet-tossing contest," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., joked.LiNeBrEaKMany environmental groups support the nomination, but some continue to voice their displeasure.LiNeBrEaKIn a press release, Nicole Rosmarino of WildEarth Guardians said Salazar "will not take strong stances on behalf of science and environmental protection and is not up to the task of undoing the enormous damage the Bush administration has done to public lands, endangered species, and the credibility of the Department of the Interior over the last eight years."LiNeBrEaKSalazar repeatedly promised to put science first in the agency's decision-making. But asked if he believed the government should consider global warming in endangered species protection _ a position environmentalists favor but the Bush administration rejects _ he gave only a hint of an opinion.LiNeBrEaK"There is no doubt that climate change and global warming is having an impact on a whole host of natural features of this world, including endangered species that we have," Salazar said. "It is something that we will take a look at."LiNeBrEaKSalazar left himself open to compromise over a pair of domestic oil initiatives: drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, which he said could make sense in some areas but not others, and leasing federal land for oil-shale development _ a particularly hot issue in his home state, where most shale efforts are located. He pledged to pursue research into so-called "clean coal" technology that seeks to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from coal to curb global warming.LiNeBrEaKEven initially skeptical Republicans declared themselves pleased. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C, had said he was concerned that Salazar's energy approach was "to cut off American energy supply." But, after speaking with him this week, he told Salazar at the hearing, he came to believe "we're pretty much on the same page."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	My Word: Linda Sheehan - Communities beginning to recognize importance of environment  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Letters; News; Local  	596 words  	TWO JAN. 11 articles, "Climate change may be stoking stronger winds, altered oceans," and "Food crisis due to warming world trumps all other worries, say scientists," discuss how science is demonstrating that we are altering, perhaps irrevocably, the Earth's systems. LiNeBrEaKOngoing resistance to this science occurs in part because it humbles us to our actual place on the planet   as one piece of a larger whole, rather than the dominant entity. LiNeBrEaKIt is reminiscent of reactions to the then-radical proposal that the Earth revolves around the sun, rather than the other way around; or that humans developed over countless millennia through evolution, rather than springing to Earth fully formed.LiNeBrEaKThough it is before our eyes every day, we continue to resist the knowledge that we cannot keep consuming the Earth and expect that it will not respond in ways that we simply can't control.LiNeBrEaKIf we accept the science that we coexist as one piece of a larger system, we can take action to improve our own lives and prevent the dire predictions scientists are making for our future family members.LiNeBrEaKOne of the first steps is to rework our legal system to reflect our actual place in the world.LiNeBrEaKOur laws currently allow   indeed, encourage   the accelerating devastation that scientists predict will arrive. Similar to a legal system premised on the sun revolving around the Earth, our laws are based on myth, not science   in this case, the myth that we can control the planet.LiNeBrEaKThe science doesn't work that way, and neither will the laws.LiNeBrEaKEffective laws allow and constrain behavior to promote desired relationships.LiNeBrEaKThey work in two directions, to reflect each party's respective rights; for example, I can't take your car and you can't take mine.LiNeBrEaKClimate change and other failures result from laws that ignore the two-way relationships that exist between us and the water, air, land and life around us.LiNeBrEaKOur legal system focuses on the rights and needs of people, but ignores the same rights and needs of the other members of the ecological community. The laws encourage us to take from the environment, only regulating how much   but barely doing even that.LiNeBrEaKFortunately, models are cropping up for legal systems that can steer us in the right direction, based on science.LiNeBrEaKIn September, Ecuadorians adopted a new constitution that, for the first time, endows the environment with inalienable rights to "exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution."LiNeBrEaKThe constitution further grants individuals the legal authority to defend these rights on behalf of the environment.LiNeBrEaKEcuadorians have taken the lead in reflecting science in law by acknowledging the interdependence between us and our environment and respecting both sides of that relationship.LiNeBrEaKCommunities around the United States also are starting to create their own rights-based environmental laws. States such as in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire have recognized in ordinance the "enforceable right of natural communities and ecosystems to exist and flourish" within their boundaries.LiNeBrEaKEcuador's constitution, and a growing body of environmental ordinances in the United States, has set the stage for an evolution of law that recognizes the inherent, inalienable rights of all occupants of this Earth to exist and thrive for the benefit of each of us and our descendants.LiNeBrEaKLet's make that evolution a reality.LiNeBrEaKLinda Sheehan is an attorney and the executive director of the California Coastkeeper Alliance, representing 12 Waterkeeper organizations coast-wide. She lives and works in Fremont.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Dan Walters: Face it, California's future is bleak  	OPINION  	500 words  	DEFENSE SPENDING in the 1980s, high-tech startups in the 1990s and housing-fueled consumer spending in the 1990s   all were California economic bubbles that burst spectacularly, leaving recession and government deficits in their wake. LiNeBrEaKWhat, if anything, will come next to pull us out of recession and return California to prosperity? Some think it will be biotechnology, services to baby boomer retirees or solving global warming. LiNeBrEaKLurking in the background, however, is a nagging worry that there won't be anything, that the state's endemically high costs, political dysfunction and long list of unresolved dilemmas, from transportation to water to education, have made us uncompetitive in a global economy. Just last week, a new federal survey found that California has the nation's highest adult illiteracy rate. LiNeBrEaKWe have tended to take the future for granted. No matter how moribund the economy may be at the moment, we think, we have the weather, the entrepreneurial spirit and the strategic location to regroup and prosper.LiNeBrEaKWe may have. But then again, maybe we aren't so special. Maybe we're not immune to the societal afflictions that have beset other states. Maybe we are a rust-belt-to-be on the left coast, a Michigan with winter sunshine.LiNeBrEaKA clue to potential decline may be found in what had been one of the state's stellar sectors in recent years, international trade. California's airports and seaports, especially the latter, became the portal for rapidly expanding trade with Asia. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach became the nation's busiest with Oakland just a few notches down the list.LiNeBrEaKAt its high point, a quarter of the nation's international cargo, imports and exports, was passing through California, including 40 percent of container traffic, despite high costs, traffic congestion and relatively inefficient cargo-handling systems.LiNeBrEaKThe global recession cut into that traffic sharply, as one might expect, but California port officials are forecasting big increases when the economy improves and are planning expensive facility upgrades.LiNeBrEaK"The forecasts are hogwash," says Jack O'Connell, an international trade expert with the University of California. He doubts whether consumer demand for Asian goods will return to former levels because of new wariness about personal debt, and he believes that competition will compel shippers to seek cheaper avenues.LiNeBrEaKLast fall, as Californians were waiting to vote for a new president and fill other offices, an election was held several thousand miles to the south, in Panama. Panamanians approved a multibillion-dollar expansion of the Panama Canal that by the middle of the next decade will allow the biggest container ships   those that have been forced to offload in California   to sail all the way to American ports on the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.LiNeBrEaKWhat has been an economic strength for California, in other words, may join a growing list of weaknesses.LiNeBrEaKDan Walters (dwalters@sacbee.com) is a columnist for the Sacramento Bee.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Home Final Edition	Gasoline tax would have many benefits  	EDITORIAL and COMMENT; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. 12A  	148 words  	It's rare that I agree with columnist Charles Krauthammer, but he's got a good idea: Raise the federal gasoline tax by $1 a gallon, and use the money to reduce the income tax. LiNeBrEaKMost schemes for reducing oil demand rely on fuel-economy standards for cars or a "Manhattan project" to come up with a magic alternative to gasoline. It'll be hard for a single effort to come up with a good solution for everyone.LiNeBrEaKIt's better to send a price signal and let the market sort it out.LiNeBrEaKWith gasoline prices at a temporary lull, now's the perfect time to implement this. We've already seen that driving goes down when gasoline prices go up.LiNeBrEaKThis proposal encourages something we need (working) and discourages something problematic (use of foreign oil). That's before you get to secondary effects, like increased fitness (more walking), better air quality and reduced global warming.LiNeBrEaK\ TONY GOINS \ Columbus		FUEL TAX (91%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); GASOLINE PRICES (90%); GASOLINE (90%); GASOLINE MARKETS (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (90%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (87%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (87%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (65%) Letters  				COLUMBUS, OH, USA (64%) OHIO, USA (64%) UNITED STATES (64%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Letter  	Newspaper  	2009 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  																
The Daily Times (Farmington, New Mexico)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	BRIEF: Lujan appointed to science, technology committee  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	270 words  	Jan. 15--FARMINGTON -- Rep. Ben Ray Lujan was appointed Wednesday to the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology, his second and final congressional committee appointment. LiNeBrEaKThe science and technology committee oversees energy research and development at national laboratories across the country, including Los Alamos National Laboratory, according to a Lujan statement.LiNeBrEaK"I look forward to using my expertise on renewable energy to be a part of the discussion on effectively developing this important resource," Lujan said in the statement. "By expanding a clean energy economy in New Mexico, we will create jobs and help get our economy back on track."LiNeBrEaKThe committee also oversees environmental research and development, which can be used to protect vulnerable lands and fight global warming, the statement says.LiNeBrEaKLujan, elected in November to the 3rd Congressional District, whose territory is northern New Mexico including San Juan County, was appointed to the homeland security committee last week.LiNeBrEaK"The diverse resources in my district and my experience on energy and climate issues will help me step into an important role in the Committee on Science and Technology," Lujan said in the statement.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EPA may get tougher with Detroit 3: Nominee wants to tackle emissions  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	324 words  	Jan. 15--Automakers could quickly face tough new rules limiting global warming pollution from new models in more than a dozen states after President-elect Barack Obama's pick to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday she would tackle the debate soon. LiNeBrEaKDetroit automakers and their foreign competitors have waged a lengthy legal fight against California's rules that set new limits on vehicle emissions to fight global warming, rules which 17 other states have adopted or vowed to put in place.LiNeBrEaKSuch rules would lead to fuel economy targets that automakers and dealers warn would create a patchwork of state laws, drive up costs and limit sales.LiNeBrEaKLast year, the Bush administration's EPA denied California's request for a waiver from federal law that is needed for it and the other states to move ahead. Obama pledged during the campaign to overturn the decision, and EPA nominee Lisa Jackson promised fast action to a Senate committee Wednesday.LiNeBrEaK"If I am confirmed I will immediately revisit the waiver, looking at the science and the rule of law, and relying on the expert advice of EPA's employees in making a determination," Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKEPA employees had told current administrator Steve Johnson that federal law and climate science required him to approve California's request, but Johnson rejected it. Several states have sued over the rejection.LiNeBrEaKThe law limits the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases vehicles can emit, which mostly comes from burning fuel.LiNeBrEaKContact JUSTIN HYDE at 202-906-8204 or jhyde@freepress.com		ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (77%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); APPROVALS (72%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (65%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (58%)  	BARACK OBAMA (92%); LISA P JACKSON (69%)  	DETROIT, MI, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); MICHIGAN, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Detroit Free Press   	Justin Hyde, Detroit Free Press  			Crime/law  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090115-DE-EPA-may-get-tougher-with-Detroit-3-0115  	DE  									
The Eagle (Bryan, Texas)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Texas AandM offers some fun new courses  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	874 words  	Jan. 15--Yes, you can get class credit for learning about Big Foot and for becoming more environmentally conscience.LiNeBrEaKThe list of courses to choose from at Texas AandM, like at most other universities, keeps expanding, much to the pleasure of students looking for a class that might just make homework fun.LiNeBrEaKClasses recently approved to be added to the course guide include Ecotourism: Principles and Practices; Science,Pseudoscience and Critical Thinking in Anthropology; Polar Regions of the Earth: Science, Society and Discovery; and, a personal favorite, Festivals, Fairs and events. LiNeBrEaKYou might have already taken an off-the-beaten-path class that sucks you in by the very title, so shoot us an e-mail if you have a favorite you want to mention: spotlight@theeagle.comLiNeBrEaKHere's a sampling of some of the new ones up for discussion.LiNeBrEaKPolar Regions of the Earth: Science, Society and DiscoveryLiNeBrEaKIn the past two years, the number of majors within geosciences has doubled. With much attention faced on global warming and being environmentally conscious, it's no wonder.LiNeBrEaK"The poles are very distant to us here in Texas," said Andrew Millington, professor in geosciences. "What students will realize, is that we're all connected."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the syllabus, one of the objectives of this class is to show that the earth is a co-dependent system of systems.LiNeBrEaK"Clearly they should get an appreciation that even though they live in Texas... what we do in Texas affects the polar regions. What's happening in the world's polar regions is relevant here," Millington said.LiNeBrEaKLast semester, classes in the department experienced record enrollment, he said.LiNeBrEaKEcotourism: Principles and PracticesLiNeBrEaKBeing eco-friendly is a new trend in most aspects of daily life.LiNeBrEaKThis class aims to show how those same ideas can be applied to leisurely travel. According to the International Ecotourisn Society, ecotourism is "responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people."LiNeBrEaKIn this class, students will have the opportunity to see how ecotourism affects the cultures tourists come into contact with, governmental agencies and also the private sector. The class will be taught as a seminar and emphasizes class participation and discussion.LiNeBrEaKScience, Pseudoscience and Critical Thinking in AnthropologyLiNeBrEaKFor those curious about Big Foot, aliens and other such claims, this class is worth considering. According to the syllabus the class focuses on "closely scrutinizing some of the fantastic claims that have been made regarding the fields of biological anthropology and archaeology."LiNeBrEaKCoursework will include evaluating the legitimacy of various documentaries, and writing a review of a pseudoscientific book.LiNeBrEaKFestivals, Fairs and EventsLiNeBrEaKTo successfully host most events, there are several areas that need attention.LiNeBrEaKThere's advertising, budgeting, recruiting help, and much more. This class has been developed as a spin off from a highly successful event leadership program.LiNeBrEaK"We submitted a major curriculum overhaul of our undergraduate classes," said Gary Ellis, department head for Recreation, Parks and Tourism Sciences. "I think a reason for that was responsiveness to changes and evolution in the knowledge base, and also being mindful of emerging career opportunities for our students."LiNeBrEaKThis class incorporates several appearances by guest speakers who have been successful in the event planning industry.LiNeBrEaK"In addition to the knowledge we provide, experience is the best way to improve in this particular field," said Harrison Pickney, an instructor for the class. "That's why we try to get so many professionals from the field to talk to students about their experiences."LiNeBrEaKLong processLiNeBrEaKFor those skeptical of the actual value of some of these classes, rest assured. It generally takes a minimum of five months before a class can be approved and added to the course guide.LiNeBrEaK"The faculty wants to make sure the curriculum of the university is substantive and meets the needs of the university and the students," said Doug Slack, regents professor in wildlife and fisheries sciences, and former head of the core curriculum committee.LiNeBrEaKFaculty members ensure the value of each proposed class by sending it through a five-step process.LiNeBrEaK"If everything goes right, it takes about a month for each step of the process," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe class must first be approved through the department, then by the college. From there it is sent for approval by the university curriculum committee and then to the executive committee of the faculty senate. The last step in the process is getting the green light from the office of the president.LiNeBrEaKAnd of course, there are some classes that don't make the cut.LiNeBrEaK"One time we had a course that made it sound like a fly fishing course," Slack said. "We later found out it wasn't, it was just an unfortunate title for the class."

The Hartford Courant (Connecticut)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Many expect better U.S. science policy under Obama  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	814 words  	Jan. 15--In the past eight years, scientists upset with President George W. Bush have tried a number of ways to show their displeasure: Nobel Prize winners have taken to YouTube to criticize his science policies; scientific organizations have circulated petitions.LiNeBrEaKIn Connecticut, 100 scientists marched in their academic robes outside the U.S. Coast Guard Academy when Bush came to speak in 2007. The organizer of that protest, Connecticut College chemistry Professor Marc Zimmer, said it was Bush's lack of action on global warming and his acceptance of intelligent design as science that particularly vexed him. LiNeBrEaKHe expects Barack Obama to restore the country's position in science.LiNeBrEaK"It's really early on and what he's done is he's got a superstar team of scientists, and they're real scientists," Zimmer says.LiNeBrEaKNot all scientists were unhappy with the Bush years, but a large number were, and they grew increasingly vocal in their criticism of the president's policies on stem cell research, health care, and alternative fuel sources.LiNeBrEaKIn an online video in October, Martin Chalfie, winner of 2008 Nobel prize for chemistry, charged that Bush's policies have "excluded reasoned research and documented scientific information, and substituted ideology and false science. This change is destroying our scientific integrity."LiNeBrEaKChalfie, who was one of 76 Nobel laureates who signed a letter endorsing Obama, said this week that Obama's science appointments show that the president-elect is on the right track.LiNeBrEaK"At the moment, the people he's selected seem to be quite wonderful," he said. "The other thing is, he's moved rather quickly to name these people, and that's a very important aspect to this."LiNeBrEaKObama scored points among scientists when, during his campaign, he released an 11-page science plan that included doubling the funding for the National Institutes of Health over the next 10 years. He has also said that he recognizes the potential for stem cell research to treat several disorders and that he would reverse current restrictions on federal funding for stem cell research.LiNeBrEaKIn a radio address last month, he said science "holds the key to our survival as a planet, and our security and prosperity as a nation." His science appointments, including John P. Holdren of Harvard as White House science adviser, have been well received.LiNeBrEaK"The last eight years have had their ups and downs; we have not made progress in areas we should have," says Suman Singha, vice president for research at the University of Connecticut. "I think as a scientist, I am more hopeful about the next eight years."LiNeBrEaKSince a federal act in 1862 fostered the teaching of agriculture and engineering in universities, Singha says, "those have been the areas that have kept the United States as a world leader."LiNeBrEaKThe country has stayed at the forefront of science, he says, but its lead has slipped in the past eight years. He hopes the next four years will see the country refocus on science.LiNeBrEaK"To compete with China and India, I think that's what we need to do," says Singha.LiNeBrEaKNot all scientists have been so enthusiastic.LiNeBrEaKMichael Monce, who teaches physics at Connecticut College, says he is wary of Obama's appointment of Carol M. Browner for global warming czar. She has been adamant that CO{-2} emissions are the cause of global warming; Monce says evidence is building that contradicts that position.LiNeBrEaKRegarding claims that funding for scientific research has decreased during the Bush administration, Monce says the past eight years have only been a continuation of a pattern that began during the Clinton administration. If anything, he says, the decrease leveled off during the Bush years.LiNeBrEaKHaifan Lin, who teaches cell biology at Yale, is looking forward to the change in administration. He criticizes Bush's prohibition on using federal funds for research on human embryonic stem cell lines that were created after Aug. 9, 2001, or on using federally funded facilities for such research. He says the older stem cell lines have less research value because they are aged.LiNeBrEaKHe noted that Connecticut researchers have been less affected by the restrictions because the state is one of the few in the country to provide its own stem cell funding. Despite Obama's vow to overturn the funding restriction, Lin says U.S. researchers will continue to feel the effects of Bush's policy. Even if Obama reverses the restrictions early on, he says, federal funding would not likely be available for two more years.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Strong showing;  Hillary Clinton seems up to the challenge. 	B; Pg. 8  	429 words  	If Sen. Hillary Clinton's performance as secretary of state in the incoming administration of Barack Obama lives up to her presentation at this week's Senate confirmation hearing, the president and the country will be well served. Clinton is expected to win committee approval today and confirmation by the full Senate next week. LiNeBrEaKClinton's forceful display of her grasp of a wide range of issues, from global warming to the Law of the Sea Treaty to the current fighting between Israel and Hamas, clearly impressed even Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Her pledge to reinstate diplomacy as a key element of America's engagement with the world promises to replace the big stick, go-it-alone philosophy of the George W. Bush presidency with a more sophisticated blend of negotiation and use of economic and military power.LiNeBrEaKIn her testimony the nominee gave a tagline to the new tactics: "smart power." In discussing the Gaza situation, she told the committee that "as intractable as the Middle East's problems may seem, and many presidents, including my husband, have spent years trying to help work out a resolution, we cannot give up on peace. We must also actively pursue a strategy of smart power in the Middle East that addresses the security needs of Israel and the legitimate political and economic aspirations of the Palestinians."LiNeBrEaKThe few pointed questions to the nominee from senators concerned possible conflicts of interest in her future assignment posed by the millions of dollars in donations, including many from foreign governments and business interests, flowing to a charitable foundation of former President Bill Clinton. In an agreement reached between the Clintons and the Obama transition team, the entire list of donors to the Clinton Foundation was disclosed, along with a commitment for annual listing of new donors, and a process to have the State Department review large foreign contributions to prevent potential ethics violations. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., called on the Clintons to go beyond that by simply refusing to take contributions from foreign entities to the foundation for the span of her tenure as secretary of state and revealing donations as they are received rather than annually.LiNeBrEaKLugar's suggestion is a good one that would lessen any perceived improprieties created by the receipt of gifts to the foundation from governments with which the secretary of state will be dealing.LiNeBrEaKWith the world's troubles sitting on her plate, the last thing Clinton or the country needs is another scandal sparked by her spouse.

The Houston Chronicle 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Coalition to detail air plan today;  Congress will hear greenhouse gas proposal 	BUSINESS; Pg. 3  	379 words  	The most detailed proposal yet by industry and environmentalists to reduce U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions will call for raising the costs of new coal plants and rewarding nations for protecting forests. LiNeBrEaKRio Tinto Group, General Electric Co. and U.S. power producers will present the plan today to a congressional committee and recommend "urgent" action, according to a copy of the report by the 32-member coalition obtained by Bloomberg News.LiNeBrEaKBalance is the goalLiNeBrEaKCongress will hear the plan five days before President-elect Barack Obama takes office on a promise to cut the amount of greenhouse gases released in the U.S. by 80 percent from 1990 levels in 2050. The U.S. Climate Action Partnership's proposal aims to strike a balance between the interests of industrial polluters and environmental activists, Duke Energy Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers said in prepared testimony.LiNeBrEaK"No one got everything they wanted, but we all got what we feel is needed to ensure a sound climate-change policy is created," Rogers said in testimony to be delivered before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.LiNeBrEaKThe group proposes slashing emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 42 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.LiNeBrEaKCapping emissionsLiNeBrEaKUnder the plan, emissions from power plants, manufacturers and oil refiners will be capped, and polluters must obtain permits for every ton of greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere. Those that exceed their caps will have to buy permits from emitters who reduce their output of greenhouse gases, under a so-called cap-and-trade program.LiNeBrEaKNew power plants that burn coal or natural gas will have to buy all credits required to meet emissions caps, under the group's proposal. That will raise their production costs compared with existing facilities, which will get "a significant portion" of credits for free at the start of the program.LiNeBrEaKBig guns to testifyLiNeBrEaKChief executives from GE, the world's biggest maker of power-plant turbines, and other companies are expected to testify to the Energy and Commerce committee today, aides to that panel said.LiNeBrEaKOther companies sending CEOs are London-based Rio Tinto, a major mining company; Duke, a major electricity producer from coal; as well as PGandE Corp., Siemens and Houston-based ConocoPhillips.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EPA nominee vows to put science ahead of special interests  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	883 words  	Jan. 15--WASHINGTON -- Lisa Jackson, President-elect Barack Obama's choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, promised Wednesday to lead the agency "with science as my guide" and not to allow political appointees to trump the advice of EPA scientists.LiNeBrEaKSenators on the Environment and Public Works Committee bombarded Jackson with environmental issues, everything from climate disruption to coal ash disposal and new air-pollution rules. LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the committee's chairman, and other Democrats said that during the Bush administration the EPA listened to industry lobbyists instead of its own science staff and failed to impose regulations that were needed to protect Americans from toxic pollution and to reduce the emissions that caused global warming.LiNeBrEaKBoxer said the confirmation hearing for Jackson and Nancy Helen Sutley, Obama's choice to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, was a turning point for both agencies. "I've been waiting for this day for a long, long time," she said, but she added that the hearing was meant to focus on the future. "You're today and tomorrow," she said to Jackson.LiNeBrEaKRepublican senators said they worried that the EPA would use the Clean Air Act or other laws to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide in excessive ways. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said that EPA decisions would determine "whether overzealous regulations pull us deeper into economic turmoil."LiNeBrEaKJackson said Obama expected the EPA to uphold scientific integrity and the rule of law and to operate with openness.LiNeBrEaKJackson and Sutley said Obama has said that it's possible to have a strong economy and a healthy environment at the same time.LiNeBrEaKJackson also said she'd move toward regulations on carbon emissions in a "reasonable, thoughtful and deliberate" way.LiNeBrEaK"If I am confirmed, I will administer with science as my guide," Jackson said. "I understand that the laws leave room for policymakers to make policy judgments. But if I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of EPA's technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes."LiNeBrEaKBoxer said the EPA was a "shadow of its former self" and that people who worked there had said that morale was low because the expertise of EPA staff had been ignored. She told Jackson to assure the EPA's 17,000 employees that they were needed to protect health and the environment.LiNeBrEaK"With pleasure, Madame Chairwoman," Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKJackson also promised to make sure that the EPA "right away" looks into how coal combustion waste from power plants is stored at hundreds of sites around the country.LiNeBrEaKThe first priority is to look into wet storage, where coal combustion waste is mixed with water and piled up in ponds such as the one in Tennessee that gave way Dec. 22, inundating more than 200 acres with toxic sludge.LiNeBrEaKPlaces such as that with a "mountain of wet coal ash" can endanger lives, Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKAs soon as the scope of the problem is clear, the EPA should decide whether it should impose federal regulations on storing the coal waste, she added. Coal ash contains lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxic metals, but there are no national standards for handling it.LiNeBrEaKWhen Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., asked Jackson for her views on the future of coal, she said that coal supplied half of America's electricity now, but added that it's also the largest source of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. She said there was a need to "move American ingenuity toward addressing it . . . if we're going to beat this climate change issue," because the United States, China and India all were likely to continue using coal.LiNeBrEaKJackson also said that she'd immediately revisit the question of whether to grant California and other states the right to impose stricter vehicle-emissions standards, something that the EPA wouldn't do under President George W. Bush. Obama has said he'd sign such a measure, Boxer said.LiNeBrEaKJackson worked at the EPA for 15 years and recently was the commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKSutley, who'll be Obama's science adviser if she's confirmed, worked for the EPA for six years and was the deputy secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, an energy adviser to former California Gov. Gray Davis and a member of the state's Water Resources Control Board. Her most recent job has been the deputy mayor for energy and environment in Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKThe Council on Environmental Quality coordinates the federal government's environmental policies.LiNeBrEaKSutley promised to "ensure that there is a strong science and policy basis for our environmental policy, to move the nation to greater reliance on clean energy and increase energy security, to combat global warming while growing the green economy, to protect public health and the environment, especially in vulnerable communities, and to protect and restore our great ecosystems."LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

Lebanon Daily News (Pennsylvania)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	OPINION: Gore's church losing followers  	COMMENTARY  	1073 words  	Jan. 15--In 1971, perhaps entertaining thoughts of entering the full-time ministry, Al Gore, raised in and baptized into the Southern Baptist Church, entered the Vanderbilt Divinity School.LiNeBrEaKHis sojourn was relatively brief. In three semesters, he enrolled in eight classes. He received an "F" as his grade in five of those classes. So, having failed out of school, he entered the family business, which was politics. But he apparently never lost his desire to enter a ministry, and since he couldn't make the grade in the conventional sense, he did the next best thing. He started his own religion.LiNeBrEaKThe result was the Church of Global Warming. With Gore as its high priest, the church was not long in establishing tenets of faith, nor in immediately branding those who refused to worship there as apostate. LiNeBrEaKThe tragedy is that Gore, in his tenure in the family business, learned well how to work the political system, and when he turned to evangelizing for his new church, he was able to effectively use what he learned as a politician to grant government sanction to that church, sanction that would have been vehemently opposed had he attempted to grant government sanction to the church in which he grew up.LiNeBrEaKNow, what began as government sanction is well on its way to becoming government policy. The establishment of the Church of Global Warming immediately attracted as acolytes those leftists orphaned by the collapse of the old Soviet Union, those who saw, and continue to see, free-market capitalism and individual liberty as grave threats. So convincing were they developing plausible pseudo-science and both faulty and falsified data that they were able to bring into the church those political leaders -- read United Nations -- who have long sought the destruction of the one bulwark standing against the encroaching tide of totalitarianism.LiNeBrEaKThe success of Gore's evangelical fervor can be seen in the apparent commitment of President-elect Barack Hussein Obama to some sort of cap-and-trade program, a program designed by Gore to create a personally lucrative market for a product that will be created by legislative fiat. The legislative fiats already in place, spurred by Gore and his followers, have played a major role in helping to bankrupt the American automobile industry, have driven up the cost of food, have hamstrung domestic energy exploration and production, and are threatening to destroy, through onerous taxation, the American livestock industry.LiNeBrEaKIt is possible, however, that the Church of Global Warming has reached its zenith. Despite its best efforts to brand as heretics those who would question the basic tenets of the church -- that global warming is man-made, that it is immediately imminent, and that the only salvation lies in the church -- there is increasing evidence that those tenets are, and always have been, wrong. A man named Khabibullo Abdusamatov, who heads a space-research laboratory in Russia, has suggested that the world is headed for global cooling, a hypothesis seconded by one of his countrymen, Dr. Oleg Sorokhtin, another respected scientist.LiNeBrEaKThe Russian scientists have been joined by many others who have examined the tenets of the Church of Global Warming not on data presented in the church's doxology but rather in the study of sunspots, something mankind has been doing with considerable interest since the early 17th century.LiNeBrEaKThe history of that study has indicated that there is a regular cycle to sunspot activity, and that those cycles correspond to global climate conditions. In the Maunder Minimum, the period from 1645 through 1715 and named after the man who identified it, there were few sunspots, and that 70-year period became known as the "Little Ice Age."LiNeBrEaKSunspot activity, it appears, is on the wane, and the result has been a gradual cooling of Earth's climate. Indeed, 2008 may be the first "coldest year" of the 21st century.LiNeBrEaKNot unsurprisingly, the Church of Global Warming has been quick to claim that the drop in temperatures is simply proof of the basic tenet of their faith, that man-made global warming does exist, hoping, no doubt, that what they have perceived and read about sunspot cycles will enable them to ignore temperature drops when sunspot activity increases and leads to rising temperatures.LiNeBrEaKIt is, however, interesting to note that the Green politicians in Europe, the elders of the Church of Global Warming who, like Gore, see the movement as a chance to enrich themselves, are suddenly finding themselves without support as record-low temperatures have eviscerated their propagandist efforts to evangelize, and take control of, the population.LiNeBrEaKLike Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, the Church of Global Warming has presented itself as an answer, a place of refuge, a shelter and a protection from the "sins" of the world, particularly the "sins" of the free world. Like Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, the Church of Global Warming is also designed to enrich its own coffers by separating its followers from their hard-earned dollars. The difference is that Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker relied on voluntary donations. The Church of Global Warming resorts to theft by taxation, all the while explaining that its fail-safe computer models, the holy scripture of the Church, prove the future.LiNeBrEaKSomehow, those computer models show just what the Church wants them to show, not entirely unlike the man who only recently conducted a study of the diminishing daylight in the Northern Hemisphere. That study, which he began conducting in the fall of 2008, indicated that the hemisphere was losing two minutes of daylight each day, and, according to the computer model, would result in complete darkness in the hemisphere by June 2009.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, there was a flaw in the computer model. It turns out that suddenly, the Northern Hemisphere is now gaining daylight with each passing day.LiNeBrEaKAnd the much-anticipated global warming is somehow being replaced by global cooling. Without any help at all from mankind.LiNeBrEaKSernoffsky can be reached at:LiNeBrEaKdansernoffsky@ldnews.com		EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (91%); CHRISTIANS and CHRISTIANITY (90%); PROTESTANTS and PROTESTANTISM (90%); RELIGION (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); POLITICS (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); CLERGY and RELIGIOUS (73%); BRANDING (68%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (65%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (63%); TAXES and TAXATION (50%)  			AL GORE (94%); BARACK OBAMA (52%)  	PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 16, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Lebanon Daily News   	Dan Sernoffsky, Lebanon Daily News, Pa.

Messenger-Inquirer (Owensboro, Kentucky)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky., Keith Lawrence column: Where is global warming when we need it?  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	627 words  	Jan. 15--OK, enough is enough!LiNeBrEaKChristmas is over.LiNeBrEaKAnd I'm ready for summer.LiNeBrEaKOr at least spring.LiNeBrEaKIt's colder than a witch's spit out there today.LiNeBrEaKIf I could find one of those global warming reports, I'd burn it in my trash can to get warm.LiNeBrEaKIf I had only thought to stash away a box or two of aerosol cans that contained chlorofluorocarbons before they were banned 20 years ago, I'd be out in the back yard squirting them at that alleged hole in the ozone. LiNeBrEaKAnything to get more heat on this planet.LiNeBrEaKYeah, I know we're not supposed to doubt global warming.LiNeBrEaKEven when we're half frozen.LiNeBrEaKIt's destroying the planet.LiNeBrEaKAll the experts say it's so.LiNeBrEaKEven Al Gore.LiNeBrEaKBut the National Weather Service just released a report last week that says 2008 was the coldest year in the United States since 1997.LiNeBrEaKEleven years ago.LiNeBrEaKAnd last month's average temperature of 32. 5 degrees coast-to-coast was 0. 9 degrees below the average for the entire 20th Century.LiNeBrEaKCan the glaciers be far behind?LiNeBrEaKProof positive that we're heading into a new ice age, right?LiNeBrEaKNo, say climate scientists at England's Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.LiNeBrEaKEven if 2008 was the coldest year in the U.S. in 11 years, it was still the 10th warmest on record since 1850, they say.LiNeBrEaKThe 10 warmest years on record, the scientists say, have all been since 1997.LiNeBrEaKThe hottest, by the way, was 1998, followed by 2005, 2003 and 2002.LiNeBrEaKSo even if my toes are numb today, it doesn't mean that global warming is a hoax?LiNeBrEaKNo, the climate scientists say.LiNeBrEaKEven in the 1980s, they say, last year would have felt warm.LiNeBrEaKAnd yeah, I've got to admit, I've lived through some bad winters since I've been in Owensboro.LiNeBrEaKWho can forget Jan. 19, 1994, when the mercury plunged all the way to a record 23 degrees below zero?LiNeBrEaKHeck, it never even got above zero on Jan. 18 and only climbed to 10 degrees above on the 19th.LiNeBrEaKThen, there was the 19 below on Jan. 20, 1989. And the 17 below on Jan. 11, 1977.LiNeBrEaKHeck, the winter of '77 saw 11 days with below zero temperatures in January -- and five of them were 10 degrees or more below zero.LiNeBrEaKI'm still shivering from that one.LiNeBrEaKScientists say global temperatures will remain about the same until 2015 and then begin to rise.LiNeBrEaKHallelujah!LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 15, 1998, -- 11 years ago today -- I wrote these words: "I was driving home Monday, just before dark. It was 55 degrees. My heater was turned off. Heck, I was thinking about rolling down the window.LiNeBrEaK"Joggers were everywhere, running alone and in packs. And most of them were wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts.LiNeBrEaK"So far this month, the only high less than 40 degrees was Tuesday's 34.

The New York Times 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Cabinet Choices Answer Questions From Senators Lisa P. Jackson  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY; Pg. 22  	411 words  	Lisa P. Jackson, chosen to head the Environmental Protection Agency, said Wednesday at her confirmation hearing that she would restore scientific and legal integrity to an agency battered by charges of political interference and coziness with industry. LiNeBrEaK  But Ms. Jackson  evaded questions on whether she would grant authority to California and 16 other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions, promising only a speedy review of the issue. Nor did she directly answer questions on whether and how the agency would address carbon dioxide regulation under the Clean Air Act, an authority granted the agency by the Supreme Court in 2007.LiNeBrEaK  Her promise to be guided by science and the law was an implicit rebuke of the management of the agency in the Bush administration, where career officials' recommendations were at times ignored. LiNeBrEaK  ''I understand the laws leave room for policy makers to make policy judgments,'' Ms. Jackson said in her opening statement to members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ''But if I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of E.P.A.'s technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Jackson holds degrees in chemical engineering from Tulane and Princeton. LiNeBrEaK  Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who heads the committee, said she had been waiting a long time for new leadership at the agency. LiNeBrEaK  ''E.P.A. works for the American people,'' Mrs. Boxer said, ''and in my view we have seen it hurt the American people these past eight years.''  LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Jackson, who was a career employee at the agency for 15 years and most recently served as head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said President-elect Barack Obama believed that sound stewardship of the environment could co-exist with economic growth.LiNeBrEaK  ''Done properly,'' she said, ''these goals can and should reinforce each other.''LiNeBrEaK  Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, cautioned against using the Clean Air Act to regulate so-called greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK  ''Ranchers and miners in Wyoming know that addressing climate change through the Clean Air Act is a disaster waiting to happen,'' Mr. Barrasso said.LiNeBrEaK  After questioning Ms. Jackson, the committee considered the appointment of Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK  Both nominees are expected to win quick confirmation.LiNeBrEaK  JOHN M.

The New York Times 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   The New York Times on the Web	E.P.A. Pick Vows to Put Science First  	Section ; Column 0; National Desk; Pg.   	798 words  	Lisa P. Jackson, chosen to head the Environmental Protection Agency, said at her confirmation hearing Wednesday morning that her first task would be to restore scientific and legal integrity to an agency battered by charges of political interference and coziness with industry.LiNeBrEaK  But she evaded questions on whether as administrator of the E.P.A. she would immediately grant authority to California and 16 other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions, promising only a speedy review of the issue. Nor did she directly answer questions on whether and how the agency would address regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, an authority granted the E.P.A. by the Supreme Court in 2007. LiNeBrEaK  The Bush administration has declined to act on either matter.LiNeBrEaK  Her promise to be guided by science and the law was an implicit rebuke of the management of the E.P.A. under President Bush, where career officials' recommendations were sometimes ignored in decisions regarding  lead in the air, arsenic in water, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK  ''Science must be the backbone of what E.P.A. does,'' Ms. Jackson said in her opening statement to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ''If I am confirmed, I will administer with science as my guide. I understand the laws leave room for policymakers to make policy judgments. But if I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of E.P.A.'s technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Jackson, 46, holds degrees in chemical engineering from Tulane University and Princeton University. She worked as a career employee at E.P.A. for 15 years and most recently served as head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection,LiNeBrEaK  Senator Barbara Boxer, chair of the committee, said she had waited a long time for new leadership at the environmental agency. ''E.P.A. works for the American people and in my view we have seen it hurt the American people these past eight years,'' she said. The agency, she added, ''needs to be awakened from a deep and nightmarish sleep.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Jackson  said that President-elect Barack Obama believes that sound stewardship of the environment can co-exist with economic growth. ''Done properly,'' she said, ''these goals can and should reinforce each other.''LiNeBrEaK  She said that the new administration's environmental priorities would be curbing global warming, reducing air pollution, cleaning up hazardous waste sites, regulating toxic chemicals and protecting water quality.LiNeBrEaK  Republicans on the committee expressed concern that Ms. Jackson would try to do too much at E.P.A. Senator John Barrasso, the newly-elected Republican from Wyoming, cautioned Ms. Jackson against using the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK  ''Ranchers and miners in Wyoming know that addressing climate change through the Clean Air Act is a disaster waiting to happen,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  That drew a rebuke from Ms. Boxer, who said that Mr. Barrasso had not read the Clean Air Act or did not accept Supreme Court decision giving the E.P.A. power to regulate carbon dioxide under it.LiNeBrEaK  The ranking Republican on the committee, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, noted that former Vice President Al Gore and many other experts of global warming had suggested that a tax on carbon would be a more effective means of reducing carbon emissions than a cap-and-trade system like the one advocated by President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Jackson said that it was a legitimate subject for debate, but that she would support Mr. Obama's preference for cap-and-trade, under which a limit is set on emissions and polluters must buy or trade permits to meet it.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Inhofe also made Ms. Jackson promise to read a speech   he delivered on the Senate floor last week, citing a number of scientists and other experts who question the consensus view on global warming.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Inhofe left Ms. Jackson, a native of New Orleans, with a warning. ''This job is no Mardi Gras,'' he said. ''This job is really tough.''LiNeBrEaK  After committee members finished questioning Ms. Jackson, they turned to the appointment of Nancy Sutley, 46, currently deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Sutley told the committee that she intended to move the nation toward reliance on cleaner forms of energy, to protect public health and to combat global warming. She did not detail how she, Ms. Jackson and Carol Browner, the designated White House coordinator for energy and the environment, would divide their responsibilities. Ms. Browner's post does not require Senate confirmation.LiNeBrEaK  Senator Boxer said she expected the committee to vote favorably on both nominees on Inauguration Day or shortly thereafter.	http://www.nytimes.com  	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); AIR QUALITY (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (78%); ENGINEERING (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); SUPREME COURTS (73%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (73%); US PRESIDENTS (72%); WATER POLLUTION (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (69%); CHEMICAL ENGINEERING (64%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (63%); INFRASTRUCTURE (53%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%)  	GEORGE W BUSH (56%); BARBARA BOXER (53%); BARACK OBAMA (52%); LISA P JACKSON (94%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); WYOMING, USA (92%); NEW JERSEY, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By JOHN M.

News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Storing sun's energy key to energy independence  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	782 words  	Jan. 15--It's widely accepted that our future energy needs will be met by experimental and theoretical technologies. Possibilities include "clean" coal, advanced "breeder" nuclear reactors, hydrogen fuel cells, and batteries with enough storage capacity to back up power plants.LiNeBrEaKNathan Lewis, a chemistry professor at the California Institute of Technology, has spent three decades researching another option: harnessing solar power to create fuels that can replace oil and gasoline. LiNeBrEaKLewis will give the keynote speech tonight in Chapel Hill to kick off a two-day conference at UNC exploring the future of solar energy. The conference marks the creation of the Solar Energy Research Center, a joint effort between UNC, Duke, N.C. Central, N.C. State and the University of Florida, which have are combining research in chemistry and polymers and other scientific disciplines. To fuel its research ambitions, the center has applied for a $25 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKLewis's address is open to the public tonight at 7 p.m. at the Stone Center Theater. The conference continues Friday but requires registration and has sold out.LiNeBrEaKHere are excerpts from Lewis's phone interview with NandO business reporter John Murawski.LiNeBrEaKNandO: Tell us what you'll be talking about.LiNeBrEaKLewis: I'm going to talk about where our energy comes from now. That gets at the scale of the energy problem. It's not fixing a few light bulbs in Fresno. It's not building 50 nuclear power plants. Even if you conserved energy at twice the level you need [it wouldn't be enough].LiNeBrEaKNandO: What would it take?LiNeBrEaKLewis: Something like 10,000 nuclear power plants within the next 50 years somewhere in the world. That's a pretty stunning number to most people, but it's in fact the scale of energy.LiNeBrEaKNandO: What else will you discuss?LiNeBrEaKLewis: I'll look at the resource base and tell you how much wind is there on our planet, and how much can be extracted, and how much can you get out of advanced biofuels, and how much can you get out of all the tides and coal-fired power plants and solar, and I'll look at the resource base to decide where the answers lie and where they don't.LiNeBrEaKNandO: How are we going to offset 10,000 nuclear power plants?LiNeBrEaKLewis: If you care about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, if energy demand is going to double, and if you have to cut emissions by 80 percent, then basically you have to save as much energy as all the energy we use today combined, and you have to make as much clean energy as we use today combined, and you have to do that within our lifetime. It's possible. We can't do it by talking about it. We have to do it by getting serious about doing it.LiNeBrEaKNandO: How does the sun fit into this picture?LiNeBrEaKLewis: More energy from the sun hits the earth in one hour than all the energy consumed on our planet in an entire year. We just can't run all our factories for one hour at full bore and then shut them down for the rest of the year. To exploit the sun and to have a technical energy systems solution you have to capture, convert and store it. We still don't have a way to store electricity on a massive scale. If you can't store it, you can't do much with it, and it's especially pronounced when you have intermittent resources, like wind and solar. In principle, you could rely on them [solar and wind power] exclusively.LiNeBrEaKNandO: Describe your research.LiNeBrEaKLewis: I work in technologies to capture, convert and store sunlight. Solar paint: stuff you can paint on your roof, and maybe ultimately make fuel directly. Artificial photosynthesis: How do you build a leaf? Nature built it. We know it works. We just gotta figure out a way to do it ourselves better.LiNeBrEaKI've been working on the fundamentals in wet solar cells for about 30 years. They can directly make fuel -- unlike the ones we're used to thinking about now that only make electricity. We would like to make a liquid fuel because it would be easier to put in cars. We have hints that it works but we don't have any product yet.LiNeBrEaKNandO: How long do you think it'll take us to get there?LiNeBrEaKLewis: How long does it take a chicken to hatch a golden egg?LiNeBrEaKNandO: That's never happened, has it?LiNeBrEaKLewis: Well, there's one way: Buy more chickens. If we had more research, we'd have greater odds of actually getting something out quicker.

North Adams Transcript (Massachusetts)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Local farmers concerned about EPA's rumored 'cow tax'  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	707 words  	Jan. 15--Despite continuing reports that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering a tax on livestock as part of efforts to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions, officials at the government agency maintain the "cow tax" is a misunderstanding.LiNeBrEaKBut even the thought of such an idea concerns local farmers. LiNeBrEaK"It wouldn't help us, that is for sure," said James Hoellerich, whose brother Roy co-owns Hales Hill Farm LLC in Adams. "I don't think it 's necessary. Farmers are not doing that great and never have."LiNeBrEaKVictor Ziemba, owner of Ziemba Farm in Adams, and John Gwozdz, co-owner of Hales Hill Farm, said taxing farms for each of their cows would be devastating to the family-run businesses barely able to make ends meet.LiNeBrEaK"I think it would put everybody out of business. It would be too expensive to compete," said Gwozdz, whose farm has about 100 cows.LiNeBrEaKA news release from the New York Farm Bureau in November 2008 stated that the tax could be as high as $175 per animal -- a figure often cited in news articles since, even after the EPA tried to dispel the rumor.LiNeBrEaK"If it was $5 a cow, we could handle it, but even $100 a cow is too much," Gwozdz said.LiNeBrEaKZiemba, who has about 175 cows on his farm, said he disagrees with a tax on the animals, and there is no reason for it.LiNeBrEaK"I'd say it would put most farmers out of business, and they can't stay in business now with the price of milk goingLiNeBrEaKdown," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe said another tax would put his farm out of business, and it can barely afford to stay in business now.LiNeBrEaK"We're working seven days a week, and we still lose money," he said.LiNeBrEaKZiemba, Gwozdz and Hoellerich agreed there are other ways to combat greenhouse gas emissions besides taxing livestock.LiNeBrEaK"They should put people first, and then get to the animals," Hoellerich said.LiNeBrEaKJonathan Schradar, spokesman for the EPA, said Tuesday the agency is a long way from addressing global climate change by taxing the country's livestock population.LiNeBrEaK"There is a lot to do with human-created issues before we talk about volcanos and livestock," Schradar said.LiNeBrEaKHe said the whole misunderstanding of the EPA's intentions began when the agency put out an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking last year, asking the public whether emissions from automobiles should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. For the EPA to take action against auto emissions, it would have to declare all greenhouse gas emissions dangerous to public health and classify them as pollutants -- that would include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Agriculture then submitted comments against any regulation because it would mean methane, which is a natural byproduct of livestock, would have to be regulated.LiNeBrEaK"From that, our friends at the farm bureau then decided to make it an issue that the EPA wanted to institute a cow tax," Schradar said.LiNeBrEaKThe Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the control of greenhouse gases was signed by EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson in June 2008, and the public comment period on the document ended in November 2008.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the document, in 2006, the agricultural sector contributed 8 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to 34 percent from electrical generation, 28 percent from transportation, 19 percent from industry, 6 percent from commercial and 5 percent from the residential sector.LiNeBrEaKSchradar said the EPA has yet to do anything about regulating greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"There is no such thing as a cow tax. The EPA is not proposing one. It's all rumor," he said.LiNeBrEaKCheryl Lekstrom, director of member relations with the Massachusetts Farm Bureau, said Tuesday the EPA was looking for a way to address emissions being produced from farms, but nothing had been proposed.LiNeBrEaK"We just know of it by rumor," she said of the cow tax.LiNeBrEaKTo reach Meghan Foley, e-mail mfoley@thetranscript.com		ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (91%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); MAMMALS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (89%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); FOOD SAFETY REGULATION (78%); METHANE (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE (78%); FAMILY COMPANIES (68%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%); NEW YORK FARM BUREAU (55%)  		UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009    	Meghan Foley, North Adams Transcript, Mass.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Bush says farewell: A final measuring  	COMMENTARY  	317 words  	Jan. 15--President Bush bids farewell to the nation tonight (at 8 p.m.) in a nationally broadcast speech. Many will say "Good riddance!" But for all of George W. Bush's failings, there were accomplishments. LiNeBrEaKIndeed, Mr. Bush's "misunderestimation" of post-Saddam Iraq leads the pack of failings. His expansion of the entitlement state will haunt us for generations. So, too, will his fealty to the educratic state, his refusal to check congressional spendthrifts and an "immigration policy" that mocks the phrase.LiNeBrEaKAnd history will show that his acquiescence to massive government economic intervention, invoked in the name of preventing calamity, helped only to prolong the shakeout so necessary to keeping capitalism robust.LiNeBrEaKBut there were tax rate cuts that helped pull the nation out of an inherited economic downturn, cuts that likely are responsible for keeping the current recession from being even worse. Supreme Court appointees John Roberts and Sam Alito were masterstrokes for constitutionalism. And Bush recognized the danger of the Kyoto global warming treaty and scuttled it.LiNeBrEaKOffered Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963: "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."LiNeBrEaKEven by that measure, history most likely will not deal kindly with George W. Bush. But things could have been worse. After all, Al Gore or John Kerry could have been president.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: The Thursday wrap  	COMMENTARY  	310 words  	Jan. 15--Stuff 'em: You might recall that five of the pirates who were paid $3 million to release a Saudi oil tanker drowned last week as they made their escape. Well, at least one of the bodies washed ashore on the coast of Somalia with more than $150,000 in cash on his person. Might we make a suggestion (other than to stop negotiating with pirates)? The body of this pirate and any others recovered should be stuffed and each one mounted on the bow of a supertanker. LiNeBrEaKUnsettled science: Uh-oh. Peer-reviewed science has just thrown some more sand into the gears of the Carbon Commandos' theory of global warming. A Danish study published this week in the Videnskab and Geology journals suggests the relationship between the Earth's magnetic field and galactic cosmic ray particles -- not human emissions -- is responsible for climate change. Yet another indication that the "settled science" of global warming is not.LiNeBrEaKAnd they're off!: Former state Revenue Secretary Tom Wolf has become the first candidate to announce for Pennsylvania governor for 2010. Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, will be able to mount a well-funded campaign, given his personal wealth from a business supply company. No fewer than four other Democrats and four Republicans are weighing a run to replace Ed Rendell, who's constitutionally barred from seeking a third four-year term. Ah, a 16-month gubernatorial primary race. We're fatigued already.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   SOONER EDITION	PAIR HOPE FARM SPROUTS ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN   	FOOD; Pg. E-2  	1244 words  	W?ASHINGTON -- Daniel Bowman Simon and Casey Gustowarow didn't really have a plan when they set off on a cross-country drive in a topsy-turvy school bus with herbs, greens and root vegetables planted on the roof. But they didn't think they needed one. Their cause seemed so pure, so obviously righteous: to persuade the next president of the United States to grow food on the White House lawn.LiNeBrEaKBut that was August. The days were bright and hot. And the only obstacle to an abundance of spinach and Swiss chard were 60-mph headwinds and highway fumes. In December, it was a different story.LiNeBrEaKOn one day when they were parked at the edge of a farmers market here, sheets of rain lashed the bus. It was too cold to sleep in the bus, too cold to grow anything on the roof, too miserable for anyone to stop and sign the White House Organic Farm (WHO Farm) petition. LiNeBrEaKMr. Simon and Mr. Gustowarow have traveled through 25 states and collected 10,000 signatures. But they've yet to hear whether President-elect Barack Obama will consent to transform the South Lawn into a working farm.LiNeBrEaKMr. Simon, 28, and Mr. Gustowarow, 27, aren't the first, or the most famous, to lobby for a White House garden. The idea became a cause celebre for food lovers during the presidential election campaign. Chez Panisse chef-owner Alice Waters and author Michael Pollan, gods of the sustainable-food movement, called on the new president to plant organic fruits and vegetables to feed the first family and stock local food pantries.LiNeBrEaKIn February, Maine gardener Roger Doiron launched an online campaign, dubbed Eat the View, with the same goal.LiNeBrEaKAdvocates say a first family garden could set an example for millions of Americans and, by promoting sustainable food, help tackle the awesome challenges of climate change, food safety and energy conservation.LiNeBrEaKThe pair have made great sacrifices for the cause. Mr. Gustowarow left his job on a farm near Annapolis to make the cross-country journey. Mr. Simon paid $42,000 for a yellow school bus with half of another bus welded upside down on its top. Topsy Turvy, as the bus is known, was owned by Ben Cohen of Ben and Jerry's fame, who had it purpose-built to demonstrate what he saw as the country's upside-down budget priorities. The pair's four-month-long, 11,000-mile journey coincided with record prices at the gas pump -- and the bus averages only seven or eight miles to the gallon. "I'm in a lot of debt," Mr. Simon shrugs. "But it's what I'm excited about."LiNeBrEaKIn a time of war and recession, a garden might not be at the top of the executive agenda. And it's not clear whether Mr. Simon and Mr. Gustowarow can put it there. They have little in common with many of the ambitious staffers who come to Washington. They're dreamers: soft-spoken, humble and more interested in their cause than in connections.LiNeBrEaKThe friends met in 2003 while working in the Philippines for the Peace Corps. After returning home, Mr. Gustowarow went to work on a farm; Mr. Simon went to New York to help develop green roof projects.LiNeBrEaKIn February, Mr. Simon attended a conference at Harvard University. There, Ms. Waters was honored and gave a speech in which she said that her two dreams were to create gardens at schools across the country and to see food grown on the White House lawn, as it had been in the past. Mr. Simon was inspired: "I thought, this is an idea that deserves a grassroots movement. Alice Waters is someone who deserves to have her dreams come true."LiNeBrEaKBefore setting off on their journey the pair contacted Ms. Waters, who blessed the venture. They set up a platform bed in the back of the bus, decked the ceiling with American flags and stocked the "kitchen" shelves with spices, oil, grains and ready-made soup.LiNeBrEaKThey planted herbs and root crops in lightweight soil on the roof, and on Aug. 4 they set off from New York to San Francisco. They had three weeks to make it to Slow Food Nation, the country's largest food festival, held on Labor Day weekend.LiNeBrEaKThere, Mr. Simon and Mr. Gustowarow parked the bus alongside the "victory garden" planted in front of San Francisco's City Hall, where they solicited signatures from thousands of like-minded food lovers.LiNeBrEaKMr. Pollan came aboard the bus for a chat. The pair even drove to Berkeley for lunch with Ms. Waters at Chez Panisse. They don't remember what they ate; "she picked the menu," Mr. Gustowarow says.LiNeBrEaKFrom there, they traveled organically across the South. Mr. Simon says they set their sights on places "where we would be preaching to the choir, then seeing where the choir led us." They visited schools in Oakland and Berkeley. In Arizona, they stopped in Flagstaff and Sedona, where they drove out to Republican presidential nominee John McCain's ranch, only to be shooed away by the Secret Service.LiNeBrEaKIn Lubbock, Texas, they hooked up with cheesemaker Nancy Patton of Haute Goat Creamery. "I was having drinks with my father at the retirement village when the phone rang, and this kid told me he was driving across the country in an upside-down school bus. The first thing I'm thinking is, 'How did you get my number?' "LiNeBrEaKMs. Patton, a self-described conservative Republican, was impressed, however. "I thought it was a different stop for someone to pitch a cause like that. We're pretty cowboy here," she says. She put out a local press release and booked Mr. Simon and Mr. Gustowarow on the local Fox morning news program. Then she called a friend and asked him to design some T-shirts for them.LiNeBrEaK"My approach is a little different than theirs," she says. "But I just appreciate what they are doing. My question is: Who would be against this?"LiNeBrEaKGood question.LiNeBrEaKThere is a history of agriculture at the White House. Its first tenant, John Adams, planted a garden shortly after taking up residence in 1800. Woodrow Wilson brought in sheep to mow and fertilize the White House lawn in 1918, an effort to conserve resources for the war effort. In 1943, over the objection of the Agriculture Department, Eleanor Roosevelt planted a victory garden, inspiring millions of Americans to grow their own food.LiNeBrEaKSince then, however, only herbs have been grown at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.LiNeBrEaKJimmy Carter, a Georgia farmer who extolled the virtues of gardening during his campaign, declined calls in 1978 to plant a vegetable garden at the White House.LiNeBrEaKThe issue has not been raised again seriously until now.LiNeBrEaKThe WHO Farm petition goes further than other similar calls to action. Mr. Simon and Mr. Gustowarow want schoolchildren and disabled Americans to work in the White House garden, a request that might pose a tricky security challenge.LiNeBrEaK(Mr. Simon says including more participants in the project will make it more viable.) They also ask, among other things, that the gardeners plant heirloom seeds and use compost made from food waste from the kitchens that serve the White House, congressional buildings and Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKHe and Mr. Gustowarow plan to upload their petition to change.gov, the Obama-Biden transition Web site, before the inauguration, then send it to the White House by mail.LiNeBrEaKThe petition will remain open, Mr. Simon says, until there is a garden on the White House lawn. It can be signed atthewhofarm.org.LiNeBrEaKIn the new year, Mr. Gustowarow is hoping to find a piece of land to farm. Mr. Simon will continue on his quest.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not terribly optimistic this will happen the day (the Obamas) move into the White House," Mr. Simon says. "I think we've planted a seed -- no pun intended -- that opens up the possibility."

For additional information call 440-257-2507. LiNeBrEaKBirds descending from the vast boreal forests that cover a billion acres of Canada have brightened up the past several winters in Northeast Ohio.LiNeBrEaKCommon redpolls, evening grosbeaks, white-winged crossbills and pine grosbeaks have invaded our area in extraordinary numbers, joining the annual waves of boreal visitors such as tree and white-throated sparrows, dark-eyed juncoes, saw-whet owls and Bonaparte's gulls.LiNeBrEaKBut as Obi-Wan Kenobi says, there is a "great disturbance in the force."LiNeBrEaKThe vast incubator for up to 5 billion birds is under siege by mining, oil and timber interests that threaten to alter forever the natural world as we know it.LiNeBrEaKAlready, surveys have documented disturbing drops in the numbers of familiar birds that we welcome to our yards, parks and lakes each year.LiNeBrEaKSome of the population losses are noticeable only anecdotally. For instance, birds we consider common here, such as chestnut-sided and blackpoll warblers, least flycatchers and Swainson's thrushes, are experiencing significant drops, according to research conducted by the Canadian Boreal Initiative.LiNeBrEaKCommon nighthawks, winter wrens, kinglets and barn and bank swallows are also showing troubling trends.LiNeBrEaKEven some of our favorite winter visitors are exhibiting the ill effects of habitat loss and climate change. Birds such as Northern harriers, pine siskins, Northern flickers, purple finches and sparrows: white-throated, white-crowned, song, vesper, and juncoes.LiNeBrEaKI previously wrote about the bird suffering the most precipitous decline - the rusty blackbird - which has lost 11 percent to 16 percent of its numbers on its boreal breeding grounds.LiNeBrEaKWhat can we do?LiNeBrEaKIncreasing our awareness of this crisis is one thing. Several Web sites documenting the problem are listed below.LiNeBrEaKSupporting organizations such as the National Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy and the Sierra Club are other ways to help.LiNeBrEaKThe latest Audubon magazine chronicles the impact that human and natural forces are having on the boreal forest. The article places much of the onus on the timber industry, with 65 percent of its produce going to pulp and paper manufacturing.LiNeBrEaKCiting the mailing of 20 billion unsolicited catalogs a year, there is a groundswell of grass roots support for a Do Not Mail system similar to the Do Not Call registry. To learn more about this proposal, go to www.catalogcutdown.org.LiNeBrEaKThe province of Ontario has taken the lead in preventive actions, moving to protect more than half of its remaining northern boreal forests - 55 million acres of wilderness - from commercial logging, drilling and mining. Other actions have been taken to preserve more than 36 million acres of the Northwest Territory and much of Quebec's forests.LiNeBrEaKLet's hope the rest of Canada follows suit. If not for us, then for the generations of birders to come.LiNeBrEaKFor details, go to www.LiNeBrEaKsaveourborealbirds.org, www.LiNeBrEaKborealbirds.org and www.LiNeBrEaKborealcanada.ca.LiNeBrEaKSightingsLiNeBrEaKIce on the lake and huge floes of fish are making for fabulous gull-watching at the East 72nd Street warm-water release site in Cleveland's Gordon State Park. Jen Brumfield led a Local Patch birding tour group to the site on Friday and hit a home run with nine gull species, including a black-headed. Unfortunately, they don't have black heads in winter; Brumfield suggests scanning the Bonaparte's gulls for dark black flashes under the wings' primary feathers. The numbers of white-winged gulls are staggering, the lesser black-backed gulls have returned after several weeks absent, and the Bonaparte's gulls are so numerous they look like giant shape-shifting clouds when the fly. The prospects for rarities are only going to increase as the ice fills in the open spots on the lake.LiNeBrEaKA possible black-legged kittiwake showed up at East 72nd Street on Sunday.LiNeBrEaKA rough-legged hawk and a Northern shrike were highlights of a morning walk through Inga Schmidt's Geauga County neighborhood.

Post and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Penguin exhibit site squeezed into place  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	664 words  	Jan. 15--Looking like little more than a giant plastic foam cooler, a new penguin exhibit required a true feat of logistics to land in its new home at the South Carolina Aquarium on Wednesday morning.LiNeBrEaKThe 8,000-pound structure arrived by tractor-trailer from North Carolina at the State Ports Authority's Union Pier Terminal on Monday. From there, it was transported on a barge over to the aquarium, where a crane lifted it onto the terrace.LiNeBrEaKA crew from All Carolina Crane Rental and Equipment guided the exhibit by dollies from there into the aquarium. LiNeBrEaKBefore bringing in the new ecosystem, the aquarium had to dismantle a wall so the 12-foot-long and 10-foot-high structure could squeeze in. Also, a revamped version of the aquarium's touch tank was moved upstairs to accommodate the flightless birds.LiNeBrEaKIf all goes as hoped, the effort and expense will pay off. Penguins, a proven visitor draw, could give a needed boost to the attraction's slumping numbers &acirc;[#x20ac]" attendance dropped 8 percent between 2007 and 2008.LiNeBrEaKKevin Kampwerth, director of brand communications, stood outside as a crew prepared to lift the man-made habitat. "On the floor yesterday people were already asking about penguins," he said. "We think they will be a great opportunity to get some people back in here."LiNeBrEaKThe aquatic birds won't arrive at their new home until late February. And until the exhibit's March 21 opening, Penguin Planet will remain behind a dark curtain.LiNeBrEaKThe aquarium will have as many as six birds on loan from a SeaWorld facility until the exhibit ends in March 2010. The particular species, the Magellanic penguin, stands a little taller than two feet and hails primarily from Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands.LiNeBrEaK"They can't fly a lick, but they are amazing swimmers," said Kevin Mills, the aquarium's president and chief executive officer. "Even when they're standing still, it's hard to suppress a smile."LiNeBrEaKAs the new exhibit made its way inside the aquarium Wednesday, Mills said, "People come up to our door and ask, Do we have penguins? We'll be happy to tell them 'yes' pretty soon."LiNeBrEaKThough the penguins mark the aquarium's only diversion from a cast of all in-state species, the birds will be used to explain climate change at a local level.LiNeBrEaK"They're wonderful ambassadors for all the world's wildlife, because the issues that penguins face in the wild &acirc;[#x20ac]" whether it's climate change, habitat loss or human encroachment &acirc;[#x20ac]" are issues that all animals face today," Mills said.LiNeBrEaKThe 550-square-foot exhibit includes an entire life-support system to clean the air and water, according to Jason Crichton, director of husbandry and facilities at the aquarium.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of the exhibit to the aquarium has not been finalized.LiNeBrEaKBecause penguins eat and excrete quickly, to keep their weight down and to stay warm, "the birds tend to be a little smelly," Crichton said. So those filtration systems not only keep the animals clean but also keep visitors comfortable.LiNeBrEaKMagellanic penguins require a water temperature between 60 degrees and 70 degrees, according to Chip Harshaw of Animal Interaction Design Group, which designed the exhibit.LiNeBrEaK"They live in Argentina and Chile," he said. "They're temperate birds and live in a place where it could be 100 degrees or 40 degrees."LiNeBrEaKHe said the exhibit, built in the late 1990s and previously used at the Virginia Aquarium, includes two nesting boxes. When the Charleston penguin attraction ends next year, the structure will be returned to Animal Interaction Design Group.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, it will go on to somebody else," Harshaw said.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Environment and economy  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 6  	171 words  	Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas wants to loosen the state s famous Act 250, which imposes among the nation s toughest land-use rules. He says it s hurting the economy by making businesses leery of building, and that more attention should be paid to the economic and social benefits of development plans, not just the environmental ones. And he wants to speed up the development-approval process. LiNeBrEaKHe wasn t saying this during the  boom  a couple of years ago. But then, the big political issue in the country a year ago was Iraq and the surging price of gasoline. A bad economy usually trumps environmentalism. The anxiety about losing your job, after all, tends to be more intense than that about, say, global warming.LiNeBrEaKMr. Douglas is a liberal Republican of the Nelson Rockefeller stripe, and no anti-government crusader. He is responding to the general economic anxiety. But given that the whole country s economy is tanking, you have to wonder if Act 250 really has much to do with what s happening to the Green Mountain State s economy.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   All Editions	Jackson vows resolve at EPA helm;  Says she won't let politics sway policy 	NEWS; Pg. A01  	901 words  	Former state environmental commissioner Lisa P. Jackson pledged aggressive action to combat pollution and global warming if confirmed as administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKTestifying before a Senate Committee on Wednesday, Jackson acknowledged a daunting agenda that would reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and other air pollution, clean up hazardous waste sites, reduce toxic chemicals and protect the nation's waters. "These five problems are tough, but so is our resolve to conquer them," Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKSeated directly behind Jackson at her confirmation hearing were Upper Ringwood residents Vivian Milligan, Jay Van Dunk, Wayne Mann and Veronica Van Dunk. Personal guests of Jackson and first-time visitors to the Capitol, they sat calmly as photographers hovered. LiNeBrEaKAs commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, Jackson called for faster cleanup of the site in Ringwood where Ford Motor Co. dumped tons of toxic waste more than 40 years ago from its former Mahwah plant. Now in its fifth EPA-supervised cleanup, the tainted area was the only one in the nation to be relisted as a Superfund site.LiNeBrEaKFor decades, residents, many of them members of the Ramapough tribe, have complained that Ford's paint sludge caused elevated rates of cancer, asthma in nearly every household, unexplained rashes and premature death. After an EPA cleanup, residents took officials on a tour of their neighborhood where chunks of gray, wrinkled sludge tainted the community.LiNeBrEaK"They and too many other Ramapoughs have lived on top of a Superfund site for decades," Jackson said during the hearing. "They are vivid reminders to me of how EPA can be a force for good if it does its job well and what can go wrong if EPA falls short."LiNeBrEaK"Now we have a strong voice in the EPA," Mann said before the hearing began. "I am honored to be Lisa's guest."LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, hailed Jackson's nomination as a course correction from the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"We have seen the agency move in a direction diametrically opposed to the mission it was established to achieve," she said.LiNeBrEaKOverall, Jackson was met with enthusiasm from many committee members, particularly the Democrats. Although there was mention of the DEP's handling of a toxic site in South Jersey where children were allowed to attend a day care center, the issue passed quickly.LiNeBrEaKJackson's hearing went so smoothly, in fact, that the committee has decided to release her nomination for a full vote by the Senate in the coming days.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who once served as Governor Corzine's chief of staff, was accompanied by her husband and appeared at ease, having testified several times before Congress in the past. She was introduced by New Jersey Sens. Frank R. Lautenberg and Bob Menendez. Jackson had met with several committee members in recent days to discuss her record and plans for the EPA, where she had worked for 15 years before joining the DEP in 2002.LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Senate, Jackson would join President-elect Barack Obama's so-called Green Dream Team, charged with developing energy independence and creating green jobs, key components of Obama's economic recovery plan.LiNeBrEaKRepublican committee members expressed concerns not with Jackson as much as with Obama's policies, particularly about the economic impact of addressing global warming, which they say will drive up energy costs. The Democrats, however, believe the search for solutions will create jobs that bolster the economy.LiNeBrEaKJackson testified that she would stress "scientific integrity" and the "rule of law" in making policy at the agency. In a poll of members of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a national organization, 60 percent said their research had been subjected to political interference during the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKLautenberg and Menendez praised Jackson's tenure in New Jersey, where she wrote the state's climate-change laws, developed the energy master plan and enjoyed support from both sides of the political aisle.LiNeBrEaK"Lisa Jackson has the energy, expertise and experience we need to revitalize the EPA," Lautenberg said.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has to take a more muscular role in Superfund cleanups, he said. During the 1990s the agency averaged more than 80 Superfund cleanups per year compared with just 30 last year, he said.LiNeBrEaKJackson, 46, a Princeton-educated engineer, would become the first African-American to lead the agency of 20,000 employees.LiNeBrEaKSeveral community and environmental groups have backed her nomination, including the Sierra Club's New Jersey Chapter and New Jersey Audubon Society.LiNeBrEaKSince her nomination, a handful of environmental groups have lobbied against her appointment, including the national Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) and Edison Wetlands Association. Critics have charged that Jackson's leadership of the DEP was flawed, especially in the site remediation program. But Jackson's supporters say the program was already under duress before she took office. In 1994 there were 270 case managers and 12,000 contaminated sites. There are now 150 cases managers and 20,000 sites.LiNeBrEaKOn a personal note, Jackson said she understands concerns with air pollution and its role in creating asthma in the population, especially in children. One of Jackson's two sons suffers from asthma and was hospitalized over Christmas.LiNeBrEaKE-mail: layton@northjersey.com		ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (94%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); WATER POLLUTION (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP (90%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (90%); SUPERFUND (89%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (85%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); CHILDREN (78%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); GOVERNORS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); ASTHMA (73%) OBAMA; APPOINTMENT; ENVIRONMENT; OFFICIAL  	FORD MOTOR CO (84%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%)  	BARACK OBAMA (59%); BARBARA BOXER (53%); BOB MENENDEZ (50%); JON CORZINE (50%); FRANK LAUTENBERG (50%); LISA P JACKSON (96%) LISA JACKSON  	NEW JERSEY, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO, JOE BRIER/SPECIAL TO THE RECORD - Lisa P.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Final Edition	Put a Price On Carbon  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A-11  	708 words  	All of us who recognize that man-made emissions are creating the climate crisis also realize that the surest way to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate the problem is to put a price on fossil carbon itself. For the past eight years the only solution deemed politically viable was a cap-and-trade system because Americans aren't thought to be mature enough to use the term "taxes" in debates about public policy. Well, much has changed since Nov. 3, 2008.LiNeBrEaK What hasn't changed is the need for speed. We are already above what many now consider the safe level of atmospheric CO2 - 350 PPM. LiNeBrEaK This week Gov. Tim Kaine announced four new incentives "to promote green jobs as part of his Renew Virginia initiative." Each one of these initiatives, however, will fail unless there is a sure and rising price for carbon. If Virginians want to see a new green economy that creates energy security and new jobs, and begins to slow climate-killing carbon emissions, we must be concerned about the carbon pricing mechanism itself.LiNeBrEaK If speed matters then we should realize that cap-and-trade is a formula for delay. For starters, there is no consensus on how CO2 allocations (the key to capping carbon emissions) will be distributed: free to big polluters, auctioned freely, or some sort of hybrid system? What doesn't even exist today is a working U.S. market for these carbon allocations - and who thinks that, from the ashes of the financial markets, a new dependable system will soon arise? The much smaller carbon trading system recently inaugurated in New England has taken years to work out. The one in the EU also took years to work out and a recent GAO report says that it has failed: CO2 emissions are worse now than they were in 1990.LiNeBrEaK ANY FORM OF carbon pricing will provide incentives to develop alternative energy, even prices set on carbon by a cap-and-trade system. The real incentive, however, for such Innovation-creating investment is the long-term assurance of a stable premium on fossil fuels. Look at the dampening effect on fuel-saving investments the current swing in gasoline prices is having. Supporters of cap-and-trade point to the successful effort to reduce SO2 and NOx through such a mechanism. Yet price volatility - on average 17 percent a month - was a hallmark of that very limited system. Prices swings in the European Union's system are equally volatile.LiNeBrEaK Cap-and trade suffers from many other defects as well, but since speed in responding is the goal, our leaders should be urging a national, if not global, direct tax on carbon. Administered far upstream, at the refinery, mine head, natural gas processor, or port of entry, the tax is transparent, can be collected with no additional bureaucracy, and can be implemented in six months.LiNeBrEaK Economists who have studied this subject believe that, since virtually all the products that will be covered by a carbon tax are already being taxed in one way or another, a national tax could easily cover 90 percent of the sources of carbon emissions. Just last week, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of Exxon, called for carbon taxes as a "more direct, more transparent, and more effective approach" than cap-and trade.LiNeBrEaK A BIG PROBLEM with cap-and-trade is that no one wants to discuss openly what happens to the revenues derived from that system: Do they reward existing polluters, do they become another government (albeit greatly diminished because of middle-man profits) revenue stream, or is there some other way that these funds will be used?LiNeBrEaK Carbon taxes can be structured to be revenue neutral if that is what the politics demand, but whatever happens to the revenue stream will be a decision by our elected leaders and not by shadowy, unregulated financial markets.LiNeBrEaK Thomas Friedman, in Hot, Flat and Crowded, when comparing cap-and-trade to carbon taxes, opts for the latter, saying: "We have to go from 'this is the best we can do' to 'this is how we are going to do it best.' "LiNeBrEaK That is the formula for creating jobs, reducing carbon emissions, and restoring America's leadership role as we seek to save our planet in peril.LiNeBrEaKAl Weed is the chairman of Public Policy Virginia, a Charlottesville-based think tank working on climate change issues.

The Santa Fe New Mexican (New Mexico)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Bills would resolve water claims, create preserves  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	676 words  	Jan. 15--Resolution to a major tribal water-rights case, a new wilderness area and a new preserve in an area containing fossilized footprints are among the New Mexico projects included in a massive package of water and public lands bills the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on this afternoon.LiNeBrEaKThe Omnibus Public Lands Management Act is sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. It contains 160 bills, of which 15 directly impact New Mexico. The Senate voted 68-24 Wednesday morning to end debate on the act and take it to a vote. If the Senate approves the act, it will go to the House. LiNeBrEaKAmong the bills are two that settle water-rights claims of the Navajo Nation, the state's largest tribe, to the San Juan River. The bill calls for approval of a 2005 settlement between New Mexico and the tribe, guaranteeing the Navajos the rights to 600,000 acre-feet of water per year for farming, cities, households and industrial uses. The bill authorizes federal funding over the next two decades for a pipeline to serve portions of the Navajo Nation and the city of Gallup. The bill authorizes $870 million to build the pipeline, with some of the cost paid by the state and the communities served.LiNeBrEaKA group of irrigators along the San Juan have protested against the settlement, saying it cedes too much water to the tribe and will harm other water-rights holders in the basin. Bingaman said, however, it will end decades of litigation and the potential for more litigation over water rights in the Four Corners area and will protect other water-rights holders.LiNeBrEaKThe omnibus bill does not include approval or funding for two other New Mexico Pueblo water-rights settlements -- the Aamodt case, which involves four pueblos in the Pojoaque Valley, and another one concerning Taos Pueblo -- according to Bingaman's spokeswoman Jude McCartin.LiNeBrEaKOne portion of the omnibus bill establishes a nationwide conservation system within the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and another portion, the Secure Water Act promoted by Bingaman, calls for a nationwide effort to quantify water resources and increase water efficiency.LiNeBrEaKThe act recognizes eight "major reclamation basins" that are included for study under the bill, including the Rio Grande. Under the bill, the U.S. Geologic Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies would coordinate efforts to determine the impact of climate change on water supplies in the basins and how that would affect available water for cities, wildlife and energy production.LiNeBrEaKThe omnibus bill also:LiNeBrEaKu Designates 16,030 acres of BLM land in northeastern New Mexico as the Sabinoso Wilderness, a bill U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. championed when he was a U.S. representative.LiNeBrEaKu Establishes the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument to protect a major deposit of Paleozoic Era fossilized footprints of amphibians, reptiles and insects in the Robledo Mountains in Southern New Mexico.LiNeBrEaKu Creates the Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area near Fort Stanton to protect a series of newly explored underground caves.LiNeBrEaKu Reauthorizes the Rio Puerco Watershed Management Program, which Bingaman first wrote into law in 1996 and which has helped restore much of the 7,000-square-mile degraded watershed.LiNeBrEaKu Creates a preservation program for the historic Route 66 Corridor, which crosses through New Mexico.LiNeBrEaKu Authorizes the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System project to build a pipeline from Ute Lake to Eastern New Mexico communities.LiNeBrEaKu Funds the restoration of irrigation projects along the Rio Grande for several pueblos.LiNeBrEaKContact Staci Matlock at 470-9843 or smatlock@sfnewmexican.com		WATER RIGHTS (91%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); WILDERNESS (89%); NATIONAL PARKS (89%); APPROVALS (89%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (78%); IRRIGATION (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (72%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (72%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (64%); CLIMATE CHANGE (60%); WATER QUALITY (60%)  			JEFF BINGAMAN (84%); TOM UDALL (50%)  	NEW MEXICO, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Santa Fe New Mexican   	Staci Matlock, The Santa Fe New Mexican  			Arts  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090115-SF-Bills-would-resolve-water-claims-create-preserves-0115  	SF  									
The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	The Salt Lake Tribune Rebecca Walsh column: Walsh: How to work the media  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	580 words  	Jan. 15--You have to give the Congress of Racial Equality credit: They know how to throw a dog-and-pony show.LiNeBrEaKParachuting into town yesterday, CORE spokesman Niger Innis and a gaggle of pastors staged a "protest press conference," rapping Robert Redford for opposing the Bush administration's sale of oil and gas leases on some of the most spectacular public land in Utah. They claim Redford's environmental ethic hurts "grandmothers on a fixed income and single mothers dependent upon public assistance in South Chicago."LiNeBrEaKYou see what they did there? They slapped down the race card in front of a Sundance movie theater. It was brilliant. Movie star plus lots of Hollywood in town for the film festival plus middle-class white guilt equals exponential increase in media coverage. LiNeBrEaKI didn't go -- just on principle. But The Salt Lake Tribune sent reporter Patty Henetz. You probably noticed the headline.LiNeBrEaK"They've got the celebrity name. They've got the location right. And they're going to draw media attention," says Laurie Wilson, a Brigham Young University communications professor.LiNeBrEaKPredictably, the loyal opposition howled. Crossroads Urban Center Director Glenn Bailey knows his response to CORE's shaky facts creates a phony debate for reporters to chew on. Still, he and former city mayor Rocky Anderson issued a press release.LiNeBrEaK"Somebody has to question their facts at this point. They keep getting trotted into town by various conservativeLiNeBrEaKcauses," says Bailey. "It's irritating to those of us who are actually doing the work on poverty issues."LiNeBrEaKTurns out the 77-parcel sale to which Redford objected would amount to two days worth of U.S. consumption. But facts are beside the point. This is theater, media manipulation, politics -- or all three.LiNeBrEaK"If facts made politics, we'd actually have a better society than we do," says Sutherland Institute Director Paul Mero, who recruited Innis' father for a 2008 Earth Day seminar meant to debunk global warming. "They're taking advantage of an opportunity to make a point. It doesn't have to be a fact. It doesn't have to be a compelling argument. All it has to do is project the broader argument" of environmental racism.LiNeBrEaKOriginally a reputable civil rights organization, CORE has become the willing tool of energy companies, conservative think tanks and white politicians. Kanab Republican Rep. Mike Noel and former legislator Aaron Tilton, in particular, love to use the Innis family -- Niger testified on Capitol Hill a year ago. The Tribune covered that gig. And I wrote about Sutherland's green day party.LiNeBrEaKI don't know if all the editors who sent reporters to Wednesday's press conference think Innis raises legitimate issues or were just afraid to be the only ones without a Redford headline. The scrum was almost -- but not quite -- inevitable.LiNeBrEaK"As a media outlet, why are you covering it? What's the substantive news here?" asks Wilson. "If there's not a substantive story without Robert Redford, then you shouldn't be telling the story."LiNeBrEaKCan't argue with that.LiNeBrEaKRebecca Walsh is a columnist.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   FINAL Edition	EPA pick will revisit state's bid for tough emission rules  	Main News; Pg. A1  	846 words  	 Lisa Jackson, President-elect Barack Obama's pick for EPA administrator, said Wednesday she would immediately revisit the Bush administration's decision to block California and 18 other states from setting tough limits on greenhouse gases from vehicles, and she hinted strongly that she will overturn it.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee pressed the 46-year-old former head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection to follow through on Obama's campaign pledge to approve California's request for a waiver from EPA so that the states can enforce the rules under the Clean Air Act. LiNeBrEaK"I will review the waiver decision, if I'm confirmed, very, very aggressively very soon after confirmation," Jackson told lawmakers. "I will let science be the guide in making the decision and the rule of law."LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration caused outrage in December 2007 when EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson overruled the opinion of the agency's legal and technical staff and rejected California's request. Lawmakers saw Jackson's comments as a signal she would side with the EPA staff when she takes up the issue.LiNeBrEaK"When you say science and the rule of law, you know, it sounds funny that it would be such music to our ears," said California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. "Because for eight years, a lot of us don't believe there was science or the rule of law involved in the decisions at EPA."LiNeBrEaKRules affect U.S. auto fleetLiNeBrEaKJackson's decision will have ripple effects across the country because the new rules would cover at least half of the U.S. auto fleet. California's rules require a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks by 2016. Automakers oppose the regulations, which would force them to modify their fleets to raise fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKThere was little doubt that Jackson would be sympathetic to California's position: Her home state of New Jersey was one of the early states to embrace California's rules, and her former boss, New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, signed legislation last year mandating cuts in greenhouse gas emissions across industries.LiNeBrEaKBut Jackson's testimony was another sign that California's adversarial relationship with EPA and the White House over environmental policy over the last eight years is about to change dramatically as Obama's nominees begin to take charge.LiNeBrEaKThe state also is likely to get a boost from Obama's nomination of Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and the environment, to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality, which coordinates policy in the West Wing.LiNeBrEaKSutley, who also appeared before Boxer's committee Wednesday, has been a major proponent of the state's climate policies as a former deputy secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and a top energy adviser to former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. She also served six years at EPA, much of it in the San Francisco regional office.LiNeBrEaKAdviser on warmingLiNeBrEaKSutley told lawmakers that her role would be to advise Obama on key policies on energy and global warming and help coordinate efforts between the White House, Congress and the agencies.LiNeBrEaK"The president-elect recognizes that energy and climate change is truly one of the great challenges of our day, and how we resolve this is going to take the creativity and thought of a lot of people throughout the executive branch and working with the Congress," Sutley said.LiNeBrEaKWhile Democrats in Congress are preparing to move comprehensive climate legislation again this year, its prospects are uncertain. But Jackson said the EPA may begin to make climate policy even sooner in response to court rulings. The agency must decide soon whether carbon dioxide endangers human health, as required by the Supreme Court's decision in the 2007 Massachusetts vs. EPA case.LiNeBrEaK"When EPA makes a decision on endangerment ... it will indeed trigger the beginnings of regulation of CO{-2} for this country," Jackson said. She predicted that "there will be an extraordinary burst of activity" on global warming policy this year.LiNeBrEaKGOP urges slow goingLiNeBrEaKRepublicans urged a go-slow approach on new regulations on greenhouse gases, which they warned could hurt the economy and Americans' standard of living. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., asked Jackson to explain "how this is dramatically going to impact people - how we travel, what we eat, how we heat our homes, how much we drive - all in the effort to address climate change?"LiNeBrEaKJackson said the new administration would push Americans toward an era of energy efficiency. "It's our responsibility, I believe, to give them choices - to give them efficient homes to buy or rent to give them the ability to cut down on their energy uses, to give them vehicles that allow them choices, that move us toward addressing climate change emissions," she said.LiNeBrEaK Jackson and Sutley appear headed toward relatively painless confirmations. Republicans on the panel said Wednesday that both nominees are well qualified, and Boxer said the Senate could confirm them as early as Inauguration Day.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   FINAL Edition	Politics makes strange new allies;  Former foes form consulting group for state campaigns 	Main News; Pg. A11  	530 words  	In what may be evidence that America really is ushering in a more conciliatory era in politics, a group of leading strategists who have battled each other for years are now joining forces in a Sacramento consulting group. LiNeBrEaK LFM Campaigns will be led by top GOP and Democratic consultants who have been murderously competitive on leading campaigns, but who now say they aim to concentrate on government reform, ballot issues and initiatives. LiNeBrEaKThe principals are:LiNeBrEaK-- Steve Schmidt, chief strategist for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's re-election campaign who was also the senior GOP strategist for John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and for President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. LiNeBrEaK-- Democrat Chris Lehane, the former spokesman for both the Clinton White House and for Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000.LiNeBrEaK-- Adam Mendelsohn, a leading GOP spokesman and the former communications director for Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaK-- Democrat Averell "Ace" Smith, who has worked against both Schwarzenegger and McCain as one of the nation's most formidable opposition researchers.LiNeBrEaK-- Democrat Mark Fabiani, the former special counsel to President Bill Clinton and a deputy campaign manager for Gore and running mate Joe Lieberman in 2000.LiNeBrEaK Brian Jones, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee and communications director for McCain last year, will also move from Washington to California to take a role in the venture. LiNeBrEaK The initials of the new firm stand for Lehane Fabiani Mercury, the latter a reference to Mercury LLC, the consulting firm founded by Schmidt and Mendelsohn that includes former Democratic Assembly Speaker Fabian N&uacute;&ntilde;ez as a partner. LiNeBrEaK "This firm, coming together, is a byproduct or a reflection of the times we're in," said Lehane, an oft-quoted personality thanks to his frequently well-honed barbs against GOP candidates, including McCain and Schwarzenegger. "These are folks who have been on the other side of the aisle, who have gone toe-to-toe and blow-to-blow."LiNeBrEaK "And the fact that these folks were able to come together really does reflect that people are putting down their swords and picking up the plowshares," he said. LiNeBrEaKBut the formation of the bipartisan firm may also reflect a changing economic and political landscape in California, which has seen an increasing number of initiatives and ballot measures, creating potentially lucrative work for consultants who normally represent very different campaign interests.LiNeBrEaKInitiatives and referendums "are unique, because they're issue-based and not partisan-based," said Mendelsohn, who served as a strategist for Proposition 11, the California redistricting measure passed by voters in November. LiNeBrEaKOn issues such as high-speed rail, clean water and global warming, "The ballot approach makes tremendous sense in this atmosphere," and on such matters, "we've worked with each other, and we have tremendous respect for each other," he said.LiNeBrEaKIt may not mean a truce in verbal warfare when it comes to campaigns, however. LiNeBrEaK"We all do partisan politics," Mendelsohn said. "And we'll continue to do it." LiNeBrEaK "I will have my plowshare in my right hand - and my sword will continue to be in the left," Lehane said.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	BLM allows oil shale demonstration in West  	NEWS; National; World; Local  	636 words  	WASHINGTON &raquo; Just days before leaving office, the Bush administration on Wednesday pressed forward with efforts to jump-start a domestic oil shale industry, saying commercial production will help lessen the country's dependence on imported oil.LiNeBrEaKIt is offering energy companies another chance to show they can make a profit on public land in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced it is soliciting a second round of proposals for oil shale demonstration projects on 1. 9 million acres in the three states. Projects would be limited to 640 acres per company, but the land could be converted to a commercial lease if the technologies proved successful. LiNeBrEaKThe bureau estimates that Western states hold as much as 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from shale. Oil shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock containing organic matter. When crushed and heated, it produces a crude oil substitute.LiNeBrEaK"Broadening the scope of research into oil shale technologies will help accelerate the development of these vast western resources, and as a result lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy," BLM Director James Caswell said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKA similar solicitation in 2005 led to five demonstration projects in Colorado and one in Utah. Colorado has more oil shale than the other two states.LiNeBrEaKLast week, 12 environmental groups sent letters to the Interior Department and BLM, threatening to sue unless the potential effects on endangered species are addressed. They argue a final plan and rules for commercial oil shale development on the nearly 2 million acres approved late last year violated federal law because the agencies did not formally consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration is trying to rush through everything they can to get this industry up and running," said Melissa Thrailkill, a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity in San Francisco, one of the environmental groups that has threatened legal action.LiNeBrEaKThrailkill said rare species of Colorado River fish, the greater sage grouse and several plants that grow only on oil shale lands could be endangered by energy develop. Environmentalists' main concern is that oil shale development would create greater greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"It's the dirtiest form of energy development out there," Thrailkill said. "It requires a ton of energy to heat the rock, and the BLM acknowledges in their environmental impact statement that more than likely that energy is going to come from new coal-fired power plants, which does nothing to help us with the climate change problem we're facing."LiNeBrEaKA spokesman for one oil company said production from shale deposits will not necessarily rely on coal plants.LiNeBrEaKGiven current trends, electricity generated by natural gas, wind or solar is just as likely an energy source in 10 or 15 years, said Tracy Boyd, a spokesman for Shell Exploration and Production Co., which holds three of the six permits for the current demonstration projects.LiNeBrEaKThat's the timeframe in which Shell estimates oil shale production will become commercially viable, he said.LiNeBrEaKColorado Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat, and other state officials have urged federal officials to delay a final plan and rules for commercial development. They say there are too many unanswered questions about the effects on water, wildlife, air and local economies.LiNeBrEaKThey point out that companies are still experimenting with the technology and say industry and government officials acknowledge that commercial development is several years away.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's nominee to head the Interior Department is Sen. Ken Salazar, a Colorado Democrat who wrote the legal provision that allows BLM to permit limited demonstration projects. Salazar also has urged a go-slow approach to oil shale development.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Mayan Nobel laureate calls racism a 'disease'  	NEWS; State  	536 words  	When 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Mench&uacute; Tum gets a day off from advocating for peace and human rights worldwide, she likes to sleep in.LiNeBrEaKMench&uacute; said the changes in climate and time zones wear on her during her travels. Once rested, she spends time with her husband of 17 years, Angel Canil; her 14-year-old son, Mash; and their three dogs. She also likes making jewelry, sewing, cooking and taking care of her plants.LiNeBrEaK"My house is a small jungle," she told The Salt Lake Tribune . "I like to be an ordinary person." LiNeBrEaKBut some folks who attended Mench&uacute;'s hourlong lecture Thursday at the University of Utah said she was inspirational and down-to-earth.LiNeBrEaKIt was her first time in Utah, and more than 1,000 people showed up for the event, nearly filling Kingsbury Hall. Her keynote address -- it began and ended with a standing ovation, and had some laughs in between -- was one of several events this week at the U. in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday.LiNeBrEaKMench&uacute;, 50, is a Mayan Indian from Guatemala who has spent her life fighting social injustice. She also ran unsuccessfully in 2007 for president of her Central American country. She has had her share controversy. For example, she has acknowledged that when she wrote a book about her life, she mixed her own testimony with experiences of other people during Guatemala's civil war that lasted from 1960 to 1996.LiNeBrEaKDuring her talk -- in Spanish and with an interpreter -- she told "young people" that there is no excuse for them not to be involved in challenging injustices. She encouraged them to initiate change in their communities because it doesn't happen on its own.LiNeBrEaK"Don't wait until you become a victim; you have your rights," she said.LiNeBrEaKMench&uacute; said racism is a "disease" that affects people spiritually and emotionally when they are not content with themselves.LiNeBrEaKShe said it still exists in her homeland --but she has hopes that it will improve over time.LiNeBrEaK"Why can someone be against a brother who doesn't have the same skin color?" she said. "Prejudice has brought us apart."LiNeBrEaKShe said humans need to interact with humans who are different from them to experience various cultures. And if all people "respected" each other, they would be able to understand one another, despite their differences.LiNeBrEaK"The power of guns can never solve the problems of humanity," she said.LiNeBrEaKMench&uacute; also said, "Human beings have abandoned our basic relationship with mother earth." She called on people to take responsibility for taking care of the environment.LiNeBrEaKAfter the event, Hanah Kim, a 22-year-old community college student, said Mench&uacute; "inspired me" to get more involved in human-rights issues.LiNeBrEaKFarah Melendez, a U. international studies sophomore, said Mench&uacute;'s talk about fighting injustice reminded her of why she walked in Utah's historic immigrants rights march in 2006.LiNeBrEaK"It's an endless fight to making [things] better," she said.LiNeBrEaKjsanchez@sltrib.com Did you know?LiNeBrEaKThe names of Mench&uacute;'s dogs are Sotz (bat), K'oi (monkey), Char (a type of bird).LiNeBrEaKAlthough she has experienced snow worldwide, Mench&uacute; has never tried any snow sports.LiNeBrEaKShe likes to visit cities' mercados (markets) when she travels.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	TRAFFIC DOWN AT MAJOR BAY AREA AIRPORTS IN '08  	TAMPA BAY; HEARD IT HERE; Pg. 4B  	478 words  	How bad is the travel business? So bad that just holding your ground is cause for celebration. St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport sent out a press release Wednesday to trumpet that its 742,380 total passengers for 2008 was less than a 1 percent drop from 2007. The airport was stung by the departure of its second-biggest carrier, USA 3000, in August. But USA 3000 returned with a daily flight to Chicago last month. More important, No. 1 carrier Allegiant Air beefed up flights from the Pinellas airport for the winter season. Meanwhile, Tampa International reported just over 9. 1-million passengers flew out of the airport in 2008, a 4. 6 percent decline from 2007. LiNeBrEaKFed report affirms tight credit marketLiNeBrEaKDespite billions in federal bailout dollars intended to ease the credit crunch, banks in the Southeast tightened their standards for lending money even more during mid November and December, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday. Hardest hit by the worsening credit squeeze: businesses connected to the housing and automobile industries and, in general, new commercial projects shopping for a loan. Those insights were included in the latest installment of the Fed's "Beige Book," a compilation of anecdotal reports from businesses across the nation. The Fed's Atlanta-based Sixth District, which includes Florida, witnessed weak economic conditions through December with dismal auto sales and retailers reporting holiday sales near or below year-ago levels. In the glass-half-full category: Home inventories fell in Florida and Georgia, lower gas prices helped tourism and manufacturers are paying less for raw materials.LiNeBrEaKPlea made to focus on climate in gulfLiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and local elected officials on Wednesday called on a government alliance of Gulf Coast states to take greater heed of climate-change warnings. The Gulf of Mexico Alliance is a government collaborative focused on protecting the Gulf of Mexico. It includes Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Climate change activists like the Gulf Coast Restoration Network and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy say the alliance needs to make climate change a priority. "We need our leaders to love our coast and the gulf as much as we do and protect our resources from their greatest threat: global warming," said Joe Murphy, an activist with the Gulf Restoration Network.LiNeBrEaKFor WTSP workers, a week with no payLiNeBrEaKEmployees of WTSP-Ch. 10 will take a week of unpaid leave before April in a cost-cutting measure aimed to avoid layoffs. Gannett Co., the station's owner as well as publisher of USA Today and numerous other newspapers, announced the companywide measure Wednesday. Channel 10 employs about 175 people, records show. Gannett spokeswoman Tara Connell said many on-air reporters have individual contracts with the station and cannot be required to take leave.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	510 CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND WE'RE WATCHING  	NATIONAL; POLITIFACT; Pg. 1A  	1275 words  	Barack Obama made 510 promises when he was running for president, a list that is stunning in its scope and leaves almost no part of the executive branch untouched, according to a new analysis by PolitiFact.LiNeBrEaKThe analysis found that Obama made more than twice as many promises as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, whose campaign pledges were examined by other news organizations. Bush made 177 promises in 2000 and Clinton made 204 in 1992, as reported by the Knight Ridder Washington Bureau (now McClatchy).LiNeBrEaKObama made sweeping promises like ending the Iraq war and cutting taxes on the middle class, and narrow ones like establishing programs to help animals survive global warming, weatherizing 1-million low-income homes per year and increasing tax deductions for artists.LiNeBrEaKThe promises reflect a philosophy that government can, and perhaps should, play a role in solving problems at all levels. LiNeBrEaK"I would describe him as an activist realist," said Bill Galston, a former policy adviser to President Clinton and a senior fellow for governance study at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. "On the one hand, he does not share the reflexive antigovernment position that has dominated the last 30 years of American politics."LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, Galston said, it would not be fair to call Obama a "gung-ho intervener or spender." Obama is grounded by a sense of what is economically and politically feasible, he said.LiNeBrEaKPolitiFact, the St. Petersburg Times' fact-checking Web site, compiled the 510 promises by examining Obama's campaign Web site, position papers, interviews and speeches. PolitiFact staffers will be tracking each one on the Web site's Obameter, which will show whether they are "In the Works" or "Stalled," and will ultimately indicate whether the promise was "Kept" or "Broken." The ratings will be tallied on a chart on PolitiFact's home page that will show the overall progress of the Obama presidency.LiNeBrEaKAmong PolitiFact's findings:LiNeBrEaK- Obama calls for more regulation, new agencies and at least 11 new groups that would have "corps" in their name, including: an America's Voice Corps to foster international diplomacy; an Artists Corps to work in low-income schools and communities; and a Health Corps to improve public health.LiNeBrEaK- Of the 510 promises, most deal with foreign policy (87), followed by health (76), the environment (59) and energy (51). He's also fond of transparency (33) and government efficiency (32). Only one deals with canines - a promise to buy his daughters a dog.LiNeBrEaK- He likes advice. We found he wants to create at least 10 new advisers such as a director of urban policy, a special adviser on violence against women, the nation's first chief technology officer and an American Indian policy adviser.LiNeBrEaK- Even before the need arose for a major economic stimulus bill, Obama proposed hundreds of billions in new spending. His ideas include $150-billion over 10 years on green initiatives, $60-billion for roads and bridges, $50-billion for the global fight against AIDS and $25-billion more in foreign aid. He also promised billions in cost savings by ending the war in Iraq, reducing earmarks and reforming federal contracting, to name a few.LiNeBrEaK- He likes green. Overall, Obama hopes to create 5-million "green" jobs as part of a more energy-efficient economy. He wants to retrofit federal buildings to save energy and spur a "Green Revolution" in Africa.LiNeBrEaKObama's high level of detail - and the large number of promises - reflects the need for a newcomer to establish his credibility.LiNeBrEaK"Obama was relatively unknown at the national level," said Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor of political science at Towson University, "so he had to have a greater degree of specificity about what his plans were. You've got to let people know who you are."LiNeBrEaKAlthough at times ridiculed by opponents as little more than a gifted speaker who emphasized abstract platitudes like "change," Obama and his policy team laid out an extremely detailed agenda for America. He was well-known for his pledge to end the war in Iraq, but his position paper on the issue details eight other promises, including a specific pledge to provide at least $2-billion to assist Iraqi refugees. Likewise, his broad health care plan includes a pledge to name a coordinator to oversee all federal efforts to combat autism.LiNeBrEaKSome promises are wrapped in nearly indecipherable jargon. "Institutionalize the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)." (It's actually a global security program launched in 2003 to stop the buying and selling of weapons of mass destruction.)LiNeBrEaKOthers are just plain obscure: "Fight to protect roadless areas on Forest Service lands from all new road construction" and to implement "cooperative projects to remove brush, small trees and other overgrown vegetation that serve as fuel for wildfires."LiNeBrEaKKumar and other political scientists said Obama's presidency should not be judged solely on the success of his campaign promises.LiNeBrEaKThey noted some promises are more weighty than others. And circumstances change.LiNeBrEaK"In some senses, the world has changed a lot," said Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center. "When a lot of those promises were made, we were in a different situation than we are now. It would be wrong to go blindly forward without re-evaluating."LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, Obama's campaign promises form a road map for his presidency. Obama's supporters will certainly expect him to keep many promises, while his opponents try to maintain the status quo.LiNeBrEaKGary Kalman, the legislative director for the nonpartisan U.S. Public Interest Research Group, is monitoring Obama's initiatives on health care, energy and education. He said he expects Obama's economic recovery package to include several goals Obama outlined during the campaign, such as funding for electronic health records and green energy.LiNeBrEaK"Campaign promises matter, not only in the context in which they were made," Kalman said, "but also looking at the events we're currently facing."LiNeBrEaKGalston, the former adviser to Clinton, agreed.LiNeBrEaK"Campaign promises don't just drop into a void," Galston said. "They represent transactions with people. They represent promissory notes that people accept at face value and expect to redeem at some point, maybe not right away."LiNeBrEaKIn other words, he said, "You'd better not say it if you don't mean it."LiNeBrEaKOBAMETERLiNeBrEaKPROMISE KEPTLiNeBrEaKNo. 503: Appoint at least one Republican to the Cabinet.On Dec. 19, President-elect Obama nominated Ray LaHood, a former GOP congressman from Illinois, to serve as his secretary of transportation.LiNeBrEaKOBAMETERLiNeBrEaKIN THE WORKSLiNeBrEaKNo. 502: Get his daughters a puppy.The Obama family has narrowed the choice to two: labradoodle or Portuguese water hound.LiNeBrEaKOBAMETERLiNeBrEaKNO ACTIONLiNeBrEaKNo. 468: Require hybrid fleet at the White House.It's too early to evaluate progress.LiNeBrEaKOBAMETERLiNeBrEaKPROMISE KEPTLiNeBrEaKNo. 13: Require taxpayers to report more detail on capital gains taxes.

USA TODAY 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   FIRST EDITION	Proposal to cut greenhouse gases set for release  	MONEY; Pg. 8A  	356 words  	A coalition of leading corporations and environmental groups plans to call today for aggressive reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, an initiative that eventually would raise electricity and gasoline prices. LiNeBrEaKThe group -- which includes General Electric, ConocoPhillips, DuPont, Duke Energy and the Natural Resources Defense Council -- will urge Congress to pass a law requiring emissions to be cut 80% by 2050, two people with direct knowledge of the plan say. They declined to be identified because the proposal won't be made public until today.LiNeBrEaKThe cuts are in line with targets advocated by President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKWhen it formed two years ago, the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, which includes some of the USA's top industrial polluters, called for emissions reductions of 60% to 80% by 2050. The coalition today will lay out a far more detailed blueprint, seeking a 42% cut in emissions by 2030.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal comes despite the recession, which could make it difficult to pass costly climate-change legislation this year. But Kyle Danish, a partner in law and policy firm Van Ness Feldman, notes that caps on emissions likely would not begin for several years, after the economy recovers. Meanwhile, he says, businesses want to put their imprint on legislation that's likely to be passed by 2010.LiNeBrEaK"They want to get in the game,"  Danish says.LiNeBrEaKUnder the group's proposed cap-and-trade system, utilities, oil companies and other manufacturers would have to acquire an allowance for every ton of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, that they emit. New power plants would have to buy their permits, while existing ones initially would get much of their allowances free.LiNeBrEaKOver time, the cap would grow more stringent and allowances prices would rise, forcing utilities, for instance, to replace coal plants with wind farms.  The costs are likely to be passed to consumers in higher electric bills or gasoline prices, for example.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal recommends a $10-a-ton minimum for a permit. To prevent CO{-2} permit prices from soaring, it calls for a store of credits to be generated by preserving forests; trees absorb CO{-2}.

USA TODAY 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	EPA nominee vows to rely on science;  Jackson says politics won't govern agency's decisions 	NEWS; Pg. 6A  	420 words  	WASHINGTON -- The nation's environmental policies should be based on science, not interference from political appointees, President-elect Barack Obama's nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency told Senate lawmakers Wednesday. LiNeBrEaK"Science will be the backbone of what EPA does," Lisa Jackson, the nominee, testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. She added that decisions by the chief environmental watchdog will "reflect the expert judgment of the agency's career scientists and independent advisers."LiNeBrEaKHer comments follow repeated criticisms -- by the committee's chairwoman, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and advocacy groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists -- that the Bush administration had given assessments by government scientists a back seat to political judgments. Her statements also pointedly suggested that she intends to break with some controversial EPA decisions of the past eight years.LiNeBrEaKAt a wide-ranging confirmation hearing, Jackson won almost unanimous praise from lawmakers. Boxer said she hopes to "move quickly" to bring Jackson's nomination before the full Senate, where she could be confirmed as early as next week.LiNeBrEaKJackson said cutting emissions of chemicals that contribute to global warming and other types of air pollution will be among the Obama administration's top five environmental goals. The others, she said, are cleaning up hazardous waste sites, protecting water quality and dealing with toxic chemicals.LiNeBrEaK"These five problems are tough, but so is our resolve to conquer them," Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKThe confirmation hearing served partly as a forum for Democratic lawmakers to batter the EPA's conduct during the Bush administration. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., called the agency "a disgrace to our country." Boxer said the agency "has hurt the American people, made them less safe."LiNeBrEaKThe panel's Republicans generally praised Jackson but criticized the new administration's plans to regulate carbon dioxide, linked to global warming. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., warned that such regulations could further damage an ailing economy.LiNeBrEaKJackson also said the Obama administration would:LiNeBrEaK*Immediately assess hundreds of coal ash piles nationwide, following a pair of spills in Tennessee and Alabama.LiNeBrEaK*Revisit controversial EPA rules, including a decision by outgoing Administrator Stephen Johnson that prevented California and other states from imposing their own limits on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK*Bolster the government's commitment to children's health.

The Washington Times 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	NSC could face sweeping changes  	PLUGGED IN - NATIONAL SECURITY; B01  	789 words  	Retired Marine Gen. James L. Jones, President-elect Barack Obama's incoming national security adviser, will be given sweeping new powers if Mr. Obama takes the advice of a little-noticed task force charged with recommending reforms to the nation's security apparatus.LiNeBrEaKThe Project on National Security Reform's executive board last month issued a report recommending updates to the National Security Act, the 1947 law that established the National Security Council. Among other things, it recommended giving the national security adviser more budget authority over the State Department, the Pentagon and military and intelligence agencies. LiNeBrEaKThe report could be considered one of the kind that is often requested but rarely acted upon in Washington, except for one thing: Gen. Jones was a member of the panel that crafted it.LiNeBrEaKNot only did Gen. Jones participate in the study, but the task force that made the recommendations also included incoming Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg and incoming Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele A. Flournoy. The deputy chairman of the task force was retired Adm. Dennis C. Blair, whom Mr. Obama has chosen to be director of national intelligence (DNI).LiNeBrEaKAlso, Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. held Senate hearings last year on national security reform, during which he heard testimony from the project's executive director, James R. Locher III.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the input on agency budgets, the task force recommended renaming the position of national security adviser to make it national security manager and expanding the number of departments and agencies represented in the National Security Council. The council currently includes the secretaries of state and defense, the director of national intelligence, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the national security adviser and the president and vice president.LiNeBrEaK"I think the way to think about it is that those individual secretaries and DNI will have important jobs and a tremendous amount of power," Mr. Locher told The Washington Times. "We need something more, though. We need that ability to integrate. We need a manager. Gen. Jones will have to play a more important role than national security advisers have in the past."LiNeBrEaKThe project's recommendations, which would have to be approved by Congress, urge the nextpresident to "broaden the scope of national security beyond security from aggression to include security against massive societal disruption as a result of natural forces and security against the failure of major national infrastructure systems and to recognize that national security depends on the sustained stewardship of the foundations of national power."LiNeBrEaKThat means, according to project staff members, that the U.S. policy on climate change or a new pandemic would be forged inside the National Security Council instead of being farmed out to the Environmental Protection Agency or the National Institutes of Health.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, those agencies, which normally do not participate in the National Security Council, would have representation inside that body.LiNeBrEaKWith budget guidance going through the National Security Council and not the Office of Management and Budget, there is a chance that Gen. Jones could emerge as the most powerful national security adviser since Henry Kissinger held that job and the job of secretary of state for Presidents Nixon and Ford.LiNeBrEaK"Right now, there is a strong consensus that the current system is not working," Mr. Locher said. "It was designed in 1947 for a different world after World War II and with the approaching Cold War in mind. It reinforced the departments and agencies. We created a weak integrating mechanism."LiNeBrEaKMr. Locher knows a few things about changing well-established bureaucracies. He was one of the main staff authors on the Senate Armed Services Committee of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, which increased the power of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Prior to that law's passage, the chairman's role in mediating the interservice rivalries in annual defense budgets was weak.LiNeBrEaKThe leader of the project's working group on resources, David Berteau, said that too often, large missions for the U.S. government overseas are designated to the Department of Defense (DoD) because the military is the one institution with sufficient personnel and budget.LiNeBrEaK"Today you go to DoD because DoD is the only readily equipped source," he said. "The question is, is that the right way to set it up? Probably not for all contingencies. Let's use these other guys instead, but they are not ready to go. They have no bench strength, no reserve capacity. At its top is a budget issue; at its core is a strategy issue."

The Washington Times 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 		THE LEGACY OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH; E1  	3311 words  	Every presidency is like a 15-round heavyweight boxing match, and every one ends with a split decision. John F. Kennedy took America to Camelot but also to the Bay of Pigs. Lyndon B. Johnson ushered in civil rights but also the Vietnam War. Jimmy Carter excited a weary America after Watergate but ended up mired in malaise. Ronald Reagan broke down the Berlin Wall but traded arms for hostages in Iran. And Bill Clinton delivered a balanced budget but also endured a scandalous impeachment.LiNeBrEaKSo, too, a split decision for President Bush.LiNeBrEaKHe kept Americans safe after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but he pre-emptively took America to war in Iraq to rid the threat of weapons of mass destruction - weapons that were never found. LiNeBrEaKHe championed the battle against AIDS in Africa, delivered accountability to America's schools, helped the elderly afford prescription medicine and called for the establishment of a Palestinian state - the first American president to do so.LiNeBrEaKBut he failed in his attempts to overhaul Social Security and the immigration system, oversaw the largest rise in federal spending since the Great Society, expanded power in the executive branch, increased the use of wiretapping, refused to hold his top advisers culpable for the Abu Ghraib scandal, rejected a climate change pact against world opinion and left the nation mired in an economic swamp that historians say rivals the Great Depression.LiNeBrEaKThroughout his presidency, Mr. Bush refused to acknowledge a single mistake, once famously telling a reporter in April 2004: "I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn't yet."LiNeBrEaKHis liberal foes have thrived throughout his two terms in office, noting hundreds - thousands - of perceived mistakes, keeping up a relentless drumbeat, often against the man, not the president. His critics lambasted every decision his military advisers and generals made as they conducted two wars. Even when the embattled Mr. Bush succeeded - as with the "surge" of 30,000 troops to Iraq, which stabilized the country - opponents charged that it was too little, too late.LiNeBrEaKIn the end, two images likely will be among the most enduring of his presidency, and though he isn't pictured in one of them, it was that single event that even some of his former top advisers say ended up sinking his presidency.LiNeBrEaKDueling snapshotsLiNeBrEaKAmericans will forever remember Sept. 13, 2001, when a young president pulling a wizened and weary New York City firefighter onto a pile of rubble that was once the World Trade Center and shouted into a bullhorn: "I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!"LiNeBrEaKIn those first few days after the attacks, Mr. Bush's approval rating soared to 90 percent. Democrats and Republicans were suddenly alike: They were shocked, lost and frightened. They looked to their president for reassurance, and they found it in the steely resolve of a Texas rancher who vowed retribution but also pledged to keep the United States safe from terrorists.LiNeBrEaKBut Americans also will remember the live video feeds from New Orleans in August 2005: Thousands of people, mostly black, stranded after Hurricane Katrina; thousands packed inside and outside the Superdome, clamoring for food, water, help; a nonstop daily stream of terrible images, the city under water, homes destroyed, billions of dollars of damage.When the president - who flew over the city while returning from a fundraiser in California, prompting cries that he couldn't care less about the Big Easy - finally did speak, he uttered eight words that would take their place in the lexicon of sarcastic praise: "Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job." He was speaking to Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who resigned within days.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush's approval rating plummeted to 39 percent; it would go lower, into the 20s, and end up as the lowest of any modern president. The political capital he claimed to have won in his 2004 re-election was spent, his bond with the American people broken, his bully pulpit lost forever.LiNeBrEaKLast month, just 18 percent of Americans said in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that they would miss Mr. Bush when he leaves office.LiNeBrEaK"Katrina was the tipping point, and it severed that bond with Americans," said Matthew Dowd, who was Mr. Bush's chief political strategist for the 2004 campaign and had worked for him since 1999. "Once that bond was severed, it's very hard to get it back. This president never did - he never recovered."LiNeBrEaKDerailed from the startLiNeBrEaKThe 2000 election would be the closest in history and would not be decided for 36 days. Vice President Al Gore refused to concede, and election officials in Florida scoured ballots by hand, looking for hanging chads, swinging chads, and pregnant or dimpled chads.LiNeBrEaKOn Dec. 12, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the Florida Supreme Court's method for recounting ballots was a violation of the U.S. Constitution. Texas Gov. George W. Bush was officially elected the 43rd president of the United States, only the second man to follow his father into the nation's highest office.LiNeBrEaKWhile he would seek to move forward with an ambitious agenda, the well already was poisoned.LiNeBrEaK"I do think the Florida recount set kind of an ugly mood amongst some in the electorate," Mr. Bush told C-SPAN's Steve Scully last month. "In other words, the election was - in their minds - was in doubt. That made it harder to come as a - to unify the country after the election."LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 20, 2001, Mr. Bush - his hair still brown, his face surprisingly unwrinkled for his 53 years - took office.LiNeBrEaKHe planned a domestic presidency. He dealt with a burgeoning recession by cutting taxes across the board, even for the richest Americans. He asserted that that was only fair - all taxpayers would pay less.LiNeBrEaKHe focused on other small-bore issues - embryonic stem cells, faith-based initiatives, the partisanship in Washington. "I think we're making progress toward changing the tone in Washington," he said in April 2001.LiNeBrEaKHe delivered commencement addresses, welcomed collegiate volleyball champions to the White House, visited the Baseball Hall of Fame and established a monthly T-ball game at the White House.LiNeBrEaKIn the early days, Mr. Bush reached across party lines to join a liberal icon, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, which the president told The Washington Times in an exclusive interview last month was "a piece of civil rights legislation" intended to end "the soft bigotry of low expectations."LiNeBrEaKBut all that changed one sunny morning, as he read "My Pet Goat" to schoolchildren in Sarasota, Fla. Islamic terrorists directed by Osama bin Laden crashed two commercial airliners into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Virginia, killing more than 3,000 people.LiNeBrEaKHis chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., passed the news to the president in a classroom at Emma E. Booker Elementary School, whispering into his ear: "A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack."LiNeBrEaKFor Mr. Bush, the day would change his presidency forever.LiNeBrEaK'A loving guy'LiNeBrEaKTwo days later, Sept. 13, reporters trotted into the Oval Office to hear the president's phone conversation with New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and New York Gov. George E. Pataki. The brief event ended in a most remarkable way, one that would cut through the resolute public persona that Mr. Bush had held in place since the attacks and showed the flesh-and-blood man.LiNeBrEaKAfter the phone call, intended to reassure Americans, several reporters posed questions. Is it safe to fly? How close are you to finding who was responsible for the attacks?LiNeBrEaKThen a reporter asked: "About the prayer day tomorrow, Mr. President. Could you give us a sense as to what kind of prayers you are thinking and where your heart is for yourself?"LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush turned away for a moment, and when he turned back, his eyes were brimming with tears.LiNeBrEaK"Well, I don't think about myself right now. I think about the families, the children. I am a loving guy, and I am also someone, however, who has got a job to do - and I intend to do it."LiNeBrEaKHis chin trembled, his face contorted with emotion, as he blinked away tears. "And this is a terrible moment. But this country will not relent until we have saved ourselves and others from the terrible tragedy that came upon America."LiNeBrEaKWith that, the president left the Oval Office.LiNeBrEaKConfused staffers, his senior aides, looked at one another. He was not supposed to leave - the press leaves, not the president. They stood for a moment, then followed their leader through the door. The reporters and a TV crew were left, alone, in the office. They, too, trickled out.LiNeBrEaKA call to actionLiNeBrEaKHours before standing atop the rubble of the World Trade Center with a bullhorn, Mr. Bush - joined by his father, former presidents, lawmakers, leaders of every religion - called the nation together, leading a day of prayer in "the middle hour of our grief."LiNeBrEaK"So many have suffered so great a loss, and today we express our nation's sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead, and for those who love them," the president said in a "National Day of Prayer and Remembrance" at the National Cathedral in Washington.LiNeBrEaKIn a powerful but brief speech, he consoled the families of the fallen, much as he would do later throughout the Iraq war. But the born-again Christian also set out a course for America, which he said would not turn the other cheek.LiNeBrEaK"Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing."LiNeBrEaK'An axis of evil'LiNeBrEaKIn his State of the Union address on Jan. 29, 2002, Mr. Bush took aim at three nations he deemed dangers to global security.LiNeBrEaK"North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens. Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror," he told a joint session of Congress.LiNeBrEaK"States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic."LiNeBrEaKIn June, Mr. Bush set out the tenets of the Bush Doctrine in a speech at West Point. "We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. We cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants, who solemnly sign nonproliferation treaties, and then systemically break them. If we wait for threats to fully materialize, we will have waited too long. Our security will require transforming the military you will lead, a military that must be ready to strike at a moment's notice in any dark corner of the world. And our security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and resolute, to be ready for pre-emptive action when necessary to defend our liberty and to defend our lives."LiNeBrEaKEarly 2003 saw a concerted effort by administration officials, notably Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, to press the case that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Lawmakers overwhelmingly approved military action, and America, too, would go along - at first.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Cheney's prediction in March 2003, that American soldiers would be "greeted as liberators," was far from true. The war would drag on, long past a speech by Mr. Bush on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, when he stood in front of a huge "Mission Accomplished" banner and declared that "major combat operations in Iraq have ended."LiNeBrEaKAnd soon, questions would arise about the veracity of claims from the White House that Iraq held weapons of mass destruction.LiNeBrEaK"There wasn't enough questioning on the intelligence that was contrary before the Iraq war," said former White House press secretary Scott McClellan. "Contradictory evidence was ignored in the process and things were lumped together to make the threat sound more grave and more serious and more urgent than it really was. ... In the end, the case was overstated, oversold"LiNeBrEaKThings were about to get worse.LiNeBrEaK'A tough stretch'LiNeBrEaK"I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it. It is my style," Mr. Bush said firmly just days after he was re-elected in 2004, winning the first majority of votes since his father in 1988.LiNeBrEaKBut his 50. 7 percent total was by no means a mandate, and the president would soon make several mistakes - one fatal.LiNeBrEaKFirst, Mr. Bush sought to overhaul Social Security, often called the "third rail of politics." Democrats opposed his plan to allow Americans to create personal savings accounts and seniors, including the powerful AARP lobby, expressed doubts. His proposal would be dead by year's end.LiNeBrEaKThen Katrina made a direct hit on New Orleans, portions of which lie below sea level.LiNeBrEaK"You can't underestimate how devastating it was," Mr. McClellan said. "It left an indelible stain on his presidency."LiNeBrEaKHe said Americans had given Mr. Bush the benefit of the doubt on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but "when Katrina hit, it moved from 'Not only are they not being truthful with us' to 'Now they're not even competent. They can't even get it right here at home, no wonder they can't get it right over in Iraq.' "LiNeBrEaKThen another misstep: In a surprisingly tone-deaf move, Mr. Bush in October nominated White House counsel Harriet E. Miers to replace Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKWhile Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid recommended Miss Miers as Justice O'Connor's successor, conservatives harpooned her. After two powerful Republican senators asked Mr. Bush to withdraw the nomination, Miss Miers stepped aside.LiNeBrEaKWithin months, the "ports controversy" exploded, as the administration acknowledged a deal in the works to transfer control of port management businesses in six major U.S. seaports to a company based in the United Arab Emirates. Conservatives lashed the president again, and he was furious at his advisers for misplaying the deal.LiNeBrEaKA panel in the House, controlled by Republicans, voted 62-2 to kill the deal.LiNeBrEaK"Yeah, that was a tough stretch," said longtime presidential adviser Dan Bartlett.LiNeBrEaKRegretsLiNeBrEaKMr. Bush, holding his final White House news conference Monday, delivered a long list of mistakes he made during his two terms in office, ticking off everything from the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq to the his decisions after Katrina struck New Orleans.LiNeBrEaK"Clearly putting a 'Mission Accomplished' banner on an aircraft carrier was a mistake," the president said. "It sent the wrong message; we were trying to say something differently, but nevertheless it conveyed a different message.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously, some of my rhetoric has been a mistake," Mr. Bush said.LiNeBrEaKIn recent days of reflective interview before he leaves office Jan. 20, the president has criticized his own choice of words, such as the time he demanded bin Laden "dead or alive" or taunted al Qaeda by saying, "Bring it on."LiNeBrEaKOn Katrina, Mr. Bush defended his decision to fly over a devastated New Orleans the day after the levees broke, as he returned from California.LiNeBrEaK"I've thought long and hard about Katrina, you know, could I have done something differently, like, land Air Force One, either in New Orleans or Baton Rouge. The problem with that is that law enforcement would have been pulled away from the mission and then your questions would have been, 'How could you possibly have flown Air Force One into Baton Rouge and police officers that were needed to expedite traffic out of New Orleans were taken off the task to look after you?' "LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush also regretted the first policy initiative he pushed after winning re-election in 2004, when he declared "I have capital, and I'm going to spend it."LiNeBrEaK"I believe that running the Social Security idea right after the '04 election was a mistake. I should have argued for immigration reform. ... The crisis was not imminent as far as members of Congress were concerned"LiNeBrEaKBut the president defended his decisions - and those of all past and future presidents.LiNeBrEaK"One thing about the presidency is that you can only make decisions based on the information at hand. You don't get to have information after you make the decision - that's not the way it works. And you stand by your decisions, and you explain why you made the decisions you made."LiNeBrEaKLegacyLiNeBrEaKThe president ends as he began: in a recession, the country split by partisan politics, the Middle East in turmoil. Mr. Bush has repeatedly said that historians are still deciding the legacy of the first president, so he won't lose much sleep trying to figure out his - historians will sort all that out, and likely get it right.LiNeBrEaKEven his former aides are split over how history will perceive him.LiNeBrEaK"No leader has ever been appreciated in their time," said Brad Blakeman, a top aide from 2000 to 2005. "It's only after time that you can make a full and fair assessment of achievement and failure. The jury's going to be out for a while on Iraq, although it appears that things are headed in the right direction for a sustainable and peaceful Iraq and if that comes to pass will deliver dividends for a very long time having an ally in a very troubled region."LiNeBrEaKAnother former senior adviser, Karen Hughes, echoed the sentiment.LiNeBrEaK"It was a time of enormous consequence and great challenge," she said shortly after she arrived in Washington this week to fly back to Texas aboard the president's plane - it will no longer be Air Force One when he departs on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaK"Many of those challenges had been brewing for years. And what defines this presidency is that the president boldly dealt with all of them. ... When you think about the range of his accomplishments, I think history's judgment is going to be veryLiNeBrEaKpositive"LiNeBrEaKCritics, though, say Mr. Bush should have leveled more with the American people.LiNeBrEaK"The first step to shaping the legacy for the better is to candidly address his own mistakes and shortcomings and accept responsibility for those," said Mr. McClellan. "And until he does that, it's hard to get people to focus on other initiatives that I think are very notable."LiNeBrEaKMr. Dowd, now an outspoken Bush critic, followed suit.LiNeBrEaK"The American public doesn't want Dr. Phil as president, but they do want somebody that can say, 'This didn't turn out, I'm going to change, I made a mistake, and here's what I'm going to do.' The public expects people not to have all the answers and to learn in office. I think the president and others around him think the admission of a mistake is a sign of weakness, but the public sees it the opposite way," Mr. Dowd said.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Bartlett, who once shaped the daily White House message, said that a sense of nostalgia and a change of heart about Mr. Bush may come sooner than many historians - or even the president - have thought.LiNeBrEaK"After this new president starts making some difficult decisions, people will think differently. There's no corner in the Oval Office to hide in. At some point, hard decisions will have to be made. Maybe in a year or so, people will say, 'Well, maybe ol' George W. wasn't as bad as we thought,' " Mr. Bartlett said with a laugh.

The Washington Post 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Regional Edition	Energy 'Czarina' Has List of Bush Policies to Undo  	A-SECTION; Pg. A17  	428 words  	This is the second go-round for Carol M. Browner as a top White House adviser on the environment. She served during both terms as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton and later became a principal at the Albright Group. During an interview this week, she joked about her new moniker as Barack Obama's energy "czarina." But there was no kidding about the challenges she faces as the first-ever assistant to the president for energy and climate -- a position she insists will coordinate and form policy rather than usurp power from other agencies. Either way, Browner, 53, will wield broad influence over environmental policies and see her portfolio expand into international affairs, job creation and the embattled auto industry. LiNeBrEaKWatch the entire interview at http://washingtonpost.com/politics.LiNeBrEaKLois Romano: They call you czarina?LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner: The president-elect has decided that he wants to have a senior adviser in the White House whose responsibility is to focus on energy and climate-change policy, in the same way you have General [James] Jones, who focuses on national security. . . . [Obama] said, "I want to make sure that we have a clear voice, a team of people focused on energy and climate change."LiNeBrEaKLR: What Bush initiatives do you have your eye on to roll back?LiNeBrEaKCB: Unfortunately, the list is rather long. . . . The Supreme Court ruled almost two years ago now that the EPA has some authorities to look at greenhouse gas emissions. . . . The current administration declined to do that.LiNeBrEaKLR: What important actions did you take during your tenure at the EPA that the Bush administration undid?LiNeBrEaKCB: There [was a] failure to really recognize that we don't have to choose between strong public health . . . environmental protections and a strong economy. The Bush administration was constantly saying, "Oh, this is going to be bad for the economy." . . . There were individual decisions, failures to regulate mercury from power plants . . . failure to really enforce the law when there is an egregious violation of our pollution standards.LiNeBrEaKLR: How do you get the American people to change the way they do business?LiNeBrEaKCB: I don't doubt that somebody will say, "Oh my gosh, they're talking about we are never going to be able to drive our cars again." We are not talking about not driving cars. We are talking about driving different cars . . . cleaner cars. We recognize that, for many Americans, cars are an important part of how they get to work. . . . It's about figuring out ways to make our lives better. . . . It's a win-win.

The Washington Post 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	Economic Recovery A Priority For Kaine;  Governor Pushes For Green Jobs as Legislature Opens 	METRO; Pg. B01  	941 words  	Gov. Timothy M. Kaine told the General Assembly on Wednesday that he will use his final year in office to cultivate a major expansion in environmentally oriented jobs and try to work through partisan barriers to steer Virginia through severe financial turbulence.LiNeBrEaKDelivering his  State of the Commonwealth Address on the opening day of the 2009 legislative session, Kaine (D) said he has worked hard over the past three years to make the state a better place to start a business, buy a home and raise a child. LiNeBrEaKBut Kaine told lawmakers that navigating "a time of national economic distress" will represent one of the biggest challenges of their political careers.LiNeBrEaK"I don't have to tell you we are serving in one of the most difficult times in our nation's recent history," Kaine said. "But we must be mindful that our pressures are no greater than those that our citizens are facing every day. . . . It is my hope that the size of the challenge . . . will inspire our best efforts to cooperate in finding the best solutions."LiNeBrEaKHours before Kaine delivered his address in the House chamber, Senate Majority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) outlined the magnitude of the fiscal turmoil that awaits legislators.LiNeBrEaKSaslaw said he thinks lawmakers will have to close a two-year shortfall of at least $4 billion -- earlier estimates had placed the gap at $2. 9 billion. If confirmed when the administration recalculates revenues this month, legislators will have 45 days to find $1 billion in cuts beyond those proposed by Kaine in December.LiNeBrEaKEfforts to balance the budget will probably be complicated by squabbling between the House, which is controlled by Republicans, and the Senate, which the Democrats control.LiNeBrEaKKaine, the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee, sought to rise above the partisanship by focusing his speech on how he plans to navigate the state through the recession.LiNeBrEaKHe vowed to speed up construction of previously approved state projects and said he is working with President-elect Barack Obama to make sure Virginia gets its fair share of the economic stimulus package pending before Congress.LiNeBrEaKKaine is also proposing a big effort to lure to the state companies that focus on the manufacture or sale of environmentally friendly products. Beside helping to slow climate change, Kaine said, the state could add thousands of "green jobs."LiNeBrEaK"The development of new energy sources presents dramatic new opportunities for the commonwealth," Kaine said during his 42-minute speech.LiNeBrEaKIn the GOP response to Kaine's address, Del. David B. Albo (Fairfax) indicated that his party is willing to work with the governor on environmental initiatives.LiNeBrEaKHouse and Senate Republicans want to set aside more than 25,000 acres of state land for renewable energy and work with the tobacco commission to allocate $100 million for the research and development of alternative energy sources. The commission oversees Virginia's share of the 1997 tobacco settlement.LiNeBrEaK"When it comes to energy, Republicans want to work with Democrats to keep the cost of heating oil, gasoline and electricity down," Albo said.LiNeBrEaKMore contentious will be Kaine's proposal for a 30-cent increase in the tobacco tax, which has generated opposition from Republican leaders. Legislators will also debate election law changes, the prospect of drilling off the coastline, driver safety initiatives and regulation of companies that offer vehicle title loans.LiNeBrEaKAnd they will consider a handful of perennial hot-button issues, including a ban on smoking in restaurants and bars and a requirement that gun sellers conduct background checks on people who buy firearms at gun shows.LiNeBrEaKKaine gave no indication Wednesday that he plans to push for a new transportation funding plan after failing last year to forge a compromise on a proposal to raise money for new roads. That means he will probably leave office without fulfilling a key promise from his 2005 campaign.LiNeBrEaKDespite calls for bipartisanship, the day began with a fierce showdown between House Republicans and Democrats that has left Alexandria residents without representation in the House.LiNeBrEaKWith Democrat Charniele Herring clinging to a 16-vote lead over her GOP opponent in Tuesday's special election to replace former delegate Brian Moran, the GOP majority voted to block her from being seated pending a recount.LiNeBrEaK"It's a bad start," Del. Robert H. Brink (D-Arlington) said.LiNeBrEaKLater in the day, House Republicans attempted to scuttle Democrats' plans to attend Monday's Virginia Inaugural Ball, which is a fundraiser for the state party. Republicans say Kaine and Democratic lawmakers are skirting the prohibition against raising money during the session by attending.LiNeBrEaKThe tension will probably continue as lawmakers gear up for another campaign season that will generate national attention.LiNeBrEaKWith the first contested Democratic primary for governor in two decades, lawmakers in that party are being forced to choose sides in the nomination fight among Moran, Terry McAuliffe and Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (Bath). Although recent legislative sessions have been marred by Republican infighting, the Democrats were the ones divided this year over who should succeed Moran as chairman of the House Democratic caucus.LiNeBrEaKAfter deadlocking in three consecutive ballots, House Democrats chose Del. Kenneth R. Plum (Fairfax) over Del. Kristen J. Amundson (Fairfax) as caucus chairman.LiNeBrEaKThe winner of the June Democratic gubernatorial primary will take on Attorney General Robert F. McDonnell (R) in the general election. Democrats will also be looking to pick up the six seats needed to gain control of the House.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Fredrick Kunkle contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	Nominee Signals Big Changes For EPA;  Confirmation Hearing Held 	FOREIGN; Pg. A08  	730 words  	At the outset of Lisa P. Jackson's confirmation hearing yesterday to be Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said many of his constituents fear that the incoming Obama administration will use existing laws to enact broad environmental rules.LiNeBrEaK"All fear for their economic future in today's political environment," he told Jackson and Nancy Helen Sutley, who is in line to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality. "Ranchers and miners know that addressing climate change through the Clean Air Act is a disaster waiting to happen. That's something Congress never intended." LiNeBrEaKIn her response a couple of hours later, Jackson agreed she would consider applying existing laws to issues that were not on the agenda 30 years ago when Congress passed them. The laws, she told Barrasso, "were meant to address not only the issues of today, but the issues of tomorrow."LiNeBrEaKThe 4  1/2  -hour hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee underscored the dramatic shifts that could occur at the EPA and CEQ if Jackson and Sutley, as expected, are confirmed. While Jackson shied away from specifying what steps she would take upon beginning the job, the former head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection said she would consider regulating coal ash waste from power plants in the aftermath of recent spills and take a more active approach toward other environmental concerns.LiNeBrEaK"Science must be the backbone of what EPA does," she said, adding that she aims to serve Americans who have suffered from "environmental negligence" such as the effects from untended Superfund sites or the government's botched response to Hurricane Katrina. "They are my conscience."LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who chairs the panel, pressed Jackson on whether she would back measures to start regulating carbon dioxide, such as a finding that  CO2 emissions endanger public health and welfare and a waiver allowing California and other states to impose their own regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles. Boxer's staff even prepared a "Report on the Tools Available Under the Clean Air Act to Immediately Reduce Global Warming Pollution" outlining how Jackson could do so.LiNeBrEaKIt would take time to finalize either of these measures, both of which outgoing EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson rejected, because the agency would have to conduct a rule-making process on each. But David Doniger, policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate center, said that both could be concluded within months, and that the private sector would feel the impact immediately.LiNeBrEaKBoxer told Jackson she might end up angering senators such as Barrasso, but that just meant she was tackling a pressing issue. "You're not going to make everybody happy," Boxer said. "That's for sure, because if you do, that means you're doing nothing."LiNeBrEaKThat sort of activism, however, alarms business leaders such as U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. Donohue, who told reporters last week that his group wants Congress to take the lead on climate regulation.LiNeBrEaK"We're better off with the Congress making those decisions rather than the independent regulators who have just arrived in town on a white horse and want to do good things," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut Frank O'Donnell, who heads the advocacy group Clean Air Watch, said he is optimistic that "an Obama administration will send a signal that it intends to use every power available to make progress on this critical issue until -- and even beyond when -- Congress takes action."LiNeBrEaKThe waiver allowing California's tailpipe emissions law to go forward would affect half the U.S. auto market, Doniger said, adding that while a rule-making may take two to three months, "in political form, it's done the day it's announced."LiNeBrEaKJeffrey Holmstead, who heads the environmental strategy section at the Bracewell and Giuliani law firm and is a former assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation, said making a finding that  CO2 endangers public health could take a year or longer to finalize.LiNeBrEaKEven more daunting, he said, is the question of how EPA will apply a provision of the Clean Air Act that labels any emitter of 250 tons of a pollutant a year as a "major source" of pollution. When you apply that standard to carbon dioxide, he said, "any building in downtown Washington could be a major source."

The Washington Post 	January 15, 2009 Thursday   Suburban Edition	Coalition Agrees on Emissions Cuts;  Businesses, Environmentalists Set Plans on Climate Change 	FINANCIAL; Pg. D01  	766 words  	An influential group of large U.S. corporations and environmental organizations have forged a detailed blueprint for limiting greenhouse gases in the hope of shaping and pushing forward climate change legislation this year.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Climate Action Partnership says its ability to reach consensus is a crucial step forward since its 32 members include corporate giants such as General Electric, Conoco Phillips, Duke Energy, DuPont and General Motors as well as the Environmental Defense Fund and World Resources Institute.LiNeBrEaKTheir plan for a cap-and-trade system calls for a 42 percent cut in emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels, limits on emissions from petroleum products and natural gas, rich incentives for the first few coal plants to capture and sequester carbon dioxide emissions, and a carbon market board to examine offsets and contain costs. LiNeBrEaKThe plan would also require any coal plant permitted after Jan. 1, 2015, to emit no more than half the carbon dioxide emissions now considered normal and require any newly permitted plant today to have the ability to be retrofitted to meet that standard.LiNeBrEaK"The fact that we got this coalition to coalesce around a set of choices I think is impressive," said Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric. "Most businesses prefer to make investments with certainty about what regulations are going to be in place."LiNeBrEaKThough some critics have said that climate legislation could impose costs on an already weak economy, DuPont Chairman Charles Holliday said his company would likely boost spending on thin film solar panels and some biofuel projects if a bill established incentives for non-carbon energy sources.LiNeBrEaKThe same group issued an action plan two years ago, but at that time members could not agree on key specifics. Today's more detailed blueprint is "more aggressive than what we called for two years ago," said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade system establishes a limit on carbon emissions, then allows companies to buy and sell allowances in order to meet the targets. Climate Action Partnership's proposal would allow companies to offset a limited amount of their own emissions by reducing emissions in developing countries.LiNeBrEaKHowever, elements of the plan designed to win corporate support will likely face criticism from some supporters of cap-and-trade. Whereas many economists and environmentalists support auctioning all emission allowances, Climate Action Partnership says its blueprint gives a significant number allowances away free to companies currently releasing carbon dioxide. The free allowances would be phased out.LiNeBrEaKSome lawmakers might also balk at a proposal to subsidize a limited number of coal plants designed to capture carbon dioxide emissions. The subsidies could cost as much as $540 million a year for a 1,000 megawatt plant.LiNeBrEaKThough the U.S. CAP is broad, many corporate executives and economists remain skeptical. Last week, Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex Tillerson called cap-and-trade a "stealth tax" and instead endorsed a tax on carbon emissions that he said would be more transparent and predictable.LiNeBrEaK"Cap and trade introduces enormous volatility in the price of permits," said Rob Shapiro, who was undersecretary  of commerce under President Clinton and is chairman of Sonecon, an economic advisory firm. Moreover, he said, "cap and trade is so complex that it allows a lot of mechanisms for gaming the system."LiNeBrEaKHowever, there is widespread support for a cap-and-trade system among leading Democrats and Obama nominees. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), who will hold a hearing on the business group's blueprint today, is eager to pass a cap-and-trade bill.LiNeBrEaK"We will move forward as fast as we can recognizing that we'll need considerable bipartisan consensus given the size of the issue," said Drew Hamill, a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). "It's a huge issue. It's going to take time to get everyone on the same page." He said Pelosi had not set any target date for the legislation, adding only that "it's not something you start out of the gate with."LiNeBrEaKIn one sign of the difficulty of keeping a coalition together,  the National Wildlife Federation withdrew from Climate Action Partnership rather than endorse its blueprint. In a statement yesterday, the group called Climate Action Partnership "a welcome, strong force for action," but said that it would independently try to "enact a cap-and-invest bill that measures up to what scientists say is needed and makes bold investments in a clean energy economy."

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 15, 2009 Thursday 	Whales' migrations evoke curiosity  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	919 words  	Jan. 15--Climate change is a real consequence facing the planet, and its affects now are beginning to manifest on a more local scale with the migration patterns of various whale species, many which are seen off the coast of Point Vicente in Rancho Palos Verdes.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, studies show that the Pacific gray whale's southbound migration to its Baja California winter breeding and calving grounds has become more lengthy, according to Michele Sousa, the Aquarium of the Pacific's senior marine mammal biologist. LiNeBrEaK"What we're seeing is that a lot of the animals are having to go further north to get their food ... [and they] go up further because it's not in their normal places," Sousa said. "Then, when they make the trip back, that's why we think we're seeing some increases in births en route, instead of waiting to get to Baja."LiNeBrEaKObservations also indicate slight abnormalities in the migratory patterns of the fin whale -- the second largest mammal on Earth, next to the blue whale.LiNeBrEaKDan Salas, an RPV resident and captain of Harbor Breeze Cruises, said he started spotting the fin whales in July 2008, and they've been in local waters ever since.LiNeBrEaK"They're just making themselves at home ... It's kind of unusual to have fin whales feeding this time of year right off our coast," he said. "Something has definitely changed here with the ocean current and the climate for these whales to stay so late ... For some reason, there's quite a bit of food here."LiNeBrEaKFin whales are similar to the blue variety in that they're a "cosmopolitan" species found in all oceans. The 50- to 70-ton animals usually remain off the coast through early September, but Salas said there have been about 15 to 18 whales "actively" feeding on krill, a shrimp-like plankton, spread out in a 20-mile area from Long Beach to Santa Monica Bay.LiNeBrEaKAs of Wednesday morning, census takers from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Cetacean Society stationed at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in RPV counted 138 gray whales and 10 calves heading south since Dec. 1. The previous day, the group reported seeing fin whales, and one pair came within a mile of the shoreline. Blue whales were last seen off of Point Vicente on Dec. 16 and humpbacks haven't made an appearance since Dec. 28.LiNeBrEaKWhile viewing the massive sea creatures from afar on land may be exhilarating, a newly formed joint venture allows those curious about cetaceans to view them up close.LiNeBrEaKHarbor Breeze Cruises, in partnership with the Aquarium of the Pacific, now offers the public an "educational whale adventure" that includes a whale-watching trip on "The Christopher," Salas' high-speed catamaran built specifically for chasing ocean life, plus a visit to the aquarium.LiNeBrEaKOn these journeys -- available seven days a week -- the aquarium's experts stress the importance of what people can do to keep the marine mammals' habitat clean.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of people don't realize we have this diversity right off of our coast, and what they do on land affects all of these animals," said Alicia Archer, the aquarium's biologist and boat program coordinator. "A lot of our trash [flows from] the storm drains directly into the ocean. Now, these animals are filter feeders. You can imagine that what goes in the ocean also can get stuck in their baleen, [furry plates on either side of their mouth that trap the food source, while allowing water to leave]."LiNeBrEaKIt's about respect, Archer and Salas both said -- not only for the ocean, but also for the cetaceans, such as fin whales, that are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.LiNeBrEaK"We're just out here to enjoy them. A lot of the whales know -- I mean, these whales are so smart," Salas said. "They actually know we're here. Sometimes they'll come out and check us out, see how we're doing ... I think they're more intelligent than humans. Could be, huh?"LiNeBrEaKACS-LA volunteers Cynthia Woo and Palos Verdes resident Natalie Massie, who belong to the same group of census takers conducting daily counts at the PVIC, last Thursday, Jan. 8, boarded "The Christopher," applying their expertise to help spot the whales on a special voyage. That day, about seven to eight miles off the coast of Long Beach, the group encountered three playful fin whales who came within close range of the 75-foot boat.LiNeBrEaKSightings of these giants of the deep sea strike a winsome sense of awe in even the most seasoned of whale watchers.LiNeBrEaK"They're spectacular -- they're huge," Woo said.LiNeBrEaK"The biggest excitement I get now is being able to take people out who don't get to see these animals. I still get excited when I see them," added Salas, who has more than 20 years of boating experience.LiNeBrEaKTo keep track of the whale migrations, stop by the Interpretive Center, 31501 Palos Verdes Drive West in RPV, or log onto the local ACS branch's Web site at www.acs-la.org.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Chu May Push Labs To Evolve: Panel Questions DOE Nominee  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	642 words  	Jan. 14--WASHINGTON -- Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate physicist and national laboratory director chosen by Presidentelect Barack Obama to lead the Department of Energy, told Congress on Tuesday that he would combat climate change and aggressively promote clean energy and conservation if confirmed for the Cabinet post.LiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California since 2004, also endorsed nuclear power and said coal can remain a key energy source, provided that new science mitigates its negative effect on the environment. Chu had previously described coal use as an envir on ment a l "nightmare," p r o mp t i n g s o m e wor -- ried questions from senators who represent coal-producing states. LiNeBrEaKDespite those concerns, Chu, 60, received near-unanimous praise from members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaKSen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Democratic chairman of the committee, said he expects Chu to win confirmation. The panel could move the nomination to the full Senate later this week, Bingaman said.LiNeBrEaKBingaman said the nominee's experience as a national laboratory director is a good sign for Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories, with more than 20,000 employees in New Mexico.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously he's very familiar with our national laboratories ... and he knows the lab directors and the issues that the labs contend with," Bingaman said in an interview after the hearing.LiNeBrEaKChu told senators he would push the national laboratories -- with Los Alamos and some of the others focused on nuclear weapons -- to evolve their missions. "I have challenged some of the best scientists at Berkeley lab to turn their attention to the energy and climate change problem," Chu said. "I want to extend this approach to an even greater extent throughout the department's network of national laboratories."LiNeBrEaKThe hearing contained almost no discussion of weapons budgets at the labs. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a report this week that said at least 67 percent of DOE's budget goes to nuclear weapons and weapons-related programs.LiNeBrEaKDanielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, said that spending should have been examined at the hearing.LiNeBrEaK"How can the Senate confirm Dr. Chu without having heard a single thing about how he plans to run the vast majority of the Department of Energy?" Brian asked in a statement. "This is a case where the Senate has left some pretty important questions unanswered."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Chu told senators that although he would push for more use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, simply using less energy makes more sense in the short-term.LiNeBrEaK"More efficient use of energy in the United States is the one big factor that can (quickly) reduce our dependence on foreign oil," Chu said.LiNeBrEaKHe also said climate change, which some key Republicans in Congress believe isn't caused by humans, threatens world security if carbon dioxide emissions aren't curbed.LiNeBrEaK"It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic disruptive changes to our climate system in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren," Chu said.LiNeBrEaKHe said science eventually will provide a way to help capture and contain carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, a leading energy source in the U.S.LiNeBrEaK"Coal resources in the U.S. are immense, and I'm optimistic we can begin to use those resources in a clean way," Chu said.

"This is a case where the Senate has left some pretty important questions unanswered."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Chu told senators that although he would push for more use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, simply using less energy makes more sense in the shortterm.LiNeBrEaK"More efficient use of energy in the United States is the one big factor that can (quickly) reduce our dependence on foreign oil," Chu said.LiNeBrEaKHe also said climate change, which some key Republicans in Congress believe isn't caused by humans, threatens world security if carbon dioxide emissions aren't curbed.LiNeBrEaK"It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic disruptive changes to our climate system in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren," Chu said.LiNeBrEaKHe said science eventually will provide a way to help capture and contain carbon dioxide emissions from burning coal, a leading energy source in the U.S.LiNeBrEaK"Coal resources in the U.S. are immense, and I'm optimistic we can begin to use those resources in a clean way," Chu said.

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Alaska should prepare for this important shift in national policy: A change is coming  	COMMENTARY  	628 words  	Jan. 14--Monday, the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce got a briefing that might be listed under the heading of "What a difference an election makes." Local attorney Heather Grahame told the business group's weekly luncheon that the new Congress and the new president will push major new laws to reduce greenhouse gas pollution. She urged Alaska businesses to think about getting ready for the coming change.LiNeBrEaKThere is "extraordinary political momentum" for action on greenhouse gases, said Grahame, who specializes in energy legislation at the law firm Dorsey and Whitney. LiNeBrEaK"Obama promised to make us a worldwide leader on climate change," she noted, and he is appointing people who will make good on that promise. In Congress, key committee positions are now held by members who are eager to move greenhouse gas legislation.LiNeBrEaKFixing the economy is still the top priority in Washington D.C., but climate change is right behind on the "to-do" list.LiNeBrEaKThe days of "inaction by the federal government" on global warming are over, according to Grahame.LiNeBrEaKAnd isn't that a welcome change?LiNeBrEaKAt last, the nation has a leader who realizes what's at stake. No longer will the president deny what the best available science shows -- that man-made greenhouse gases are pushing the earth toward a potentially catastrophic tipping point with climate change.LiNeBrEaKGrahame said there will be plenty of debate about exactly how best to control greenhouse gases. Old style command-and-control regulation -- the government sets limits on the pollution and then tries to enforces those limits with fines -- has fallen out of favor. Market-based approaches are getting more attention.LiNeBrEaKOne market-based option is a tax on greenhouse gas emissions -- charging industries (or maybe even consumers) for the right to pollute. The less you pollute, the lower the taxes.LiNeBrEaKAnother market approach is called cap-and-trade. Government sets an overall limit on greenhouse gas pollution and gives (or sells) pollution "allowances" to various industries or businesses. An industry that can easily reduce greenhouse gas pollution will have allowances it doesn't need. Those extra allowances can be traded or sold to businesses that have a harder time reduces greenhouse gases. Over time, the cap can be lowered to ensure pollution levels actually go down.LiNeBrEaKIt will be a challenge to get a market-based pollution control system right. Set a carbon tax too high, and you hurt the economy, which is already in a world of hurt. Set it too low, and you don't cut pollution enough.LiNeBrEaKThe same is true for cap-and-trade. Choosing where to set the cap will be controversial. So will deciding how to allocate pollution rights among businesses, industries and consumers.LiNeBrEaKReducing greenhouse gases requires complicated choices, without knowing exactly how well the rules and market incentives will pay off. But success is possible, as Grahame pointed out to the chamber of commerce audience. Cap and trade controls placed on sulfur dioxide years ago have efficiently and effectively cut emissions and helped control acid rain, an environmental scourge of the 1970s and '80s.LiNeBrEaKThe country won't see similar progress on greenhouse gas pollution overnight -- but at least the hard work in Washington, D.C., is finally getting underway.LiNeBrEaKBOTTOM LINE: On global warming, the recent election made a big difference -- and that's a good thing.

The Boston Globe 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	Clinton says she would embrace climate, arms treaties Lays out vision to revitalize US leadership  	NATIONAL; Pg. A9  	998 words  	A NEW PRESIDENTLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Senator Hillary Clinton pledged yesterday that as secretary of state she would revitalize US leadership by embracing a host of treaties on arms control and climate change that the Bush administration has been reluctant to endorse.LiNeBrEaKIn five hours of testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she said she would revive attempts to ratify or renegotiate several international accords, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which bans nuclear weapons testing; the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, which stops the production of fuel for nuclear weapons; and the START agreement between the United States and Russia, which expires in December. The treaty reduces stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Clinton said during her confirmation hearing that President-elect Barack Obama would appoint a negotiator to international efforts to halt global climate change.LiNeBrEaK"The best way to advance America's interests in reducing global threats and seizing global opportunities is to design and implement global solutions," Clinton said in her opening remarks. "That isn't a philosophical point. This is our reality." LiNeBrEaKHer statements marked a drastic departure from the Bush administration's broad skepticism toward treaties, and were greeted enthusiastically by Democrats and many Republicans on the committee, as well as by specialists on arms control and the environment.LiNeBrEaK"The Obama administration recognizes that to deal with international challenges like nuclear proliferation and nuclear weapons, we need greater cooperation," said Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based nonproliferation think tank. "If we are going to improve the global system, the United States is going to have to lead by example, and these three initiatives have been something that other countries expect the United states to take action on."LiNeBrEaKHowever, some conservatives have already begun to campaign against the treaties, which need a two-thirds majority in the Senate to pass, saying that they bring the United States closer to world government and unwisely tie US hands.LiNeBrEaK"More senators should be educated about the sovereignty implications of these treaties," said Steven Groves of the conservative Heritage Foundation, although he acknowledged that "it could still be a tough fight to block them."LiNeBrEaKMassachusetts Democrat John Kerry, who made his debut yesterday as chair of the committee - a position recently relinquished by Vice President-elect Joe Biden - warmly welcomed Clinton's pledges to take climate change seriously and made his own impassioned plea for US participation in international efforts.LiNeBrEaK"Many today do not see climate change as a national security threat, but it is," Kerry said in his opening remarks.LiNeBrEaKThroughout the hearing, Clinton commented with confidence on a wide range of foreign policy questions - from meat-and-potatoes issues, like Iraq, to arcane topics, like the need to map the continental shelf.LiNeBrEaKOn Iran, Clinton declined to say whether she would soon meet with Iranian officials, but said the new administration would use both sanctions and diplomacy to dissuade Tehran from continuing uranium enrichment.LiNeBrEaK"We are not taking any option off the table at all, but we will pursue a new, perhaps different approach that will become a cornerstone of what the Obama administration believes is an attitude toward engagement that might bear fruit," she said.LiNeBrEaKOn the Israel-Palestinian crisis, she pledged stepped-up US engagement in building the capacity of a Palestinian government, saying "We cannot give up on peace."LiNeBrEaKStill, the issue of foreign donations to a foundation run by her husband, former president Bill Clinton, came up several times in the hearing as members implored her to take additional measures to ensure there was no appearance of a conflict of interest.LiNeBrEaK"The bottom line is that even well-intentioned foreign donations carry risk for US foreign policy," Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican from Indiana, told her, adding that the foundation was a "temptation" for foreign governments who might see it as a way to curry favor.LiNeBrEaKLugar applauded both Clinton's credentials and her foreign policy vision, and pledged to support her nomination, but called on the Clintons to either decline new foreign donations or at the very least make them public as soon as possible. Senator Clinton has agreed to allow vetting of donations to the foundation by foreign governments - not individuals - through the State Department ethics office and to make all donations public once a year.LiNeBrEaKSenator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, and Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, also urged her to ask her husband to curtail acceptance of foreign donations. Corker said that the Clinton Foundation, which operates a number of global anti-poverty and HIV efforts, is a "speck" compared with the "huge magnitude of efforts" that Clinton herself can now enact on behalf of the US government.LiNeBrEaKClinton made no promises to amend the agreement that she struck with the committee, saying that she is already going beyond what ethics rules requires, and that the foundation pays for lifesaving drugs for 1. 4 million people in the developing world.LiNeBrEaK"My husband doesn't take a salary. He has no financial interest in any of this," she said, expressing pride in the foundation's work. "I don't take a salary. I don't have any financial interest."LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press reported yesterday that Senator Clinton intervened at least six times on issues affecting companies or individuals that later contributed to her husband's foundation. For example, the AP said she had written to the Federal Communications Commission in 2004, expressing concern that changes to competitive local exchange carrier access rates could hurt carriers such as New York-based PAETEC Communications. PAETEC's chief executive is Arunas Chesonis, whose family and charity later contributed to the Clinton Foundation, the report said.

Buffalo News (New York) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   CENTRAL EDITION	Deep freeze grips WNY;  Record cold temperatures feared in next few days 	NEWS; Pg. A1  	1153 words  	We were buffeted by record-setting, hurricane-force winds.LiNeBrEaKWe were blasted by record-setting snowfall in a couple of blizzardlike snowstorms.LiNeBrEaKNow comes the deep freeze.LiNeBrEaKAn Arctic front moved into Western New York overnight, bringing bone-chilling temperatures -- and the outside chance of a record low -- for the next few days.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming?LiNeBrEaKNot here. Temperatures won't climb very far out of the single digits until the weekend, and Thursday night's low will hit a numbing minus-5 degrees. LiNeBrEaK"It's been a couple years since we've been this cold," said Joseph Pace, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service at Buffalo Niagara International Airport.LiNeBrEaKTuesday's blustery winds and steady snow are giving way to uncommonly frigid temperatures that will linger here for several days and make Buffalo feel more like Siberia.LiNeBrEaKThe icy temperatures may come close to the record low for Thursday's date -- minus-12 in 1957. And, combined with the wind chill, it will make it utterly unpleasant outside for two- and four-legged creatures.LiNeBrEaKBuffalonians tend to think of themselves as hardy folk who won't let winter weather disrupt our routines.LiNeBrEaKBut with the cold front moving in, experts are offering a range of tips to help people stay safe as they try to warm their homes, commute to work and get their children ready for school.LiNeBrEaK"I would think it's a great thing to be prepared, especially with the subzero temperatures that are being forecast," said Shaun D. Seufert of the AAA of Western and Central New York.LiNeBrEaK* Most calls to AAA at this time of year involve battery and lock-out problems, and the agency is bracing for more of the same the next few days, said Seufert.LiNeBrEaKThe AAA that covers the metro Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse areas received nearly 16,000 calls for vehicle assistance over one five-day period in late December -- double the typical number, he said.LiNeBrEaK* It's important when the temperatures fall to such dangerous levels to try to be there for neighbors and others who need a little extra help, said Dr. Karthik Puppala, a resident in family medicine at Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital, Amherst.LiNeBrEaKMany of those admitted to the hospital with weather-related problems -- frostbite, injuries from falls on ice -- were vulnerable because of their age or medical condition or because they lived alone, he said.LiNeBrEaK* Cats and dogs need special attention as well, said Gina Browning, a spokeswoman for the Erie County SPCA.LiNeBrEaK"They can't tell us when they're too cold," Browning said. "We have to be really in tune with our pets and what they're trying to tell us with their behavior."LiNeBrEaK* With the deep freeze coming, hardware stores in the area have noticed some people trying to better prepare their homes for the cold.LiNeBrEaK"I recommend you keep your water on just a little bit, so it's dripping out and it doesn't sit in [the pipes] and freeze," said Frank DiMaria, owner of Mr. Plumber in the Town of Tonawanda.LiNeBrEaKIf your pipes do freeze, DiMaria said, call a professional.LiNeBrEaKAlso, if a plumber does come out to the house to thaw the pipes, make sure he also determines what the problem is so the pipes don't freeze again several hours later.LiNeBrEaK"Don't do it yourself," he said. "A lot of fires happen when there are people trying to thaw out their pipes. They try to use a torch, then you have insulation burning, drywall burning."LiNeBrEaK* With temperatures dropping so severely, area schools will be keeping an eye on the weather.LiNeBrEaKDistricts decide whether to cancel classes early, with superintendents up by about 4 a.m. to get the latest conditions from the National Weather Service, police and highway crews.LiNeBrEaK"We've had 12 days in the last 14 years when we closed for cold," said John Fahey, assistant superintendent for transportation for the Buffalo Public Schools. "The threshold seems to be minus-20 degrees, with the wind chill."LiNeBrEaKIf school is not closed on these frigid days, parents may want to accompany their children to the bus stop or at least make sure they know what to do if the bus doesn't show up, Fahey said.LiNeBrEaKParents also have the option of driving their children, car pooling or keeping them home.LiNeBrEaKAs thousands of children around Erie County go to sleep this week dreaming of a day off from school, the rest of us will have to wait until the weekend for relief from the cold.LiNeBrEaKIt will be cold, but not as cold as it was in parts of the Great Plains and upper Midwest, where temperatures hit lows of minus-40 degrees.LiNeBrEaKAs another Arctic front moves into the area, temperatures Thursday will be bone-chilling, with a high near 5 degrees in the afternoon and winds that could gust to 28 mph.LiNeBrEaKThis region hasn't had a day where the high temperature didn't break 5 degrees since January 1994, meteorologist Jon Hitchcock said.LiNeBrEaKThe low Thursday night will drop to minus-5 degrees at the airport, and it will likely be much colder farther inland.LiNeBrEaKTemperatures should hit the mid-20s Sunday.LiNeBrEaKe-mail: swatson@buffnews.com and jrey@buffnews.comLiNeBrEaK&gt;Tips to get through the deep freezeLiNeBrEaKFor youLiNeBrEaK* Try not to leave any skin exposed to the elements.LiNeBrEaK* Dress in layers. Keep your extremities warm. Wear boots, hats and gloves, though mittens are better.LiNeBrEaK* If you know a family member or neighbor who lives alone and needs extra assistance, check in on them to make sure they have adequate heat and food.LiNeBrEaKFor your childrenLiNeBrEaK* If you are worried about your kids waiting at the bus stop, accompany them, drive them to school, find a car pool or keep them home.LiNeBrEaK* Check children playing outside for frostbite or hypothermia.LiNeBrEaK* For more tips, visit this page at the Buffalo Public Schools Web site: www.buffaloschools.org/news.cfm?story=1369LiNeBrEaKFor your vehicleLiNeBrEaK* Make sure your vehicle's battery is in good condition and keep the terminal connections clean and tight.LiNeBrEaK* To keep your gas line from freezing, keep the tank at least half full. Using dry gas or a fuel system anti-freeze can help, but consult your owner's manual before doing that.LiNeBrEaK* Warm up your car for five or 10 minutes before driving it.LiNeBrEaK* Check your oil, anti-freeze and windshield wiper fluid levels.LiNeBrEaKFor your petLiNeBrEaK* Don't leave your pet outside unsupervised for any length of time.LiNeBrEaK* Because snow can pile up and pets can scamper over fences, make sure your pet is wearing evident identification tags.LiNeBrEaK* Keep foot pads of cats and dogs free of snow and ice.LiNeBrEaK* Give your car a tap, or a kick, before you start it in case a cat climbed under the hood to find warmth.LiNeBrEaKFor your homeLiNeBrEaK* Keep faucets open to a drip so pipes don't freeze.LiNeBrEaK* Don't try to thaw out pipes by yourself -- call a plumber.LiNeBrEaK* Know where the main water shut-off valve is, and how to turn it off should pipes burst.LiNeBrEaK* Be careful using space heaters; inspect cords on electric heaters.LiNeBrEaK* Keep flammable materials away from heating appliances.LiNeBrEaKSources: Buffalo Public Schools; Williamsville Central School District; Mr. Plumber; AAA of Western and Central New York; City of Buffalo; SPCA; National Weather Service; Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital.

"The threshold seems to be minus-20 degrees, with the wind chill."LiNeBrEaKIf school is not closed on these frigid days, parents may want to accompany their children to the bus stop or at least make sure they know what to do if the bus doesn't show up, Fahey said.LiNeBrEaKParents also have the option of driving their children, car pooling or keeping them home.LiNeBrEaKAs thousands of children around Erie County go to sleep this week dreaming of a day off from school, the rest of us will have to wait until the weekend for relief from the cold.LiNeBrEaKIt will be cold, but not as cold as it was in parts of the Great Plains and upper Midwest, where temperatures hit lows of minus-40 degrees.LiNeBrEaKAs another Arctic front moves into the area, temperatures Thursday will be bone-chilling, with a high near 5 degrees in the afternoon and winds that could gust to 28 mph.LiNeBrEaKThis region hasn't had a day where the high temperature didn't break 5 degrees since January 1994, meteorologist Jon Hitchcock said.LiNeBrEaKThe low Thursday night will drop to minus-5 degrees at the airport, and it will likely be much colder farther inland.LiNeBrEaKTemperatures should hit the mid-20s Sunday.LiNeBrEaKswatson@buffnews.com and jrey@buffnews.com		WEATHER (91%); HURRICANES (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); METEOROLOGY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (77%); CHILDREN (69%); FAMILY PRACTICE (64%); CATS (62%); DOGS (60%); AIRPORTS (54%); COLD INJURIES (72%)  				BUFFALO, NY, USA (90%); ROCHESTER, NY, USA (73%) NEW YORK, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Buffalo News   	Stephen T.

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Nominee promises to work on coal emissions plan  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	581 words  	Jan. 14--CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu pledged Tuesday that, if confirmed as energy secretary, he would lead a government effort to capture the greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKChu backed off a bit from earlier comments -- widely quoted on the Internet after Chu's nomination by President-elect Barack Obama -- that coal was his "worst nightmare," and explained that the term applied only if carbon dioxide emissions go uncontrolled. LiNeBrEaK"I said that in the following context: If the world continues to use coal the way we're using it today ... then it is a pretty bad dream," Chu told a Senate committee during a two-hour confirmation hearing.LiNeBrEaKPreviously, Chu had said publicly that he wasn't certain scientists would find a workable way to capture and bury carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. He had said pilot projects so far were too small to tell if the process would work on the scale needed around the world.LiNeBrEaKDuring Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., quizzed Chu about those comments, prefacing his questions by noting that he chairs an appropriations subcommittee that controls the Department of Energy budget.LiNeBrEaK"It is imperative that we figure out a way to burn coal as cleanly as possible," Chu told Dorgan. "I will work very hard to extensively develop these technologies so that the United States and the rest of the world can use them."LiNeBrEaKHe added, "There are some people in the United States who feel, perhaps, that we should turn off coal, but even if we do, China and India will not."LiNeBrEaKBut Chu also said the United States should take the lead on reducing greenhouse emissions, and not delay action until other nations agree to take the same steps.LiNeBrEaK"I feel pretty strongly that, going forward, all of the countries in the world -- China and India included -- have to be included in a carbon plan to reduce emissions of carbon," Chu said. "I think the United States can take the first step and, hopefully, China will immediately, very closely follow."LiNeBrEaKSen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., responded that such a plan isn't likely to win approval from lawmakers, who have previously declined to mandate greenhouse emissions reductions absent agreement that developing nations will do the same.LiNeBrEaK"It's my honest conviction that that approach will not be enacted by the United States Congress," Bayh said. "That probably won't be good enough to get the job done."LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama pledged to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050. In the near term, his campaign plan called for reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 -- a cut that the coal industry and the United Mine Workers union strongly oppose.LiNeBrEaKIn his prepared confirmation testimony, Chu described climate change as "a growing and pressing problem.LiNeBrEaK"It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate system in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren," Chu told senators.LiNeBrEaKReach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.comLiNeBrEaKor 304-348-1702.

The Clover Herald (South Carolina)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Va. environmental group touts green investments  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	791 words  	Jan. 14--The country's environment and employment could be given a huge boost by investing in clean, green infrastructure, a report by a state environmental advocacy group suggests.LiNeBrEaK"Fossil fuels have run our environment and economy into the ground," said J.R. Tolbert, an advocate for Environment Virginia.LiNeBrEaKThe Richmond-based environmental group released a 34-page report Tuesday outlining how much it says pollution could be reduced if energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements were made nationwide. The document says that if all its proposals -- which include increasing transit operations, funding the Green Jobs Act and creating a building retrofit program -- were implemented within the next decade, annual global warming pollution would be reduced by nearly 10 percent. In terms of oil consumption, the savings would be the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road each year, the report states. LiNeBrEaK"There is so much room for savings," Tolbert said.LiNeBrEaKTolbert said the energy initiatives would not just be beneficial for the environment, but also for the economy, as jobs would be created through infrastructure investments.LiNeBrEaKAs President-elect Barack Obama's $775 billion economic stimulus plan takes shape, the advocacy organization has attempted to convince lawmakers that $150 billion should be directed toward investments in clean energy and green infrastructure, such as wind, solar and geothermal power and public transit.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Obama's plan, which has emphasized green infrastructure improvements and investments in alternative energy, already has been met with skepticism by some legislators who question how much debt the package would generate and whether it would be wise to spend heavily on high-cost renewable energy during a recession.LiNeBrEaKRich Lowry, of the conservative National Review, has called Obama's plan a "lavish, politically correct free lunch," writing that the government should seek to create a favorable business climate and leave the "color-coding" to the marketplace.LiNeBrEaKCharlottesville, meanwhile, is attempting to get a chunk of Obama's proposed stimulus package, having drafted a $36 million list of "shovel-ready" infrastructure projects -- including improvements to the ailing water and sewer systems -- to help spur job growth and economic revitalization.LiNeBrEaKTolbert said the organization released its report in Charlottesville because it has been a "bright light" in the state for tackling energy-efficient projects in its municipal buildings and schools. Apart from winning a dozen awards for its sustainability efforts, Charlottesville's City Council also unanimously voted in July 2006 to sign the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement to reduce carbon dioxide pollution, and the body passed a resolution in December 2007 that obliges the city to purchase electricity from renewable energy sources.LiNeBrEaKCouncilor David Brown said the city is pushing for more incentives for homeowners and businesses to make energy efficiency improvements, which can have sizeable up front costs. The city has an existing real estate tax break for buildings that are 30 percent more energy efficient than state standards, but the program has seen few takers because of how costly it is to make the improvements to the city's aging housing stock.LiNeBrEaK"There's lots of things we've been trying to do as a community," he said. "But the problem is it's just the beginning."LiNeBrEaKThe city has a slate of legislative initiatives -- including energy efficiency tax incentives -- that it wants passed in the General Assembly, which convenes today.LiNeBrEaKAdditionally, prior to the report's release Tuesday, Gov. Timothy M. Kaine on Monday proposed several pieces of legislation that are designed to create "green jobs" statewide -- including a biofuels incentive grant, renewable energy system income tax credits and a sales tax exemption for renewable energy equipment.LiNeBrEaKChad Freckman of Blue Ridge Clean Fuels said certain energy upgrades, such as installing solar panels to generate electricity, are substantially more expensive than the traditional coal-powered plant. But, he said, "if money is going to be spent on infrastructure, let's spend it on something that's going to have long-term payoff."LiNeBrEaKThe transition to a "clean energy economy," Tolbert said, would put 3 million people to work on ready-to-go projects.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Schwarzenegger accused of doing bidding of big business  	NEWS  	974 words  	SACRAMENTO   Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has chastised Democrats as being too firmly in the grasp of special interest groups and his fellow Republicans for hewing too closely to their anti-tax pledges.LiNeBrEaKBut as he portrays himself as standing above the warring factions, Schwarzenegger has held fast to his own loyalties   to the business community   while claiming to seek a solution to the budget crisis that will simultaneously stimulate the economy.LiNeBrEaKCritics say his business-first ideology has clouded budget negotiations. Though both sides say progress has been made in the last several days, a number of obstacles remain, including the governor's demands that Democrats roll back some worker and environmental protections. LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger wants to eliminate the eight-hour workday to allow employers scheduling flexibility and is seeking to exempt a handful of major construction projects from environmental standards, saying exemptions from the California Environmental Quality Act would speed up job production for projects such as the $420 million Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Bore expansion on State Route 24.LiNeBrEaK"This confirms that when the chips are down, the governor goes to bat for wealthy contributors and friends," said Jamie Court, director of Consumer Watchdog, which monitors campaign contributions to the governor. "His heart is with big business."LiNeBrEaKAdministration officials insist the governor has not offered any special favors to the business community, pointing to his proposed tax increases in current negotiations, as well as past efforts such as limiting greenhouse emissions, raising the minimum wage and attempting to reform the health care system.LiNeBrEaK"We're facing a $42 billion shortfall, and the governor's priority is to get people back to work," said Aaron McLear, the governor's spokesman. "His job creation measures do just that."LiNeBrEaKThe administration estimates that 22,000 new jobs would be created with the exemptions and permit streamlining. CEQA is the state law that requires construction projects to minimize environmental impacts. It also allows the public to raise concerns. In addition to the CEQA exemptions, Schwarzenegger wants to create a Cabinet-level board that would have the authority to overrule state agencies' decisions on how quickly to issue building permits.LiNeBrEaK"I've not had a single conversation with big business in all the weeks I've been engaged in discussions," said Will Kempton, director of the California Department of Transportation, which has played a central role in pushing for the CEQA exemptions. "We maintain that the economic urgency compels us to create new opportunities for jobs through CEQA relief and permit streamlining."LiNeBrEaKKempton acknowledged that a streamlined CEQA process could allow CalTrans to sidestep a decision on a pending appeal before the Alameda County Superior Court. CalTrans would be able to reapprove the project with a CEQA exemption.LiNeBrEaKA group of environmentalists, the Fourth Bore Coalition, is seeking stronger environmental protections to be put in place before allowing the Caldecott project to move forward.LiNeBrEaKCritics say "shovel-ready" projects   and tens of thousands of jobs   could have been protected if Schwarzenegger had agreed to the Democrats' $18 billion deficit reduction plan. He vetoed it last week. Nearly 2,000 infrastructure projects were put on hold last month when a state agency that handles financing for bond-funded projects, the Pooled Money Investment Board, had to suspend the allocation of $3. 8 billion to avoid running out of cash.LiNeBrEaK"That's the part that makes me angry," said Paul Mason, deputy director of Sierra Club California. "The standoff is making the problem worse. People are losing jobs with projects that are funded by PMIB dollars. There's more than enough good projects where you don't have to waive environmental protections. It's holding the state hostage to weak environmental protections in a way that doesn't even provide economic benefit in the short term."LiNeBrEaKInstead, Schwarzenegger appears to be using the budget crisis to sidestep environmental safeguards, said Ann Smulka, chair of the Fourth Bore Coalition and a member of Berkeley's Transportation Commission.LiNeBrEaK"It seems shortsighted to do something that would have an impact for the next 20 to 30 years for jobs that may be created in the next five years," Smulka said. "Especially when mitigation would provide jobs and should be done. This just shows the power of government versus the little guy, and CEQA is there to protect the little guy."LiNeBrEaKDevelopers have long sought to weaken CEQA, which they contend delays construction and increases costs. Developers and others in the construction industry have contributed $21. 6 million to Schwarzenegger since he took office in 2003 after promising to take moneyed influence out of Sacramento. He's taken another $15 million from banks and other businesses, according to Consumer Watchdog.LiNeBrEaKEliminating the eight-hour workday would reduce overtime pay for workers, which means less money going into the economy, said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Federation of Labor. "It's just more money in the pocket of big business and has nothing to do with spurring on the economy," Pulaski said. "And it only makes budget negotiations more complicated when you add extraneous things that have nothing to do with the budget."LiNeBrEaKThe governor is merely trying to reduce costs for employers, which will enable them to hire more employees, said Allan Zaremberg, president and CEO of CalChamber, which represents more than 16,000 businesses.LiNeBrEaK"The governor knows that without a robust private sector, there's less money for essential government programs," Zaremberg said. "To say protecting jobs means he's in the pocket of big business is a misunderstanding."LiNeBrEaKReach Steven Harmon at 916-441-2101 or sharmon@bayareanewsgroup.com		TAXES and TAXATION (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); JOB CREATION (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (88%); CONSTRUCTION (88%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (88%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (88%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (78%); BUDGET (77%); TAX LAW (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (74%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); CAMPAIGN FINANCE (73%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (73%); BUILDING PERMITS (73%); EMISSIONS (69%); MINIMUM WAGE (69%); WAGES and SALARIES (69%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (68%); CONSUMER LAW (66%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (66%); HEALTH CARE (65%); APPEALS (60%); HEALTH CARE REFORM (50%)  			ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (94%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (93%); SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  	By Steven Harmon, MediaNews Sacramento Bureau

The Destin Log (Florida)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	A World Wide Web of difference: Destin teen using multimedia for civil rights awareness  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	612 words  	Jan. 14--Jessica Best has no ordinary routine. She goes to school in her pajamas and now she has plans to fight for civil rights via the World Wide Web.LiNeBrEaKA sophomore through Florida Virtual School, Jessica has been residing in Miramar Beach since shortly after Hurricane Ivan.LiNeBrEaKShe will be leaving Destin this week when she and her mother, Signe, move back to Oklahoma, but she will be taking a new mission with her that she acquired from her stint as a Florida Virtual student. LiNeBrEaKFor Colleen Brandao's global studies course, Jessica made a video using Windows Movie Maker that was a review of what she had learned in the class. She learned about globalization in the sense of the economic, cultural, technological and political influences that countries have on one another.LiNeBrEaKWhen Brandao saw the quality of her work, she recommended Jessica for the DOTCOM initiative. DOTCOM is the acronym for Developing Online Tools for Civic Outreach and Mobilization. The program teaches students to "gain media literacy skills and create socially conscious media that will impact communities."LiNeBrEaK"It's getting kids from Armenia, America and Azerbaijan to work together on civil rights," Jessica said.LiNeBrEaKDOTCOM students depict issues through the lens of media, ultimately creating their own documentaries, digital stories, short films, public service announcements and other media for distribution internationally.LiNeBrEaKJessica said that videos made by DOTCOM students will be posted on Youtube.com and other networking sites to raise awareness of civil rights issues.LiNeBrEaKElizabeth Metraux, the DOTCOM program director in Waitsfield, Vt., told The Log that students take on issues that directly affect youth or matter to young people in their everyday lives.LiNeBrEaK"This could be as broad as global warming and international conflict, or as specific and 'local' as stereotyping, discrimination, etc., looking at how the media portrays those important issues and how students can use the media to motivate change on those issues," Metraux explained.LiNeBrEaKJessica hopes to hone in on freedom of religion and the stripping of human rights in other countries. Through her unusual education, she is learning to combine her talents and passion for humanitarian work to carve out a unique high school experience.LiNeBrEaK"With Jessica's experience as a young leader in her community, I'm eager to learn from her as we decode media messages and explore ways to inspire meaningful change in our world," Metraux said.LiNeBrEaKThe Log has been running into more Florida Virtual School students who normally take advantage of the flexible scheduling to pursue a specific dream. But Jessica finds it a practical alternative for the average teen as well.LiNeBrEaK"I definitely like to do it, because it gives me more time to do other things like go to church and help out there more," Jessica said.LiNeBrEaKAfter she graduates, she plans to attend technical school to learn engineering technology to develop new avenues for cleaner energy.LiNeBrEaK"I'm very fortunate that she's so self-motivated," Signe said. "She does it all on her own, really."LiNeBrEaKHome schooling began for Jessica in the third grade.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of people were concerned she would not learn social skills," Signe said, adding that Jessica has a lot of friends and stays very busy.LiNeBrEaK"I can't keep up with all of it," Signe said.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Obama EPA pick aims to revisit California car rules  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	323 words  	Jan. 14--Automakers could quickly face tough new rules limiting global warming pollution from new models in more than a dozen states after President-elect Barack Obama's nominee to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday she would tackle the debate soon. LiNeBrEaKDetroit automakers and their foreign competitors have waged a lengthy legal fight against California's rules that set new limits on vehicle emissions to fight global warming, which 17 other states have adopted or vowed to put in place. Such rules would lead to fuel economy targets that automakers and dealers warn would create a patchwork of state laws, drive up costs and limit sales.LiNeBrEaKLast year, the Bush administration EPA denied California's request for a waiver from federal law that's needed for it and the other states to move ahead. Obama pledged during the campaign to overturn the decision, and EPA nominee Lisa Jackson promised fast action to a Senate committee Wednesday.LiNeBrEaK"If I am confirmed I will immediately revisit the waiver, looking at the science and the rule of law, and relying on the expert advice of EPA's employees in making a determination," Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKEPA employees had told current administrator Steve Johnson that federal law and climate science required him to approve California's request, but Johnson rejected it. Several states have sued over the rejection.LiNeBrEaKThe law limits the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases vehicles can emit, which mostly comes from burning fuel.LiNeBrEaKContact Justin Hyde at 202-906-8204 or jhyde@freepress.com		AUTOMOBILE MFG (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (77%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); APPROVALS (72%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (65%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (58%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); LISA P JACKSON (70%)  	DETROIT, MI, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); MICHIGAN, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Detroit Free Press   	Justin Hyde, Detroit Free Press  			Crime/law  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090114-DE-Obama-EPA-pick-aims-to-revisit-California-car-rules-0114  	DE

LiNeBrEaKThe $10,000 six-month contract is aimed at freeing up city crews to take on other responsibilities at the plant, instead of dealing with the invasive foliage on a hard terrain.LiNeBrEaKMesa spokesman Ian Satter said it's hard to use machines, especially at some sites, because of the way they're designed, but it's different for goats.LiNeBrEaK"The place is fenced off and they're free to roam around easily," Satter said.LiNeBrEaKGoats, apparently, can get to places human beings can't.LiNeBrEaKThe water reclamation plant area is steep and rocky, making it hard for human workers to take equipment.LiNeBrEaKBesides the practicality, from the city's viewpoint, this is an eco-friendly move as well.LiNeBrEaKGoats don't pollute, they actually like to eat these plants that are the bane of the city, there are no chemicals or pesticides being used, and no big machines burning up fuel and polluting the air.LiNeBrEaKCities around the country are using this tool for clearing rightsof-way around their roads or to clear weeds near their dumps.LiNeBrEaKSeveral companies across the country, including California's Goats R Us, specialize in supplying goats as grazing machines.LiNeBrEaKOne theory claims domesticated farm animals contribute to greenhouse gases with all that methane they release.

The Hartford Courant (Connecticut)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Survey Shows That Americans Are Eager To Conserve Energy  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	384 words  	Jan. 14--Most Americans already have taken steps to conserve energy, from turning off lights to riding a bicycle to work, and many would like to do more -- if they could afford it, according to a survey by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities. LiNeBrEaKThe survey suggests that many people already have made the easier and less expensive changes in their homes and lifestyles, but that the nation's broader goals of energy independence and fighting global warming are going to be costly and more difficult to achieve.LiNeBrEaKSaving money is the prime motivation behind individual conservation efforts. But the survey found that many people also have been moved by a desire to help the environment, act morally, improve their health and feel good about themselves.LiNeBrEaKBy a ratio of more than 2-to-1, Americans believe that reducing their energy use will improve the quality of their lives, the survey said.LiNeBrEaK"Overall, many Americans are ready, willing and able to save energy at home and on the road. Many others are ready and willing, but need some help," said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change and the survey's lead investigator.LiNeBrEaKThe survey found that a majority of people have cut energy use at home, installing more efficient furnaces, weatherizing, turning down thermostats and changing to energy-saving light bulbs.LiNeBrEaKFar fewer have changed their transportation habits, largely because of expense and inconvenience. Only 21 percent said they had bought a fuel-efficient car. About a quarter of the respondents said they often or always use public transportation or car pools, walk or bike, while majorities said they rarely or never use those forms of transportation.LiNeBrEaKBut transportation accounts for a substantial portion of individual energy use and carbon emissions in the United States.LiNeBrEaKThe survey of 2,164 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	EPA nominee vows to put science ahead of politics  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	902 words  	WASHINGTON _ Lisa Jackson, President-elect Barack Obama's choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, promised Wednesday to lead the agency "with science as my guide" and not to allow political appointees to trump the advice of EPA scientists.LiNeBrEaKSenators on the Environment and Public Works Committee bombarded Jackson with environmental issues, everything from climate disruption to coal ash disposal and new air pollution rules. LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the committee's chairman, and other Democrats said that during the Bush administration the EPA listened to industry lobbyists instead of its own science staff and failed to impose regulations that were needed to protect Americans from toxic pollution and to reduce the emissions that caused global warming.LiNeBrEaKBoxer said the confirmation hearing for Jackson and Nancy Helen Sutley, Obama's choice to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, was a turning point for both agencies. "I've been waiting for this day for a long, long time," she said, but she added that the hearing was meant to focus on the future. "You're today and tomorrow," she said to Jackson.LiNeBrEaKRepublican senators said they worried that the EPA would use the Clean Air Act or other laws to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide in excessive ways. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said that EPA decisions would determine "whether overzealous regulations pull us deeper into economic turmoil."LiNeBrEaKJackson said Obama expected the EPA to uphold scientific integrity and the rule of law and to operate with openness.LiNeBrEaKJackson and Sutley said Obama has said that it's possible to have a strong economy and a healthy environment at the same time.LiNeBrEaKJackson also said she would move toward regulations on carbon emissions in a "reasonable, thoughtful and deliberate" way.LiNeBrEaK"If I am confirmed, I will administer with science as my guide," Jackson said. "I understand that the laws leave room for policymakers to make policy judgments. But if I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of EPA's technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes."LiNeBrEaKBoxer said the EPA was a "shadow of its former self" and that people who worked there had said that morale was low because the expertise of EPA staff had been ignored. She told Jackson to assure the EPA's 17,000 employees that they were needed to protect health and the environment.LiNeBrEaK"With pleasure, Madam Chairwoman," Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKJackson also promised to make sure that the EPA "right away" looks into how coal combustion waste from power plants is stored at hundreds of sites around the country.LiNeBrEaKThe first priority is to look into wet storage, where coal combustion waste is mixed with water and piled up in ponds such as the one in Tennessee that gave way Dec. 22, inundating more than 200 acres with toxic sludge.LiNeBrEaKPlaces such as that with a "mountain of wet coal ash" can endanger lives, Jackson said.LiNeBrEaKAs soon as the scope of the problem is clear, the EPA should decide whether it should impose federal regulations on storing the coal waste, she added. Coal ash contains lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxic metals, but there are no national standards for handling it.LiNeBrEaKWhen Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., asked Jackson for her views on the future of coal, she said that coal supplied half of America's electricity now, but added that it's also the largest source of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. She said there was a need to "move American ingenuity toward addressing it ... if we're going to beat this climate change issue," because the United States, China and India all were likely to continue using coal.LiNeBrEaKJackson also said that she'd immediately revisit the question of whether to grant California and other states the right to impose stricter vehicle-emissions standards, something that the EPA wouldn't do under President George W. Bush. Obama has said he would sign such a measure, Boxer said.LiNeBrEaKJackson worked at the EPA for 15 years and recently was the commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKSutley, who will be Obama's science adviser if she's confirmed, worked for the EPA for six years and was the deputy secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, an energy adviser to former California Gov. Gray Davis and a member of the state's Water Resources Control Board. Her most recent job has been the deputy mayor for energy and environment in Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKThe Council on Environmental Quality coordinates the federal government's environmental policies.LiNeBrEaKSutley promised to "ensure that there is a strong science and policy basis for our environmental policy, to move the nation to greater reliance on clean energy and increase energy security, to combat global warming while growing the green economy, to protect public health and the environment, especially in vulnerable communities, and to protect and restore our great ecosystems."

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Energy nominee: Coal, nuclear an 'important part' of power mix  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	638 words  	Jan. 14--WASHINGTON -- Energy-Secretary-Designate Steven Chu told a Senate Committee on Tuesday that the incoming administration would have an increased commitment to alternative energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal, but also made clear coal and nuclear would be part of the energy mix.LiNeBrEaKChu, who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997 and is currently director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, made the comments during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Chu is expected to win confirmation easily. LiNeBrEaKThe new administration is also committed to "aggressively" increasing energy efficiency in appliances and buildings; will push for more fuel-efficient vehicles including plug-in hybrids and supports a more "robust" transmission and distribution system for electricity, Chu said.LiNeBrEaK"I would not have accepted the President-elect's nomination if I had not thought it was essential to move ahead on this plan," he said.LiNeBrEaKChu also said, however, that the Obama administration would support efforts to revitalize the nuclear power industry, including developing a long-term plan to dispose of radioactive waste from the civilian reactors; would seek the "responsible" development of domestic oil and gas supplies; and would invest in technology to capture and store carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKChu was questioned closely by Republican and Democratic committee members about the new administration's plans for nuclear and coal. Chu said in a public lecture last year, available on YouTube, that coal was his "worst nightmare."LiNeBrEaK"That quote is ricocheting around the Internet," Chu said. "The context was whether we will continue using coal as we do today . . . that is a pretty bad dream."LiNeBrEaKBurning coal is a major source of the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere and is contributing to an increase in Earth's average temperature that experts say will lead to damaging changes in climate and sea level in the decades to come.LiNeBrEaKChu began his comments at his confirmation hearing by warning: "It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate system in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren."LiNeBrEaKChu has spoken throughout the country and focused the Berkeley Lab's work on the related problems of global warming and the need for renewable energy sources that don't add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. has immense stores of coal, and Chu said he was "hopeful and optimistic we can use those resources in a clean way."LiNeBrEaKThe only way to burn coal without increasing the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is to capture it and store it underground, something that's not being done at any of the nation's 450 coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKAs for nuclear power, Chu said that a federal loan program to provide funding to build new nuclear power plants needs to be accelerated, but he acknowledged that finding a way to safely dispose of the waste could be more difficult.LiNeBrEaKObama said during the campaign he opposed using the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada to store the waste, which the federal government is obligated to take.LiNeBrEaKChu said that a better system to recycle the waste would need to be developed, but non-proliferation issues would remain.LiNeBrEaKEven so, Chu said, "Nuclear power will be an important part of the energy mix."LiNeBrEaK(Renee Schoof contributed to this article.)LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

The New York Times 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final	A Stimulus Plan That Values Learning  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 32  	663 words  	To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''Tax Cuts for Teachers,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Jan. 11):LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Friedman is right. America must invest in its people.LiNeBrEaK  If President-elect Barack Obama hopes for technology and innovation to jump-start our nation's economy, he will have to expand federal financing for scientific research through agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.LiNeBrEaK  In particular need of increased federal assistance are fellowships to support graduate studies, like the graduate research fellowship awarded by the N.S.F. The program's alumni have included more than 20 Nobel laureates, as well as a co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin. LiNeBrEaK  As research institutions across the country slash their budgets, the nation's ability to maintain its scientific edge is tied ever more closely to government financing. Federal support is necessary to spur American innovation, train the next generation of American scientists, and combat climate change and disease.LiNeBrEaK  Let's start investing in our people -- it's one investment that is sure to outperform the stock market.LiNeBrEaK  Andrew L. ChangLiNeBrEaK  Stanford, Calif., Jan. 11, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Thomas L. Friedman's proposal to eliminate federal income taxes for all public schoolteachers is a refreshingly creative and workable idea. It's relatively easy to put into effect, shows teachers that we appreciate them in a tangible way and has broad appeal, including for conservative tax-cutters.LiNeBrEaK   Fred Haag LiNeBrEaK  Burnt Hills, N.Y., Jan. 11, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Eliminating federal income taxes for public schoolteachers, as Thomas L. Friedman proposes, would do nothing to increase the perceived value of teachers or address their strategic position. LiNeBrEaK  If such a proposal were put into effect with no defined minimum salary, market pressures would give municipalities the opportunity to cut teacher salaries until their take-home pay was the same as before the income taxes were eliminated, with the savings most likely going into reduced local taxes. LiNeBrEaK  The net result would be a further corrupted tax system.  John Hutson LiNeBrEaK  Santa Clara, Calif., Jan. 11, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Thomas L. Friedman wants to ''double the salaries of all highly qualified math and science teachers'' to encourage more people to become teachers and help make the United States more innovative. LiNeBrEaK  But without highly qualified language arts teachers to teach students to read and comprehend increasingly complex material and how to communicate it clearly to others (and, preferably, in more than just the English language), and without highly qualified social studies teachers to teach students about the global economy and the diverse societies around the world with whom we must interact, knowledge of math, science and technology in and of themselves will not increase American competitiveness. LiNeBrEaK  To accomplish that, the salaries of all teachers should be raised, since all subjects are equally vital in stimulating students' minds.  Susan L. Schwartz LiNeBrEaK  Haverhill, Mass., Jan. 11, 2009LiNeBrEaK  The writer is a public schoolteacher in Methuen, Mass.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Here is a math problem. Subtract the number of hours that a typical math teacher spends outside of school grading student work, tutoring and preparing for class from those spent by a typical English teacher. LiNeBrEaK  As the wife of an English teacher and a teacher myself, I can tell you that the number of hours that an exemplary English teacher must volunteer of his or her own time in order to teach the essential skills of literacy and writing far exceeds that which we ask other teachers to contribute.LiNeBrEaK  As someone who is not opposed to the idea of merit pay, I would suggest that exemplary math and science teachers be rewarded for their work. But to pay people differently based on their title or perceived value at a given political moment, and not based on their work, effort or skill at teaching, is blatantly unfair.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Keep conserving  	LETTERS; Pg. A12  	248 words  	Yes, lower gas prices are a blessing in these tough economic times. Yes, lower gasoline prices will help Detroit sell cars. Yes, lower prices are a welcome blow to the petrodictators that control much of the world's oil. But will lower gas prices make you stupid? LiNeBrEaKThe problem is, lower prices result in increased demand. We know where that leads. Prices go back up again. It's not rocket science. Its simple supply and demand economics. Unfortunately, lower energy prices result in a decreased collective effort to use less oil and gasoline. Using more oil and gas takes badly needed money out of our economy and sends billions to countries that are not our friends: Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, etc. This is a serious problem for our economy and disastrous in any effort to reverse global warming.LiNeBrEaKTom Friedman's Jan. 2 column recommends a gas tax or carbon tax with offset relief in other areas such as decreased payroll taxes. This makes sense to me. I will leave the specifics of how to do this to economists, accountants and responsible politicians with the common sense and guts to do the right thing.LiNeBrEaKFor the rest of us: Don't let temporary cheap gas make you stupid. Drive as if gas is $5 a gallon and going higher. Carpool if you can. Batch your shopping trips. Support public transportation. And please, make your next car as fuel-efficient as possible.LiNeBrEaKI believe it is time for our generation to make sacrifices. Please be part of the solution.LiNeBrEaKMARIO SANGILLO Lower Paxton Twp.

Pioneer Press (St. Paul, Minnesota)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Big Stone II pushes clean-energy alternative  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	614 words  	Jan. 14--Can an offer of clean-energy technology seal the deal for Big Stone II?LiNeBrEaKA group of rural utilities hoping to gain approval for high-voltage power lines from the proposed coal-fired power plant in South Dakota on Tuesday offered to equip the plant with such technology at a hearing before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKThe offer was the latest effort by utilities led by Otter Tail Power of Fergus Falls, Minn., to support the proposed Big Stone II power plant in Milbank, S.D. The matter has been before the PUC for more than three years. LiNeBrEaKA St. Paul hearing room packed with attorneys, environmentalists and building and construction union officials listened to what essentially were the closing arguments in a long-running trial. The plant now is estimated to cost between $1. 4 billion and $1. 5 billion if it is built by 2015 and would provide 650 construction jobs, though most of them would go to South Dakota.LiNeBrEaKThe commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to allow high-voltage transmission lines to be built from the South Dakota plant to central Minnesota, where nearly half of its proposed 500 megawatts to 580 megawatts of electricity would be consumed.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the project has been approved in South Dakota, it would die if the Minnesota PUC votes down the transmission lines. The utilities say they need the coal-fired plant to satisfy the region's demand for electricity, which they say will exceed regional capacity beginning in 2013.LiNeBrEaKButLiNeBrEaKenvironmentalists worry that carbon dioxide emissions from the plant will contribute to global warming. That could cost ratepayers a lot more than renewable energy like wind power if, as expected, the incoming Obama administration levies a cost on carbon emissions to discourage the use of fossil fuels in energy production.LiNeBrEaKUnder the latest proposal by the utilities, however, Big Stone II could be built as an "ultra-supercritical coal plant," meaning it would burn hotter and more efficiently than a conventional supercritical plant, using less coal and emitting fewer emissions, said Mark Rolfes, the plant's project manager.LiNeBrEaKThe plant also could be built with extra space for "clean coal technology" that could be installed later, proponents said. Such equipment could trap carbon dioxide and send it in a pipe to oil fields in North Dakota or Canada. It could then be pumped underground and used to push up trapped oil, Otter Tail Power CEO Chuck McFarland said.LiNeBrEaK"It would be the hybrid car of power plants," Big Stone II attorney Todd Guerrero told the five commissioners.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists dismissed the claims, saying ultra-supercritical technology wouldn't dent the 4 million tons of CO2 the plant is expected to produce annually.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal to capture carbon dioxide is meaningless since Big Stone II backers don't know when that technology might be feasible, said attorney Beth Goodpaster, of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.LiNeBrEaKCommissioners expressed concern about how to minimize the risk of later rate hikes related to the cost of building and operating Big Stone II. They asked for the Office of Energy Security to present new ideas Thursday on how to divide the risk between consumers and the utilities.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Remove the energy czarina  	COMMENTARY  	296 words  	Jan. 14--The ascension of Carol M. Browner to be President Barack Obama's global warming czarina indicates that the vetting process is indifferent to radical socialism. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama must reconsider his ill-advised decision to allow this extremist to implement her militant socialist environmental political agenda.LiNeBrEaKUntil last week, Ms. Browner was listed as one of 14 leaders of the Socialist International's Commission for a Sustainable World Society, which calls for "global governance," reports The Washington Times. Rich countries must shrink their economies to address climate change, the group advocates.LiNeBrEaKSocialist International thinks the world of socialism but very little of U.S. policies. Browner's former commission demands that developed countries accept draconian standards to reduce consumption and punitive limits on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe organization also condemns "neo-liberal market ideology and the unilateralist, U.S.-dominated approach in the global economic system" -- and even America's construction of a security fence along its Mexican border.LiNeBrEaKThe solution to the world's problems, says Socialist International, is "global governance." In other words, a one-world government where united nations will tell the United States what is permissible in the new world order.LiNeBrEaKNo thanks. Carol Browner must go.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition; All Editions	A push to go 'green' on stimulus projects;  Environmental group gets Akron mayor's support in its quest to emphasize renewable projects 	BUSINESS; Pg. C1  	734 words  	cleveland.com/businessLiNeBrEaKRead the Environment Ohio report and see projects proposed in Ohio.LiNeBrEaKAkron -"Green" has taken on a new meaning in Ohio and across the nation as President-elect Barack Obama prepares a federal economic stimulus program that could surpass $1 trillion.LiNeBrEaKEnvironment Ohio, a statewide environmental advocacy group, hopes to emphasize renewable projects in the requests the U.S. Conference of Mayors will present to Obama and congressional leaders Saturday. LiNeBrEaKEnvironment Ohio worked last spring with former Ohio House Speaker Jon Husted to "green up" the state's new utility law. Now the group wants to build an alliance with Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic, a leader of the mayors conference.LiNeBrEaKAt a news conference Tuesday organized by Environment Ohio staffers, Plusquellic supported the organization's green goals, at least in part.LiNeBrEaK"What we are saying, and what Environment Ohio is saying, is that as we look at these investments, we ought to look at them in terms of how we can make them more green, more environmentally friendly," Plusquellic said. "And when you have a choice, choose the greener side."LiNeBrEaKEnvironment Ohio used the occasion to release a 25-page report written by its parent group, Environment America Research and Policy Center. The report argues for a convergence of the federally funded economic recovery with the environmentalists' goal of embracing high-tech and massive efficiency measures; turning away from fossil fuels; and reducing carbon dioxide in order to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe report calls for $150 billion for renewable energy systems - including solar electric generating systems on 10 million rooftops - claiming 3 million jobs would be created if Obama followed its blueprint.LiNeBrEaKEnvironment Ohio also released a list of about 100 such projects that will be submitted to the new administration by Ohio cities, everything from converting traffic signals to energy-stingy LED lights, to upgrading heating and air conditioning in government buildings, to funding household insulation and new furnaces, to large solar panel installations, to constructing bicycle lanes that would encourage commuters to bike instead of drive.LiNeBrEaKThe Akron press event also included remarks from former Mayor Tom Sawyer, now a state senator, and presentations from green business companies as well a brief report about Akron's "Greenprint" project by Paul Davis, president of Keep Akron Beauutiful. The project, initiated by the city, aims to bring city and civic planning to make future development green.LiNeBrEaKIn his endorsement of Environment Ohio, Plusquellic said the recession is an opportunity to rebuild the nation's aging infrastructure and invest in new technologies.LiNeBrEaK"I think that every crisis gives society an opportunity to make important decisions about the future," he said. "And this is an important opportunity that we have flowing out of this terrible economic crisis."LiNeBrEaKAnd he singled out renewable projects as a way to preserve American jobs.LiNeBrEaK"Those smart investments are what we are here to talk about," he said. "I think some of the smartest are those investments that help us to provide incentives and packages to reduce our dependence on oil, to seek alternative energy sources, to save energy and to create green jobs that can't be outsourced to some other country."LiNeBrEaKThe mayor, who is past president of the conference of mayors and still on its leadership team, estimated in an interview after the news conference that more than 750 cities will submit more than 18,000 infrastructure projects to the incoming administration for federal funding of more than $100 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe total request from state and local governments, including those from governors, could run as high as $350 billion, with about a third going directly to cities, Plusquellic estimated.LiNeBrEaKHe said the total value of the stimulus package has been estimated at between $700 billion and $1. 3 trillion. "How much of that is for green jobs, I don't know."LiNeBrEaKIn a visit to Capitol Hill in early December, Plusquellic and other mayors gave key congressional leaders the conference's Mainstreet Economic Recovery report that included 427 "shovel-ready" projects at a cost of $73 billion to $78 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe mayor called that level of funding "a pittance" compared with the money the government has already thrown to Wall Street, with little to show for it.LiNeBrEaKTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter: jfunk@plaind.com, 216-999-4138		MAYORS (91%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (86%); LEGISLATORS (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (77%); JOB CREATION (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (76%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (76%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (69%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (67%); HVAC SYSTEMS (67%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); POSTWAR RECONSTRUCTION (61%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (77%); US PRESIDENTS (77%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (77%)  		UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF MAYORS (57%)  	BARACK OBAMA (92%)  	CLEVELAND, OH, USA (92%) OHIO, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   All Editions	We'll pull through;  Corzine focuses on N.J.'s gains 	NEWS; Pg. A01  	1566 words  	New Jersey will see the recession get worse and last through the end of 2009, but the state has the right plan and priorities to weather the ongoing economic storm, Governor Corzine said Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe governor, delivering the annual State of the State address inside the State House in Trenton, offered optimism and a challenge to legislators in a 45-minute speech that was interrupted 31 times by applause.LiNeBrEaK"I cannot help but feel an overwhelming sense of pride in the people of New Jersey," Corzine said. "Despite the challenges of today's national economic crisis, the people of our state are pushing forward in building better schools, broadening access to health care, making our streets safer and building a more secure world."LiNeBrEaKCorzine, who is up for reelection this year, highlighted a number of achievements, including recent work on economic recovery, state finance and pension reforms, climate-change initiatives and anti-crime efforts. LiNeBrEaKHe also offered new proposals, including a one-year moratorium on development fees for affordable-housing projects. And he reiterated support for projects already in the pipeline, such as the proposed new rail tunnel linking North Jersey with Manhattan.LiNeBrEaKBut the governor said there's more work to do. The state, which is facing a $2. 1 billion budget hole, still lacks an approved pension-deferral plan for towns with looming property tax increases, or a long-term source of open space preservation funding.LiNeBrEaK"Members of the Legislature, we may not always agree, but we must always share a common commitment to making the world a better place for this generation and beyond," he said.LiNeBrEaKCorzine also made a new pitch for ethics reform, including tougher campaign finance rules.LiNeBrEaK"Let's complete our agenda on ethics because it's the right thing to do," he said.LiNeBrEaKCorzine's largely optimistic tone drew praise from Democratic legislative leaders.LiNeBrEaK"I think it was the right kind of message for today," said Senate President Richard J. Codey, D-West Orange. "After so many bad economic stories coming out, I thought it was the right tone."LiNeBrEaK"It's only because this governor has proactively made some decisions in the past ? to have a budget that's less than last year's, to pay down debt, to act so responsibly ? that we have a chance to survive this," said Assembly Speaker Joe Roberts, D-Camden.LiNeBrEaKBut Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., R-Union, said Corzine's bragging fell flat because he's failed to cut property taxes and adopt the ethics reforms he promised as a candidate in 2005.LiNeBrEaK"He just doesn't have a strong story to tell," Kean said. "I would say I think the governor has had the wrong priorities."LiNeBrEaK"What taxpayers need is straight talk and honesty," said Assembly Republican Leader Alex DeCroce, R-Morris.LiNeBrEaKReaction among North Jersey legislators was also largely split along party lines.LiNeBrEaK"I was pleased he made economic recovery the preeminent state priority," said state Sen. Robert Gordon, D-Fair Lawn.LiNeBrEaK"He really laid down the reasons why he deserves four more years to lead this state," said state Sen. Paul Sarlo, D-Wood-Ridge.LiNeBrEaKBut state Sen. Gerald Cardinale, R-Demarest, pointed to a recent patronage hire by a state agency.LiNeBrEaK"If Corzine is serious about being frugal, the actions of our government today in appointing a leech to a patronage job paid for by taxpayers sure doesn't prove it," said Cardinale, referring to a Local Finance Board appointee who previously did promotional work for the scandal-plagued Schools Construction Corporation under Gov. James E. McGreevey. The position carries a salary of $12,000 and full benefits.LiNeBrEaKCorzine's address also drew mixed reviews outside of state government.LiNeBrEaKJeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, questioned the governor on open space preservation.LiNeBrEaK"We really need to have a long-term solution," Tittel said. "We have real concerns."LiNeBrEaKA state union leader questioned Corzine's approach to public employees.LiNeBrEaK"The governor says all New Jerseyans must come together to get through the economic crisis, but his proposal to impose an 18-month wage freeze pits private workers against public workers," said Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communications Workers of America labor union.LiNeBrEaKHarry Pozycki, chairman of the Citizens' Campaign, a non-profit good government organization, praised Corzine for pressing for campaign-finance reforms.LiNeBrEaK"Now is the time for the governor and the legislative leaders to finally enact pay-to-play reform that expands the state protections to all levels of government," Pozycki said.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Christopher Christie, a Republican who is the early favorite in the GOP's gubernatorial primary field, issued a statement to coincide with Corzine's address ? even though he didn't directly comment on it.LiNeBrEaK"With the strong leadership our state deserves, I will finally make the tough decisions needed to return New Jersey to its rightful place ? a state with a vibrant economy, a lower tax burden and great place to educate our kids and start a business," Christie said.LiNeBrEaKFast factsLiNeBrEaKIn Tuesday's state of the state speech, Governor Corzine:LiNeBrEaK* Laid out economic challenges facing the state and boasted about what the state government has accomplished.LiNeBrEaK* Said the state has weathered tough times better than most and applauded the state for expanding access to health care and having schools that get good marks in many areas - including graduation rates.LiNeBrEaK* Offered few specifics.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   All Editions	Say yes to Jackson  	OPINION; Pg. A11  	672 words  	LISA JACKSON'S background and ability to navigate through complex issues and political landmines while achieving success makes us think she has the potential to be a great administrator for the federal Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKJackson, whom President-elect Barack Obama has nominated to head the EPA, is scheduled to appear before the Senate for her confirmation hearings today. She has led the state's Department of Environmental Protection, overseeing a state with the most toxic waste sites in America along with beautiful open spaces.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental challenges here have included sprawl contaminating the state's water supply in the Highlands, a corroding nuclear reactor at the Jersey Shore, Newark's dioxin-laced harbor, an outdated Meadowlands chemical plant in the shadow of New York City that threatens millions ? and the displacement of the pine snake in the Pinelands. LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming responseLiNeBrEaKJackson was able to finesse a Global Warming Response Act, the nation's most far-reaching. And she has a solid background in enforcement with the agency she is now slated to administer.LiNeBrEaKWith a chemical engineering degree from Tulane University, and a master's degree from Princeton University, her educational and professional backgrounds clearly qualify her for her new prospective job.LiNeBrEaKBut, perhaps, her most defining qualification is her family and heritage.LiNeBrEaKJackson grew up in the Ninth Parish, or what is commonly known as a ward or district, of New Orleans. Jackson knows the kind of pit-of-your-stomach horror so many families experienced, hers included, as the levees broke, decimating her hometown, taking the lives of loved ones, changing the way they live forever.LiNeBrEaKJackson has personally experienced devastation brought on by government negligence toward environmental conditions because they seem too inconvenient or too expensive to fix. It's that intimate knowledge of the toll Washington's indifference can take on a family that will make Jackson a strong defender of environmental protection, and a strong leader for reform.LiNeBrEaKDaunting assignmentLiNeBrEaKJackson's new job will be daunting because as she moves the country's environmental agenda forward, she will have to counteract years of Bush administration rollbacks of clean air and clean water policies that affect our communities.LiNeBrEaKShe will have to reopen her agency to environmental groups that were shut out by a Bush White House that threw the doors wide open to corporate polluters and let them write environmental rules.LiNeBrEaKAnd she will have to restore the public's trust in the EPA by putting the agency back on course to fulfill its mandate: the protection of our environment and health of our communities.LiNeBrEaKThe challenges of climate change will be a priority, and when accepting the nomination in December, Jackson placed the transformation of "how we produce and use energy throughout the economy" at the top of her list. Drawing inspiration from her input into the New Jersey Energy Master Plan, we hope strong emphasis will be given to renewable energy sources and conservation measures.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey's diverse geography, aging cities, abandoned industrial facilities, toxic waste sites, the pristine Pinelands, the water-rich mountainous Highlands, the Jersey Shore and polluted harbors all offered Jackson a Pandora's box of environmental challenges. In each instance, she has had to interact with a wide assortment of individuals. She mixed her listening skills with sound scientific judgment to arrive at solutions that firmly landed on the side of the environment.LiNeBrEaKThat is not to say we've agreed with her each and every step along the way. However, this was largely due to a governor and Legislature that held her back. We are optimistic that our new president and Congress will give her their full support.LiNeBrEaKSo, America, may we introduce to you, Lisa Jackson. She's savvy, smart, pragmatic, and true to her heart, our favorite Jersey girl.LiNeBrEaKAmy Goldsmith is the state director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, the Garden State chapter of Clean Water Action.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Financial incentives mean home solar is hot  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	880 words  	Jan. 14--While many in this troubled economy worry about making investments, Doris Dobkins didn't think twice about sticking her money on her roof.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of paying PGandE, I'm paying myself," said Dobkins, a Placer County homeowner who recently spent $36,000 for an electricity-generating solar system.LiNeBrEaKBased on projected savings in her electricity bills, a state rebate and a new federal tax credit, Dobkins expects to recoup her investment in six years. LiNeBrEaKThe family anticipates saving $100 to $150 a month on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bills, and the utility company will credit them for excess electricity generated, she said.LiNeBrEaKDobkins is one of many residents motivated by new financial incentives that help bring the cost of a home solar system within reach.LiNeBrEaKIn December, more than 1,200 Californians applied for the state's solar rebate program, according to the California Public Utilities Commission.LiNeBrEaKSince the program began two years ago, more than 18,000 state homeowners and businesses have filed for rebates.LiNeBrEaKWhile the explosive increase in solar installations is good news for the environment, the growth has caught some by surprise.LiNeBrEaK"The solar issue got out there in front of the fire service," said Roseville Fire Marshal Dennis Mathisen.LiNeBrEaKIn April, the first draft of state guidelines for solar systems was released by a task force of fire officials, solar companies, planners and home builders.LiNeBrEaKThis summer in Roseville, the city expects to break ground on a regional training center for solar firefighting.LiNeBrEaK"It is important to educate (firefighters) in how these solar systems work and the additional steps that must be taken," Mathisen said.LiNeBrEaKThe need for punching holes in a roof of a burning home requires sufficient spacing between solar panels, and even after utilities are shut off, some panels can be dangerous because they remain loaded with electricity, Mathisen said.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Roseville and Sierra College were given a $468,000 state grant to encourage solar development.LiNeBrEaKThe money came from a fund aimed at encouraging cities to reduce greenhouse emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe city and Sierra will use most of the grant to fund a new solar training program offered through the college for firefighters, solar-system installers and building inspectors in the new center.LiNeBrEaKThe Photovoltaic Program's first class will instruct in solar installation, design, business practices and safety lessons.LiNeBrEaKKirk Uhler, a vice president of SolarPower Inc., said business was good last year.LiNeBrEaK"We had a threefold increase," said Uhler, whose Roseville-based firm has installed the solar system at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKUhler's company, one of the largest solar businesses in the Sacramento region, specializes in the manufacture and installation of systems for commercial and government clients.LiNeBrEaK"We are expecting an explosive growth on the residential side, based upon what we have seen on the commercial side," said Uhler, who is also a Placer County supervisor.LiNeBrEaKSteve Hansen, general manager for Solar Universe based in Loomis, specializes in retrofitting solar systems on homes.LiNeBrEaKHe also expects the skyrocketing growth to continue.LiNeBrEaK"It is the hottest energy job going today," Hansen said.LiNeBrEaKThe latest motivation to go solar may be a larger federal tax break that went into effect the first of the year. It gives homeowners a tax credit of as much as 30 percent of the cost of their systems.LiNeBrEaKThe tax break was previously capped at $2,000 per system.LiNeBrEaKThe state rebates, paid for by utility ratepayers across the state, can range from 20 percent to 50 percent of the cost of a system.LiNeBrEaKThe $3 billion state rebate program is part of the California Solar Initiative, the 2007 measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKSacramento Municipal Utility District also pays homeowners in Sacramento County $2. 20 per watt from their retrofitted solar systems.LiNeBrEaKLast year and the year before, there were 60 to 70 retrofitted SMUD homes, said Jim Barnett, a solar energy expert with SMUD.LiNeBrEaKBarnett also expects that Sacramento County will see more solar systems because of a new funding model that involves a third party who pays for the equipment and installation and leases the system to the homeowner.LiNeBrEaK"That model is coming to our area, and it is going to increase the activity because it will take the bite out of the upfront costs," Barnett said.LiNeBrEaKAs a homeowner, Dobkins said she researched the solar systems for two to three years before taking the plunge.LiNeBrEaKBut a radio advertisement describing the federal tax credit Congress passed last fall pushed her into action.LiNeBrEaK"That was all I needed," said the mother of two who with her husband has lived in their home for the past 15 years.LiNeBrEaKLast week, the solar panels went up on the Dobkins family's home in Lincoln.LiNeBrEaK"All of my neighbors are watching," Dobkins said. "Someone had to take the first step."LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Ramon Coronado, (916) 773-6866.

San Antonio Express-News 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   METRO Edition	The whiff of a new 'gas' tax is in the air  	A SECTION; Pg. 1A  	612 words  	Could the secret to containing global warming lie in controlling the, to put it delicately, "emissions" from cows and pigs?LiNeBrEaKThe seemingly comical idea is being taken dead seriously by some of the 5,350 farmers and ranchers gathered in San Antonio this week for the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual meeting.LiNeBrEaKMany are worried that an idea floated by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as a pollutant through the Clean Air Act could act as a de facto tax on livestock. The cost, according to the American Farm Bureau, could be $175 a year for each dairy cow, $87. 50 for each head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog. LiNeBrEaK"It is just outrageous," said cattle farmer Brad Hargett, who made the trip from Monroe, N.C. "A small producer such as myself, it would put us out of business."LiNeBrEaKThe issue is garnering significant attention in the agriculture community. The Farm Bureau's national and Texas publications recently carried stories about it, and EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said he's had several calls a day on the "cow tax" for the past three months. Ultimately though, Shradar characterized the "cow tax" as a scare tactic used by the by the Farm Bureau to fight global warming regulation.LiNeBrEaK"Any time you get people who are opposed to climate change regulation or climate change science, you always hear the cows coming up," he said. "No one has anything to worry about. Our friends at the Farm Bureau have suggested wrongly that the EPA is proposing to regulate cows, and that is inaccurate."LiNeBrEaKRick Krause, the Farm Bureau's director of regulatory regulations, disagrees with the EPA's attempts to dismiss the "cow tax" and makes no apology for making such a fuss over the issue.LiNeBrEaK"It wouldn't have been in the federal register if the EPA wasn't serious about floating the idea," he said. "I know we've got the EPA's attention."LiNeBrEaKThe idea stems from a notice the EPA issued in July seeking comment on its proposal to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKShradar said the proposal is focused on carbon dioxide regulation, but the Department of Agriculture, in its comments, said that the way the proposed rule is written, it would likely include the regulation of the greenhouse gas methane. The Farm Bureau worries that the regulations would be extended to any livestock operation that emitted more than 100 tons of greenhouse gas a year. That would hit virtually every livestock operation in the country, Krause said.LiNeBrEaKThat's because cows, pigs, goats and all manner of livestock emit methane from the manure they leave and, as Krause puts it, "the gas coming out of both ends."LiNeBrEaKThat gas can be potent when it comes to global warming. Methane is thought to be some 20 times more powerful at causing climate change than carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKShradar acknowledges that all sources of greenhouse gases are being discussed as the EPA formulates climate change plans, but he insists farmers and ranchers have little to worry about.LiNeBrEaK"Even if we regulate methane, we would most likely waive agriculture activities," said Shradar. "There is no cow tax."LiNeBrEaKCharles Nunu of Element Markets, a Houston-based alternative energy and carbon management firm, said much of the anxiety over the issue can be attributed to uncertainty over climate change policy. In an effort to fight global warming, the administration of President-elect Barack Obama is expected to push climate change regulation this year that will affect some or all sectors of the economy.LiNeBrEaK"We all know it's coming," he said. "But I think there is a lot up in the air right now."LiNeBrEaKPossible 'gas' taxesLiNeBrEaK* $175 for each dairy cowLiNeBrEaK* $87. 50 for each head of beef cattleLiNeBrEaK* $20 for each hog		AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (89%); ANIMAL FARMING and BREEDING (89%); AIR QUALITY (89%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); METHANE (89%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); AGRICULTURAL WASTES (78%); DAIRY FARMING (78%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION (77%); TAXES and TAXATION (76%); FOOD SAFETY REGULATION (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (72%); TALKS and MEETINGS (71%); BEEF CATTLE FARMING (58%)  		AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION (58%); US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%)  		SAN ANTONIO, TX, USA (93%) TEXAS, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Gas Emissions : A look at how much methane gas livestock emit compared with an average passenger vehicle.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	EPA nominee pledges to quickly review California's emissions standard  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	599 words  	Jan. 14--WASHINGTON -- Lisa Jackson, President-elect Barack Obama's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, told senators Wednesday that she will move quickly on California's request to enact its own far-reaching vehicle emissions standards.LiNeBrEaK"My commitment is that I will immediately review that," Jackson, New Jersey's top environmental official, told Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. "I will look to science and the law, and rely on the expert advice of the staff." LiNeBrEaKThat was a signal from Jackson, during her confirmation hearing to become EPA director, that she is likely to approve the state's bid -- turned down by the Bush administration a year ago -- for a waiver from the Clean Air Act to enforce its own standards. Obama pledged to grant the waiver during the presidential campaign.LiNeBrEaKStephen Johnson, outgoing EPA director, overruled the unanimous recommendations of his scientific and legal staff when he turned down the California standard, angering Boxer and other Democrats on the committee.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey and at least 15 other states, with more than 40 percent of the nation's population, are ready to enact the California standard, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaK"Granting the waiver is the single greatest thing we could do for fuel efficiency," Boxer said Monday during a briefing with CaliforniaLiNeBrEaKreporters.LiNeBrEaKJackson, a 46-year-old chemical engineer who heads the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, received a warm reception from the committee. So did Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, who is nominated to head the White House Council for Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who would be the first African-American to head the EPA, pledged to follow "science and the rule of law" and to make sure that "political appointees will not compromise the integrity of EPA's technical expertise."LiNeBrEaKDemocrats complained that the EPA under Johnson too often followed the will of industry, ignoring scientific findings about threats to public health.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans on the committee had kind words for Jackson's record, but warned that any move by the EPA to use the Clean Air Act to deal with climate change could threaten coal industry jobs and consumers who depend on coal and oil.LiNeBrEaK"We can't support East Coast and West Coast plans that would hurt our industries," said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. "What may be acceptable in San Jose, California, may not be acceptable in Carthage, Missouri."LiNeBrEaKSutley, 46, spent six years in state government in Sacramento, serving as deputy secretary of the state EPA and an adviser to former Gov. Gray Davis. The daughter of immigrants from Argentina, Sutley has been a gay activist and advocate for California's aggressive global-warming regulations.LiNeBrEaKSutley told the committee that she will help coordinate the Obama administration's environmental and energy policies and will focus on global warming and clean technology.LiNeBrEaKBoxer said she expected Jackson and Sutley to be confirmed by the Senate as early as next week.LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	COOK'S BOOKS: Saving the planet, one meal at a time;  WHAT'S NEW 	Food; WHAT'S NEW; Pg. F2  	251 words  	We're two weeks into the new year, and if you're already flagging on your resolution to eat a more healthful diet, "Food Matters: A Guide to Conscious Eating" might offer you some additional incentive.  LiNeBrEaK Author and New York Times food writer Mark Bittman The Minimalist encourages readers to rethink how and what they consume, and in the process, heal themselves and the planet. Eating less meat and less processed food and focusing more on locally grown produce, what Bittman labels a sane eating approach, can help reduce global warming as well as waistlines - no need to cut calories, he promises, that will happen naturally.LiNeBrEaK Bittman targets overproduction and overconsumption of meat and modern agricultural practices as the main culprits for global warming and obesity and other health issues prevalent in the United States, effectively using statistics to make his point: Global livestock production is responsible for a fifth of the earth's greenhouse gas emissions - more than transportation; Americans consume 10 times as much meat as people in many developing countries; and so on.LiNeBrEaK Bittman's thorough reporting is highlighted by factoids in the book's margins - 100 grams of chocolate cake has 333 more calories than the same weight of broccoli. They may not be enough to pry the cake plate from a chocoholic's grip, but 75 simple recipes, pantry-stocking tips and menu plans offer good place to start.LiNeBrEaK"Food Matters: A Guide to Conscious Eating," by Mark Bittman Simon and Schuster, 2009; 326 pages; $25.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Torture by any other name  	Op-Ed; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. B6  	1187 words  	Editor - I pride myself on being a liberal, which in my mind includes hearing and discussing points of view very different from my own. I'm glad to see Debra J. Saunders' columns because I think we need a healthy discourse of opinions. I am, however, nearly shaking with anger over her Tuesday piece entitled "Flexibility on torture.'"LiNeBrEaKIt sounded like she was regurgitating all the nonsense this outgoing administration has been feeding us for the last eight years, especially touting that horrifying phrase - "enhanced interrogation techniques" - designed to make torture more palatable to the general public. LiNeBrEaKSaunders stated that these "techniques," such as sleep deprivation, exposure to cold and waterboarding "do not scar." She quoted a former CIA official as saying it isn't torture "because we don't torture our own people." That kind of circular thinking and double talk is absurd. These techniques, even if not used regularly, cause enormous distress. If Saunders wants to deny this, I challenge her to experience the simulated drowning of waterboarding.  LiNeBrEaKI've read articles about how prisoners are treated regularly in Guantanamo and things as "simple" as sleep deprivation and exposure to cold have extreme detrimental affects to a person's psyche. People claim that these tactics have saved us from further attacks, but how can you prove a negative? I have extremely mixed emotions about this, because I too want to feel safe in a post 9/11 world, so I can't say that I don't want something done. But to claim we aren't torturing people is absurd and insulting.LiNeBrEaKJENNIFER SMITH LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco LiNeBrEaKCall it what it isLiNeBrEaKEditor - The descent into barbarity is invariably paved by euphemisms. Does the word torture bother you? Just replace it with "enhanced interrogation techniques," as Debra J. Saunders does. Like air freshener in your bathroom, one euphemistic spray makes everything smell so much better.LiNeBrEaKFELIX BRAENDEL LiNeBrEaKSan Rafael LiNeBrEaKWrong, wrong, wrongLiNeBrEaK Editor - How many times can you get it wrong before you are asked to go away? I am speaking about Debra J. Saunders. Over the last eight years we, the readers have been subjected to her being a global warming denier, calling the appalling George W. Bush a giant, claiming that Iraq is not a quagmire, and now she says that waterboarding is not torture and that torture is effective, when it has been proven otherwise.LiNeBrEaKAt what point does never getting it right disqualify you from holding the job of columnist? She has long ago proven that being a ideologue prevents her from at the very least being rational.LiNeBrEaKVERNON BURTON LiNeBrEaKSan Leandro LiNeBrEaKIn praise of SaundersLiNeBrEaKEditor - Thank you for the perceptive column on torture by Debra J. Saunders.LiNeBrEaKDAVID C. HAMILTON LiNeBrEaKSalem, Ore. LiNeBrEaKDon't torture meLiNeBrEaKEditor - I confess! I'm a liberal, I voted for Barack Obama. Now, please make Debra J. Saunders stop torturing me with her "grabbing, shaking, open hand slapping, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold and simulated-drowning" endorsing columns.LiNeBrEaKSaunders wants "flexibility on torture." Is this some form of torture yoga? Interrogators can bend the suspect's limbs, but don't break them. And that's how she wants to treat the "suspect," I prefer not to imagine what rites of the inquisition she might inflict on someone actually convicted.LiNeBrEaKCall me old-fashioned, but when you terrorize the terrorist, you become the terrorist. So stop it, Debra, quit twisting words, slapping our intelligence and putting bad TV shows on the same level as national policy.LiNeBrEaKSTEVE ABNEY San Francisco LiNeBrEaKBART's leadershipLiNeBrEaKEditor - Regarding the article "BART calls meeting on killing, gets flak" Jan. 12, I know that I will be voting at the next election for a different director to represent me. I would advise other voters to do so as well. LiNeBrEaKOscar Grant's homicide and its aftermath have shown me that the BART directors are just one more group of political seat-warmers and benefits-collectors, rather than the responsible and prudent overseers of a huge transit system they purport to be. LiNeBrEaK Ultimately the voters have to show these directors who is the boss. All of these directors should be voted out of office as soon as possible. Better yet, they should resign.LiNeBrEaKJOHN MEHRING LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco LiNeBrEaKAll together now ...LiNeBrEaKEditor - President-elect Barack Obama says we need "skin in the game," meaning that we all must make sacrifices in these troubled times. Does that include members of Congress? They just gave themselves a $4,700 raise.LiNeBrEaKKEITH C. DeFILLIPIS LiNeBrEaKSan Jose LiNeBrEaKSupport police officersLiNeBrEaKEditor - The real crime is that San Francisco city government at all levels fails to acknowledge the cameras will not, do not, and cannot work. LiNeBrEaKWhat does work are solid leaders who manage, schedule, monitor and oversee city agencies. The SFPD can and will reduce crime with leadership: Give the men and woman of the SFPD the tools they need - solid direction daily to prevent crime.LiNeBrEaKTOM DE TORRE LiNeBrEaKLincoln LiNeBrEaKA 16-year-old's viewLiNeBrEaKEditor - Californians vote in draconian sentencing laws for minor offenders. Our prisons begin to overfill. The prison health care system breaks down. To pay for fixing it, we propose slicing the school year by five days. If this goes into place, the achievement gap will widen, and more young people will see petty theft as a way of getting by. These petty offenders will be caught under our draconian sentencing laws, and tossed in for 25-to-life. LiNeBrEaKAm I the only one who sees the pattern?LiNeBrEaKSAM NEFF LiNeBrEaKPalo Alto LiNeBrEaKA true 'Sanctuary City'LiNeBrEaKEditor - In the interests of fairness, equality and political correctness, I suggest that San Francisco open its arms, and housing, to sexual predators who have been released from prison and who have a difficult time finding lodgings.LiNeBrEaKJEFFREY L. SUITS LiNeBrEaKKensington LiNeBrEaKHe kept us safe and upheld his principlesLiNeBrEaK Editor - The Chronicle editorial "Regrets? Sure, he has a few," Jan. 13 dwells exclusively with President Bush's perceived shortcomings as president.LiNeBrEaK Vilified and abused, George W. Bush has consistently demonstated political courage over the past eight years. Since 9/11, the controversial use of enhanced interrogation technics, wireless eavesdropping, etc., have prevented a second attack. These policies undoubtedly saved American lives.LiNeBrEaKBush's counterinsurgency stategy in Iraq, coming in January 2007 at a time of near unanimous war disapproval, has now succeeded beyond anyone's realistic expectations.LiNeBrEaK Nearly forgotten, Bush sponsored and saw enactment of both No Child Left Behind to improve math and reading educational performance as well as a prescription drug benefit for seniors.LiNeBrEaKHe was excoriated from those in his own party for his efforts on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform and by Democrats for proposing necessary reforms in Social Security.LiNeBrEaKBush has defiantly tried to do the right thing as president - irrespective of popular mood.LiNeBrEaKJIM HARTMAN LiNeBrEaK Berkeley LiNeBrEaKPhoto says it allLiNeBrEaKEditor - Has anyone else noticed that the George W.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Chu cruises in energy post hearing;  Obama's pick promises to fight climate change, push renewable energy 	Main News; Pg. A4  	1121 words  	 Steven Chu, President-elect Barack Obama's choice to lead the Energy Department, is known for his scientific prowess as a Nobel laureate physicist and director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. But at his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday, he showed he knows a few political moves as well.LiNeBrEaKHe appealed to Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with a pledge to forcefully advocate for Obama's plans to fight climate change and speed the nation's transition to renewable energy. But he also soothed Republicans and lawmakers from energy-producing states with his support for new nuclear plants, clean coal technology and some new oil drilling as part of a comprehensive energy bill.LiNeBrEaKThe 60-year-old Chu was cruising toward an easy confirmation even before he set foot in the Senate hearing room, but his steady performance is likely to have assured it. The committee's chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., predicted Chu would be confirmed by the panel later this week and by the Senate next Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKChu could have a much harder time satisfying Washington's various energy constituencies when he steps into the job running an agency with a $23. 9 billion budget, 14,000 employees and 193,000 contract workers - a post that includes managing the nation's sprawling nuclear weapons complex.LiNeBrEaKChu, a professor of physics and cellular and molecular biology at UC Berkeley who once chaired Stanford University's physics department, got off to a strong start at the hearing as senators of both parties praised his science credentials. Chu shared a Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work in finding new methods for trapping atoms with laser light.LiNeBrEaKSen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the panel's ranking Republican, said Chu was "uniquely poised" to carry out the agency's science and technology missions. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Chu's home-state senator who introduced him to the panel, said, "In my opinion, there is no one brighter or better equipped than this man to become secretary of energy."LiNeBrEaKAlthough the questioning was mostly gentle, Chu was forced to try to defuse the controversy over several remarks he had made in recent speeches. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., pointed to a statement that Chu made in a speech last year in which he called coal "my worst nightmare" because of the heavy greenhouse gas emissions of coal-fired plants. The statement drew fire from conservative bloggers and coal-state lawmakers.LiNeBrEaKChu reiterated his view that "if the world continues to use coal the way it is using it today, not only in the United States but in Russia, India and China, it is a pretty bad dream" because of emissions of not just carbon, but also mercury and sulfur dioxide. He added that he would not back a moratorium on new coal plants, as some environmentalists want, favoring new technologies to limit emissions instead.LiNeBrEaK"There are ... some people in the United States who feel perhaps we should turn off coal," he said. "But even if we do it, China and India will not. And so we are in a position to develop those technologies so that the world can capture the carbon."LiNeBrEaKChu also retreated from comments he made last September favoring much higher gas taxes, when he said, "somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe" - which at the time were over $8 a gallon. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called the idea "a tax on folks who are trying to get to work."LiNeBrEaKChu pointed out that Obama has said raising gas taxes was "off the table" because of the weak economy.LiNeBrEaKHe sidestepped a question by Murkowski about whether he favors reinstating the presidential and congressional bans on offshore drilling. Chu said new offshore leases could be part of a new energy bill, but he suggested that the country can't drill its way to energy independence with less than 3 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.LiNeBrEaK"More efficient use of energy in the United States is the one big factor that can most help us decrease our dependency on foreign oil," he said.LiNeBrEaKChu was chosen by Obama for his expertise on renewable energy, and he was at his best Tuesday describing the pioneering work being done at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab. He spoke of the lab's Helios Project, which seeks to harness solar energy and gene-altered bacteria to create new biofuels that could substitute for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.LiNeBrEaKChu said the rapid, commercial-scale development of new technologies is the best way to address the twin issues of climate change and America's dependence on foreign oil. He said he supports Obama's plan for a cap-and-trade system that sets tough targets for emissions reductions and allows major emitters to buy and sell credits to release greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"It's an aggressive plan, but one I think is achievable," he said.LiNeBrEaKChu also made comments favoring an expansion of nuclear power. He explained that nuclear power now accounts for 20 percent of the country's energy supply, but 70 percent of its carbon-free electricity.LiNeBrEaK"The point here is that nuclear power ... is going to be an important part of our energy mix," he said.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers praised his testimony, but some on Capitol Hill predict that energy policy will be driven not by Chu, but by Carol Browner, President Bill Clinton's secretary of the Environmental Protection Agency, whom Obama picked as his new energy and climate czar. Sen.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Walsh: How to work the media  	NEWS; State  	510 words  	You have to give the Congress of Racial Equality credit: They know how to throw a dog-and-pony show.LiNeBrEaKParachuting into town yesterday, CORE spokesman Niger Innis and a gaggle of pastors staged a "protest press conference," rapping Robert Redford for opposing the Bush administration's sale of oil and gas leases on some of the most spectacular public land in Utah. They claim Redford's environmental ethic hurts "grandmothers on a fixed income and single mothers dependent upon public assistance in South Chicago." LiNeBrEaKYou see what they did there? They slapped down the race card in front of a Sundance movie theater. It was brilliant. Movie star plus lots of Hollywood in town for the film festival plus middle-class white guilt equals exponential increase in media coverage.LiNeBrEaKI didn't go -- just on principle. But The Salt Lake Tribune sent reporter Patty Henetz. You probably noticed the headline.LiNeBrEaK"They've got the celebrity name. They've got the location right. And they're going to draw media attention," says Laurie Wilson, a Brigham Young University communications professor.LiNeBrEaKPredictably, the loyal opposition howled. Crossroads Urban Center Director Glenn Bailey knows his response to CORE's shaky facts creates a phony debate for reporters to chew on. Still, he and former city mayor Rocky Anderson issued a press release.LiNeBrEaK"Somebody has to question their facts at this point. They keep getting trotted into town by various conservative causes," says Bailey. "It's irritating to those of us who are actually doing the work on poverty issues."LiNeBrEaKTurns out the 77-parcel sale to which Redford objected would amount to two days worth of U.S. consumption. But facts are beside the point. This is theater, media manipulation, politics -- or all three.LiNeBrEaK"If facts made politics, we'd actually have a better society than we do," says Sutherland Institute Director Paul Mero, who recruited Innis' father for a 2008 Earth Day seminar meant to debunk global warming. "They're taking advantage of an opportunity to make a point. It doesn't have to be a fact. It doesn't have to be a compelling argument. All it has to do is project the broader argument" of environmental racism.LiNeBrEaKOriginally a reputable civil rights organization, CORE has become the willing tool of energy companies, conservative think tanks and white politicians. Kanab Republican Rep. Mike Noel and former legislator Aaron Tilton, in particular, love to use the Innis family -- Niger testified on Capitol Hill a year ago. The Tribune covered that gig. And I wrote about Sutherland's green day party.LiNeBrEaKI don't know if all the editors who sent reporters to Wednesday's press conference think Innis raises legitimate issues or were just afraid to be the only ones without a Redford headline. The scrum was almost -- but not quite -- inevitable.LiNeBrEaK"As a media outlet, why are you covering it? What's the substantive news here?" asks Wilson. "If there's not a substantive story without Robert Redford, then you shouldn't be telling the story."LiNeBrEaKCan't argue with that.LiNeBrEaKRebecca Walsh is a columnist.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Opinion: Yellowstones and Grand Canyons of the oceans finally are protected  	NEWS; Opinion  	618 words  	With the stroke of a pen, President Bush recently created three marine monuments in the Pacific Ocean, including one covering most of the famed Mariana Trench, the deepest place on Earth. Together with a monument established two years ago in the northwest Hawaiian Islands, this marks the end of an era in which humans have increasingly understood the need to conserve vanishing wild places on land but failed to comprehend the similar plight of our oceans. It comes none too soon.LiNeBrEaKNow, 137 years after the creation of America's first national park in Yellowstone, in 1872, we're finally recognizing that unique areas of the world's oceans deserve the same kind of protection. Industrial fishing, drilling, pollution and climate change are rapidly transforming the world's marine domain. If not protected soon, these fragile places will become part of the large toll that nature has suffered in the wake of human settlement and development. LiNeBrEaKThe new monument designations encompass Rose Atoll in American Samoa, most of the Equatorial or Line Islands in the central Pacific and portions of the Mariana Islands. Covering almost 200,000 square miles, these three new monuments roughly equal the size of Spain. Together with the earlier reserve in Hawaii, this president has protected more of the oceans' unique places than any other person in history.LiNeBrEaKThe importance of these ecosystems cannot be emphasized enough. In the Marianas, perhaps the most significant of the monuments, coral reefs overlap with some of the world's most exceptional geology, creating the greatest diversity of seamount and hydrothermal vent life known to science. It's the sole place on Earth with huge, active mud volcanoes, one more than 31 miles across, which are believed to harbor some of the oldest known life.LiNeBrEaKThe other monuments also harbor a remarkable array of life. Rose Atoll contains the highest percentage of live coral cover of any place on Earth, while the Equatorial Islands host some of the largest populations of top-level predators found in the oceans.LiNeBrEaKThe remoteness of these places might seem to offer them protection enough, but the march of human society is steadily opening up areas long considered to be impenetrable or simply not worth the trouble. In 1857 the leader of a War Department expedition described the Grand Canyon as "altogether valueless," adding that "after entering it there is nothing to do but leave." Fortunately, President Theodore Roosevelt thought otherwise. Designating it a monument in 1908, he called it "a natural wonder which, so far as I know, is in kind absolutely unparalleled throughout the rest of the world."LiNeBrEaKThe same is true for these unique areas of the oceans protected today. In weighing the long-term benefits to the marine environment and to the American people of protecting these places before they are ruined, the president decided they are worth more intact than whatever commercial benefits might be derived from fishing, drilling or mining them.LiNeBrEaKThe decision is a tribute to common sense. We will gain immeasurably more from having these places kept safe than we would from plundering in the short term whatever commercial resources they might contain. Moreover, there is an inherent value in wild places that transcends their importance for science, education, recreation and the ecosystem services they provide   although these are reason enough to leave them be. We value them precisely because they have not been shaped by us, but reflect the natural world when left to its own devices. Thankfully this president, and most Americans, want to see some places on Earth remain this way.LiNeBrEaKJoshua S. Reichert is the managing director of Washington-based Pew Environment Group.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	EPA nominee pledges to quickly review California's emissions standard  	BREAKING; Politics; Science; News; National; State; Business; Science and Tech  	527 words  	WASHINGTON   Lisa Jackson, President-elect Barack Obama's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, told senators Wednesday that she will move quickly on California's request to enact its own far-reaching vehicle emissions standards. LiNeBrEaK"My commitment is that I will immediately review that," Jackson, New Jersey's top environmental official, told Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "I will look to science and the law, and rely on the expert advice of the staff."LiNeBrEaKThat was a signal from Jackson, during her confirmation hearing to become EPA director, that she is likely to approve the state's bid   turned down by the Bush administration a year ago   for a waiver from the Clean Air Act to enforce its own standards. Obama pledged to grant the waiver during the presidential campaign.LiNeBrEaKStephen Johnson, outgoing EPA director, overruled the unanimous recommendations of his scientific and legal staff when he turned down the California standard, angering Boxer and other Democrats on the committee.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey and at least 15 other states, with more than 40 percent of the nation's population, are ready to enact the California standard, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent in new cars and light trucks by 2016.LiNeBrEaK"Granting the waiver is the single greatest thing we could do for fuel efficiency," Boxer said Monday during a briefing with California reporters.LiNeBrEaKJackson, a 46-year-old chemical engineer who heads the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, received a warm reception from the committee. So did Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles, who is nominated to head the White House Council for Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who would be the first African-American to head the EPA, pledged to follow "science and the rule of law" and to make sure that "political appointees will not compromise the integrity of EPA's technical expertise."LiNeBrEaKDemocrats complained that the EPA under Johnson too often followed the will of industry, ignoring scientific findings about threats to public health.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans on the committee had kind words for Jackson's record, but warned that any move by the EPA to use the Clean Air Act to deal with climate change could threaten coal industry jobs and consumers who depend on coal and oil.LiNeBrEaK"We can't support East Coast and West Coast plans that would hurt our industries," said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo. "What may be acceptable in San Jose, California, may not be acceptable in Carthage, Missouri."LiNeBrEaKSutley, 46, spent six years in state government in Sacramento, serving as deputy secretary of the state EPA and an adviser to former Gov. Gray Davis. The daughter of immigrants from Argentina, Sutley has been a gay activist and advocate for California's aggressive global-warming regulations.LiNeBrEaKSutley told the committee that she will help coordinate the Obama administration's environmental and energy policies and will focus on global warming and clean technology.LiNeBrEaKBoxer said she expected Jackson and Sutley to be confirmed by the Senate as early as next week.LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.

Your excellent diagram on the front page shows a key congestion point in the design. If vehicles using the Battery Street Tunnel are going to merge into the new two-lane tunnel, the daily backup will be felt from Royal Brougham south.

Let's hope the county, state or even federal help can step up before it's too late and we're stuck with our version of Boston's "Big Dig." I never stated a desire to build a new viaduct; the simplest, cheapest and least disruptive option is right in front of our faces: Retrofit the existing viaduct.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	Coal ash disposal rules vary from state to state Tennessee's toxic spill spurs concern about power plant wastes stored in ponds.  	NEWS; Pg. A1  	944 words  	When a storage pond with more than a billion gallons of toxic coal ash sludge broke in Tennessee last month, alarms sounded over the lack of federal regulation of coal combustion waste piling up at power plants around the nation.LiNeBrEaKMore than 700,000 tons of coal combustion waste are estimated stored in ponds in Missouri and more than 600,000 tons in Illinois, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. LiNeBrEaKAnd while state environmental regulators say it's unlikely a similar collapse would occur here, some worry about the fact that many ponds are near rivers that supply drinking water.LiNeBrEaK"Coal ash is toxic and the last place in the world it should be is next to water," said Kathy Andria, director of the American Bottom Conservancy, an Illinois-based environmental group. "When you factor in climate change - and the increased potential for greater rainfall events - you raise the risk that these dam walls become weakened and we're looking at a serious problem."LiNeBrEaKDespite growing concerns about the risk from coal combustion waste, there are no national standards for its storage and disposal. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not consider the waste "hazardous" even though it contains harmful metals such as lead and arsenic.LiNeBrEaKStill, industry groups insist that coal combustion waste does not fall into a regulatory black hole as many environmental groups have suggested since the Tennessee catastrophe.LiNeBrEaK"What's been interesting to me is this fiction that since coal ash is not regulated by EPA as hazardous waste, there's no regulation at all," said Jim Roewer, executive director of the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group. "That's simply not true. Many states have very tough programs."LiNeBrEaKRegulations governing coal combustion waste disposal vary wildly from state to state - some do little other than require companies to obtain discharge permits while others establish rigorous water monitoring rules.LiNeBrEaKBoth Missouri and Illinois scrutinize the ponds and landfills where coal ash waste is stored, but many older structures lack liners that would protect pollution from leaching into groundwater and migrating into drinking water sources.LiNeBrEaKIn Missouri, companies that generate coal combustion waste have been moving away from ash ponds in recent years, state environmental regulators say.LiNeBrEaKInstead, those companies are disposing of coal combustion waste in on-site landfills, which are regulated similar to municipal trash dumps. Nine landfills in Missouri have permits to accept coal combustion waste, as do two in Illinois, state environmental regulators confirmed this week.LiNeBrEaKDespite the trend toward "dry" disposal in landfills, most older coal-fired power plants do have several man-made lagoons on site where both fly and bottom ash - the byproducts of burning coal - are stored. Fly ash is captured at the top of the furnace while the coarser bottom ash particles settle out at the base.LiNeBrEaKMissouri environmental regulators say that in general, those ponds are not constructed like the one that burst in Tennessee. That pond covered about 40 acres and sat about 60 feet above the nearby river.LiNeBrEaK"Historically these fly ash impoundments are relatively flat, bowls in the ground," said Chris Nagel, with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources' solid waste management program. "There's not much in the way of elevation."LiNeBrEaKMany environmentalists, however, believe the biggest danger posed by coal ash ponds is leakage, not a catastrophic collapse like what occurred in Tennessee.LiNeBrEaKThey point to cases where unlined coal ash ponds have been linked to water pollution.LiNeBrEaK"I look at a lot of numbers and I'm not particularly phobic, but some of the monitoring we've reviewed has yielded some particularly astounding levels (of pollution)," said Eric Schaeffer, a former top EPA official and now the director of the Environmental Integrity Project.LiNeBrEaKIllinois did not require ponds to be lined until 1989, after state environmental regulators discovered pollution seeping from the Havana, Hennepin and Wood River plants, which were owned by Illinois Power at the time.LiNeBrEaK"Havana and Hennepin leaked as much as they held I think," said Darin LeCrone, a manager in Illinois EPA's bureau of water permit section. "Once we became aware of those problems we changed our regulations."LiNeBrEaKDespite the requirements, there are no regulations in Illinois for how frequently groundwater near the old, unlined ash ponds must be monitored. Each site is monitored on a "case by case" basis, LeCrone said.LiNeBrEaKAmeren officials say they test groundwater near their ash ponds on a weekly basis.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, the company routinely monitors the structural integrity of the impoundments. Those efforts were beefed up after the company implemented its dam safety program following the collapse of the Taum Sauk reservoir.LiNeBrEaK"We feel like we have a very robust system in place for checks," said Michael Menne, Ameren's vice president for environmental safety and health."LiNeBrEaKMenne said that while the company disposes much of its coal combustion waste on site, it also recycles much of it, saving valuable landfill space.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the American Coal Ash Association, about 43 percent of the coal combustion waste generated each year, or 70 million tons, is recycled.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Ameren's Labadie Power Plant opened an on-site concrete packaging facility where it mixes about 10,000 tons of fly ash and 60,000 tons of bottom ash annually into about 2 million bags of concrete.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, fly ash from Ameren plants is used in road construction projects in both Missouri and Illinois.LiNeBrEaK"Over 50 to 60 percent of our ash is recycled," Menne said. "That's a pretty significant amount and we're always looking to recycle more."

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Climatologist Mark Seeley: Eyes on the sky: The U climatologist has been answering Minnesota's weather questions for three decades. He's a longtime St. Paul resident with a mind packed with obscure Minnesota weather history.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	960 words  	Jan. 14--What's the coldest day in Minnesota history? What's the biggest snowfall ever dumped on the Twin Cities? Which city has the lowest probability of white Christmases?LiNeBrEaKMost Minnesotans would rush to Google to find the answers to such questions. But Mark Seeley, a University of Minnesota climatologist and longtime St. Paul resident, is a human encyclopedia of such weather facts.LiNeBrEaKWith another Minnesota winter upon us, Seeley shares his predictions for this season and explains how he wound up fascinated by this state's wild weather history. LiNeBrEaKQ What does winter have in store for us this year?LiNeBrEaKA It looks like it's going to be a long winter. We just had the 14th-coldest December in about 100 years. I expect January to be similar to December -- namely colder and snowier than usual. I think it's going to be generally colder this winter, although not necessarily record setting, and the cold will linger into March and April.LiNeBrEaKQ And how about the rest of the year?LiNeBrEaKA We can't really say because the models don't indicate one [clear] direction or the other. But there is a trend toward "amplified variation" -- wetter periods are wetter and dryer periods are dryer. I expect that pattern in '09.LiNeBrEaKQ Why are you so fascinated by the weather?LiNeBrEaKA Weather relates to everything. For example, it affects our health in profound ways. I've lectured at the Mayo Clinic about the impact of our longer spring and fall seasons: The number of their patients showing symptoms brought on by allergies and molds was getting greater.LiNeBrEaKFarmers need some realistic ideas for what their yield goals will be each year, and knowing weather and climate changes help them. ... And if you're a roofer or a paver, or someone outdoors most of the day, you want to know about summer dew points. Those have direct impact on what we call the "heat index." If you're a roofer working in a high heat index, you'd better drink lots of water and take frequent breaks in the shade.LiNeBrEaKQ You are a U of M "education specialist" based on the St. Paul campus.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Metro Edition	Eyes on the sky;  Climatologist Mark Seeley has been answering Minnesota's weather questions for three decades. He's a longtime St. Paul resident with a mind packed with obscure Minnesota weather history. 	NEWS; Pg. 1AA  	1031 words  	What's the coldest day in Minnesota history? What's the biggest snowfall ever dumped on the Twin Cities? Which city has the lowest probability of white Christmases?LiNeBrEaKMost Minnesotans would rush to Google to find the answers to such questions. But Mark Seeley, a University of Minnesota climatologist and longtime St. Paul resident, is a human encyclopedia of such weather facts.LiNeBrEaKWith another Minnesota winter upon us, Seeley shares his predictions for this season and explains how he wound up fascinated by this state's wild weather history.LiNeBrEaKQ What does winter have in store for us this year? LiNeBrEaKA It looks like it's going to be a long winter. We just had the 14th-coldest December in about 100 years. I expect January to be similar to December -- namely colder and snowier than usual. I think it's going to be generally colder this winter, although not necessarily record setting, and the cold will linger into March and April.LiNeBrEaKQ And how about the rest of the year?LiNeBrEaKA We can't really say because the models don't indicate one (clear) direction or the other. But there is a trend toward "amplified variation'' -- wetter periods are wetter and dryer periods are dryer. I expect that pattern in `09.LiNeBrEaKQ Why are you so fascinated by the weather?LiNeBrEaKA Weather relates to everything. For example, it affects our health in profound ways. I've lectured at the Mayo Clinic about the impact of our longer spring and fall seasons: The number of their patients showing symptoms brought on by allergies and molds was getting greater.LiNeBrEaKFarmers need some realistic ideas for what their yield goals will be each year, and knowing weather and climate changes help them. ... And if you're a roofer or a paver, or someone outdoors most of the day, you want to know about summer dew points. Those have direct impact on what we call the "heat index.'' If you're a roofer working in a high heat index, you'd better drink lots of water and take frequent breaks in the shade.LiNeBrEaKQ You are a U of M "education specialist'' based on the St. Paul campus.

The Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Nuke energy-policy push picks up: New Pa. advocacy group stresses pluses of nuclear energy, including its cost and environmental impact.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	562 words  	Jan. 14--Seizing on a shift in the national political scene, a new nuclear-policy advocacy group announced its creation on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaK"Today is our first day," said Karen Walsh, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Energy Alliance for Generating Reliable Electricity for our Energy Needs, during a Tuesday conference call. LiNeBrEaKCiting nuclear energy's nominal greenhouse-gas emissions, reliability and cheap generation costs relative to alternatives, the alliance is urging Pennsylvanians to support new plant construction and relicensing the nine existing plants, all of which either have been relicensed or are applying.LiNeBrEaKPPL Corp., the majority owner of the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Salem Township, also is seeking approval for a new reactor at an adjacent site. The alliance received its initial funding, Walsh acknowledged, from Exelon Corp., which already has had two reactors relicensed in the state, and is seeking approval for three others.LiNeBrEaK"We just feel the time is right, and we feel there is a resurgence in nuclear energy," Walsh said.LiNeBrEaKWalsh noted that Pennsylvania ranks among the nation's leaders in emissions of several major greenhouse gases. While nuclear accounts for about a third of the state's electricity, roughly half comes from coal. During his campaign, President-elect Barack Obama called for mandating infrastructure upgrades to coal plants that would drastically reduce their emissions, but increase their production costs.LiNeBrEaKState environmental advocates, however, aren't sold on nuclear's promise. "By far, it is the most expensive form of energy to build. And it's impossible to build a plant without substantial help from the government," said Jan Jarrett, the president and chief executive officer of Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future.LiNeBrEaKThe same amount of money could shift the state's energy portfolio toward renewables, she said, but an even cheaper solution would be simply to use less electricity. "Vigorous energy conservation could replace the need for a nuclear power plant," she said.LiNeBrEaKAs part of its grand opening, the alliance unveiled the results of a poll of 800 Pennsylvanians on their opinions of nuclear energy. Created by pundit, pollster and Franklin and Marshall College professor G. Terry Madonna, the poll found that nearly 60 percent felt to some extent that nuclear energy will increase national security and reduce global warming. It also found favorable opinions of nuclear's reliability, safety and ability to create energy independence.LiNeBrEaKAn important question it didn't address, though, is what's to be done with the radioactive spent fuel. Walsh said the waste created from a reactor running for 50 years could be packed in a two-car garage.LiNeBrEaK"If it was packed into a two-car garage, it would be an extremely radioactive two-car garage," Jarrett countered. "It seems that it's not prudent to move ahead with new nuclear facilities until they figure out what they're going to do with the waste."

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	Energy secretary choice warmly received  	Business; Pg. E3  	395 words  	WASHINGTON Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu promised Tuesday that if confirmed as energy secretary he will aggressively pursue policies aimed at addressing climate change and achieving greater energy independence by developing clean energy sources. But he also told lawmakers that he views nuclear power and coal as critical parts of the nation's energy mix and said he was optimistic that ways can be found to make coal a cleaner energy source by capturing its carbon dioxide emissions. Nominated by President-elect Barack Obama to head the Energy Department, Chu appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where he received quick support from Democrats and Republicans.  LiNeBrEaKThe committee chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said Chu has "the insight and vision" to press Obama's energy policies. Bingaman said he saw no serious opposition to Chu's nomination and that a committee vote approving his selection would likely occur later this week. Chu, a Chinese-American who has been director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2004, told senators that climate change is "a growing and pressing problem," and the nation's dependence on oil represents a threat to the U.S. economy and security. Of the risks from global warming, Chu said: "It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic disruptive changes to our climate system in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren." Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the committee's ranking Republican, also called Chu well qualified but pressed him on his position on nuclear energy. Chu said nuclear energy produces a fifth of the nation's electricity and 70 percent of the carbon-free electricity and "is going to be an important part of our energy mix." A widely respected scientist who shared a Nobel Prize in physics in 1997, Chu has been a strong advocate for more energy-related research, especially work on advanced biofuels and solar energy technologies. Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., asked Chu about early research into using plants to produce not ethanol, but as direct substitutes for gasoline or diesel. "Now we're getting into the science. I love this," replied Chu, 60, before going into a detailed explanation of the challenges in such research and progress being made.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Final Edition	ConocoPhillips chairman wary of 'green' costs  	Business; Pg. E3  	382 words  	WASHINGTON President-elect Barack Obama's plan to create a "green energy economy" is designed to address the problems of energy security, climate change and job creation, but its cost could be greater than policymakers realize, the CEO of oil giant ConocoPhillips said Tuesday. "We agree that we must reduce the environmental footprint of energy production and consumption. But we must be realistic about the cost of green energy (and) about its true potential and how long it will take for commercial-scale supply contributions," Jim Mulva said in a speech at the National Press Club.  LiNeBrEaKTo ensure prosperity, the U.S. economy needs quickly available energy, reasonably priced, he said. By restricting energy development domestically, the country exports dollars to buy oil from abroad, thereby also exporting jobs. ConocoPhillips, the nation's third-largest oil company, is a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership, a coalition of business and environmental groups calling for a mandatory national framework to slow and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. The group is issuing recommendations for climate policy later this week. Mulva leaned toward institution of a cap-and-trade system to cut carbon dioxide emissions over a tax on them, though he added that "they both can work." A cap-and-trade system, which allows a company with reduced emissions to sell a credit to another business that needs to exceed the emissions limit to operate, is more widely understood and has a better chance of working through the political process, he suggested. But Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson last week called for a carbon tax, saying it would be transparent and effective, while cap-and-trade would require establishment of new markets to trade carbon credits and new regulators to monitor them. As the Obama administration prepares to take office next week, Big Oil clearly is seeking a seat at the table. ConocoPhillips "is ready, eager and willing to work with the new administration," Mulva said. He said a comprehensive policy is needed that would embrace the principles of broad diversity of energy supply, greater efficiency, technological innovation and sound environmental stewardship.

USA TODAY 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Chu vows to tackle global warming;  Obama's Energy nominee warmly received on Hill 	NEWS; Pg. 6A  	458 words  	WASHINGTON -- The Nobel Prize winner nominated to head the Energy Department said Tuesday that he would focus the department in part on global warming. The policy would be a sharp departure from the department's priorities during the Bush administration. LiNeBrEaK"If we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate," physicist Steven Chu told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee during his confirmation hearing.LiNeBrEaKSince 2004, Chu has headed the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which he redirected to focus on renewable energy. President-elect Barack Obama tapped Chu for Energy secretary last month.LiNeBrEaKAt the hearing, Chu, who often rides his bike to work, called for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the same time, he presented himself as a pragmatist who won't reject taking advantage of energy sources just because they are out of favor with environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKNew nuclear plants, continued reliance on coal-fired power plants and U.S. oil and gas drilling are all necessary, Chu said. Environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)  have urged Obama to move the United States to 100% renewable electricity from sources such as solar and wind power.LiNeBrEaK"We need all solutions," Chu said. "We need to make them as clean as possible as quickly as possible."LiNeBrEaKThe NRDC declined to comment, but one industry group took heart from Chu's statements. "We were encouraged by what we heard on nuclear and clean coal," said Keith McCoy of the National Association of Manufacturers.LiNeBrEaKChu seemed headed for an easy confirmation as early as next Tuesday, the day Obama will be inaugurated, said committee Chairman Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. Chu's qualifications drew praise from committee Democrats and Republicans alike.LiNeBrEaK"It's great to have somebody of Dr. Chu's intelligence running the Energy Department," said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.LiNeBrEaKOn global warming, Chu said the U.S. should lead the way in cutting greenhouse gases. Chu, the son of Chinese immigrants, said he hopes that China -- the world's largest source of the main greenhouse gas -- will follow.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush cited inaction by China and India in his opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 global-warming treaty adopted by nearly 200 nations but not the United States.LiNeBrEaKThe treaty exempted most developing nations, including China, from having to cut their global-warming emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The United States should take the first step and hopefully the Chinese will immediately, very closely follow," Chu said.LiNeBrEaKThat drew a gentle rebuke from Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind.LiNeBrEaK"That approach will not be enacted by the U.S. Congress," Bayh said. A climate treaty would have to be ratified by the Senate.

Ventura County Star (California)  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Once-plentiful abalone put on endangered list  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	888 words  	Jan. 14--The black abalone that were once thick in the waters off the California coast earned a dubious distinction today when biologists took the final steps in putting the mollusk on the Endangered Species List.LiNeBrEaKThough it is debatable how much will change for the black abalone -- which, like all other abalone, is off-limits to Southern California fishermen -- scientists say the listing of the species speaks to the larger issue of the health of the ocean and could be used by environmentalists in their fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaK"What it means for abalone is that we need to be serious about restoring the integrity of the ecosystem that supports them and supports us," said Gary Davis, the retired chief of ocean science for the National Park Service. "If we are going to put all the pieces together, we can use these abalone as flagships for the environment and the ecosystem." LiNeBrEaKThe wording in the listing of the abalone brings up how global warming may affect the endangered species if ocean temperatures were to rise.LiNeBrEaKThat inclusion has activists at the Center for Biological Diversity thinking about making the black abalone a poster child in their fight against global warming. The center petitioned to put the abalone on the list two years ago.LiNeBrEaKThe abalone, which were once found in great numbers off the Channel Islands, suffered a one-two punch that led to their rapid decline and population crash in the 1990s, said Melissa Neuman, a fisheries biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, which published the listing in the Federal Register today. After 30 days, the listing becomes official.LiNeBrEaKYears of fishing greatly reduced the population numbers, but it was the "whithering syndrome" that was first found on Santa Cruz Island that dealt the devastating blow to the species, she said.LiNeBrEaKThe disease, which spread rapidly among the population, prevents it from digesting food and the abalone in turn starts to absorb its own body mass, including its foot which attaches it to rocks and reefs.LiNeBrEaKThey are now found in only a few places off the islands and off the mainland to the north. Recent surveys off Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands found about 320 in three places, said Kate Faulkner, chief of resources management of the Channel Islands National Park.LiNeBrEaKA problem with patchy populations is that though they produce millions of eggs, they are broadcast spawners, which means they send eggs into the water and the males' sperm fertilizes them.LiNeBrEaKWith so few pockets of them left, there is little chance for the sperm and eggs to meet.LiNeBrEaKNeuman said it is still unclear how the disease was introduced to the waters or how to stop it, but it is certain that it spreads during times of warmer water, such as El Nino events.LiNeBrEaKBecause increased temperature is known to help spread the disease, any power plant that releases warm water into the ocean during cooling processes could now be subject to a consultation under the Endangered Species Act, if it is operating in what is deemed suitable black abalone habitat.LiNeBrEaKThis includes any renewable energy sources that use the ocean's tidal motion to create power.LiNeBrEaKBut scientists are also worried about the effect of global warming on ocean temperatures.LiNeBrEaKBrendan Cummings, the oceans director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the abalone could become as emblematic as the polar bear in the fight against climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe polar bear was listed as a threatened species last year in part because of shrinking of sea ice as viable habitat in Alaska. However, in making that decision, government officials said that is not grounds for curbing activities that lead to global warming, such as building new coal-burning plants.LiNeBrEaKBut, Cummings said, the polar bear, and now the black abalone, will be used as a tool to do just that in future battles.LiNeBrEaK"This species is important enough that we would have done (listed) it anyway, but that it highlights the impact of global warming on California's ocean is part of the reason we chose to focus on it."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Attorney General Jerry Brown, who recently sued the Bush Administration for radical changes to the Endangered Species Act, filed a letter of support to put the abalone on the list. He cited the need to include the effects of global warming on the species.LiNeBrEaKKevin Lafferty, a marine biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said any global climate change would affect many species.LiNeBrEaKHe doesn't think the black abalone will suffer more than any other species, and he believes the majority of the blame for the abalone population crash lies with the disease.LiNeBrEaKLafferty can remember days when black abalone were a part of life along the California coast that seemed like it would never go away.LiNeBrEaK"It does do something psychological," he said. "This makes it official in the sense that this is an animal that is in serious trouble and a marine invertebrate that we thought was resistant to change."

The Washington Times 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	Global government  	LETTERS; A20  	248 words  	I was in the room in The Hague in November 2000 when then-French President Jacques Chirac hailed the Kyoto Protocol, or "global warming" treaty, as "the first component of an authentic global governance." Then-European Union Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom seconded the sentiment when she told London's Independent that Kyoto was "not about whether scientists agree" but instead "about leveling the playing field for big businesses worldwide." LiNeBrEaKIn truth, and as Europe is proving, its rhetorical bluster notwithstanding, no free society would do to itself what the Kyoto agenda requires. Hence the increased claims that this issue "is too important to be left to democracy." Once a group of our betters is empowered to determine our energy - and therefore economic, sovereignty and national security - concerns, this crowd get its way.LiNeBrEaKKyoto, of course, was negotiated while Carol M. Browner led the Environmental Protection Agency - and with her participation despite unanimous Senate instruction against doing so. Her position with Socialist International reminds us precisely why a radical like Mrs. Browner has had a position created for her, so as to avoid disclosure and Senate scrutiny, to lord over actual, Senate-confirmed Cabinet officials. Taxpayer representatives should not approve funds for such a position unless and until they receive an honest accounting of the agenda and its champions' activities.LiNeBrEaKCHRIS HORNERLiNeBrEaKSenior fellowLiNeBrEaKCompetitive EnterpriseLiNeBrEaKInstituteLiNeBrEaKWashington		LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (72%) Global-government  		EUROPEAN UNION (58%); US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (56%); SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL (55%)  	JACQUES CHIRAC (91%); CAROL BROWNER (70%)  	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS (73%) EUROPE (93%); EUROPEAN UNION (92%); FRANCE (90%); NETHERLANDS (90%); UNITED STATES (79%); EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES (92%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Washington Times LLC All Rights Reserved  	THE WASHINGTON TIMES  															
The Washington Post 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Suburban Edition	At Hearing, Chu Tempers Comments on Gas Tax, Coal  	A-SECTION; Pg. A09  	564 words  	Steven Chu, President-elect Barack Obama's nominee for Energy secretary, presented strong views yesterday on the need to combat climate change while delicately handling questions from senators about his  past criticism of coal use, endorsement of gasoline taxes and embrace of a cap-and-trade system for limiting greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren," he said in prepared remarks, adding, "at the same time, we face immediate threats to our economy and our national security that stem from our dependence on oil." LiNeBrEaKChu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who heads the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, was testifying before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where several members hailed his scientific background and recent focus on energy issues.LiNeBrEaKBut senators questioned  him about  comments he has made, including  "coal is my worst nightmare," a reference to the amount of climate-altering carbon dioxide emitted by coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKChu told the committee that "if the world continues to use coal the way it is using it today, not only in the United States but in Russia, India and China, it is a pretty bad dream." But he added that he does not favor a moratorium on coal and said he would seek and fund research on carbon capture and storage technologies so that the United States could continue to tap its abundant coal reserves.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Chu once called for sharply raising gasoline taxes to cut oil use, yesterday  he echoed Obama's comments that given the troubled economy, higher gasoline taxes are for now "off the table." He nevertheless continued to defend the idea of higher taxes, noting that they could reduce demand for petroleum products and encourage people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles, ultimately pushing down  crude oil prices.LiNeBrEaKAsked about nuclear power, Chu said it had to be "part of our mix." He said he favored tapping loan guarantees to restart the  nuclear industry. But he deflected a question from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) about whether he favored a far-reaching expansion of nuclear power, saying he hoped to get "the first few"  plants started while continuing to search for safe ways to dispose of nuclear waste. He said  waste disposal was a "legal and moral" obligation of the department.LiNeBrEaKThe California physicist repeated Obama's views on offshore oil exploration, saying it had to be part of "a comprehensive energy policy." But he added that U.S. reserves were a tiny fraction of world reserves and could not solve U.S. energy problems. "The more efficient use of energy in the United States is the biggest factor that can reduce our dependence on foreign oil," he said.LiNeBrEaKAsked about the cap-and-trade system, Chu gave only tepid endorsement of the approach most commonly cited as the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "The simpler the cap-and-trade system is, the happier I will be," Chu said. He spoke strongly about  energy efficiency, saying it could cut emissions and postpone the need to build new power plants. "This to my mind is the lowest hanging fruit,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKChu also said he favored the development of a new generation of biofuels that could be made from agricultural waste and other materials and  turned directly into diesel-type fuels.

The Washington Post 	January 14, 2009 Wednesday   Regional Edition	Build a Diverse Staff? Yes, He Can -- and Did.  	A-SECTION; Pg. A15  	775 words  	I n less than a week, President-elect Barack Obama will settle into the West Wing, surrounded by a senior staff in which white men are the minority.LiNeBrEaKOf the top officials in Obama's White House -- including czars, assistants to the president and other important positions, but excluding secretaries of statutory Cabinet agencies -- 24 are men and 21 are women. Sixty-nine percent are white, and 20 percent are black. Three officials are Asian American, and two are Hispanic. The statistics were compiled by the Presidential Transition Project at New York University's Wagner School of Public Service in cooperation with The Washington Post.LiNeBrEaKMore than half the officials are younger than the 47-year-old president-elect, and -- surprise, surprise! -- they're an overachieving bunch. Three-quarters have at least one advanced degree (17 have law degrees, 11 have master's degrees in business or public policy, and six have doctorates). Fourteen graduated from Ivy League institutions, like their new boss. LiNeBrEaKAbout 20 of the officials served in the Clinton administration, including Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary who will head Obama's National Economic Council, and Carol M. Browner, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who will oversee energy and climate-change issues.LiNeBrEaK"It is by my reading the most diverse White House team in modern presidential history and speaks volumes to Obama's commitment to racial, gender, educational and generational diversity," said transition expert Paul C. Light, a professor of public service at NYU. "There are a very large number of very smart people, some of whom earned their smarts at leading colleges and universities and others who earned it on Capitol Hill and working for the Clinton administration."LiNeBrEaKGrounds for a Complaint LiNeBrEaKA Justice Department inspector general's report released yesterday recounted some truly stunning goings-on in the department's civil rights division. In one 2004 episode, according to the report, John Tanner, who headed the voting section at the time, asked Bradley J. Schlozman, a former senior official in the department, to bring him coffee "Mary Frances Berry style -- black and bitter," in a reference to the African American former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Schlozman forwarded the e-mail message to several department officials, earning a rebuke from his supervisor, internal investigators said.LiNeBrEaKApply Now! I Mean Now! LiNeBrEaKWe told you last week about a plum, six-figure career job at the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection shop that was posted just in time for a political person to burrow in. Turns out our favorite Homeland Security sister agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has its share of fine jobs with postings that expire just before the inauguration, raising more than a few eyebrows.LiNeBrEaKOne of the FEMA postings is for a "Supervisory Human Resources Specialist," a GS-15 job with a top salary of $154,200. The job posting opened on Jan. 5 and closed on Jan. 9. There are several similar top jobs posted at FEMA with relatively short application periods ending on or before Jan. 20, prompting AFGE Local 4060, a FEMA employees union, to file a grievance.LiNeBrEaK"This appears to be an attempt to fill as many FEMA senior leadership jobs as possible with pre-selected individuals prior to the beginning of the Obama Administration," the grievance says. "For example, it would seem unlikely that the best candidate for a GS-15 job paying over $120,000 per year could be found in a five-day search, unless that candidate had been chosen ahead of time."LiNeBrEaKThe union complains that "the great majority of new senior-level hires" under the Bush administration have been recruited from the military, the Coast Guard and elsewhere within Homeland Security, rather than from civilian emergency management agencies.LiNeBrEaKFEMA's human resources director, Tim Cannon, called the union's grievance "a ruse to try to embarrass the agency."LiNeBrEaKCannon said the agency's "normal process" is to post a job "for at least two weeks, and we often go as long as 30 days." But he said posting high-level jobs for as little as five days is not unusual.LiNeBrEaKPass It Along LiNeBrEaK Reminder: If you've got news or a tip on who may be getting jobs in the new administration, write to movingin@washpost.com News on where Bush administration folks are headed?

Wyoming Tribune-Eagle  	January 14, 2009 Wednesday 	60th Wyo. Legislature begins  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	552 words  	Jan. 14--CHEYENNE -- The new speaker of the Wyoming House of Representatives told fellow lawmakers Tuesday they can still offer property tax relief and accomplish important goals, even though money is tight.LiNeBrEaK"The passage of a bill can be torturous and brutal," House Speaker Rep. Colin Simpson, R-Cody, told new lawmakers. "But you will be strengthened by the fight."LiNeBrEaKSimpson also called on the 60th Wyoming Legislature to help create a western states energy task force during the general session that started Tuesday and is scheduled to continue through March 5. LiNeBrEaKThe task force would be a public-private partnership involving 14 western states. It would provide comprehensive analysis of the energy industry and its needs and impacts.LiNeBrEaKSimpson said he hopes the task force will be in place and hold a conference by the fall.LiNeBrEaKKeeping Wyoming's energy economy viable in a world concerned with greenhouse gases and global warming has to be a priority, he said.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers will have to focus on narrowing priorities, Simpson added.LiNeBrEaKState lawmakers learned last week they would have an estimated $259. 2 million -- rather than $909 million -- available for supplemental spending.LiNeBrEaKThat is money available for new spending on top of the budget that runs through fiscal 2010.LiNeBrEaK"We are able to and we should provide property tax relief," Simpson said.LiNeBrEaKThere are a variety of plans being offered by lawmakers, as well as the governor, he said. Lawmakers should be able to craft a property tax relief bill from those.LiNeBrEaKSome areas of the state have experienced skyrocketing property values that also create skyrocketing tax bills for homeowners.LiNeBrEaKThe speaker said he also expects that the Legislature will address health care, community colleges and local government financing.LiNeBrEaKSimpson comes from an extended family that has been engaged in Wyoming politics for about a century.LiNeBrEaKHis father, Alan Simpson, served in the Wyoming House from 1965 to 1977 and as one of the state's U.S. senators from 1979 to 1996.LiNeBrEaK"I served with giants in this Legislature," Alan Simpson told lawmakers.LiNeBrEaKAnd he said the key to success is establishing trust.LiNeBrEaK"That's the only cash you have here is trust," Simpson said. "Break that trust, and you are history.LiNeBrEaK"Don't get all tangled up day after day in social issues," he advised, "because you'll never change a vote."LiNeBrEaKHis son will be a fine House speaker, Alan Simpson added.LiNeBrEaKThe elder Simpson struggled to control his emotions as he said, "I commend him to you with deep pride and much love."LiNeBrEaKIn other business, Wyoming Supreme Court Justice William Hill administered the oath of office to Cheyenne's newest senator, Rick Hunnicutt.LiNeBrEaKHunnicutt was chosen by Laramie County Republicans and the Laramie County Commission to replace Sen. Bob Fecht, who resigned.LiNeBrEaKGov. Dave Freudenthal will present his State of the State speech at 10 a.m. today to a joint session of the Legislature in the House chamber.

Akron Beacon Journal (Ohio)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Coalition calls for investment in renewable energy  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	609 words  	Jan. 13--The proposed federal economic stimulus by President-elect Barack Obama should be used to boost renewable energy, energy efficiency and public transportation, a coalition of Akron leaders, businesses and an Ohio eco-group said today.LiNeBrEaKAkron outlined $150 million in environmentally friendly public works, including boosting energy efficiency at several city buildings and investing in bus improvements, Mayor Don Plusquellic said. LiNeBrEaKAkron has proposed $350 million in other projects, including a request for federal funds for a new downtown hotel, Plusquellic said during a morning news conference at the Akron-Summit County Public Library.LiNeBrEaKAkron is seeking $14 million to help attract a partner to build a hotel with 100 to 110 beds. The hotel would be between the Akron Art Museum and the John S. Knight Center and would help Akron attract more conventions, the mayor said.LiNeBrEaKInvestors cannot arrange the needed financing in today's economy, and such a federal grant would provide a big boost for a second downtown hotel in Akron, Plusquellic said.LiNeBrEaKThe 274-room Radisson Hotel's Akron City Centre is the only full-service hotel downtown.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, the University of Akron purchased the Quaker Square Inn. Half of the 190 rooms there have been converted into student lodging. UA plans to convert the remaining 95 rooms to student use by late this year.LiNeBrEaKAkron has a major need for more downtown hotel rooms, Plusquellic said.LiNeBrEaK"To be successful, the economic stimulus package must provide a sound investment in our future," Plusquellic said. "This means that funding for projects that conserve energy, promote alternative fuels and clean our environment must be a priority. 'Green' jobs can't be outsourced, and Ohio can be a leader in this area."LiNeBrEaKSaid Michele Fisher of Environment Ohio, "Clean energy can protect our environment and rev our economic engine to generate a brighter future for Ohio."LiNeBrEaKHer statewide eco-group also released a new report, Clean Energy, Bright Future. It said that the economic stimulus program's investments in environmentally friendly projects would reduce global warming pollution, cut oil consumption and create or sustain 3 million jobs in the United States.LiNeBrEaKInvesting $150 billion in non-polluting wind and solar power, energy efficiency and improved mass transit could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 670 million tons a year across the country, the report said.LiNeBrEaKThe report calls for weatherizing homes and businesses, training workers for new, clean-energy industries and expanding public transit.LiNeBrEaKThere is strong support in Ohio for such a green component to the federal stimulus effort, she said.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Tom Sawyer, D-Akron, called for major investments to upgrade the nation's overloaded electric system. As much as 20 percent of the electricity produced is lost through inefficiency and overcrowding on the electric grid, he said.LiNeBrEaKAkron businessman Mike Foraker praised the plan to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency and public transportation.LiNeBrEaK"I'm just so excited by this plan," said Foraker, chief executive of Jennings Heating and the Energy Factory.

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Bush supports ratification of sea treaty to administer Arctic: LAW OF THE SEA: The policy gives U.S. legal claim in the Far North.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	846 words  	Jan. 13--In one of its last official acts, the Bush administration released a comprehensive policy Monday for the Arctic regions, addressing the growing number of boundary, resource development and shipping disputes in the fast-changing waters north of Alaska's coast.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush presidential directive takes no startling new policy turns, but it does emphasize the outgoing president's support for Senate ratification of the Law of the Sea treaty, an international agreement blocked by some conservative Republicans. LiNeBrEaKThe directive asserts that the Northwest Passage through Canada is an international shipping route and calls for building up the U.S. presence in the region to protect strategic interests, including homeland security.LiNeBrEaKThe policy talks about promoting responsible energy development and preparing for the risks associated with increased marine traffic through the region as summer ice retreats. The policy also calls for increased study and monitoring of the effects of climate change in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"The United States is an Arctic nation, with varied and compelling interests in that region," the policy declares. Among the commitments: to "involve the Arctic's indigenous communities in decisions that affect them."LiNeBrEaKThe policy statement was praised by Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the only member of Congress to participate in work on the plan over the past two years. Murkowski supports ratification of the Law of the Sea treaty, saying it would give the U.S. a legal claim to oil and gas resources on the northern continental shelf.LiNeBrEaKBut the directive drew criticism from Rick Steiner, a University of Alaska Anchorage marine biology professor who tried to have the policy delayed until Barack Obama takes office. He said the policy should commit to reducing greenhouse gases, not merely talk about studying the causes of climate change in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKOverall, he said, the policy is tilted toward "commercial and military exploitation" of the area. "This may have been George Bush's last gift to the oil industry," he said.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, Bush's public support may prevent the Law of the Sea from turning into a partisan battle between Obama and conservatives who fear the treaty would surrender too much American sovereignty to hostile international bureaucrats.LiNeBrEaK"By having a Republican administration say some of those things, it may help move that agenda along," said Mead Treadwell, chairman of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission, who worked with the State Department and other federal officials on the policy.LiNeBrEaKA Murkowski spokesman said Monday she is optimistic this year about approval of the Law of the Sea treaty, which was drawn up in 1982 and has been ratified by more than 150 countries.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush policy on the Arctic was reported near completion last summer. But it vanished off the radar during the height of the presidential campaign as Republican John McCain came under fire from some conservatives for his past support for the treaty.LiNeBrEaKThe breadth of the 11-page directive's concerns, and its public release, show how far Arctic concerns have risen as a priority, Treadwell said.LiNeBrEaKHe said the last time the government drew up an Arctic policy was 1994, and it remained a closely held document only summarized publicly in a press release. The Arctic policy before 1994, he said, was top secret, even from most policy-makers, presumably because its major concerns were deployment of nuclear submarines under the polar ice.LiNeBrEaKSteiner said he supported some elements of the policy, including its call for a risk assessment study of Arctic shipping. But he said he would rather see maritime commerce in the Arctic curbed while such studies are under way, rather than promoted.LiNeBrEaKHe also was concerned about increased use of icebreaking ships in the Arctic, saying that might speed the loss of sea ice habitat. Funding for new ice breakers also has been opposed by fiscal conservatives in Congress.LiNeBrEaKThe policy refers generally to investing in "infrastructure to support shipping activity, search and rescue capabilities," and other measures.LiNeBrEaKTreadwell said new icebreakers will be important not only for research but to "project the U.S. presence" in a time of growing traffic. The U.S. is not in a position to unilaterally push a moratorium on shipping, he said.LiNeBrEaK"With that ocean opening up, lord knows what kinds of ships are going to show up," Treadwell said.LiNeBrEaKThe policy explicitly rejects proposals for a new international treaty among the eight Arctic nations, saying current cooperative arrangements are preferable to the kind of treaty that governs the Antarctic.LiNeBrEaKFind Tom Kizzia online at adn.com/contact/tkizzia or call him at 907-235-4244.

The Bemidji Pioneer (Minnesota)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Climate change action plan: Utilities worried about future  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1214 words  	Jan. 13--Unless Minnesota adopts a climate change action plan this session, state law bans construction of any new coal-fired power plants as of Aug. 1, and that scares utilities.LiNeBrEaKAt that point, "there would be a coal moratorium for any new growth in Minnesota," says Christina Pierson, executive director of Partners for Affordable Energy. "That concerns us."LiNeBrEaKPierson, who spoke Monday to the Bemidji Rotary Club, said Partners for Affordable Energy is comprised by a number of groups, including utility and power associations and co-ops, Minnesota Forest Industries, Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, Minnesota Agri-Growth Council and Printing Industry of Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKMinnesota, as well as the nation, needs to move to next-generation power such as wind or solar, but the technology isn't there yet to provide the baseload energy capacity needed for uninterrupted power through those sources, Pierson said Monday in an interview. LiNeBrEaKThe Next Generation Energy Act of 2007 calls for strict standards to control carbon emissions by utilities but also dictates that the state adopt a climate change action plan to control greenhouse gas emissions from all sources.LiNeBrEaKThe 2007 Legislature first passed renewable energy standards that found the state could integrate 25 percent of electrical generation from renewable sources without affecting baseline power or greatly increasing costs, she said.LiNeBrEaKIt then passed the Next Generation Act, "which includes very aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals," Pierson said. "And they did that without knowing whether that solution and the timeline and the amounts was affordable, or if it would effectively reduce emissions for the costs being asked of Minnesota energy users."LiNeBrEaKThe Legislature, however, hasn't gone very far down the road to put together the climate change action plan, which must passed by the 2009 Legislature to avoid the ban on new coal plants.LiNeBrEaK"The only solution offered to date for a climate change action plan is a regional cap-and-trade program or a state-only cap-and-trade program," Pierson said. "There was no study, there was nothing to know if this would even work."LiNeBrEaKLacking a state report and wanting some answers before the Aug. 1 deadline, PAE commissioned its own study with an independent firm, CRA International, which found that a regional cap-and-trade program would adversely affect Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKCap and trade provides economic incentives for achieving reductions in emissions of pollutants by setting a cap on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted, and then allowing companies that exceed that cap to purchase allowances or credits from those who under-emit.LiNeBrEaKSimply put, the buyer pays a charge for polluting, while the seller is rewarded for having reducing emissions below the cap.LiNeBrEaKA five-state regional cap-and-trade program is now being organized, Pierson said, involving Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and Kansas. If either the state or the accord puts in place a cap-and-trade program that isn't national, the CRA study found:LiNeBrEaKE National emissions will increase at least 49 percent by 2050 even with a successful state or regional program.LiNeBrEaK'E Minnesota households will see a projected 17 percent increase in electrical prices, which is inflation-adjusted, by 2015 and prices to continue to increase faster until they are 40 percent higher in 2035.LiNeBrEaKE A net loss of 21,000 jobs by 2015, and 30,000 by 2025, which includes "green jobs" increases, because of higher energy costs. Most affected will be mining, paper manufacturing and agriculture.LiNeBrEaKE Minnesota households would collectively decrease discretionary spending by $2 billion a year if a regional cap-and-trade program is in place because of higher energy costs.LiNeBrEaKTechnologies are improving, but until they are developed and commercially available, the United States must depend on coal-fired plants to provide baseline power, Pierson said.LiNeBrEaKThere is a cap-and-trade program in the Northeast, but it works there because 70 percent of power generation is hydroelectric. In the Midwest, 70 percent is from coal-fired plants, where a cap-and-trade program would be expensive to consumers.LiNeBrEaKNew coal technology is also at work, she said, citing a small North Dakota power plant that is sending carbon to dry oil fields in Canada, with the carbon filling in underground gaps and pushing more oil up. It now wants to move to larger power plant.LiNeBrEaK"These things take time to prove and do all the paperwork and get all the capital lined up," she said. "They don't think it will be widely commercially deployable until 2025. Meanwhile, Minnesota's greenhouse gas reduction goals start in 2015.LiNeBrEaK"Part of the reason it takes until 2025 is that we have a limited financial resources and human resources until that date," Pierson added. "To accomplish that, it would take a lot more financial resources and more engineers and scientists."LiNeBrEaKAs is everyone else with a project, the prospect of President-elect Barack Obama's economic stimulus package holds promise.LiNeBrEaK"President-elect Barack Obama has said that we do need to continue clean coal research," Pierson said. "He understands that coal is to this day more than half of the electrical resources in this country come from coal. He understands we need to have clean-coal technologies moving into the future."LiNeBrEaKPierson said clean-coal technologies "is on the horizon and it is real and we are demonstrating it."LiNeBrEaKStill, Minnesota needs to adopt a climate change action plan and there seems to be little political will to simply delay the Aug. 1 deadline, she said. "The Legislature hasn't been very open to listening to our industry and our suggestions."LiNeBrEaKThere are other methods to reduce carbon emissions, especially with conservation. While seemingly a small reduction, conservation cumulatively can add up. For instance, she said curbing "phantom power" could save 10 percent of electric generation.LiNeBrEaKPhantom power is electricity used by appliances that are not on but still plugged into an outlet. She suggests connecting at TV or computer to a power surge unit, and turning that off when done watching TV or computing.LiNeBrEaKAnother solution would be to lift Minnesota's moratorium on new nuclear energy plants, which don't emit any carbon.LiNeBrEaK"We don't have the magic bullet," Pierson said. "There's still this margin of time -- 10 to 20 years -- before the next best thing comes about. ... It's tough and it's a challenge when the state of Minnesota decides to ban things. How do you operate that to make sure you have the baseload of uninterruptible power that people are used to?"LiNeBrEaKShe hopes it doesn't take brownouts and blackouts before people realize how important it is to provide stable and uninterrupted baseload power.LiNeBrEaKA balanced approach is needed, she said. "We can get to a clean environment and have a low environmental impact through electric generation, we just need a bit more time to get there," Pierson said.

The Boston Globe 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	New directions for foreign relations  	OP-ED; Pg. A13  	843 words  	AS SENATOR Hillary Clinton appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today for confirmation hearings as secretary of state, the foreign policy agenda of the US government is confronting many challenges. We are engaged in wars in different stages in Afghanistan and Iraq. Global climate change represents a potential catastrophe. The danger from the spread of nuclear weapons and technology remains significant.LiNeBrEaKYet it would be wrong to infer that we cannot triumph over the torrent of troubles afflicting the world today. After eight years of unilateral decision-making on the world stage and log rolling and partisan paralysis at home, we have an opportunity to reshape the way the United States does business with the world. We can resolve these issues by reasserting our moral leadership and restoring the world's trust in us through multilateral problem-solving rooted in diplomacy. LiNeBrEaKThe Defense Department has fulfilled the enormous burdens placed upon our men and women overseas with honor and professionalism. But the road to reestablishing American leadership and improving the lives of our citizens and the rest of the world also runs through the State Department and the Congress. As incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am determined to push an agenda that recognizes a new reality, returns civilian functions to civilians, and enhances the ability of US diplomats to play the leading role in solving these problems through effective foreign assistance and diplomacy.LiNeBrEaKWe live under the constant threat of catastrophic terrorism. In recent weeks, we have heard chilling warnings about the prospect of nuclear terrorism. No issue is more urgent than dealing with nuclear proliferation. And none cries out louder for international cooperation. We need to signal the world that the United States is again ready to lead the way toward a world free of nuclear weapons. The ultimate goal may be far in the future, but now is the time to begin the journey with two dramatic steps.LiNeBrEaKFirst, I will urge the Obama administration to embrace the goal of reducing our strategic nuclear arsenals to 1,000 deployed warheads and work to persuade the Russians to do the same. That number is more than enough to keep us and our allies safe, but it will tell the world that we are determined to fulfill our responsibilities to eventually eliminate these doomsday weapons. In conjunction, it is essential that the new administration immediately open serious discussions with the Russians on extending or replacing the landmark Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expires in less than a year.LiNeBrEaKSecond, I will begin working to build the necessary bipartisan support for US ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which would impose a worldwide ban on nuclear testing under the watch of a far-reaching verification regime. Winning approval of two-thirds of the Senate will be a long and difficult process. It will require the unyielding support of the Obama administration and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But success would be the single greatest arms control accomplishment for the new Senate and it would reestablish America's traditional leadership role on nonproliferation.LiNeBrEaKJust as we must work diligently to prevent a nuclear attack, the same leadership must be applied to avert a potential disaster of equal magnitude - global climate change. For eight years, the United States has been the world's laggard on this vital issue, and the global community craves new and aggressive leadership. We need to send a strong and certain message that we are ready to lead the effort to combat climate change through action at home and active engagement with other countries to develop a comprehensive new treaty.LiNeBrEaKIn two months, negotiators will meet for the next round of discussions on a pact to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. The essential elements of that treaty must be defined by the next Conference of Parties in Copenhagen this December. The time is short and the task is tremendous. The Senate has a vital role to play in defining the scope of the treaty to meet this urgent challenge.LiNeBrEaKAnd just as we must work with allies and other progressive nations to meet these challenges, we need the assistance of the international community to achieve stability in the Middle East and find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Strengthening our alliances through leadership and cooperation will help when it comes to persuading Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions and to deliver the political and economic stability we seek in Afghanistan and across South Asia.LiNeBrEaKThe common element in this formula for a new foreign policy is replacing military solutions and unilateral action with diplomacy and multi-national consensus. Clinton's work on the Armed Services Committee, her lifetime of public service, and her global stature have prepared her well to help pave this new road for American leadership.LiNeBrEaKSenator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Senators praise Chu, who signals support for a variety of energy alternatives  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	713 words  	WASHINGTON _ Senators celebrated Steven Chu on Tuesday as a scientist, administrator and Nobel Prize winner. But in the hearing on his nomination as President-elect Barack Obama's energy secretary, Chu played another, newer role: politician.LiNeBrEaKUnder gentle questioning from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the physicist and director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory signaled his support for a variety of energy alternatives _ including coal _ to America's dependence on imported oil.LiNeBrEaKChu told Republicans that he would help fast-track a resurgence of domestic nuclear power and accept oil and gas drilling as part of a broad energy package. He told Democrats that he would champion solar plants and a "smart grid" that could help bring more wind power to market. LiNeBrEaKHe told coal-state senators that he supports increased research for so-called "clean coal" technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, but that he wouldn't wait for that process to be perfected before he supported new coal power plants. He softened a much-publicized 2008 comment that coal is "my worst nightmare," saying that "if the world continues to use coal in the way we're using it today ... that's a pretty bad dream."LiNeBrEaK"We need all of the solutions," Chu said midway through a more than two-hour hearing. "We need to make them as clean as possible, as quickly as possible. All I can say is, we really need to do all these things."LiNeBrEaKBut Chu made it clear that he favors some things above others. He focused heavily on global warming and the need to combat it through efficiency measures and renewable energy research.LiNeBrEaKQuestioners focused largely on regional energy production concerns, and Chu worked hard to allay them. He did not oppose calls for increased oil drilling as part of an energy package, but noted that the United States contains only an estimated 3 percent of the world's known oil and gas reserves.LiNeBrEaKIn multiple answers, he sketched a plan for accelerated nuclear energy development, including improving a department loan program for new reactors and developing a long-range plan for dealing with nuclear waste.LiNeBrEaKHis most extended questioning on climate change came from Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who asked whether Chu preferred setting government caps on emissions or levying a carbon tax to curb them. Chu deferred to Obama's stance in favor of caps.LiNeBrEaK"Is that the best decision," Corker asked, "or the politically best decision?"LiNeBrEaKTo which Chu replied, drawing laughter: "You're far more experienced at answering that question than I am."LiNeBrEaKCommittee members praised Chu's credentials and his answers, and they predicted quick and easy confirmation of his appointment. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who chairs the energy committee, said the panel could approve Chu by week's end.LiNeBrEaKThe committee's top Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told Chu: "It's probably fair to say that you are uniquely poised in your ability to bring with you your background that relates the science and the technology" of the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaKChu's home-state senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein of California, were equally effusive: "Simply stating, in my opinion," Feinstein said, "there is no one brighter or more equipped than this man to become secretary of energy."LiNeBrEaKAfter the hearing, even environmental groups who oppose coal and nuclear plants praised Chu's commitment to renewable fuels and efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"What I am most heartened by is that we have someone heading the Department of Energy now who not only believes that we must fight global warming, but that the top ways of fighting global warming are energy efficiency and renewable energy," said Anna Aurilio, who directs the Washington office for Environment America. "This is a huge change in direction from where the previous administration has been."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	What global warming? U.S., Europe feel big chill: But climate change shows no end in sight, scientists say  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	807 words  	Jan. 13--LONDON -- Where has global warming gone when we need it most?LiNeBrEaKAs cities from Chicago to London deal with an unusually bitter winter, weather records show that 2008 was one of the cooler years in the last decade. And the early months of 2009 are shaping up as "numbing" in the United States, according to the Farmer's Almanac, that nearly 200-year-old source of traditional weather lore.LiNeBrEaKThe chilly weather has fueled arguments that man-made global warming is bunk. "This [climate] 'crisis' is over," insists Joseph Bast, president of the Chicago-based Heartland Institute, which will sponsor a conference for climate change dissenters in March in New York. LiNeBrEaKBut most meteorologists say climate change shows little sign of slowing, and they blame our shivering misery this season on two key factors: normal variation in weather, which happens on a much shorter scale than climate shift, and short memories, or a gradual shift in what we think of as "normal" winter weather.LiNeBrEaKBritain this year has had its coldest start to winter in 30 years, with temperatures 5 degrees below average, but "this would have felt like a warm year as recently as the 1980s, and an exceptionally warm year in Victorian times," said Myles Allen, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford.LiNeBrEaKIn most parts of the world, "what we regard as normal weather is the average weather over the past 10 years," he said. "We forget what it was like before then," even if someone occasionally drags out old photos of houses roof-high in snowdrifts or tales of slogging miles to school in near-impassible conditions.LiNeBrEaKBritain's recent deep freeze  -- its coldest spell since 1996 -- is due to stalled weather patterns that have funneled in frigid air from Siberia and from continental Europe, which is also shivering after years of unusually mild winters, according to the Hadley Center, the United Kingdom's leading weather service.LiNeBrEaKStalled or unusual weather patterns also have contributed to remarkable snow and cold in Chicago and across much of the United States this winter. So far, this winter has been the 22nd coldest in 139 years of record-keeping in Chicago, and the fourth-snowiest in 124 years of records, according to Tom Skilling, chief meteorologist at WGN-TV. On Thursday, Chicago could see its first subzero high temperature in nearly 13 years.LiNeBrEaK"Just because certain areas cool down in the midst of an overall warming trend doesn't mean warming isn't going on," Skilling said. But the intensity of the cold and snow over the past two winters is raising some questions about how well scientists understand the interaction of an array of weather-changing forces, from sunspots to volcanic activity.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, one reason the last two winters have been chillier than normal, climate scientists say, is a cyclical change in Pacific Ocean currents known as La Nina. In La Nina years, cold ocean currents rise to the surface near the equator, often causing cooler winters in northern regions like the United States. An opposite warming effect occurs in El Nino years.LiNeBrEaKMeteorologists say La Nina phase in the Pacific is now ending, and some predict that by 2010 the world should again be seeing some of the warmest years on record -- warm enough that the Hadley Center is warning that poor residents of Britain may need help paying air-conditioning bills this summer.LiNeBrEaKBut other meteorologists see evidence of an unusual second La Nina on the rise in the Pacific, which could extend the current stretch of colder-than-average winters.LiNeBrEaK"It's a very complex puzzle, this whole climate thing," Skilling said.LiNeBrEaKSnowfall in Chicago in recent years still isn't anything approaching the snowy winters of the 1970s, when the Chicago average was 54 inches, Skilling said. But he said graphs his research department has drawn up suggest "we're cycling back into an era of a little more snow."LiNeBrEaKWhether that is a simply a temporary break from a long-term rise in planetary temperatures or a new, not-well-understood winter trend isn't entirely clear. But "the fact that 2009, like 2008, will not break records does not mean that global warming has gone away," warned Phil Jones, director of climate research at the University of East Anglia in England.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, "when you step back and look at the bigger picture, the overwhelming evidence is that temperature is increasing around the world," said John Hammonds, a meteorologist with the Hadley Center.LiNeBrEaKlgoering@tribune.com		GLOBAL WARMING (92%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); WEATHER (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); METEOROLOGY (89%); TRENDS (77%)  				CHICAGO, IL, USA (91%); LONDON, ENGLAND (90%) ILLINOIS, USA (91%); NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%); EUROPE (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (90%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  			Science  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090113-TB-What-global-warming-U-S-Europe-feel-big-chill-0113  	TB  									
Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	'Clean coal': Law could open door to new generation of coal-burning power plants: $18 million to fund studies for proposed Downstate facility  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	629 words  	Jan. 13--As President-elect Barack Obama vows to curb pollution linked to global climate change, Illinois is moving closer to building a new power plant that could be a showcase for burning dirty-but-plentiful coal more cleanly.LiNeBrEaKUnder legislation Gov. Rod Blagojevich signed into law Monday, the state will provide $18 million for studies that would lay the groundwork for the plant, proposed for a site near Downstate Taylorville. LiNeBrEaKThe plant, to be built by Tenaska Inc. and MDL Holding Co. about 25 miles southeast of Springfield, would be the nation's first large-scale test of technology that captures heat-trapping carbon dioxide. Half of its emissions would either be injected deep underground or piped to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico.LiNeBrEaKCompared with conventional coal plants, the Taylorville plant would emit less smog-forming chemicals and other harmful byproducts, including mercury. It also would produce less coal ash, the toxic stuff that recently spilled from holding ponds near two Tennessee plants.LiNeBrEaKIf the project goes forward, ComEd and other power companies would be required to buy up to 5 percent of their electricity from the new plant. The new law also requires any new coal plant built in Illinois after 2017 to store at least 90 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaK"This puts Illinois at the forefront of clean energy," said Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan, who brokered a deal on the bill signed by Blagojevich. "That's where the entire country needs to move."LiNeBrEaKBurning coal is the most carbon-intensive way to generate electricity, and many experts say that dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require greater reliance on wind power, solar energy and other renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKBut coal is relatively inexpensive, at least for now, and the coal industry remains politically influential in a number of states. The Taylorville project represents a chance to help revive Illinois' beleaguered coal industry.LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, Obama promised to boost funding for research into ways to burn coal without all the nasty byproducts. The goal, he said, is to build five demonstration plants that capture carbon dioxide emissions and pump them deep underground, a process known as carbon sequestration.LiNeBrEaKThough coal companies and utilities have held up sequestration as the holy grail of "clean coal" for years, there still hasn't been a full-scale test of the technology. And even if carbon capture and storage works, most energy experts say, it will take decades to employ it at the scale necessary to significantly affect emissions.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, though Illinois' proposed coal plant would emit less carbon dioxide than conventional power plants, it still would increase the overall amount of greenhouse gases the state produces.LiNeBrEaKIt's possible an expensive price tag could end up thwarting the project.LiNeBrEaKSkyrocketing construction costs already have scuttled many other proposed coal plants, including the federally supported FutureGen project near Downstate Mattoon. Like the proposed Taylorville plant, FutureGen was hailed as a model for keeping coal viable in a carbon-constrained world.LiNeBrEaK"Can coal interests actually address their massive contributions to climate change? And can they do so economically?" said Bruce Nilles, director of the Sierra Club's National Coal Campaign. "Those are two major questions that remain unanswered."LiNeBrEaKmhawthorne@tribune.com		COAL FIRED PLANTS (93%); POWER PLANTS (91%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (91%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (91%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); SMOG (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); CONSTRUCTION (78%); CONSTRUCTION COSTS (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (77%); WIND POWER PLANTS (77%); WIND ENERGY (77%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (76%); AIR POLLUTION (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (72%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (72%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (58%)  	TENASKA INC (71%)  		BARACK OBAMA (92%); ROD BLAGOJEVICH (73%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (88%) ILLINOIS, USA (95%); GULF OF MEXICO (76%); ATLANTIC OCEAN (76%) UNITED STATES (95%); NORTH AMERICA (79%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Chicago Tribune   	Michael Hawthorne, Chicago Tribune  		NYSE:EXC  	Construction  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090113-TB-Clean-coal-Law-could-open-door-to-new-generation-of-coal-burning-power-plants-0113  	TB  									
The Columbian (Washington)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Environmental groups lay out green agenda  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	493 words  	Jan. 13--Washington's environmental groups will lobby the 2009 Legislature to impose a "polluter pays" levy on oil companies. The money would help pay the cost of reducing contaminated runoff into the state's waters. LiNeBrEaKThe Washington Environmental Council, a coalition of the state's major environmental groups, also will urge lawmakers to move ahead with adopting a "cap and invest" system for carbon emissions, which would require polluters to buy permits to emit carbon. The revenue would be used to create green energy jobs, spur innovation, and provide assistance to people who are struggling with high energy costs.LiNeBrEaK"Rather than wait for the federal government to design a cap and trade system for us, we can adopt a program that benefits the Washington economy, protects Washington's interests in the national climate policy debate, and positions us for success in the new energy economy," the council said in announcing its priorities for the session.LiNeBrEaKSen. Craig Pridemore, D-Vancouver, will serve as vice chairman of the Senate Environment, Water and Energy Committee and is expected to push the green agenda. He said last week he supports a "strict regulatory approach" to reducing carbon emissions rather than a "cap and trade" system that allows polluters to buy and sell the right to emit greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKAsking oil companies to help pay to clean up the cost of polluted stormwater, which it calls the state's top water pollution problem, is a matter of fairness, the council said. "Presently stormwater projects are funded by utility taxes and fees on local developers. By also imposing fees on the companies that sell the primary stormwater contaminants, we move toward a system where everyone is paying their fair share."LiNeBrEaKClark County home builders have long argued that it's unfair to expect them to bear the full cost of containing and decontaminating stormwater runoff. Those development fees in turn are passed on to home buyers.LiNeBrEaKThe council's four-point agenda also calls for the Legislature to:LiNeBrEaKn Adopt and promote "super-efficient," low-energy-use building codes for new buildings, for example by requiring disclosure of energy-use performance scores and helping energy-efficient projects qualify for Local Improvement District funding;LiNeBrEaKn Encourage less driving by making urban regional transportation planning agencies responsible for meeting goals to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled, for example by zoning for compact development near rail and bus rapid transit stations to make it more convenient to use mass transit.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Texas Legislature to revive clean coal debate  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	543 words  	Jan. 13--The clean coal debate lives.LiNeBrEaKThis session, the Texas Legislature will revive the issue of whether to give tax breaks to companies building cleaner, coal-fired power plants that capture greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKThe bill, filed by Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, is designed to make integrated gasification combined cycle power plants, or IGCC, economically viable by waiving up to $100 million in franchise taxes per plant, along with other incentives. The incentives are only for IGCC plants that capture and store at least 60 percent of their carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaK"People are afraid, the industry's afraid, to go and try to build a clean coal plant. I call it the prototype penalty," King said.LiNeBrEaKNew, prototype technology often costs more than older technology, so some developers shy away from the risk and cost of innovating. IGCC with carbon capture can cost as much as 50 percent more than traditional coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaKSen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, will sponsor the bill in the Senate. His district includes Odessa, one of the sites proposed to host the now-defunct federal clean coal project called FutureGen.LiNeBrEaKThe bill targets an IGCC plant proposed by Summit Power, which hired former Dallas Mayor Laura Miller to help get it built. Summit wants to build at the Odessa site, but Miller said the company needs government incentives to make a business case for the plant.LiNeBrEaK"The reason there are legislators that are interested in this kind of plant is that Texas has the opportunity to be ground zero in the country for carbon capture and sequestration," Miller said. She will appear at a news conference in support of the bill Thursday in Austin.LiNeBrEaKOther companies with IGCC proposals could also apply for the tax credit.LiNeBrEaKNRG Energy has applied for an air permit for an IGCC plant in South Texas. The company has said it needs government incentives to make the plant profitable.LiNeBrEaKAnd Energy Future Holdings' Luminant generation business has said it is considering building an IGCC facility, but it hasn't offered any proposals.LiNeBrEaK"This type of policy proposal is a solid first step by the Legislature," said Phil Wilson, Luminant's senior vice president of public affairs.LiNeBrEaKThe bill offers three incentives. First, the plant developer gets up to $100 million in franchise tax credit.LiNeBrEaKSecond, the University of Texas' Bureau of Economic Geology will monitor the sites where the carbon dioxide is stored to ensure that the greenhouse gas remains underground.LiNeBrEaKThird, any oil company that will take the carbon dioxide from the plant and use it for enhanced oil recovery gets a tax incentive.LiNeBrEaKA number of oil companies around Texas buy naturally occurring carbon dioxide produced out of state. The carbon dioxide is piped in and injected into aging wells to bring up more oil.LiNeBrEaKIGCC plants are called clean coal because the plant turns the fuel into a gas.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   ALL S EDITION	The Public Pulse  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A15  	581 words  	Don't stifle businessLiNeBrEaKI am the owner/operator of Jimmy's Ala Cart. After 22 years of working in the corporate world, I decided to take a huge risk and left a secure career behind. Like the other individuals who have ventured into the unknown to follow the American dream of owning their own business, it has not come without a great deal of risk, money, and sweat equity.LiNeBrEaKI feel that the vendors have just as much right to own and operate their businesses as anyone else. This is America! The land of opportunity. Let's not forget that by stifling our industry. If you look back in history, the streets were filled with vendors peddling their goods. After all, it was small business that built America. Remember? LiNeBrEaKJIM FARHAT/WalkerLiNeBrEaKNot worthyLiNeBrEaKI object to The Press running a front-page "Situation Wanted" ad for Glenn Steil Jr. ("Situation wanted: Legislators seek work," Jan. 5). His being out of work is not front-page news, nor is the poor job market front-page news. It is perhaps unfortunate that Glenn Steil Jr. is out of work, but at least he had six years to prepare for it. In addition, he leaves his last employer with a pension, lifetime health benefits for himself, his spouse and his dependent children. The Associated Press article neglected to mention that in addition to salary our representatives also receive $1,000 per month per diem allowance.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, The Press must also believe he is entitled to the gift of a front-page "situation wanted" ad.LiNeBrEaKHere's an idea. How about running free "situation wanted" ads for anyone who wants one? The paper could consider it simply doing its part for the unemployed in a poor job market. After all, The Press already has a precedent for doing such a thing.LiNeBrEaKRAY Van HAECK/HudsonvilleLiNeBrEaKCan't drill our way outLiNeBrEaKIn response to Representative Dave Agema's letter ("Don't raise taxes in a recession," Pulse, Jan. 5): Whether or not one endorses the concept of a raised gas tax, does anyone really believe that we in the United States can simply "drill our way out" of our energy problems?LiNeBrEaKEven if attainable, would it not already have been achieved, using the millions of acres where drilling is allowed? Mr. Agema seems to believe we are addicted only to "foreign oil," so that if we merely removed the word "foreign," there would somehow be no more addiction, and therefore no problem. One might agree, were it not for the messy little problem of global warming (yes, it's real) -- a subject he conveniently does not address. "Drill Now" may sound good and marginally address energy supply, but it works against confronting the deeper problem that we are abusing our planet (God's creation, remember?). Rather than whining about raised gas taxes, Mr. Agema would be more useful and true as a conservative by championing the benefits of conservation of energy. We just witnessed the power of conservation following last summer's $4 gasoline spike. How about it, Mr. Agema?LiNeBrEaKEDWARD BOLT/Grand RapidsLiNeBrEaKAid to other countriesLiNeBrEaKI can see giving aid to a country that needs it, but let's not give aid to countries that don't need it. Israel is a country that the United States gives aid to, some $3 billion, and Israel would use that money to buy weaponsLiNeBrEaKFirst of all I didn't know that Israel was a country in need of welfare, and why are we giving money to other countries that could be used at home? Are we still going to be giving money to other countries when we are in a Depression? We need to get our own house in order first!LiNeBrEaKMARCIA BOELENS/Rockford		EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); EMPLOYMENT (73%); SMALL BUSINESS (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (72%); LEGISLATORS (67%); WAGES and SALARIES (66%); TAXES and TAXATION (64%); FUEL TAX (50%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%) Opinion  	ASSOCIATED PRESS (54%)  			UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Grand Rapids Press All Rights Reserved  							grp  									
The Houston Chronicle 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Bush zeroed in on energy like few other presidents;  Experts clash on assessments of his policies 	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	1121 words  	WASHINGTON - George W. Bush leaves his mark on the nation's energy policy like no president in a generation.LiNeBrEaKAn unabashed champion of the oil industry, Bush swept aside regulatory impediments to domestic oil and natural gas drilling.LiNeBrEaKBut this same one-time Midland oilman also declared the nation "addicted" to oil and signed bills requiring greater use of renewable fuels and raising vehicle mileage requirements. LiNeBrEaKWhile a steadfast, at times even lone, advocate for building up the nation's emergency oil stockpile, Bush largely punted on what may be the most pressing environmental issue of our age: addressing climate change.LiNeBrEaKAs polarizing a figure on energy as any other issue, Bush sparks assessments that suggest a mix of strategic vision and shortsightedness.LiNeBrEaKKevin Book, an oil analyst with FBR Capital Markets, credits Bush for saving consumers last summer from even worse problems than $4-a-gallon gasoline when supplies of high-quality oil became tight, thanks to a "bold" policy promoting ethanol and other renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaKBut David Doniger, a climate policy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls Bush's energy legacy "a wasteland," while Mark Cooper, director of research for the Consumer Federation of America, considers Bush's energy policy as disastrous as the government's response when New Orleans was drowning.LiNeBrEaK"The Katrina analysis fits perfectly," Cooper said.LiNeBrEaKPolicy shortcomingsLiNeBrEaKCertainly, Bush fell short on several major energy policy fronts.LiNeBrEaKHe was unable, for instance, to marshal the political support to open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, believed to hold the largest untapped onshore oil deposit left in the U.S.LiNeBrEaKNo new nuclear power plants have been built on his watch, although utilities have filed a number of new permit requests. And a proposal to encourage refineries to build plants on old military bases has gone nowhere.LiNeBrEaKAn energy focusLiNeBrEaKBut the Bush White House has focused on energy like no administration since Jimmy Carter's.LiNeBrEaK"You've got to give the president a lot credit for putting energy center stage from, literally, the first week in office," said Spencer Abraham, a former Michigan senator who served as Bush's first energy secretary.LiNeBrEaKHis first day in office, Abraham remembers, he was on the phone with the then-governor of California, trying to keep the lights on.LiNeBrEaKAnd from that day on, the Bush White House had to deal with Enron trading shenanigans, petrochemical makers abandoning the United States because of high natural gas prices and motorists clamoring about the cost of filling up their SUVs.LiNeBrEaKMajor role for CheneyLiNeBrEaKWhen Bush took office, many experts were complaining the nation's energy policy had been left to drift.LiNeBrEaKBush assigned Vice President Dick Cheney, the former head of oil field services giant Halliburton Co., to craft a new energy strategy.LiNeBrEaKThe resulting proposal focused largely on boosting domestic energy supplies. Critics complained it had been written in secret, largely reflecting the views of industry with only token acknowledgment of environmental concerns.LiNeBrEaKAbraham said some argued the energy strategy was too alarmist, "when in fact all the subsequent history has borne out" the need for attention directed toward energy concerns.LiNeBrEaKEasier processLiNeBrEaKUnder Bush, the federal government streamlined the process companies must navigate to drill on federal lands. Indeed, the Bureau of Land Management has approved more than twice the number of drilling permits annually under Bush than during the Clinton administration, agency records show.LiNeBrEaKBush also pushed to open new areas offshore. In July, he lifted a presidential moratorium barring drilling off the East and West coasts. Then he helped his Republican allies strong-arm a Democratic-controlled Congress to allow a similar, congressional drilling ban to lapse for the first time since the early 1980s.LiNeBrEaK"He tried to develop federal resources more aggressively than his predecessors had - including his dad, who started that executive moratorium," said Lee Fuller, vice president of government relations for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, referring to former President George H.W. Bush.LiNeBrEaKOil reserve a priorityLiNeBrEaKThe current president, Abraham said, has been "personally adamant" about building up the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with the amount of oil in the stockpile rising 24 percent during his time in office.LiNeBrEaKBush repeatedly rebuffed calls to try to use the reserve to provide relief for motorists. Indeed, even as oil prices were soaring toward their record highs last summer, Bush insisted on adding new barrels to the reserve, until Congress finally stepped in and forced him to stop.LiNeBrEaKConsumers also complained loudly about record profits oil companies racked up in recent years. Despite that public anger, Bush tried repeatedly to swat away efforts to hit oil companies up for higher taxes.LiNeBrEaKEventually, he was forced to swallow a tax increase in October, when lawmakers added new taxes for the industry to the financial bailout package.LiNeBrEaKBecause Bush "was viewed as an oilman," the Independent Petroleum Association's Fuller said, "it made policy choices sometimes harder to present" because critics assumed he would side with the industry.LiNeBrEaKThat made it all the more dramatic when Bush declared during his 2006 State of the Union address that "America is addicted to oil."LiNeBrEaK'Bright spot'LiNeBrEaKJim Marston, head of the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund, said that was a rare "bright spot" for the administration.LiNeBrEaK"The problem was, we didn't treat the addiction," he said.LiNeBrEaKBush has promoted production of ethanol, made both from corn and from nonfood items such as switchgrass, to help lessen the nation's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, ethanol now accounts for 7 percent of the nation's gasoline supply, according to the Renewable Fuels Association. And in 2007, Bush signed a landmark energy bill requiring even greater use of renewables. That same legislation requires the nation's fleet of cars and trucks achieve an average 35 miles per gallon by 2020.LiNeBrEaKIn coming years, the Bush White House may be most faulted for not moving more aggressively to curb greenhouse gas emissions and slow the effects of climate change.LiNeBrEaKAbraham said critics don't give the administration enough credit for helping encourage development of technologies to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists point to FutureGen, a federal initiative to develop a way to capture carbon dioxide emitted from coal-fired power plants. Bush announced the program in 2003, but after five years his administration announced it was revamping the project.LiNeBrEaKMarston said the program was moving in the right direction.LiNeBrEaK"We got close," he said, "and then they pulled the rug out from under it."

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Coal, nuclear an 'important part' of power mix, energy nominee says  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	679 words  	WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary-designate Steven Chu told a Senate Committee on Tuesday that the incoming administration would have an increased commitment to alternative energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal, but also made clear coal and nuclear would be part of the energy mix.LiNeBrEaKChu, who won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997 and is currently director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, made the comments during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Chu is expected to win confirmation easily. LiNeBrEaKThe new administration is also committed to "aggressively" increasing energy efficiency in appliances and buildings; will push for more fuel-efficient vehicles, including plug-in hybrids; and supports a more "robust" transmission and distribution system for electricity, Chu said.LiNeBrEaK"I would not have accepted the president-elect's nomination if I had not thought it was essential to move ahead on this plan," he said.LiNeBrEaKChu also said, however, that the Obama administration would support efforts to revitalize the nuclear power industry, including developing a long-term plan to dispose of radioactive waste from the civilian reactors; would seek the "responsible" development of domestic oil and gas supplies; and would invest in technology to capture and store carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKChu was questioned closely by Republican and Democratic committee members about the new administration's plans for nuclear and coal. Chu said in a public lecture last year, available on YouTube, that coal was his "worst nightmare."LiNeBrEaK"That quote is ricocheting around the Internet," Chu said. "The context was whether we will continue using coal as we do today ... that is a pretty bad dream."LiNeBrEaKBurning coal is a major source of the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere and is contributing to an increase in Earth's average temperature that experts say will lead to damaging changes in climate and sea level in the decades to come.LiNeBrEaKChu began his comments at his confirmation hearing by warning: "It is now clear that if we continue on our current path, we run the risk of dramatic, disruptive changes to our climate system in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren."LiNeBrEaKChu has spoken throughout the country and focused the Berkeley Lab's work on the related problems of global warming and the need for renewable energy sources that don't add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. has immense stores of coal, and Chu said he was "hopeful and optimistic we can use those resources in a clean way."LiNeBrEaKThe only way to burn coal without increasing the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is to capture it and store it underground, something that's not being done at any of the nation's 450 coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKAs for nuclear power, Chu said a federal loan program to provide funding to build new nuclear power plants needs to be accelerated, but he acknowledged that finding a way to safely dispose of the waste could be more difficult.LiNeBrEaKObama said during the campaign he opposed using the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada to store the waste, which the federal government is obligated to take.LiNeBrEaKChu said a better system to recycle the waste would need to be developed, but nonproliferation issues would remain.LiNeBrEaKEven so, Chu said, "Nuclear power will be an important part of the energy mix."LiNeBrEaK(Staff writer Renee Schoof contributed to this article.)LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKFor more information about energy secretary nominee Steve Chu:LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.lbl.gov/Publications/Director/LiNeBrEaKChu's lecture on April 23, 2007, at Berkeley:LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v(equal sign)pLr4YbStc0M		WIND POWER PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); WIND ENERGY (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (89%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (79%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (79%); POWER PLANTS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (78%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); PHYSICS (77%); NOBEL PRIZES (77%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (77%); AWARDS and PRIZES (77%); NUCLEAR WASTE (77%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (77%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (74%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); HAZARDOUS WASTE TREATMENT and DISPOSAL (72%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (64%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (69%); US PRESIDENTS (73%)  			STEVEN CHU (94%); BARACK OBAMA (55%)  	EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  	ARCHIVE GRAPHIC on MCT Direct (from MCT Graphics, 202-383-6064): 20081215 OBAMA Chu		Newspaper  	2009 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   	By Les Blumenthal, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON   			Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	20090113-BC-OBAMA-CHU  	WA  									
Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Mulroy: Don't ignore warming  	A; Pg. 12A  	621 words  	STEPHENS WASHINGTON BUREAULiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Southern Nevada's top water official warned federal policymakers Monday that they underestimate climate change at their own risk as they consider ways to bolster the nation's infrastructure.LiNeBrEaK"We need to understand where the floods are going to occur and where the drought conditions are going to be protracted before we start making long-term investments," said Pat Mulroy, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority.LiNeBrEaKIn the short term, fixing long-neglected bridges, roads, and water and sewer systems is fine, Mulroy said. But beyond that, she said, "we need to look at (infrastructure) through a 21st-century lens in a very different climate and not take a 19th-century climate and assume that is going to be the norm." LiNeBrEaK"We have not spent any time in this country investing in the science of climate change in any kind of concerted action," she said. "We have not spent time talking about how we are going to adapt."LiNeBrEaKMulroy, who directs the agency that supplies most of the water in Clark County, sounded the alarm as part of a panel assembled by the Brookings Institution to discuss infrastructure and recommendations for President-elect Barack Obama to pursue in his economic stimulus strategy and beyond.LiNeBrEaKInvestments in infrastructure create jobs and shore up the physical foundations of the nation, but panelists said the ways such projects are weighed and funded are grossly inefficient.LiNeBrEaKThe audience of several hundred at the think tank grew silent at Mulroy's striking predictions. She said that Southern California "is very much facing the real possibility of having a major water crisis in 2010" and that three more years of drought along the Colorado River will cost Southern Nevada 40 percent of its water supply.LiNeBrEaK"Two more years after that, we lose 90 percent of our water supply" if the drought persists over the longer period, she said, referring to Lake Mead levels dropping beneath the intake pipes that draw water for municipal use.LiNeBrEaKProfessional water managers recognize that climate change "could destroy the very underpinnings of every economy of the United States," Mulroy said.LiNeBrEaKDikes could burst under pressure from rising ocean levels, she said, and water treatment plants near riverbanks could get flooded, threatening clean supplies.LiNeBrEaKAnd the West could wither "from the most dire and desperate drought that we have ever experienced," she said.LiNeBrEaKMulroy said she was hopeful about the appointment of former EPA Administrator Carol Browner to become the global warming coordinator in the Obama White House. While federal science agencies now compete for climate change funding, there might be some coordination in the new administration, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Once that science gets going and we get a better understanding of the true impacts of climate change, then we can look at the most at-risk situations, whether it is the dikes in California, whether it is the potential of losing a significant part of Florida, whether it is the protracted droughts that are going to wipe out whole economies, and what are the possible solutions," she said.LiNeBrEaKPolicymakers will need to become creative, even "outrageous," Mulroy said. For instance, she suggested that floodwaters from the Mississippi River might be diverted west for drought prevention.LiNeBrEaK"Why can't floodwaters in one part of the country, through a series of exchanges, be a water supply in another part of the country?" she said. "I could show you a series of exchanges between the Mississippi and California, and you could start fixing some problems.LiNeBrEaK"When it comes to watersheds and water supplies, we are all interconnected."LiNeBrEaKContact Washington Bureau Chief Steve Tetreault at stetreault@stephensmedia.com or 202-783-1760.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   03 EDITION	Alabama Power studying idea of using wood for fuel  	A; Pg. 01  	746 words  	Alabama Power studying idea of using wood for fuelLiNeBrEaKBy SEAN REILLYLiNeBrEaKWashington BureauLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - With utilities under growing pressure to turn to renewable energy sources, Alabama Power Co. is exploring the option of making electricity solely by burning wood or other "biomass."LiNeBrEaKUnder a study to be completed in the second half of this year, the state's top power provider is looking into converting a coal-fired generating unit at one of its facilities. LiNeBrEaKAmong the sites under consideration is Barry Steam Plant in north Mobile County.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of power involved would be 70 to 80 megawatts, according to a description of the project recently released by the city of Mobile. That's a fraction of the company's total output but still enough to light thousands of homes.LiNeBrEaKOnce the results are in, "we'll make a decision on what we're going to do going forward," Chris Habig, the company's marketing renewable resources manager, said in an interview last week.LiNeBrEaKWhile Habig described the study as part of "general planning activities," environmentalists see it as recognition that utilities are likely to face a long-term federal push to lessen their dependence on coal as a primary fuel source.LiNeBrEaKWhen burned, coal emits carbon dioxide - a colorless, odorless gas now seen as a key culprit behind global warming.LiNeBrEaKWood combustion also produces carbon dioxide, but because trees and other plants absorb the gas during their life cycles, the overall impact on the climate is a wash, according to scientists.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's more of a pre-emptive effort," Adam Snyder, executive director of Conservation Alabama, said of the Alabama Power study, adding that he considers it "a great move."LiNeBrEaKAlong the same lines, Georgia Power Co., another affiliate of Atlanta-based Southern Company, is seeking regulators' permission to convert a small coal-fired plant to biomass, said Anne Blair of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, another advocacy group headquartered in Knoxville, Tenn.LiNeBrEaK"I think they are doing a good job in terms of anticipating what is likely to be coming down the pipeline at the federal level and simply diversifying their energy mix," said Blair, who is the alliance's program manager for diesel and biofuels.LiNeBrEaKAlabama Power and other Southern Company affiliates collectively rank among the nation's largest corporate carbon dioxide polluters.LiNeBrEaKAt the congressional level, Southern has lobbied strenuously against legislation that would push utilities to gradually bolster their use of renewable fuels. Such legislation has so far failed, but congressional Democrats are gearing up for another try this year.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Alabama Power uses wood chips and switchgrass at a Gadsden plant, the company has no generating units that run exclusively on biomass. Building such a unit from scratch is also an option.LiNeBrEaKThe Barry feasibility study came to light when the city of Mobile included the proposed conversion in a wish list of projects to be included in an economic stimulus package that lawmakers will take up this month. That list puts the price tag at $100 million, but Habig indicated that the figure could be lower and said no decision has been made on how to pay for the conversion. Higher costs for coal and other fuels make the venture economically cost-effective for the first time, he added.LiNeBrEaKThe company would like to burn tree limbs and other "waste material" but could also use pulp chips, he said. In all, the plant would need 700,000 to 800,000 tons of biomass annually, according to the city of Mobile's description of the project.LiNeBrEaKThat volume of timber is available in southwest Alabama, said Ruth Seawell, a vice president and forest analyst at Larson and McGowin, Inc., a Mobile-based consulting firm.LiNeBrEaKBut, she added, "Do we have the infrastructure to move the resource?"LiNeBrEaKAlthough the study's completion is still months away, Alabama Power has already broached the potential conversion with the Alabama Public Service Commission, a state regulatory agency.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview last week, Commissioner Susan Parker said the project came up in "informal discussions" between the utility and the PSC before Christmas.LiNeBrEaK"I am aware of it, but they have not made any official filing on it," she said. "It's still in the very preliminary stages."LiNeBrEaK(Press-Register Capital Bureau Reporter Brian Lyman contributed to this report.)LiNeBrEaKMIKE KITTRELL/Staff PhotographerLiNeBrEaKBarry Steam Plant in north Mobile County is among the sites being considered for transition to burning wood or other "biomass."

Mt. Vernon Register-News (Illinois)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Calvary United Pentecostal Church receives grant for geothermal system  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	660 words  	Jan. 13--MT. VERNON -- Calvary United Pentecostal Church will be moving into a new building this Sunday, and the new building will feature a geothermal heating and cooling system with the help of a grant from the Association of Illinois Electric Cooperatives.LiNeBrEaK"This is not a conventional heating and cooling system," pastor Steven Edwards explained. "It's extremely efficient and utility companies nationwide are encouraging new construction to use this type of system." LiNeBrEaKTri-County Electric Cooperative, which provides electrical service to the site of the new church at 406 N. 44th St. and is a member of the Association of Illinois Electric Cooperatives in Springfield, was able to help the congregation obtain the new technology with a grant of $12,467.LiNeBrEaK"We got in touch with the Illinois Electric Cooperatives ... they help with processing of grants for various groups to apply for grants when using geothermal heating and cooling in new construction," Edwards said. "We made the application for it and got approved."LiNeBrEaKThe grant writing was done by David Piercy, and Edwards said Tri-County was also "instrumental" in getting the final approval. The system was installed by Holloway Heating and Air.LiNeBrEaK"They've installed quite a few of these systems," Edwards said. "This is the way of the future."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the association, geothermal heating and cooling systems are the most efficient systems available today. The technology harnesses the natural energy trapped beneath the earth's surface and taps into the renewable energy of the sun.LiNeBrEaK"You may realize that no matter whether it's frigid winter or boiling summer, the temperature of the earth stays fairly constant below ground level," information from the association states. "In Illinois, the temperature below ground is a constant mid-50 degrees. To heat, a geothermal system uses an earth loop to extract this heat from the ground. The system draws the heat from a fluid that is circulated from a closed earth loop, maximizing the heat energy through a simple refrigeration process. The heat is then distributed through a conventional duct system."LiNeBrEaKTo cool, the system takes heat from inside the building and moves it back to the earth loop.LiNeBrEaKEdwards said the grants are designed to help with the higher initial costs of installation. According to the association, the system will produce savings of 50 percent or more than the conventional heating and cooling systems and pay back the initial upfront costs in two to three years.LiNeBrEaKThe grant program, Geothermal Alliance, was developed to encourage growth of geothermal technology through a grant program. It is a collaboration between the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation and the AIEC.LiNeBrEaK"The alliance supports the installation of new or retrofit energy efficient geothermal systems to heat and cool non-profit entities and public facilities served by AIEC member cooperatives," information on the alliance states. " In May 2006, when phase two of the program kicked off, the ICECF contributed an additional $500,000 to further expand commercial use of geothermal technology in co-op territories. Those monies will be available until funding is depleted."LiNeBrEaKProjects which are eligible for grant funding are public and private schools, churches, libraries, community centers, municipal buildings and other community or non-profit buildings.LiNeBrEaKSunday will see the first church services in the new building, Edwards said. Formerly located on the corner of 25th and Jones Streets, the church has an average attendance of about 150.

The New York Times 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	A Bicycle Evangelist With the Wind Now at His Back  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; Pg. 2  	1196 words  	For years, Earl Blumenauer has been on a mission, and now his work is paying off. He can tell by the way some things are deteriorating around here.LiNeBrEaK  ''People are flying through stop signs on bikes,'' Mr. Blumenauer said. ''We are seeing in Portland bike congestion. You'll see people biking across the river on a pedestrian bridge. They are just chock-a-block.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Blumenauer, a passionate advocate of cycling as a remedy for everything from climate change to obesity, represents most of Portland in Congress, where he is the founder and proprietor of the 180 (plus or minus)-member Congressional Bicycle Caucus. Long regarded in some quarters as quixotic, the caucus has come into its own as hard times, climate concerns, gyrating gas prices and worries about fitness turn people away from their cars and toward their bikes.LiNeBrEaK  ''We have been flogging this bicycle thing for 20 years,'' said Mr. Blumenauer, a Democrat. ''All of a sudden it's hot.''  LiNeBrEaK  But Mr. Blumenauer's goals are larger than putting Americans on two wheels. He seeks to create what he calls a more sustainable society, including wiser use of energy, farming that improves the land rather than degrades  it, an end to taxpayer subsidies for unwise development -- and a transportation infrastructure that looks beyond the car.LiNeBrEaK  For him, the global financial collapse is ''perhaps the best opportunity we will ever see'' to build environmental sustainability into the nation's infrastructure, with urban streetcar systems, bike and pedestrian paths, more efficient energy transmission and conversion of the federal government's 600,000-vehicle fleet to use alternate fuels.LiNeBrEaK  ''These are things that three years ago were unimaginable,'' he said. ''And if they were imaginable, we could not afford them. Well, now when all the experts agree that we will be lucky if we stabilize the economy in a couple of years, when there is great concern about the consequences of the collapse of the domestic auto producers, gee, these are things that are actually reasonable and affordable.'' LiNeBrEaK  All this might still be pie-in-the-sky were it not for one of Mr. Blumenauer's fellow biking enthusiasts, Representative James L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, avid cyclist and chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has jurisdiction over surface transportation. LiNeBrEaK  ''He's been wonderful,'' Mr. Oberstar said of his Oregon colleague. And as support for cycling grows, he said, builders, the highway construction lobby and others have stopped regarding biking as a ''nuisance'' and started thinking about how they can do business. LiNeBrEaK  With an eye on the potential stimulus package, cycling advocates ''have compiled a list of $2 billion of projects that can be under construction in 90 days,'' Mr. Oberstar said, adding that prospects are ''bright.'' LiNeBrEaK  In addition, after many attempts, this fall Mr. Blumenauer saw Congress approve his proposal to extend the tax breaks offered for employee parking to employers who encourage biking. The measure, which Mr. Blumenauer called a matter of ''bicycle parity,'' was part of a bailout bill. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Blumenauer has  spent a lot of time on another issue that ordinarily draws little attention: the federally subsidized flood insurance program. The program serves people who own property along coasts and rivers who otherwise would pay enormous premiums for private flood insurance, if they could obtain it at all. LiNeBrEaK  The insurance ''subsidized people to live in places where nature repeatedly showed they weren't wanted,'' he said. They might be better off if they did not live there, he said, but ''it's un-American to say, 'Get out.' ''  Politicians who should confront the problem ''are betting Nimto, not in my term of office,'' he said. They hope that disasters will spare their districts or, if they strike, that the government will come to the rescue, Mr. Blumenauer said. LiNeBrEaK  A Portland native, Mr. Blumenauer, 60, has spent his adult life in elective office. He graduated from Lewis and Clark College in 1970 (after organizing an unsuccessful 1969 campaign to lower the state's voting age to 18) and worked until 1977 as assistant to the president of Portland State University. In 1972, he won a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives. He moved to the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners in 1978, and from there, in 1986, he won election to the Portland City Council. Though he lost a mayoral election in 1992, he easily won election to the United States House in 1996 and has not faced serious opposition since. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Blumenauer entered Congress just after Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker, killed a stopgap spending measure, shutting down much of the government, out of pique over his treatment on Air Force One.  ''Partisan tensions were very raw,'' Mr. Blumenauer said. The bicycle caucus was ''a way to bring people together.''  LiNeBrEaK  Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican and fellow bicyclist who represented upstate New York in Congress until 2007, agreed. When ''partisanship was at an all-time high and tolerance of another point of view was at a longtime low,'' he wore the bike caucus's plastic bicycle lapel pin. ''Bicycling unites people regardless of party affiliation,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  In addition to bicycles, Mr. Blumenauer is particularly interested in public broadcasting and the plight of pollinators like honeybees. He is a founder of a ''livable communities task force'' whose goal, he said, is to educate members of Congress and their staffs on the benefits of transportation alternatives, open space, sustainability, vibrant downtowns, affordable housing and transparency in government.LiNeBrEaK  Initially, he said, these interests marked him as ''kind of left coast.'' Not anymore. ''They are becoming very mainstream,'' said Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat who represents in Congress the area around Pasadena, Calif., and who, with Mr. Blumenauer's bicycle advice, now regularly rides to work from his home in Maryland. ''He has been way out in front of the Congress,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''Now the rest of us are trying to catch up.'' LiNeBrEaK  When Mr. Blumenauer is in his Portland district, he usually gets around by bike, cycling about 20 miles in a typical day.  He has three bikes in Washington and five here, and he cycles in all weather, even in the unusual snow Portland has had recently. ''In falling snow you can get some traction,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  But the surge of bicycling in Portland has not been free of incident. The Oregonian newspaper and bloggers have reported on ''bike rage,'' drunken biking, hit-and-run bicycle accidents and other problems. Drivers complain about bikers who ignore traffic rules or hog narrow roads, phenomena some irritated motorists attribute to feelings of entitlement or moral superiority. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Blumenauer brushes off this criticism. ''They are burning calories, not fossil fuel, they are taking up much less space, they are seeing the world at 10 miles per hour instead of 20 or 30,'' he said. ''And even though there are occasionally cranky or rude cyclists, they are no greater a percentage than cranky or rude motorists.''LiNeBrEaK  Plus, he added, ''they have really fought for their place on the asphalt.''	http://www.nytimes.com  	CYCLING (89%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (75%); LOBBYING (75%); CLIMATOLOGY (75%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (73%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (72%); INFRASTRUCTURE (72%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (71%); SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (70%); AUTOMAKERS (68%); OIL and GAS PRICES (68%); RELIGION (68%); CONSTRUCTION (64%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (50%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS and SUBSIDIES (50%); OBESITY (70%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (69%)  LiNeBrEaKEarl Blumenauer 			EARL BLUMENAUER (94%); JIM OBERSTAR (51%)  	PORTLAND, OR, USA (92%) OREGON, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: THE CYCLIST  Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon.

The New York Times 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Advice for Obama on the Economy  	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 24  	1323 words  	To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''Plan to Jump-Start Economy With No Instruction Manual'' (front page, Jan. 10):LiNeBrEaK  The Obama stimulus plan includes about $150 billion of tax cuts for individuals and families. Despite the fact that our economic problems are due in large part to a $400 billion-a-year decrease in consumer spending, many Congressional Democrats and economists have criticized this part of the stimulus plan because they think that a large portion of the tax cuts will be saved rather than spent. Consequently, they believe that more direct government spending, rather than tax cuts, will provide a better economic stimulus.LiNeBrEaK  But there may be a way to increase consumer spending, without incurring the risk that tax cuts will be saved, not spent. Instead of distributing tax cuts in cash, or lower payroll deductions, the government could distribute the tax cuts in the form of gift or debit cards.LiNeBrEaK  These ''gift cards from Uncle Sam'' would be for a stated dollar amount, would be valid only for consumer purchases and would expire if they aren't used by a certain date. Everyone would use the cards, since they either ''use it or lose it.'' With ''gift cards from Uncle Sam,'' overall spending would increase by the exact amount of the tax cut. LiNeBrEaK  Andy Rush Scarsdale, N.Y., Jan. 10, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  The plan to jump-start the economy should be based on the nation's true economic condition: poverty.LiNeBrEaK  We are currently a poor nation because we have run ourselves into six deep debts: a federal debt (owed heavily to other nationals); a balance-of-payments debt from buying much more from other nations than we have sold them; personal debt from credit cards and other loans; infrastructure deterioration that must be repaired and replaced; education quality compared with our competitor countries; and most serious, an environmental debt from depleting nature's assets of clean air (without climate-changing gases), clean water, fertile soil, diverse species and a healthy ocean.LiNeBrEaK  We cannot afford a stimulus package aimed at sending people back to the mall. It must aim at repaying our debts, particularly restoring the environment, rebuilding infrastructure and improving our schools.LiNeBrEaK  Bill Shore  Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., Jan. 10, 2009LiNeBrEaK  The writer is executive secretary of the Nature Network. LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  I applaud your Jan. 11 editorial ''The Stimulus Debate,'' in which you oppose proposed tax cuts by the coming Obama administration for people making up to $200,000 a year. You do, however, say tax cuts make ''good sense for low-  and middle-income Americans.''LiNeBrEaK  I am a retired journalist and consider myself a middle-income American. Speaking for myself and my wife, we do not need a tax cut. We live modestly on my pension and our Social Security checks. We own our own home and have few debts. And even though, like so many Americans, we have lost a substantial portion of our retirement I.R.A., we have been frugal and lucky. So far we're doing O.K. LiNeBrEaK  I absolutely agree with you that ''every dollar spent on a politically expedient tax cut is money that is not spent where it could do more good.'' LiNeBrEaK  Do the right thing, Mr. Obama -- and don't worry. We'll support you.LiNeBrEaK  James Houtrides Brooklyn, Jan. 11, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Your concern with tax cuts in the stimulus package is a distraction. Far more troublesome is the conventional assumption that the recession is a more or less classic business cycle that an infusion of cash through infrastructure projects and tax cuts will turn around. It isn't, and it won't be. LiNeBrEaK  The current recession is not cyclical; it is structural, and it is unprecedented. During the 1930s, thousands of factories closed. But their buildings and equipment remained in place and intact, and they could be reactivated to meet World War II mobilization needs. That model no longer exists. LiNeBrEaK  Most of the thousands of manufacturing facilities that closed since World War II closed for good. Their equipment was crated and shipped overseas; their buildings are boarded up, their workers laid off. These factories didn't close because of a cyclical shortfall in demand but because they lost their markets to imports. LiNeBrEaK  No fiscal stimulus can possibly match the benefits of using low-wage overseas labor for such production. Thus, the hollowed-out manufacturing sector will not be able to create the advertised millions of new jobs. I believe that this structural issue looms larger than who gets what tax cuts.LiNeBrEaK  S. Stanley Katz Sarasota, Fla., Jan. 11, 2009LiNeBrEaK  The writer was deputy assistant secretary of commerce, 1976-78, and is a former vice president of the Asian Development Bank.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor: LiNeBrEaK  Re ''Obama's Biggest Challenge,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 10):LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Herbert writes what everyone already knows: ''There is one overriding mission for the incoming Obama administration when it comes to dealing with the economy, and that's putting Americans back to work.''LiNeBrEaK  But the way that Mr. Herbert and Barack Obama plan to put people back to work is an illusion. Building roads and bridges as well as green technology will not have any meaningful effect on immediate job creation. Jobs will continue to be lost until people start buying houses and automobiles again, and that is not going to happen unless the consumer is motivated to buy.LiNeBrEaK  The first order of business is to scrap all the bailouts, which are a nonproductive use of taxpayer money. Instead of bailouts, the government should insist that banks start lending again. This can be accomplished with government guarantee of the loans. Such guarantees would be for both the housing and automobile industries. LiNeBrEaK  In addition, first-time buyers of houses should get a $10,000 rebate from the government, and those buying hybrid vehicles a $5,000 rebate. Nothing less will get the economy back on track quickly. LiNeBrEaK  Paul Schoenbaum Williamsburg, Va., Jan. 10, 2009LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  I applaud Bob Herbert's column. If President-elect Barack Obama fails to achieve an aggressive program to sustain and expand employment, we are headed for a real domestic disaster. As he put it, we have an economic emergency.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Herbert makes the important point that unemployment (and underemployment) creates a vicious cycle, because those who are unemployed must draw on public benefits, including unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid and public assistance. Since the unemployed generally do not pay taxes, the public coffers become strained and depleted.LiNeBrEaK  One point he did not make, but is very important -- especially since Mr. Obama has already hinted that he may move to curtail Social Security benefits -- is that the unemployed (as well as those who are employed but poorly paid) and their potential employers do not contribute to the Social Security system, thus making that system less secure and providing more excuses for cutting benefits.LiNeBrEaK  What our country needs is a true full-employment policy, supported by government as employer of last resort if needed, where everyone who wants to work can get a decent job at a living wage. Such a pro-active policy would go a long way to fulfilling individuals' and families' lives as well as securing our promise as the one nation that Mr. Obama so eloquently called upon us to be.LiNeBrEaK  Marguerite Rosenthal Jamaica Plain, Mass., Jan. 12, 2009LiNeBrEaK  The writer is a member of the Executive Committee of National Jobs for All Coalition and professor emerita, School of Social Work, at Salem State College.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''The Confidence Surplus,'' by David Brooks, and ''The Obama Gap,'' by Paul Krugman (columns, Jan. 9):LiNeBrEaK  Yes, the economy is complex and the effects of government actions are unpredictable.

The New York Times 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   The New York Times on the Web	Energy Nominee Shifts His Stance  	Section ; Column 0; National Desk; Pg.   	958 words  	Physics met politics at the confirmation hearing Tuesday for Steven Chu, the Nobel laureate scientist chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to head the Department of Energy, and the physics bent a bit, as Dr. Chu backed away slightly from earlier statements he has made -- that gasoline prices should be higher, and that coal was his ''nightmare.'' LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu, whose last job was director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, answered an array of questions from the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources -- about his position on new nuclear reactors (yes, at least for a few plants), offshore drilling (only as part of an energy package) and new coal-burning power plants (a few, until we figure out a better way). He told the lawmakers that ''last year's rapid spike in oil and gasoline prices not only contributed to the recession we are now experiencing, it also put a huge strain on the budgets of families all across America.''  LiNeBrEaK  Last September, though, he told The Wall Street Journal, ''Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' At the hearing, responding to a question about that statement, he said, ''What the American family does not want is to pay an increasing fraction of their budget, their precious dollars, for energy costs, both in transportation and keeping their homes warm and lit.''LiNeBrEaK  The answer is efficiency, using less so that even if the price rises, the bill does not, he said. LiNeBrEaK  He also said that coal, which has a wide political constituency, would continue to be used, and that the trick was to convert it to electricity cleanly.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu, who is 60, got a friendly welcome from the committee, but really warmed up when Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, asked him how plants could be turned into substitutes for petroleum.LiNeBrEaK  ''Actually, now we're getting to science, I love this,'' he said, to laughter around the room. He said he had supervised research to figure out, ''How do you break those plants down into the kind of sugars these little critters, the yeast and bacteria, can actually use.'' Gene-altered bacteria have been developed to turn sugar into substitutes for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, he said. LiNeBrEaK  Several senators reiterated the idea that the Energy Department faced terrific scientific challenges, and that a Nobel physicist was the appropriate person to head it. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who introduced him to the committee, referred to him as ''one of the great brilliant thinkers of his generation.'' Around Washington, Dr. Chu draws wide approval for emphasizing energy efficiency and new technology as approaches to the problems of energy prices and global warming. LiNeBrEaK  But his science-based frankness sometimes contrasts with ordinary energy politics, which are often more centered on narrower economic interests.LiNeBrEaK  For example, in a presentation at Berkeley in April 2007, now preserved on YouTube, he declared, ''coal is my worst nightmare,'' words previous energy secretaries would be unlikely to utter.LiNeBrEaK  ''We have lots of fossil fuel,'' he said in that presentation. ''That's really both good and bad news. We won't run out of energy but there's enough carbon in the ground to really cook us.''LiNeBrEaK  And he has said frankly that some of the technologies that federal dollars are pursuing would be nice to have, but are not today ready for use, either because they are too expensive to be practical, or not demonstrated to be safe. In this category he puts sequestering the carbon dioxide from power plants, recycling nuclear fuel to reduce its volume and recover unused fuel, and making ethanol from cellulose, which is essentially woody wastes or non-crop plants. LiNeBrEaK  In the course of the hearing, the main mission of the department -- making, maintaining and dismantling nuclear weapons, and cleaning up from six decades of nuclear weapon production -- got intermittent mention. According to a report on nuclear weapons spending by Stephen I. Schwartz and sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment, the budget for nuclear weapons in 2008 was over $52 billion. Robert Alvarez, who was a policy advisor to the energy secretary in the Clinton administration, said in an interview that the department is spending about 11 times more money on nuclear weapons than on energy conservation. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu's plans for steps that would reduce consumption of oil and electricity may come at an inopportune moment, as consumption is falling anyway, taking pressure off the electric grid and other energy systems. The Energy Information Administraton, which analyzes data for the department, predicted on Tuesday that for 2009, electricity consumption would fall 0. 5 percent, and oil product consumption by 2 percent. Dr. Chu faces a variety of conflicting mandates. For example, he said that using more renewable energy was a national priority and thus would require a national electric grid. To help create such a grid, a 2005 law gives the department the authority to designate high-priority corridors, to overrule local objections to new power lines. But Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, complained that the department had designated his entire state, New Jersey, as part of a corridor. Mr. Chu promised to investigate. LiNeBrEaK  Another problem is nuclear waste. Dr. Chu repeatedly said that of the carbon-free power generation in this country, 70 percent was nuclear. But Mr. Obama has expressed deep skepticism about the plan to bury nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, the site near Las Vegas that the government has worked for 20 years to develop. A solution would have to be found, Dr. Chu said, but construction of new plants should resume now, after a hiatus of 30 years, even before the solution is developed.	http://www.nytimes.com  	NOBEL PRIZES (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); GASOLINE PRICES (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (90%); POLITICS (90%); PHYSICS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); AWARDS and PRIZES (89%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); POWER PLANTS (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (77%); GASOLINE MARKETS (77%); PRICE INCREASES (77%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (77%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (77%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (77%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (76%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (76%); LEGISLATORS (75%); APPROVALS (73%); JET FUEL (72%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (72%); DIESEL FUEL (72%); BACTERIA (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%)  	WALL STREET JOURNAL (55%)  		STEVEN CHU (94%); BARACK OBAMA (91%); BLANCHE LINCOLN (53%); DIANNE FEINSTEIN (51%)  	ARKANSAS, USA (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); EUROPE (76%)  	January 14, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The New York Times Company   	By MATTHEW L.

News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	'Green coal' to get a tryout: Charred wood shows promise as renewable option but challenges remain  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1185 words  	Jan. 13--North Carolina is about to become the nation's test case for what marketers call "green coal" -- wood that has been baked into charcoal.LiNeBrEaKIf successful, the experiment -- a partnership of sorts between Progress Energy, N.C. State University and an Asheville start-up -- could mark the end of the state's reliance on dirty coal.LiNeBrEaKBut the option of locally grown fuel is not without challenges and environmental concerns. Still, advocates of the process believe the technology is on the verge of a breakthrough.LiNeBrEaK"This is probably closer to reality than anything I have seen up to here," said NCSU professor Mike Boyette in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering. "We're moving in the direction where some portion of our energy will come from biomass." LiNeBrEaKThe process is not as simple as collecting dead branches from the forest floor. The wood has to be treated in an industrial oven until it turns to charcoal. It remains to be seen if the experimental ovens can mass-produce charred wood of a uniform quality that won't clog power plants sensitively calibrated to burn coal.LiNeBrEaKProgress Energy this year plans to test the idea by adding charred wood at its coal-fired Cape Fear power plant in the Chatham County community of Moncure. The wood will come from two sources: NCSU's agricultural extension service, which has been developing a wood baking technology; as well as from Integro Earth Fuels, a 2-year-old Asheville company that's betting on the increasing importance of wood as a clean energy source.LiNeBrEaKIn a state that depends on out-of-state coal for half its electricity, burning wood waste holds appeal because it's local, clean and renewable. When burned, wood releases significantly less sulphur and almost no mercury. And wood doesn't add to the atmospheric greenhouse gases that are believed to cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKCharred wood, a type of biomass, would be a major breakthrough because it can be pulverized into a fine powder for burning in existing power plants, potentially displacing a third of the coal in some plants, advocates say. By blending wood with coal, Progress wouldn't have to build a separate power plant for incinerating wood chips, thus eliminating a multimillion-dollar expense from the green energy equation.LiNeBrEaKProgress expects a state environmental permit as early as this month to burn up to 240 tons of the material, initially offsetting about 5 percent of the coal the Cape Fear plant would normally burn. The company is accumulating charred wood delivered for the past month from N.C. State University's agricultural extension program, which is producing small batches. Progress will run the test as as soon as it accumulates enough fuel, possibly this summer.LiNeBrEaKBurning wood to generate electricity would help Progress comply with state law requiring power companies to tap renewable resources.LiNeBrEaK"It has a lot of promise as a renewable option for us," said Grant Blume, Progress Energy's lead strategic engineer.LiNeBrEaKChallengesLiNeBrEaKDespite the early enthusiasm, many obstacles remain. The process of torrefaction is so experimental that it has only been tested in a power plant once, in the Netherlands in 2005, for a 24-hour period. Even if power plants can burn the fuel successfully, electric utilities won't sign long-term contracts for charred wood if they lack confidence they can count on steady supplies. Currently there are no commercial suppliers in the world.LiNeBrEaKBut that could soon change. Integro is developing an industrial-scale wood-baking apparatus, called a torrefaction reactor, in Person County, about 20 miles north of Durham. Integro plans to bake wood chips for one hour between 500 degrees and 535 degrees, drawing out more than 99 percent of the water and cooking away the bonding agents that reinforce wood tissue. Agri-Tech Producers in Columbia, S.C., is developing several competing facilities, including a torrefaction site that it plans to have in eastern North Carolina by 2010. Europeans also are advancing the technology: RWE Innogy, a German concern, last summer announced plans for a facility to be built this year in Europe.LiNeBrEaKIntegro expects to be in commercial production this fall, beginning by processing five tons of charred wood per hour, and operating around the clock. It would ramp up to 20 tons per hour by 2010. Integro has letters of intent from Progress Energy and two other potential customers in North Carolina, contingent on successful tests, but has not signed a contract yet to sell the fuel.LiNeBrEaKIntegro and others developing the technology will have to demonstrate that their torrefaction ovens can consistently produce fuel that rivals coal in quality. And the producers will need to depend on reliable sources for wood scraps from paper mills and forestry operations, without incurring cost overruns if there's a wood shortage or if quality suffers. As is, torrefied wood costs about 30 percent more than coal today, but the cost disparity could be erased if coal values surge as they did last summer.LiNeBrEaKIn its marketing materials, Integro refers to the charred wood as "green coal" because the fuel can be farmed or collected in the wild without dynamiting mountaintops. In Europe, RWE markets the fuel as "biocoal."LiNeBrEaK"It looks like coal, it acts like coal, but it's green," said Walt Dickinson, Integro's chief executive. "You can't grow coal, but you can grow trees."LiNeBrEaKRisky ventureLiNeBrEaKIntegro plans to obtain scrap pine and pulp wood from paper mills and forestry operations by collecting branches shaved off tree trunks and left on the forest floor. It would harvest wood within about 40 miles of its Person County facility.LiNeBrEaKDickinson acknowledged Integro is running a high risk in developing a facility that will cost about $16 million. If the torrefaction process fails the test and utilities balk, the company would fall back on making wood pellets for home heating and for small power plants that burn wood chips.LiNeBrEaKSuch power plants generate power in the state, mostly at paper mill operations that recycle their own scrap wood and pulp. But instead of wood charred under high temperatures, they use regular wood, a much less efficient source of fuel.LiNeBrEaKFarming wood for fuel raises its own set of issues. The benefits of reducing reliance on coal would be negated if natural habitats are destroyed to create single species tree farms, said Dee Eggers, a professor of environmental studies at UNC-Asheville. Every stray branch removed from the forest floor means that much organic material won't replenish the soil with nutrients. The forestry practices would have to be managed to minimize damage, she said.LiNeBrEaK"It's not purely an environmental positive," Eggers said.LiNeBrEaKjohn.murawski@newsobserver.com or 919-829-8932		COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); BIOMASS (89%); POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); ENGINEERING (75%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (75%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (62%)  				NORTH CAROLINA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 News and Observer   	John Murawski, The News and Observer, Raleigh, N.C.

Public Opinion (Chambersburg, Pennsylvania)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Borough of Chambersburg looks at using landfill gas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	559 words  	Jan. 13--CHAMBERSBURG -- Borough of Chambersburg officials are looking into trapping gases at one of the borough's landfills and using it as an alternative fueling source for the borough's electric plant. LiNeBrEaKBorough council on Monday approved performing a sensitivity analysis and study case on collecting raw landfill gas at the Scotland landfill north of the borough and piping it to the borough's power plant.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed $20 million project would collect the gas, refine it by removing other gases and deliver the gas through a 10-mile pipeline to the Orchard Park generation plant or into the borough's gas distribution system. The gas would then be used to fuel the borough's natural gas customers or to fuel power generation.LiNeBrEaKDavid Downes, president of Downes Associates Inc. Engineering and Management Consultants in Salisbury, Md., said in a report that over 20 years 559,315 British Thermal Units of landfill gas could be injected into the gas distribution system. The amount would equal about 58 percent of the borough's retail gas sales or 19. 5 percent of the municipality's power generation requirements.LiNeBrEaKDownes said the project would also have environmental benefits by trapping energy that would be wasted otherwise. He said the project would result in a reduction in greenhouse gases and could allow the borough to be energy independent. The project would also help the borough to keep prices low for electricity and natural gas customers.LiNeBrEaKAfter the study is complete, the borough would still have to finalize a gas purchase agreement, secure a right of way for the pipeline, select developers for the project and search for grants and alternative sources of funding. The project could take 18 to 24 months to get under way, and council President William McLaughlin said the borough has already been in negotiations with area municipalities and agencies about the project.LiNeBrEaK"I think that's a very doable timetable," McLaughlin said after the meeting.LiNeBrEaKMcLaughlin said borough officials have spoken with the Department of Environmental Protection, which has a keen interest in endeavors such as the gas project. McLaughlin said grant money should be available the project at the state level, if the borough is interested in pursuing the project.LiNeBrEaK"I'd like Chambersburg to be the national poster child for this type of project," McLaughlin said.LiNeBrEaKCouncil also presented an award to outgoing Electric Department Superintendent Richard Hamsher, who is retiring after 40 years of service. Hamsher was instrumental in leading the department through federal deregulation of electric providers, worked to sign two supply contracts for the borough with Detroit Edison and also directed the construction of the Orchard Park generation station and Commerce Street Substation.LiNeBrEaK"The borough of Chambersburg has benefited from your service," McLaughlin said.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   Metro Edition	COAL BELONGS TO YESTERYEARS  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B7  	793 words  	The recent coal ash sludge disaster in Kingsport, Tenn., underscores the need for change in the way electricity is generated in the Southeast. In the Dec. 23 incident, more than 1 billion gallons of toxic, heavy-metal-laden liquid sludge were dumped directly into rivers that supply drinking water to millions of people. It is increasingly obvious that coal, the longtime staple of our energy diet, is a dinosaur.LiNeBrEaKLet us briefly enumerate coal's shortcomings. It is a non-renewable product; we'll eventually run out. The effects of its extraction from the ground are impossibly damaging and difficult to convey without seeing it in person, but mountain-top removal is an accurate description. The byproducts of its combustion are asthma-inducing gases, which lead to the orange-alert and red-alert summer days when children and elderly are advised to stay indoors. And, let's see . . . I seem to be forgetting one. Oh, yeah, the carbon thing. Burning coal is one of the primary sources of greenhouse gases leading to global warming. LiNeBrEaKThis is all before coal's final legacy, the leftover coal sludge, is dumped into giant holding pits where it sits . . . forever. Or, until it escapes into the waterways that it inevitably sits beside.LiNeBrEaKThink this spill is an isolated incident? In 1972, a breach of a sludge impoundment at a mining operation in West Virginia killed 118 people. In 2000, a coal-sludge levee broke in Marin County, Ky., and spilled 300 million gallons in what is widely considered the worst environmental disaster in the Southeastern United States. Until Dec. 23, when the TVA's Harriman plant in Kingsport managed to make the 2000 spill look small.LiNeBrEaKFolks, we can do better. We must do better. Other energy sources are gaining traction. Progressive states have enacted temporary market-support mechanisms that make wind and solar viable short-term options, and a slam dunk when long-term financials are considered.LiNeBrEaKRegrettably, Virginia lags behind in solar production incentives that drive implementation in many states, including our southern neighbor, North Carolina, which is getting in on the act. Leaders in these states have seen the writing on the wall, having proclaimed the future must belong to the sun and the wind. And utilities in these vanguard states are working with local and state governments to provide the framework for the clean energy future.LiNeBrEaKOur local electric provider, Appalachian Power, appears to stand in the way of progress. Think I'm speaking out of turn? Fair enough; the inner workings of large-scale energy utilities might be above my pay grade. But here's a telling sign. Try a search for "net metering" on the Web sites of large utilities in progressive states like California (Pacific Gas and Electric) and North Carolina (Duke Energy). On any of the hundreds of links, you'll quickly learn that net metering is the ability to sell excess generated power from a solar installation back to a utility. Solar owners like to call it "spinning the power meter backward." You'll also learn how to make money off of your solar installation. Now do the same search on Apco's Web site. Voila. Nothing.LiNeBrEaKFortunately, 2008 saw a gathering of momentum in the Roanoke Valley that served to counter the immobility of the electric utility and Virginia's state government. Organizations like the Roanoke Valley Cool Cities Coalition had a banner year attracting new affiliates and implementing progressive programs to promote energy conservation. They also furthered their goal of educating the public about the impact of fossil-fuel usage and the promise of renewable energy sources.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, Roanoke took great strides in 2008. Led by Councilwoman Gwen Mason and a slate of forward-thinking leaders, the city's Clean and Green initiative partnered with local business heavyweights. In November, the Clean and Green Business Coalition announced the notably aggressive goal of a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions over the next five years.LiNeBrEaKLocal residents are choosing to act in the green spirit as well. Neighborhood organizations like the Greater Raleigh Court Civic League, itself a RVCCC affiliate, went to work building greenways and making plans for future recycling campaigns and other citizen initiatives. The group invited Mason to its January meeting to make plans for more good work in the new year.LiNeBrEaKSo, in 2009, there's reason for optimism. Hopefully, it's contagious, and state legislators will follow the lead of our neighbor states on renewable energy. And, hopefully, our electric utility will join in the growing recognition that coal, like the dinosaur, is on its way to extinction.LiNeBrEaKChad BrabyLiNeBrEaKBraby, of Roanoke, is vice president of the Greater Raleigh Court Civic League and regional manager for a general contractor.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	Record heat - and maybe the driest January;  BAY AREA 	Metro; Pg. B1  	640 words  	High-temperature records fell like imaginary raindrops in the Bay Area on Monday, among the warmest mid-January days ever. LiNeBrEaKIt's also shaping up to be one of the driest Januarys ever - if not the driest. There's been almost no rain this month, and none is in sight, the National Weather Service says.LiNeBrEaKThe thermometer hit 74 in downtown San Francisco, breaking the old record for Jan. 12 of 67, set in 1948. LiNeBrEaK"We broke the records pretty much everywhere," said weather service meteorologist Brian Tentinger. "Breaking them wasn't hard. This wasn't extreme heat, but it was very abnormal for January."LiNeBrEaKThe heat marks got their biggest thumping in Santa Rosa, where it was 84 degrees. The old mark was 66, set in 1967.LiNeBrEaKThe 77 degrees recorded at Oakland International Airport made it the warmest January day ever at that location. The old mark was 75, set on Jan. 8, 1962. Downtown Oakland merely set a record for the date at 76 degrees, 11 degrees better than the old mark from 1980.LiNeBrEaK In San Rafael, it was 75, breaking the mark of 68, set in 1948. In San Jose, it was 77, six degrees warmer than 1948's record.LiNeBrEaKHeat records also fell in Kentfield 74, besting the 66 recorded in 1918, Moffett Field 72, beating the 65 set in 1980 and Gilroy 73, nudging out the 72 set in 1959.LiNeBrEaK The unseasonably warm weather is expected to continue, although the temperatures could decline a few degrees in the North Bay, Tentinger said. That means the highest January temperature ever in San Francisco - 79 degrees - may be safe. LiNeBrEaKLeone Evans, 89, of Oakland didn't need a thermometer to tell her that it was "absolutely gorgeous."LiNeBrEaKEvans left her home state of Oregon - and its rainy weather - in the 1940s and vowed never to return. She hasn't.LiNeBrEaK "We have the most beautiful weather in the world," Evans proclaimed as she took a breather on a bench at Snow Park near Lake Merritt. LiNeBrEaK Bob Benjamin of the National Weather Service said the main reason it's so warm is "the wind component" - strong gusts coming off the land, the reverse of the Bay Area's normal, cooler onshore flow. The strongest gust atop Mount Diablo on Monday morning was 78 mph, and winds elsewhere in the North and East Bay hills exceeded 50 mph.LiNeBrEaKThe warm weather is the result of a fairly strong high-pressure system that is bumping storms far to the north, Benjamin said. It's a pattern that has been entrenched most of the fall and winter, an unwelcome development for a state coming off two consecutive years of below-average rainfall. LiNeBrEaKSince the start of the rain year July 1, rainfall in San Francisco has totaled just 56 percent of average. It's been so dry since New Year's Day that the National Weather Service is starting to keep an eye on whether this will be the driest January ever in the Bay Area.LiNeBrEaKThe warm weather is not doing the Sierra snowpack any favors. To state water officials, good weather is bad and bad weather is good.LiNeBrEaKThe snowpack is about 67 percent of normal, said Matt Notley, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources. That figure will go down in light of the next several days of predicted clear skies.LiNeBrEaK"We're very concerned we're experiencing another dry winter," Notley said. "Even an average year this year would not bring us out of drought."LiNeBrEaK The driest January on record in San Francisco was in 1920, when 0. 26 of an inch of rain fell. So far this January, the city is 0. 02 of an inch short of that.LiNeBrEaKIn Oakland, the driest January was in 1976, during the first of two straight bone-dry years when mandatory rationing was the norm in Northern California and lawns by the thousands went unwatered.LiNeBrEaK The January total that year was 0. 31 of an inch; so far this January, Oakland has gotten 0. 28.LiNeBrEaK"We're very concerned we're experiencing another dry winter.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	Stanford's green energy windfall;  Cheaper solar cells, cutting global warming are goals of $100 million research institute 	Main News; Pg. A1  	723 words  	Stanford University will create a $100 million energy research institute that will develop cheaper solar cells, technologies that use electricity more efficiently and ways to prevent the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThe new Precourt Institute for Energy will bring together Stanford researchers from various departments who already are developing better solar cells or new ways to make fuel. The financing, most of it from three alumni, also will allow the school to tackle more projects, hire more faculty and train more students interested in the field. LiNeBrEaK"This is a complex and long-term undertaking that will engage the minds of hundreds of faculty and thousands of students," said Stanford President John Hennessy. "And our success will impact millions, even billions, of lives across the planet."  LiNeBrEaKThe institute also will strengthen the Bay Area's lead in the race to develop sources of power that won't contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKFor several years, Bay Area academic institutions have been devoting more of their money and intellectual might toward alternative energy, hunting for ways to power homes and cars without spewing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKUC Berkeley has its Energy Biosciences Institute, founded nearly two years ago with $500 million from oil giant BP. That effort also includes Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, whose researchers have been at the forefront of using micro-organisms to produce fuel. LiNeBrEaKStanford already has a $225 million Global Climate and Energy Project funded by Exxon Mobil, General Electric, Toyota and oilfield services company Schlumberger. The school also hosts the Precourt Center for Energy Efficiency. Both the climate project and the efficiency center will become part of the new Precourt Institute for Energy.LiNeBrEaK The presence of so much energy research has, in turn, helped spawn green-technology startup companies throughout the Bay Area, just as information technology research at the area's schools helped create hundreds of software, hardware and Internet companies.LiNeBrEaKThe new institute takes its name from Stanford alumnus Jay Precourt, who donated $50 million for the project. Precourt studied petroleum engineering at Stanford before pursuing a career in the oil and natural gas business with such companies as Hamilton Oil and Tejas Gas Corp. LiNeBrEaK"I'm quite concerned, having been in the energy business my whole life, with the fact that we are importing energy from insecure, unreliable sources who are, in many cases, not friends of the United States," Precourt said in a release.LiNeBrEaKUC Berkeley faced criticism for accepting an oil company's money and help with its biosciences institute. Many Berkeley students and faculty questioned whether BP's participation would undermine the goal of finding replacements for petroleum. Hennessy said that shouldn't be a concern with the Precourt Institute.LiNeBrEaK"The Precourt gift is a gift to the university, and the university will decide how to use it," Hennessy said. He also praised Precourt for wanting the school to take such a wide-ranging approach to energy issues.LiNeBrEaK"It's the kind of vision we need more of in this country," Hennessy said.LiNeBrEaKAn additional $40 million for the Institute came from Stanford trustee Thomas Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor. Steyer is the founder and a managing partner of Farallon Capital Management as well as a managing director of the Hellman and Friedman private equity firm. Both Steyer and Taylor are Stanford alumni.LiNeBrEaKIn their honor, the institute will include a center devoted to renewable power, called the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy.LiNeBrEaKThe full $100 million in donations will help Stanford add as many as eight faculty positions and 20 graduate student fellowships. If private donors hadn't come forward, adding that many positions probably would have taken a decade, Hennessy said.LiNeBrEaKLynn Orr, who had been director of the school's global climate project, will head the institute. Stanford will now have more money to devote to such research projects as using nanomaterials to make better solar cells, Orr said. And the school's many alternative energy researchers will be encouraged to collaborate with people outside their own departments. LiNeBrEaK"The energy challenge is a big and important one," Orr said, "but it is just the sort of challenge Stanford students and faculty should tackle with enthusiasm."

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Stanford announces $100 million energy institute  	COMMUNITIES; Peninsula; News; Local  	512 words  	Stanford University has received $100 million to create a new energy institute where scholars can study everything from solar cells to energy markets and economics.LiNeBrEaKThe institute will expand Stanford's role in energy research and national energy policy. It will consolidate Stanford's existing energy-focused efforts onto one site   and allow the hiring of new faculty, support additional graduate students and offer seed money for major research projects. LiNeBrEaKThe donations came from three alumni who said they were motivated by the desire to protect the environment from greenhouse gases, improve energy efficiency and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKOil and gas executive Jay Precourt donated $50 million to create what will be called the Precourt Institute for Energy. Farallon Capital Management partner Thomas Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, gave $40 million to create a new research center within that institute, the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. The final $10 million came from other donors.LiNeBrEaK"These generous gifts will help us overcome the enormous challenges that we are facing in energy research," Stanford President John Hennessy said at a Monday news conference. "It will create an independent institute for researchers on campus and around the world."LiNeBrEaKWhile commending the role that Silicon Valley has played in supporting alternative energy companies, "it needs some new discoveries," Hennessy said. "We need to be working on new technologies."LiNeBrEaKThe new institute will be directed by Lynn Orr, professor of energy resources engineering and director of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project. He plans to pull together 136 faculty members in 21 departments to create interdisciplinary projects.LiNeBrEaKOrr will start recruiting new professors almost immediately, he said. He will also encourage graduate students to apply for the 20 new fellowships available at the institute.LiNeBrEaKAn even larger $500 million energy institute supports work at the University of California-Berkeley, but it is controversial because it's supported by international energy company BP and industry scientists collaborate on research.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked about Stanford donor Precourt's r&eacute;sum&eacute;, Hennessy said the new program is an "independent institute."LiNeBrEaKStanford's new gifts are among the largest ever received by the university to support academic and research programs, Hennessy said. Because of the downturn in the economy and Stanford's shrinking endowment, it could have taken a decade to create the program using existing funds, he said.LiNeBrEaKOther recent gifts from alumni include a $75 million pledge in 2007 by Jerry Yang, co-founder and a director of the Internet search engine Yahoo and his wife, Akiko Yamazaki. Of that, $50 million was used to build the Environment and Energy Building, which will house the new Precourt Institute for Energy. In 2006, Stanford University trustee Ward Woods and his wife, Priscilla, committed $30 million for what is now named the Woods Institute for the Environment. The energy institute will work in tandem with Woods' environmental researchers.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Santa Clara County has second-highest emissions  	COMMUNITIES; News  	517 words  	The Bay Area Air Quality Management District recently released a source inventory of Bay Area greenhouse gas emissions, and the numbers show that Santa Clara County is doing its share of releasing harmful chemicals into the environment. LiNeBrEaKThe district's jurisdiction includes the counties of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo and Napa, along with portions of Solano and Sonoma counties.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the district's report, which was released in December, Santa Clara County emits about 18. 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the air, second only to Contra Costa County, which emits 32 million metric tons yearly. Carbon dioxide "is released into the atmosphere when solid waste, fossil fuels and wood products are burned," the report states.LiNeBrEaKThe increased concentration of gases such as carbon dioxide is disturbing the balance of the flow of natural energy, and carbon dioxide is the "leading cause of global warming," the report states.LiNeBrEaKThe district states its mission is to improve air quality to protect the public's health and the environment.LiNeBrEaK"The information contained in this report is critical to accomplishing the air district's mission," wrote district planning director Henry Hilken in a press release. "The more information we put in the public's hands, the better they will be able to make clean air choices that will help the Bay Area reduce its greenhouse gas impact."LiNeBrEaKThe report also states that most of the county's greenhouse gas emissions, about 40 percent, can be traced to transportation, including small cars, trucks and buses. Another 20 percent can be connected to the industrial and commercial sector of the county.LiNeBrEaKThe Bay Area has seen about a 1 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions yearly, said Aaron Richardson, spokesman for the district. It may not all be bad news, Richardson added, since many programs have been initiated recently by local governments and organizations to stem increasing emissions.LiNeBrEaK"We just may not be seeing the results of what's been put into place," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe numbers released by the district, however, do not include the city of Saratoga. The city has been working with the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, officially known as ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, since last February, administrative analyst Crystal Morrow said.LiNeBrEaKFounded in 1990, ICLEI is an international association of local governments and organizations that works to promote sustainability, its website states.LiNeBrEaK"We have been diligently working with ICLEI to compile our baseline greenhouse gas emissions inventory," wrote assistant city manager Barbara Powell in an e-mail, adding that the numbers will include emissions data related to city-owned buildings, vehicles and equipment.LiNeBrEaKPowell stated that city staff and members from ICLEI are "currently in the process of solidifying emissions information related to the collection and management of city government-related waste."LiNeBrEaKIf everything goes according to plan, the city's emission inventory would be completed by the end of the month, Powell wrote.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   SECOND EDITION	Initiative strives to improve agriculture  	BUSINESS; Pg. C1  	558 words  	American agriculture uses fewer resources to produce more food, but as farmers scramble to meet growing global demand in coming years, agriculture could take a greater toll on waterways, soil and climate, according to a report released Monday. LiNeBrEaKThe report, called "Field to Market," is part of an initiative to provide food producers with a better way to measure their impact on natural resources. It was put together by the Keystone Center, a Colorado-based not-for-profit that tries to come up with policy solutions for global problems.LiNeBrEaKSeveral organizations, from big agribusiness to conservation groups, contributed to the effort. Overall, they concluded that the production of corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat in the United States was becoming less harmful to the environment. Fertilizer, land, energy and water use has slowed from 1987 to 2007, while production increased, largely because of the emergence of new technologies, the report stated.LiNeBrEaKTo prepare the report, the Keystone Center called on a diverse group of stakeholders - from food industry giants, such as Coca-Cola and Cargill, to conservation groups, such as The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund. Monsanto and the National Corn Growers Association, both based in the St. Louis area, were among the members.LiNeBrEaKThe group first got together about two years ago to address a looming global challenge. In order to feed itself, the world's agriculture production will need to double by 2050. At the same time, food production will need to mitigate its environmental impact, including climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Agriculture is the dominant land use on Earth. An estimate in 2005 said that crop- and pastureland takes up a quarter of the Earth's surface," said Michael Reuter of The Nature Conservancy. "We have to look at this very complex situation from a lot of perspectives."LiNeBrEaKThe report issued Monday was described as a first step toward addressing the challenge of agricultural sustainability to evaluate productivity versus resource use. The authors studied government data and came up with measurements. The next step, they say, will be to look at the impact American agriculture has on water quality and biodiversity - a much more complicated task.LiNeBrEaKUltimately, the group's goal is to develop a "Sustainability Index" that will help food producers along the food chain measure sustainability and trends over time.LiNeBrEaK"We're starting to develop tools that a farm can use to see how their efficiencies compare to other farmers," said Michael Doane of Monsanto, a member of the Keystone group. "We believe the comparisons will make them want to make changes."LiNeBrEaKProponents of a more diversified approach to sustainable agriculture say the group has overemphasized the role technology has played in improving the sustainability of the American farm.LiNeBrEaKFerd Hoefner, policy director of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, said the report's emphasis on four commodities and on technology skews the picture.LiNeBrEaK"They're looking at the technological fixes that have improved some resource indicators, rather than the revolution of a system that we need to farm in concert with the environment," Hoefner said.LiNeBrEaKHoefner also noted that his group was not part of the report. "They don't have the voice of the farmer represented," he said. "At least not the sustainable agriculture farmer we present."

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   SECOND EDITION	Law creates customers for plant Coal-Fueled Power Project in Illinois  	BUSINESS; Pg. C1  	442 words  	A next-generation coal-fueled power plant in central Illinois got a boost Monday when impeached Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich signed a bill that will enable work on the project to advance. LiNeBrEaKDevelopers of the project near Taylorville, Ill., have been in a holding pattern for more than a year, unable to move forward without long-term commitments to sell the plant's output. Illinois utilities can't enter such contracts under a 1997 law that deregulated the state's electric market.LiNeBrEaKLegislation signed Monday requires electric utilities including Ameren to enter into 30-year contracts to buy electricity as long as the impact on rates isn't too great.LiNeBrEaK"We now have the momentum that we and the state need to get this vital project built and operational," said Bart Ford, vice president of Omaha, Neb.-based Tenaska, the managing partner of the group building the project.LiNeBrEaKThe 500-megawatt plant would be big enough to power about 500,000 homes. It is expected to be completed by 2014 and estimated to cost $3. 5 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe project promises to create mining and construction jobs as well as help limit emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most closely linked with global warming. It is been backed by a broad coalition of interests, including environmental groups, organized labor and Illinois Coal Association.LiNeBrEaKInstead of burning coal, the plant would convert coal to methane, which will be use to generate electricity. Developers say the plant will initially capture 55 to 60 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, which would be injected into underground rock formations or piped to the Gulf Coast for oil recovery.LiNeBrEaKJohn Thompson, director of the Coal Transition Project for the Boston-based Clean Air Task force, said the Illinois law requires emissions from coal-fueled plants to be as low as those from plants that run on natural gas.LiNeBrEaK"This very tough standard should become the national model," said Thompson, who works in Carbondale, Ill.LiNeBrEaKThe state will provide up to $18 million for planning and updated cost studies required before construction begins. The Legislature could still block the project if cost estimates rise too much.LiNeBrEaK"We have the burden of going back to the General Assembly and showing them that the cost is reasonable," Ford said.LiNeBrEaKThe plant will be subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as well as the Illinois Commerce Commission.LiNeBrEaKThe bill caps the amount of any potential rate increase at 2 percent a year, and no increase can be passed through to customers until the plant begins operation. If the impact on rates is greater, utilities can reduce the amount of electricity they buy from Taylorville.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   MORRIS EDITION	Towns face having no say in power line  	NEW JERSEY; Pg. 017  	490 words  	PSEandG applied to the state Board of Public Utilities yesterday for permission to build a 45-mile, $750 million high-voltage power line that would cut through North Jersey, bypassing a potential process that would require approvals from each of the 15 towns affected by the project. LiNeBrEaKThe company's decision to apply directly to the BPU to build the Susquehanna-Roseland power line, which it says is required to prevent overloads and maintain reliability of the power grid, was criticized by opponents as an attempt to avoid local public scrutiny.LiNeBrEaK"PSEandG is going behind the backs of the communities affected by the power lines," said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. He urged the BPU to reject the plan.LiNeBrEaK"These power lines will not only cut an ugly scar across New Jersey but will bring dirty coal power into our state along with more pollution and undermine our efforts to combat climate change," he argued.LiNeBrEaKBut company officials dismissed that contention, saying there is an obvious need for a better and more reliable power system, with an eye on future needs.LiNeBrEaK"The line is needed because demand for electricity in our area has risen substantially in recent years and is expected to continue to grow over the long term despite the current economic slowdown and conservation efforts," PSEandG President Ralph LaRossa said in a statement last night.LiNeBrEaKBoard of Public Utilities spokesman Doyal Siddell said the application is under initial review by agency staff, and the process will include public hearings, which have not yet been scheduled. BPU has one year to make a decision, he said.LiNeBrEaKIf there is no decision in that time, PSEandG may seek approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Siddell added.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed 500-kilovolt line would run from Hardwick in Warren County, through Sussex and Morris counties, to Roseland in Essex County. The company said the line has been mandated by PJM Interconnection, an organization that oversees the regional power grid in 13 states, and will prevent electrical overloads and blackouts in northern New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKThe project includes installing 180- to 190-foot towers, about twice the height of what is along the route now, to accommodate the existing 230-kilovolt line and the new 500-kilovolt one.LiNeBrEaKLocal officials and environmentalists criticized the power-line plan on several fronts, charging it presents health hazards, will hinder renewable energy efforts and harm property values. But PSEandG said no direct link has been established between power lines and health issues, and contends the lines will be designed to "cancel out" magnetic fields between the 230- and 500-kilovolt lines.LiNeBrEaKPSEandG said it applied to the BPU to deal with the process in "one comprehensive proceeding." But some local officials, including East Hanover Mayor Joseph Pannullo and Byram Councilman Scott Olson, charged the company with making it more difficult for opponents to voice concerns.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Big Stone II pushes clean-energy alternative  	BUSINESS  	542 words  	Can an offer of clean-energy technology seal the deal for Big Stone II?LiNeBrEaKA group of rural utilities hoping to gain approval for high-voltage power lines from the proposed coal-fired power plant in South Dakota on Tuesday offered to equip the plant with such technology at a hearing before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. LiNeBrEaKThe offer was the latest effort by utilities led by Otter Tail Power of Fergus Falls, Minn., to support the proposed Big Stone II power plant in Milbank, S.D. The matter has been before the PUC for more than three years.LiNeBrEaKA St. Paul hearing room packed with attorneys, environmentalists and building and construction union officials listened to what essentially were the closing arguments in a long-running trial. The plant now is estimated to cost between $1. 4 billion and $1. 5 billion if it is built by 2015 and would provide 650 construction jobs, though most of them would go to South Dakota.LiNeBrEaKThe commission is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to allow high-voltage transmission lines to be built from the South Dakota plant to central Minnesota, where nearly half of its proposed 500 megawatts to 580 megawatts of electricity would be consumed.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the project has been approved in South Dakota, it would die if the Minnesota PUC votes down the transmission lines. The utilities say they need the coal-fired plant to satisfy the region's demand for electricity, which they say will exceed regional capacity beginning in 2013.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists worry that carbon dioxide emissions from the plant will contribute to global warming. That could cost ratepayers a lot more than renewable energy like wind power if, as expected, the incoming Obama administration levies a cost on carbon emissions to discourage the use of fossil fuels in energy production.LiNeBrEaKUnder the latest proposal by the utilities, however, Big Stone II could be built as an "ultra-supercritical coal plant," meaning it would burn hotter and more efficiently than a conventional supercritical plant, using less coal and emitting fewer emissions, said Mark Rolfes, the plant's project manager.LiNeBrEaKThe plant also could be built with extra space for "clean coal technology" that could be installed later, proponents said. Such equipment could trap carbon dioxide and send it in a pipe to oil fields in North Dakota or Canada. It could then be pumped underground and used to push up trapped oil, Otter Tail Power CEO Chuck McFarland said.LiNeBrEaK"It would be the hybrid car of power plants," Big Stone II attorney Todd Guerrero told the five commissioners.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists dismissed the claims, saying ultra-supercritical technology wouldn't dent the 4 million tons of CO2 the plant is expected to produce annually.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal to capture carbon dioxide is meaningless since Big Stone II backers don't know when that technology might be feasible, said attorney Beth Goodpaster, of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.LiNeBrEaKCommissioners expressed concern about how to minimize the risk of later rate hikes related to the cost of building and operating Big Stone II. They asked for the Office of Energy Security to present new ideas Thursday on how to divide the risk between consumers and the utilities.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Initiative strives to improve agriculture  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	630 words  	Jan. 13--American agriculture uses fewer resources to produce more food, but as farmers scramble to meet growing global demand in coming years, agriculture could take a greater toll on waterways, soil and climate, according to a report released Monday.LiNeBrEaKThe report, called "Field to Market," is part of an initiative to provide food producers with a better way to measure their impact on natural resources. It was put together by the Keystone Center, a Colorado-based not-for-profit that tries to come up with policy solutions for global problems. LiNeBrEaKSeveral organizations, from big agribusiness to conservation groups, contributed to the effort. Overall, they concluded that the production of corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat in the United States was becoming less harmful to the environment. Fertilizer, land, energy and water use has slowed from 1987 to 2007, while production increased, largely because of the emergence of new technologies, the report stated.LiNeBrEaKTo prepare the report, the Keystone Center called on a diverse group of stakeholders -- from food industry giants, such as Coca-Cola and Cargill, to conservation groups, such as The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund. Monsanto and the National Corn Growers Association, both based in the St. Louis area, were among the members.LiNeBrEaKThe group first got together about two years ago to address a looming global challenge. In order to feed itself, the world's agriculture production will need to double by 2050. At the same time, food production will need to mitigate its environmental impact, including climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Agriculture is the dominant land use on Earth. An estimate in 2005 said that crop- and pastureland takes up a quarter of the Earth's surface," said Michael Reuter of The Nature Conservancy. "We have to look at this very complex situation from a lot of perspectives."LiNeBrEaKThe report issued Monday was described as a first step toward addressing the challenge of agricultural sustainability to evaluate productivity versus resource use. The authors studied government data and came up with measurements. The next step, they say, will be to look at the impact American agriculture has on water quality and biodiversity -- a much more complicated task.LiNeBrEaKUltimately, the group's goal is to develop a "Sustainability Index" that will help food producers along the food chain measure sustainability and trends over time.LiNeBrEaK"We're starting to develop tools that a farm can use to see how their efficiencies compare to other farmers," said Michael Doane of Monsanto, a member of the Keystone group. "We believe the comparisons will make them want to make changes."LiNeBrEaKProponents of a more diversified approach to sustainable agriculture say the group has overemphasized the role technology has played in improving the sustainability of the American farm.LiNeBrEaKFerd Hoefner, policy director of the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, said the report's emphasis on four commodities and on technology skews the picture.LiNeBrEaK"They're looking at the technological fixes that have improved some resource indicators, rather than the revolution of a system that we need to farm in concert with the environment," Hoefner said.LiNeBrEaKHoefner also noted that his group was not part of the report. "They don't have the voice of the farmer represented," he said. "At least not the sustainable agriculture farmer we present."

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Report: Ice Age about to freeze out global warming: The historical record suggests that the current 12,000-year warming trend is about to be replaced by a 100,000 year ice age.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	480 words  	Jan. 13--Earth is "on the brink of entering another Ice Age" that will last for the next 100,000 years, reports the Russian Pravda Online newspaper. LiNeBrEaKBased on a "large and compelling body of evidence from within the field of climate science," Pravda reports this week, "many sources of data which provide our knowledge base of long-term climate change" indicate that the current 12,000-year-long warming trend is coming to an end.LiNeBrEaKPravda points to three astronomical "Milankovich cycles" for the coming cool-down:LiNeBrEaK-- The tilt of the Earth, which varies over a 41,000-year period.LiNeBrEaK-- The shape of the Earth's orbit, which changes over a period of 100,000 years, "separated by intervening warm interglacials, each lasting about 12,000 years."LiNeBrEaK-- The Precession of the Equinoxes, also known as the earth's "wobble," which gradually rotates the direction of the earth's axis over a period of 26,000 years.LiNeBrEaKThese cycles, Pravda explains, each affect "the amount of solar radiation which reaches the Earth [and] act together to produce the cycle of cold Ice Age maximums."LiNeBrEaKSince the late 1970s, the Milankovich theory has remained the predominant explanation to account for Ice Age causation among climate scientists. Pravda then went on to outline the widespread campaign to counter so-called global warming and the prevailing thought that human activity is dangerously warming the planet.LiNeBrEaK"The main flaw" in the thinking behind global warming, Pravda says, "is that its proponents focus on evidence from only the past 1,000 years at most, while ignoring the evidence from the past million years -- evidence which is essential for a true understanding of climatology."LiNeBrEaKThe data provide a "more credible explanation for the recent global temperature spike, based on the natural cycle of Ice Age maximums and interglacials."LiNeBrEaKPravda predicts that the Earth is "near to the end of a warm interglacial, and the Earth is now due to enter the next Ice Age. If we are lucky, we may have a few years to prepare for it. The Ice Age will return, as it always has, in its regular and natural cycle, with or without any influence from the effects" of global warming.LiNeBrEaKPravda was a leading newspaper of the Soviet Union and an official organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party between 1912 and 1991. After the paper was closed in 1991 by government decree, many of the staff founded a new paper with the same name. Pravda Online is run by former Pravda newspaper employees.LiNeBrEaK--PAUL WALSH		CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); TRENDS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); WEATHER (90%); ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (89%); ASTRONOMY and SPACE (77%); HISTORY (68%); POLITICAL PARTIES (64%)  				MINNEAPOLIS, MN, USA (74%) EARTH (94%); MINNESOTA, USA (74%) RUSSIA (88%); UNITED STATES (74%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Star Tribune   	Paul Walsh, Star Tribune, Minneapolis  			Environment/Recycling/Waste  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090113-MS-Report-Ice-Age-about-to-freeze-out-global-warming-0113  	MS  									
St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	BUSH'S LASTING GIFT: BIG OCEAN RESERVE  	NATIONAL; TIMES EDITORIALS; Pg. 6A  	350 words  	President Bush has made history by establishing the largest marine reserve ever created, designating three remote Pacific Ocean areas as national monuments. The protected areas, encompassing 195,280 square miles, include the Mariana Trench, the world's deepest canyon, and other mostly uninhabited atolls and reefs near American Samoa and the equator. Although Bush's overall environmental record leaves much to be desired, this is a rare bright spot that will leave a lasting imprint. LiNeBrEaKThe new reserve, which includes mountains, corals and a chain of 21 underwater volcanoes, is one of the most pristine places on Earth. It will forever protect hundreds of endangered and rare species of birds, fish, especially some sharks, and other marine life. Commercial fishing, mining and other threatening activities will be barred inside the reserve. U.S. naval ships and other approved maritime operations will not be inhibited.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say Bush's move will have lasting global impact. "If we can keep that area untouched," said Diane Regas of the Environmental Defense Fund, "it will provide an unparalleled scientific resource and a huge investment in improving the planet's resilience to climate change."LiNeBrEaKNot everyone, especially islanders near the designated tracts, likes the move. They argue that, among other limits, it takes away fishing rights and restricts plans for economic development. They may have good arguments, but two years of scientific study shows that the global benefits of the protected tract far outweigh the drawbacks.LiNeBrEaKThis time, Bush did a tremendously positive thing for the environment by signing an executive order to protect an enormous area in the Pacific. Perhaps it could have been even larger, and the restrictions could have been tougher. It also does not make up for his many wrong-headed policies that crippled endangered animal and plant protections, stymied climate change initiatives and handed over public land for oil and gas exploration. But it is a foresighted gift to the world during Bush's final days in office, and all it took was the stroke of his pen.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reduced its forecast by 3-million boxes compared to last month's estimate, a 2 percent decrease. That will leave 162-million boxes produced in Florida this season. Each box weighs about 90 pounds. More than 170-million boxes were harvested during the last growing season, which stretches from October to July. LiNeBrEaKFederal regulators are asking financial institutions to monitor their use of government money received under the $700-billion rescue plan and other support. Banks and other financial institutions should track how the federal money or guarantees they received helped them boost "prudent lending" and efforts to help at-risk borrowers avoid foreclosures, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Monday in a directive.LiNeBrEaKThe Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge to halt the integration of Wild Oats and Whole Foods Market as part of an ongoing legal battle over the 2007 deal that combined the two natural grocery chains. The FTC wants a U.S. District Court judge to force Whole Foods to stop any integration activities while one of multiple disputes over its acquisition of Wild Oats is handled in court.

If one were to ask the Trib to honestly name the three most liberally biased, anti-Bush, anti-Republican newspapers in the world, the answer would be The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. Their bias is obviously reflected in the article, which, as a result, is filled with inaccuracies and exaggerations. They are too numerous to even begin to address.LiNeBrEaKNo, this was no fair and balanced effort; this was a hatchet job on Bush.

Times-News (Twin Falls, Idaho)  	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Salmon River Canal shareholders get water update  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	564 words  	Jan. 13--The good news, said Ron Abramovich, is the Salmon Falls Basin had about 119 percent of its usual snowpack on Friday.LiNeBrEaKThe bad, the federal water supply specialist said, is that Mother Nature is going to start chipping away at that -- 1 to 2 percent a day for every day of sunshine until a possible storm arrives Jan. 21 or 23.LiNeBrEaKAnd that's just January. It's not entirely clear how the rest of the winter will play out for the shareholders of the Salmon River Canal Company, but they might be smart to expect an irrigation supply similar to what they got this year, he said. LiNeBrEaKAbramovich, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, gave canal company members their first water update of 2009 at the company's annual meeting Monday in Hollister. Pointing them to a series of graphs and tables he brought along, he said there's a 70 percent chance that Salmon Falls Reservoir will provide at least 73 percent of an adequate water supply for the farmers who rely on it.LiNeBrEaKIt doesn't help that unlike some other parts of the state, where reservoirs are trending higher than the past year, Salmon Falls Reservoir is down from 27,000 acre-feet to 16,000 acre-feet. It's the result of a difficult and late water year that posed a challenge for the company and drained much of the reservoir, said Karl Joslin, president of the company's board.LiNeBrEaKSalmon River's board of directors usually sets allotments on a monthly basis. But the year's unique water situation led to special interim meetings to dole out miniscule amounts. The system hit 54 percent efficiency for the year, Joslin said.LiNeBrEaK"We allotted water when we had it to give," Joslin told shareholders. "This year the water just didn't get up and moving."LiNeBrEaKAt the meeting, shareholders suggested and passed a change requiring the board to meet twice a month when snowpack on April 1 is less than 125 percent of average, the level below which Abramovich said irrigation supplies get iffy.LiNeBrEaKA key issue this year will be soil moisture, he said. Storms so far haven't been able to saturate soil in the region, meaning some snowpack will be absorbed before it can run into rivers and reservoirs. That, he said, is a reason to lean to the 70 percent prediction, one of a range the agency releases.LiNeBrEaKThis year's weather has been hard to predict, Abramovich said, in part because of a lingering La Nina effect. But a change in a long-term climate pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation could lead to fewer consecutive dry years across southern Idaho, he said.LiNeBrEaKIt's still hard to be sure what Salmon River will see this year -- most water predictions become more firm starting around February. Despite 2008's problems, Manager Larrie Ragain said he thinks his company is still better off than others that have had to make water delivery calls.LiNeBrEaK"It's too early to worry about, really," Ragain said of this spring's supply.LiNeBrEaKNate Poppino may be reached at 208-735-3237.LiNeBrEaKor npoppino@magicvalley.com		BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (89%); SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS (89%); IRRIGATION (89%); TALKS and MEETINGS (88%); CLIMATOLOGY (84%); RIVERS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); EL NINO and LA NINA (76%); WEATHER (76%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (74%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%)  		US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (56%)  		IDAHO, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 Times-News   	Nate Poppino, The Times-News, Twin Falls, Idaho  			Science  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20090113-TW-Salmon-River-Canal-shareholders-get-water-update-0113  	TW  									
Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   Final Edition	FYI: Business  	Business; Pg. E2  	864 words  	 Tronox bankruptcy addresses liabilities Tronox Inc. said Monday it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it looks to reorganize its operations and alleviate legacy liabilities. The filling includes Tronox and some of its operating subsidiaries. Tronox's non-U.S. operations in Australia, Germany and the Netherlands were not part of the filing.  LiNeBrEaKThe Oklahoma City company said it took the step to address legacy liabilities it incurred when it was spun off from Kerr-McGee Corp. in 2006. The liabilities, which Tronox said are an obstacle to financial stability, include environmental remediation and litigation costs. Tronox, which makes pigments used in paint and other materials, said it would continue operations as usual amid the restructuring. Tronox obtained a commitment for up to $125 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its existing creditors. The financing provides Tronox the liquidity it needs to continue operating normally. Tronox, which employs 1,800 people, including 200 in Oklahoma City, does not anticipate layoffs. Stanford launches energy institute Stanford University has announced a $100 million initiative to study energy issues. The Precourt Institute for Energy unveiled Monday will be dedicated to research on energy security, renewable energy sources and global warming. The founding donors are Stanford alumni Jay Precourt, an energy executive, and Thomas Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor. Steyer is a trustee of the university in Palo Alto, Calif., and managing partner of Farallon Capital Management. The donors say that even in an economic downturn it's essential to direct research dollars to solving energy problems. Energy issues, they say, affect everything from economic to national security policy. Interest rates fall at Treasury auction Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills fell to the lowest levels in two weeks in Monday's auction. The Treasury Department auctioned $26 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 0. 12 percent, down from 0. 15 percent last week. An additional $27 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 0. 29 percent, down from 0. 32 percent last week. The three-month rate was the lowest since three-month bills averaged 0. 05 percent on Dec. 29. The six-month rate was the lowest since 0. 25 percent, also on Dec. 29. The discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value. For a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,996. 97 while a six-month bill sold for $9,985. 34. That would equal an annualized rate of 0. 122 percent for the three-month bills and 0. 294 percent for the six-month bills. Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 0. 44 percent last week from 0. 37 percent the previous week. Fed board member leaving next week Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner announced Monday that he will leave, giving President-elect Barack Obama an opportunity to put his stamp on the central bank. After nearly three years at the Fed, Kroszner said he will step down Jan. 21, a week before the central bank's next regular meeting. Kroszner, 46, will return to academia as a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Kroszner's departure will create a second Fed opening for Obama to fill. Obama, who takes over on Jan. 20, has selected Daniel Tarullo, a Georgetown University law professor, to fill one of two already vacant seats on the Fed's seven-member board. At the Fed, Kroszner was the point person on efforts to tighten regulations on home mortgages and credit cards. Big soybean, corn crops reported U.S. farmers delivered a bumper crop in 2008, according to a government report released Monday that eased fears of a looming food shortage but caused commodity prices to drop. Corn futures dropped 60 cents, or 7 percent, to close at $3. 81 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade after the report was released. Soybeans also fell 7 percent, losing 70 cents to close at $9. 66 a bushel. Midwestern farmers delivered the second-largest corn crop in U.S. history in spite of massive flooding that ripped through Iowa, Missouri and elsewhere this summer. There were 12. 1 billion bushels of corn grown for use as grain, down 7 percent from 2007's all-time record of 13. 04 billion bushels, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The soybean crop of 2. 96 billion bushels was the fourth largest in U.S. history, up 11 percent from 2007. News of the bounty came just six months after global commodity traders pushed crop prices to all-time highs on fears that growing demand for grain and crop-based fuels such as ethanol would strain global food supplies. Ethanol industry groups were quick to cite the report as evidence that farmers can grow enough food to support demand for both food and fuel. "With an expected surplus of nearly 2 billion bushels at the end of this marketing year, it is clear that farmers can supply ample feedstock for food, feed, fiber and renewable fuel production," Renewable Fuels Association President Bob Dinneen said in a statement.

USA TODAY 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Energy pick fervent on climate;  Physicistwon Nobel Prize; political novice faces challenges 	NEWS; Pg. 5A  	869 words  	WASHINGTON -- In an autobiography for the Nobel committee, atomic physicist Steven Chu called himself "the academic black sheep" of his family.LiNeBrEaKHe goofed off in high school. Several Ivy League schools rejected him when he applied to college. His father discouraged him from following his older brother into physics, telling him, "You'll never be successful," recalled younger brother Morgan.LiNeBrEaKThat prediction would turn out to be wildly incorrect. Last month, Chu was nominated by President-elect Barack Obama as his secretary of Energy. LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed, Chu will be the Cabinet's first Nobel Prize winner.LiNeBrEaKHis confirmation hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is today.LiNeBrEaKColleagues such as Mark Kasevich of Stanford University say Chu, 60, is a "scientist's scientist," a walking encyclopedia of facts and figures. Before age 40, he did the first experiments that would earn him the Nobel in physics in 1997: He figured out a way to study individual atoms by trapping them in laser light.LiNeBrEaKAfter that, he jumped to experiments in biophysics, a move akin to switching "from golf to football," says Paul Alivisatos of the University of California-Berkeley. In his new field, too, Chu did groundbreaking research.LiNeBrEaK'Imperative' to actLiNeBrEaKA decade or so ago, his brother says, Chu began to take an interest in global warming and energy supply. Those close to Chu can't explain exactly how he came to seize on these issues, but with typical intensity, he quickly came up to speed and became passionate about them.LiNeBrEaKChu co-authored a 2007 report about energy that in part concluded: "What the world does in the coming decade will have enormous consequences that will last for centuries. It is imperative that we begin without further delay."LiNeBrEaKFor the past 4 1/2 years, he has headed the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, an Energy Department research institute that he steered to a new focus on renewable energy. He was also on the UC Berkeley faculty.LiNeBrEaKChu recently began teaching himself economics so he could weigh the consequences of differing options for slowing global warming. He won't rely on the opinion of others, preferring to form his own judgments on everything, says Sally Benson, the head of Stanford's energy research center, who worked with Chu at Lawrence Berkeley.LiNeBrEaK"He's very hands-on. He gets into the nitty-gritty," says Benson, who also says he's "a visionary ... truly committed to solving these problems."LiNeBrEaKChu's zeal about climate and energy also fits with a life-long hunger to succeed on a grand scale. He has a "desire to do something noteworthy and important," says Eugene Commins, Chu's graduate adviser at UC Berkeley.LiNeBrEaKEven friends make a joke of Chu's drive, both in the lab and outside it. On the tennis court, the bike path and the hiking trail, Chu is known for turning every encounter into a contest.LiNeBrEaK"You're a seriously competitive person when you turn whipping cream for dessert into a competition," friend and fellow physics Nobelist Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado said at a 60th birthday celebration for Chu.LiNeBrEaKOthers don't find it a joking matter. Chu is "arrogant" with a "we-know-best attitude," says Ignacio Chapela, a UC Berkeley ecologist who clashed with Chu over Chu's plan for the university and the Lawrence Berkeley lab to take part in a research effort funded by energy giant BP.LiNeBrEaKDoesn't suffer 'fools'LiNeBrEaKChu's ambition and independence have served him well in the laboratory, but it's not clear how those qualities will serve him as Energy secretary. He has shown little interest in politics until now and is a novice at the rough-and-tumble of Washington. He'll have to juggle -- and avoid alienating -- many warring parties, both inside and outside the agency.LiNeBrEaKThat could be tough for an outspoken scientist who, Commins says, "doesn't suffer fools gladly."LiNeBrEaKPast Energy secretaries have often been content to take orders from above, says the University of Texas-Austin's Tad Patzek, a former UC Berkeley colleague.LiNeBrEaK"Chu will ... want to implement his own policies. So there's this potential for conflict," says Patzek, who clashed with Chu over the Nobelist's enthusiasm for biofuels, gasoline substitutes derived from plants. "I actually don't know why he agreed to do this."LiNeBrEaKThose who know him say he's up to the job.LiNeBrEaKChu's ex-wife is confident he will make progress on the intractable problem of how to power the nation without destroying the environment.LiNeBrEaK"I'll be stunned if he doesn't succeed," says Lisa Chu-Thielbar. "He might leave a few bloody corpses behind him, but he won't succumb to pressure. He'll do what he thinks is right."

The Washington Times 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	Bush policy stakes U.S. claim in Arctic;  Seeks rights to waterways and resources 	NATION; A06  	507 words  	Facing growing competition for the Arctic, President Bush on Monday issued a directive staking the U.S. claim to be an Arctic nation with rights to its resources and travel lanes. LiNeBrEaKIt's the first presidential declaration of Arctic policy since 1994. The directive comes at a time when Russia has claimed the North Pole seabed, Canada has continued to assert that the Northwest Passage is an internal waterway and scientists say global warming is chipping away the polar ice cap but opening up new opportunities to explore for oil, minerals and natural gas.LiNeBrEaKIn the document, Mr. Bush challenges Canada's claim to the Northwest Passage, saying the U.S. must spell out its own claims on natural resources and calling for American defense and homeland security officials to "develop greater capabilities and capacity" to defend U.S. access.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush also renewed his call for the Senate to pass the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, which has been blocked by conservative senators.LiNeBrEaK"The Northwest Passage is a strait used for international navigation, and the Northern Sea route includes straits used for international navigation; the regime of transit passage applies to passage through those straits," said Mr. Bush, who issued the directive with just a week to go before he leaves office, though the policy process had been under way for months.LiNeBrEaK"Preserving the rights and duties relating to navigation and overflight in the Arctic region supports our ability to exercise these rights throughout the world, including through strategic straits," Mr. Bush said.LiNeBrEaKTwo dozen executive offices and agencies worked on the document, which comes as Arctic issues are heating up.LiNeBrEaKLate last year, the European Union, citing member nations that border the Arctic, asserted its own claims to be involved in discussions on the region.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush's document focuses heavily on science and environmental protections.LiNeBrEaKSen. Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican, who was the lone member of Congress to actively participate in the drafting process, said the policy is a needed statement at a time when there is much uncertainty surrounding the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"This is a significant step forward for the nation and sends a message to the world that the Arctic is important to the United States, and we stand ready to work cooperatively with the international community in this vital region," she said.LiNeBrEaKShe added that Congress and President-elect Barack Obama would have to follow through with manpower and money to help make the recommendations policy.LiNeBrEaKIn his directive, Mr. Bush also called on the Senate to ratify the Law of the Sea treaty, which has been pending for years and has been ratified by all of the other nations that border the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKBut the treaty has been blocked by conservative senators, who argue that the U.S. would cede sovereignty and could end up subject to an international tax. Sen. John McCain, Republicans' presidential nominee last year, came out in opposition to the treaty, which could explain the Bush administration's delay in releasing the directive.

Based on my experience, I am convinced that the current alarm over carbon dioxide is mistaken."LiNeBrEaKIn his interview with writer Raymond Brusca, Mr. Happer argued that carbon dioxide is not warming the planet: "Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. Every time you exhale, you exhale air that has 4 percent carbon dioxide. To say that that's a pollutant just boggles my mind. What used to be science has turned into a cult."LiNeBrEaK66 TO GOLiNeBrEaKThe Internal Revenue Service has corrected or mitigated 49 of the 115 information security weaknesses that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported during its last audit, including encrypting sensitive data going across its computerized network.LiNeBrEaK"However, most of the previously identified weaknesses remain unresolved," the GAO states in a new report. "For example, IRS continues to, among other things, allow sensitive [taxpayer] information, including IDs and passwords for mission-critical applications, to be readily available to any user on its internal network, and grant excessive access to individuals who do not need it."LiNeBrEaKThe IRS relies extensively on computerized systems to collect taxes - about $2. 7 trillion in fiscal 2008 and 2007 - process tax returns and enforce the nation's tax laws.LiNeBrEaK"Effective information security controls are essential to protect financial and taxpayer information from inadvertent or deliberate misuse, improper disclosure, or destruction," the GAO says.

The Washington Post 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday   Suburban Edition	O'Malley Outlines Growth Strategy;  Bills Proposed to Preserve Farmland, Limit Bay Pollution 	METRO; Pg. B04  	632 words  	Gov. Martin O'Malley yesterday announced legislative proposals to manage growth that he said would "stave off further destruction" of Maryland's remaining acres of farmland and the Chesapeake Bay.LiNeBrEaKThe governor, who is seeking to leave an environmental legacy, said his administration hopes to invigorate a Smart Growth program started under former governor Parris N. Glendening (D) and to curb the suburban sprawl that sends polluting runoff into the bay.LiNeBrEaK"It's time to move from 20 years of treading water to 20 years of cleaner water and more sustainable growth," O'Malley (D) said as he ticked off six bills he will propose this month to the General Assembly. LiNeBrEaKOne would reverse a ruling by the state's highest court that allows local governments to ignore their planning maps when approving development projects. Another would require local governments to track more closely how growth is unfolding in counties and cities. Another bill would incorporate such goals as economic development and public participation into the state's planning agenda.LiNeBrEaKThe state's planning director cited the challenge of population growth -- by 2030, officials predict a 27 percent increase, to 6. 7 million -- and the effect on global warming and bay pollution that such growth could have if it is not better controlled.LiNeBrEaK"The job is harder in Maryland because we're the fifth-most densely populated state," Planning Secretary Richard E. Hall said. "We have small towns, and the citizens expect them to be vibrant communities."LiNeBrEaKThe legislative initiatives are in line with the conclusions of a report released yesterday by a task force that spent the past year working on a statewide planning map. The 90-page report -- "Where Do We Grow from Here?" -- says Maryland needs a comprehensive road map to guide the location and density of growth throughout the state.LiNeBrEaKIf suburban sprawl continues unabated in Maryland, workers will be unable to find housing near their jobs, commuting times will increase and the bay "will be in further jeopardy," the report says. It says about 650,000 acres would shift from rural use to urban development by 2030 at the current pace of development. But the report presents another scenario that would reduce the total to 150,000 acres if development is restricted to areas near public transit.LiNeBrEaKThe O'Malley administration is not proposing restrictions on development, and some environmentalists worry that the Smart Growth law passed under Glendening in 1997 will not be strengthened to restrict growth to designated high-density areas. Some environmental groups said they had hoped for more from O'Malley.LiNeBrEaK"There are visions but no goals or standards" for what new communities should look like, said Dru Schmidt-Perkins, executive director of 1000 Friends of Maryland, a group that promotes dense development near rail and bus stations.LiNeBrEaKThe task force of planners, developers, local officials and lawmakers is recommending legislation to effectively undo a Court of Appeals decision last year. The court ruled that Allegany County did not have to follow its planning map in approving Terrapin Run, a 4,300-home community far from public water and sewer lines.LiNeBrEaKThe Maryland Association of Counties said local governments are concerned that another bill, requiring "compulsory information-gathering" on a community's growth patterns, could stigmatize some jurisdictions unfairly.LiNeBrEaK"One size rarely fits all," said Michael Sanderson, the association's executive director.LiNeBrEaKOther legislation would reauthorize a tax credit for rehabilitating historic properties; the credit is set to expire next year. Another bill would have fishermen lease land on the floor of the bay for oyster harvests. That would leave large swaths of the bay unharvested, with the idea of allowing oyster populations to revive.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	January 13, 2009 Tuesday 	O'Malley bill: Local development plans must be followed  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	627 words  	Jan. 13--It's a simple bill, but one that Gov. Martin O'Malley deems necessary: a law to require local governments to carry out the development plans that they write.LiNeBrEaKA controversial court case over a huge proposed development in Western Maryland called Terrapin Run led to a ruling that local governments do not have to base zoning decisions on their comprehensive development plans, which say where growth should occur.LiNeBrEaKTerrapin Run was in an area that Allegany County did not mark for future growth, but the county zoning board approved the development anyway. The Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the zoning board's decision last year. LiNeBrEaKSo the O'Malley administration -- to the delight of environmentalists -- is proposing a change in state law to make it clear that cities and counties must follow their own plans.LiNeBrEaKIt's one of several bills that Mr. O'Malley unveiled during an event at the State House yesterday. The bills are aimed at controlling sprawl that has been eating up Maryland's natural spaces and frustrating some residents and environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKThe other proposals include:LiNeBrEaKRequiring local governments to include more sections in their comprehensive plans on topics such as economic development, housing and environmental protection.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping statewide "measures or markers" to better track development trends and see how they are affecting the environment.LiNeBrEaKMaking it easier for local governments to attract "transit-oriented development," which is building near train stations or other transportation hubs.LiNeBrEaKReauthorizing a state historic tax credit to boost projects in older cities and towns.LiNeBrEaKMr. O'Malley said 21 percent of the state's land is developed and 21 percent is preserved and protected from development.LiNeBrEaK"Our future is going to be defined in the choices we make in the remaining 58 percent," Mr. O'Malley said.LiNeBrEaKThe City of Annapolis, Anne Arundel County and Queen Anne's County governments are working on updating their comprehensive plans. It's a tedious process that involves poring over maps, talking with residents and business owners and determining where growth should be directed.LiNeBrEaKWhile environmentalists were pleased with the bills Mr. O'Malley is putting forth, they said it's only a start.LiNeBrEaKAlan Girard, a policy manager for land use at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called the Terrapin Run-inspired bill a "no-brainer."LiNeBrEaKDru Schmidt-Perkins, head of the preservation group 1000 Friends of Maryland, said the bills are only the first step. Comprehensive plans should be required to better tie into state goals, such as those to combat climate change and minimize damage to the Chesapeake Bay, she said.LiNeBrEaK"There's already goals out there that people universally believe," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe governor also hinted at some other environmental issues, including paving the way for watermen to raise oysters in aquaculture.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked whether Program Open Space -- the state's signature land-preservation program -- might be hit by budget cuts, Mr. O'Malley responded: "I don't intend to transfer one dime out of Program Open Space."LiNeBrEaKHe also said he soon might have an announcement on the Global Warming Solutions Act, a bill that would set greenhouse gas reduction goals into state law. The bill has failed in the General Assembly several years in a row.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers go back to work tomorrow with the opening of the 2009 General Assembly.

The Boston Globe 	January 12, 2009 Monday   THIRD EDITION	THE GREEN BLOG  	HEALTHSCIENCE; Pg. A8  	496 words  	Excerpts from the Globe's environmental blog.LiNeBrEaKGreenhouse credits for a coal plant? LiNeBrEaKMaybe you've read the headlines about the giant sludge pond of fly ash - a byproduct of burning coal - that swallowed a piece of the Tennessee landscape last month, raising a host of questions about the toxic material. LiNeBrEaKIt turns out Massachusetts has its own fly ash controversy.LiNeBrEaKThe Conservation Law Foundation is outraged that state environmental officials have given conditional approval for the region's largest coal-fired power plant to receive what could be millions of dollars in greenhouse gas allowances for recycling fly ash and using it in the production of cement. Dominion, the owner of the Brayton Point power plant in Somerset, says about a ton of greenhouse gas emissions are avoided for every ton of fly ash used in cement production.LiNeBrEaKThere is irony that a toxic byproduct of burning coal - which releases enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere - would be eligible for greenhouse gas credits at all.LiNeBrEaKBut the foundation's argument centers more on additionality: Whether Brayton Point was going to recycle the fly ash anyway. The environmental group argues that the nation's coal-burning industry already regularly recycles fly ash for cement - and increasing regulation on ash is pushing even more recycling to take place. To give Brayton Point credit for it is like giving a student extra credit for carrying a backpack to school: He is going to carry it whether or not you reward him.LiNeBrEaK"It's absurd," says the foundation's Seth Kaplan. "It fails the additionality test completely." He says it's also impossible to measure how much greenhouse gas is truly displaced by using fly ash.LiNeBrEaKState environmental officials say Dominion decided to build a fly ash recycling plant voluntarily in 2006 - when it wasn't considered regular business practice. That - and the fact that Brayton Point wasn't required by law to build the plant - persuaded them to conditionally deem it as "additional" under so-called "Filthy Five" rules, one of the nation's first to limit carbon dioxide from power plants and financially encourage them to develop cleaner technologies.LiNeBrEaKNow, those rules are being eclipsed by a 10-state pact called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and state officials say Brayton Point's fly ash credits can be converted into some of the initiative's allowances. They note they are giving the power plant less than half the credit it wants for fly ash recycling - and are requiring a review in 2010 to see if that should continue. State officials say they are reviewing the foundation's comment letter to see if fly ash recycling has become common business practice in recent years and take it into consideration when deciding on final approval.LiNeBrEaKDominion, Brayton Point's owner, says their recycling plant is one of four in the country and state regulations allow them to get greenhouse gas credit for their fly ash plant.LiNeBrEaKMORE GREEN BLOG at www. boston.com/greenblog		COAL FIRED PLANTS (91%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (78%); CEMENT MFG (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); APPROVALS (76%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (72%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (72%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (58%)  				MASSACHUSETTS, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Dominion, Brayton Point's owner, says its ash recycling plant is one of only four in the country.

The Boston Globe 	January 12, 2009 Monday   THIRD EDITION	Finding a sustainable future at the dump  	OP-ED; Pg. A11  	665 words  	THE ECONOMIC CRISIS has now hit the bottom of the barrel - the trash barrel, that is.LiNeBrEaKIf we were to look at a garbage landfill from 200 feet away, most of us would see what appears to be a landscape of unidentifiable trash. If we dared to stand in the landfill, we would be able to identify familiar solid-waste products such as paper, cardboard, metal cans, plastic and glass bottles, scrap metal, and a host of other items. But what if we were able to take a really close look - down to the atomic level? We would see trillions of molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, the building blocks of precious fuel to run our cars, heat our homes, and generate electricity. We would see trillions of molecules of inorganic chemicals that could be transformed into building and construction materials to save energy and preserve our natural resources.LiNeBrEaKFor years, the paradigm for waste recycling has only considered the value of waste on the material level. We recycle plastics to plastics, rubber to rubber, paper to paper - we simply refabricate the same molecules into similar products of the same molecules. LiNeBrEaKThis isn't a bad idea as long as the demand for those products remains strong enough to support the cost of recycling. But we are currently witnessing a drastic drop in the market for traditional recyclables because of the downturn in our economy and the economies of global trading partners. Also, recycling and refabricating these materials often uses more energy than creating virgin products. The result - more and more recyclable materials are finding their way back into a landfill system that is getting dangerously close to capacity and continues to spew greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThere are a number of new technologies that can come to the rescue of this landfill dilemma.LiNeBrEaKOne such technology is called plasma-enhanced melter. With it, virtually any waste product can be fed into a closed chamber where it is superheated to temperatures of between 10,000 and 20,000 degrees Fahrenheit using an electricity-conducting gas called plasma. This is not an incineration process that creates greenhouse gases, hazardous ash, and other air pollutants. The intense heat of the plasma gasification process actually rearranges the molecular structure of the waste, transforming organic (carbon-based) materials into an ultra-clean, synthetic gas (syngas) rich in carbon and hydrogen. The clean gas can be made a substitute for natural gas for heating, converted to liquid transportation fuels, or even used for electricity generation.LiNeBrEaKThe gasification technology is not simply another science project. In fact, it is already being used in the United States as well as other countries. In 2003, Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan purchased a plasma-enhanced melter system to destroy PCBs and asbestos. Global Plasma in Taiwan has been converting industrial and medical wastes into clean electric power since 2005. Last year, Dow Corning signed a 10-year contract and construction has started to use this technology to convert chemical waste into process-quality hydrochloric acid and enough clean synthetic gas to heat several thousand homes. Fulcrum Bioenergy is building a facility outside of Reno, Nev., that will have the capacity to process 90,000 tons of municipal solid waste into 10. 5 million gallons of ethanol per year. A 25-ton-per-day, demonstration-scale plasma-enhanced melter unit in Richland, Wash., is capable of processing 20 percent of the town's waste.LiNeBrEaKPlasma gasification technology like the plasma-enhanced melter creates a new paradigm for waste recycling and sustainability, because it actually rearranges the atoms in molecules of low-value waste into molecules of high-value products. Over the past 1,000 years we have called this process "alchemy." Perhaps in the next 1,000 years we will call it "a sustainable future."LiNeBrEaKJeffrey E. Surma is president and CEO of InEnTec LLC, an Oregon-based firm specializing in the conversion of waste into clean, renewable products.

Buffalo News (New York) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   CENTRAL EDITION	Everybody's Column   	VIEWPOINTS; Pg. A7  	1114 words  	&gt;There's no denying wind is a viable energy sourceLiNeBrEaKA recent Another Voice authored by an anti-wind power proponent presented a myopic point of view with unfounded claims that do nothing but spread misinformation and do the public a disservice. The fact is that wind is a viable energy source, and can and will play an important role in our nation's energy future. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that wind can safely provide 20 percent of our nation's energy needs by 2030.LiNeBrEaKI do not claim that wind is the single "silver bullet" solution to our current energy crisis, but rather an important piece of the puzzle that also includes energy conservation and efficiency, as well as other renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro and geothermal energy. Every time more wind power enters the electric grid, we avert the need to use additional fossil fuels that pollute our environment and devastate consumers with volatile price spikes.LiNeBrEaKWestern New York is blessed with abundant wind resources that we can continue to harness to produce clean, domestic energy. Wind will play a significant role in combating global warming and revitalizing our economy by creating good jobs. LiNeBrEaKBrian SmithLiNeBrEaKWNY Program Director, Citizens Campaign for the EnvironmentLiNeBrEaK&gt;'Me' generation needs to get back to the basicsLiNeBrEaKSeveral letters have appeared in The News from and about folks intolerant of Catholic Church teachings. A number of decades ago, the good sisters in every neighborhood in the Buffalo area taught the principles of the faith, and the people -- for the most part -- believed and behaved accordingly.LiNeBrEaKThen came the "me, me, me" generation, and many truths and beliefs were discarded, including adherence to the laws of God, as stated in the Bible and as taught by the Catholic Church.LiNeBrEaKJust a reminder: God gave us his Commandments as a part of his covenant with his people. It might be well to recall and review the commandments of God or, better still, check out the Catechism of the Catholic Church for a full understanding of what God wants and expects of his creation. Now just because some will say they don't believe, or this is not true, does not make it untrue. People need to forget about "me, me, me" and get back to the basics of God's laws.LiNeBrEaKThis does not mean we do not love everyone -- we do. But we do not have to love the actions that are not in God's laws. If anyone still cannot accept this, please leave in peace, but do not call yourself Catholic or make a mockery of our faith and traditions and beliefs.LiNeBrEaKDolores KurzdorferLiNeBrEaKAmherstLiNeBrEaK&gt;Don't punish recipients of Empire Zone benefitsLiNeBrEaKThe recent News editorial, "Reform program fairly," was right on the mark. The Empire Zone program should be reformed, but not at the expense of companies that, in good faith, based significant investments on the commitment of the state to provide Empire Zone benefits.LiNeBrEaKThe governor's proposed budget would subject companies that relied on Empire Zone benefits in making significant investments to a 20-to-1 cost-benefit requirement that they were not subject to when they made those investments. Because of this, more than 2,000 businesses could be removed from the program, including GEICO, Barilla Pasta and FedEx in Western New York.LiNeBrEaKSuch actions would result in litigation, relocation and loss of credibility for New York's economic development efforts for years to come. Economic development is a competitive marketplace, and the loss of legitimacy in New York's commitments would be used against it by other states and countries with which we compete for projects.LiNeBrEaKThese proposals would have a devastating effect on economic development in upstate, where the Empire Zone program has been the primary incentive used to encourage most major expansion.LiNeBrEaKGoing forward, the Empire Zone program should be rebranded and reconstituted. The current program is too complex, too confusing, too bureaucratic and too expensive. But punishing businesses that have played by the rules and made investments and created jobs in New York would do long-term damage to New York's credibility as a good place to live and work.LiNeBrEaKBrian McMahonLiNeBrEaKNew York State Economic Development CouncilLiNeBrEaK&gt;Increasing taxes will not balance the state budgetLiNeBrEaKA recent letter in The News called for a "progressive" tax plan that supposedly would balance the state budget. The writer shows a lack of both historical and economic knowledge in calling for such a plan. Her idea was to raise taxes to 80 percent on the "wealthy."LiNeBrEaKFirst, who defines what "wealthy" is? And, has she missed the mass exodus of businesses and individuals from the state due to an already onerous tax burden? IRS data shows that 75 percent of upper-income filers are small businesses paying the personal rate. Such a plan will either drive such businesses to close or relocate, taking more jobs out of a local economy that desperately needs them.LiNeBrEaKRaising taxes won't balance the state budget. The imposition of such confiscatory rates will be the death knell for New York. If such a plan were adopted, the only people left in the state will be those who weren't paying taxes -- only exacerbating the deficit. Our forefathers started a revolution over tax rates less than this. The writer would be well served to consider what has already occurred, and what will occur, if taxes are raised in an overtaxed state.LiNeBrEaKRick CannonLiNeBrEaKBuffaloLiNeBrEaK&gt;Mediators assist many couples seeking divorceLiNeBrEaKA News article on Jan. 4 emphasized that economic pressures, both nationally and especially in Western New York, appear to be among the major forces contributing to the substantial reduction in our local divorce rate. The article attributed this, at least in part, to the high cost of lawyering to complete a divorce.LiNeBrEaKWhat was critically missing from the article was the increasing use of trained divorce mediators to assist divorcing/separating people in reaching their own reasonable resolutions through direct negotiations, with the mediator as a facilitator of effective discussion.LiNeBrEaKOnce a couple voluntarily appears to begin mediation, there is usually at least a 95 percent success in achieving a comprehensive settlement of all related issues, with that settlement being reduced to writing and submitted to a court as the formal terms of any judicial judgment or order.LiNeBrEaKIn almost all cases, a successful mediation is at least 50 percent less expensive than a traditional settlement achieved through the adversary process, and usually is far quicker, more fine-tuned for the particular family setting and is far less polarizing between the parties, which is so important for future effective co-parenting of any children involved.LiNeBrEaKPaul D.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Canada's forests, once a help on greenhouse gases, now contribute to climate change  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	1075 words  	VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ As relentlessly bad as the news about global warming seems to be, with ice at the poles melting faster than scientists had predicted and world temperatures rising higher than expected, there was at least a reservoir of hope stored here in Canada's vast forests.LiNeBrEaKThe country's 1. 2 million square miles of trees have been dubbed the "lungs of the planet" by ecologists because they account for more than 7 percent of Earth's total forest lands. They could always be depended upon to suck in vast quantities of carbon dioxide, naturally cleansing the world of much of the harmful heat-trapping gas. LiNeBrEaKBut not anymore.LiNeBrEaKIn an alarming yet little-noticed series of recent studies, scientists have concluded that Canada's precious forests, stressed from damage caused by global warming, insect infestations and persistent fires, have crossed an ominous line and are now pumping out more climate-changing carbon dioxide than they are sequestering.LiNeBrEaKWorse yet, the experts predict that Canada's forests will remain net carbon sources, as opposed to carbon storage "sinks," until at least 2022, and possibly much longer.LiNeBrEaK"We are seeing a significant distortion of the natural trend," said Werner Kurz, senior research scientist at the Canadian Forest Service and the leading expert on carbon cycles in the nation's forests. "Since 1999, and especially in the last five years, the forests have shifted from being a carbon sink to a carbon source."LiNeBrEaKTranslation: Earth's lungs have come down with emphysema. Canada's forests are no longer our friends.LiNeBrEaKSo serious is the problem that Canada's federal government effectively wrote off the nation's forests last year as officials submitted their plans to abide by the international Kyoto Protocol, which obligates participating governments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Kyoto agreement, governments are permitted to count forest lands as credits, or offsets, when calculating their national carbon emissions. But Canadian officials, aware of the scientific studies showing that their forests actually are emitting excess carbon, quietly omitted the forest lands from their Kyoto compliance calculations.LiNeBrEaK"The forecast analysis prepared for the government ... indicates there is a probability that forests would constitute a net source of greenhouse gas emissions," a Canadian Environment Ministry spokesman told the Montreal Gazette.LiNeBrEaKCanadian officials say global warming is causing the crisis in their forests. Inexorably rising temperatures are slowly drying out forest lands, leaving trees more susceptible to fires, which release huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKWarmer temperatures also are accelerating the spread of a deadly pest known as the mountain pine beetle, which has devastated pine forests across British Columbia and is threatening vital timber in the neighboring province of Alberta. More than 50,000 square miles of British Columbia's pine forest have been stricken so far with the telltale markers of death: needles that turn bright red before falling off the tree.LiNeBrEaKBitter cold Canadian winters used to kill off much of the pine beetle population each year, naturally keeping it in check. But the milder winters of recent years have allowed the insect to proliferate.LiNeBrEaK"That's what's causing some of our forests to switch from a carbon sink position to a source position," said Jim Snetsinger, British Columbia's chief forester. "Once those infested trees are killed by the pine beetle, they are no longer sequestering carbon _ they are giving it off."LiNeBrEaKSnetsinger noted that eventually, over the course of a generation, some of the dying forests will begin to regenerate and once again begin storing more carbon than they release. But for the foreseeable future, experts say, their models show that Canada's forests will stay stuck in a vicious global-warming cycle, both succumbing to the effects of climate change and, as they decay and release more carbon, helping to accelerate it.LiNeBrEaKThat grim reality is stoking a new debate over commercial logging, one of Canada's biggest industries.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists contend that the extreme stresses on Canada's forests, particularly the old-growth northern forest, mean that logging ought to be sharply curtailed to preserve the remaining trees _ and the carbon stored within them _ for as long as possible.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, they argue that the disruptive process of logging releases even more carbon stored in the forest peat, threatening to set off what they describe as a virtual "carbon bomb" _ the estimated 186 billion tons of carbon stored in Canada's forests, which is equivalent to 27 years worth of global carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK"There's only one thing which hauls all that carbon out of the forest, and that's logging," said Merran Smith, director of the climate program at the environmental group ForestEthics. "What we need to do is maintain as much biodiversity as we can, so we are prepared to adapt as temperatures change, so we have resilience."LiNeBrEaKBut Kurz and other government scientists contend that a logging moratorium is no solution to the global warming problem and would in fact increase carbon emissions over the long term.LiNeBrEaKThat's because, they argue, essential wood products for construction, furniture and other uses would have to be replaced with other man-made materials, such as plastic, steel or concrete, which require the burning of even more fossil fuels _ and therefore carbon emissions _ during their manufacturing process.LiNeBrEaK"It's not as simple as saying, 'Log less and therefore have more carbon sequestered in the forests,' " Kurz said. "That is true, but if in order to do that you have more fossil fuel emitted elsewhere, your impact on the climate may be negative."LiNeBrEaKInstead, some scientists argue for more extensive logging of the remaining commercial forests so that older forest stands, which are most vulnerable to insect infestations and have nearly reached their carbon-storage capacity, can be replanted with younger trees that will take in even more carbon during their growing years.

It will consolidate Stanford's existing energy-focused efforts to one site   and allow the hiring of new faculty, support additional graduate students and offer seed money for major research projects. LiNeBrEaKThe donations came from three alumni who said they were motivated by the desire to protect the environment from greenhouse gases, improve energy efficiency and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKOil and gas executive Jay Precourt donated $50 million to create what will be called the Precourt Institute for Energy. Farallon Capital Management partner Thomas Steyer and his wife Kat Taylor gave $40 million to create a new research center within that institute, the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. The final $10 million came from other donors.LiNeBrEaK"These generous gifts will help us overcome the enormous challenges that we are facing in energy research," Stanford President John Hennessy said at a Monday news conference. "It will create an independent institute for researchers on campus and around the world.''LiNeBrEaKThe new institute will be directed by Lynn Orr, professor of energy resources engineering and director of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project. He plans to pull together 136 faculty in 21 departments to create interdisciplinary projects.LiNeBrEaKOrr will start recruiting new professors almost immediately, he said. He will also encourage graduate students to apply for the 20 new fellowships available at the institute.LiNeBrEaKAn even larger $500 million energy institute supports work at UC Berkeley, but it is controversial because it's supported by international energy company BP and industry scientists collaborates on research.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked about Precourt's resume   he's a former oil and gas executive   Hennessy said the new program is an "independent institute."LiNeBrEaKStanford's new gifts are among the largest ever received by the university to support academic and research programs   rather than new building construction, said Hennessy.

LiNeBrEaKThe suspect, Francisco Hernandez, 19, whose street name is Zapper, is scheduled to enter a plea to the charges Jan. 21. He is being held without bail at Santa Rita Jail. His attorney, William P. Daley, did not want to comment Monday because he has not seen all the reports on the case.LiNeBrEaKHomicide Sgt. Jim Rullamas said Hernandez has told police he was a member of the South Side Locos street gang. But he refused to talk to investigators about the two shootings, Rullamas said.LiNeBrEaKHernandez is charged with the Sept. 19, 2008, killing of Marco A. Casillas and the wounding of Casillas' 19-year girlfriend, whose name has not been released. She is still recovering from her wounds.LiNeBrEaKThe shooting happened late that night in the 4000 block of Santa Rita Street while the couple was out walking her dog.LiNeBrEaKEven though Hernandez is an admitted gang member, police said neither Casillas nor his girlfriend were involved in gangs. The shooting may have been a case of mistaken identity, authorities said.LiNeBrEaKRullamas said Hernandez was identified as the gunman by a witness, and he was arrested Dec. 29 at his girlfriend's house in Oakland by the police Gang Unit.LiNeBrEaK  Harry HarrisLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaKLearn how to reduce your carbon footprint at Berkeley workshop: If one of your New Year's resolutions is to reduce your carbon footprint, there is a workshop later this month that can help.LiNeBrEaKThe city of Berkeley, the Berkeley Energy Commission and the Ecology Center are partnering to help Berkeley residents learn how to reduce global warming emissions at home. The free workshop is at 7 p.m. Jan. 28 at the Hillside Club, 2286 Cedar St., in Berkeley.LiNeBrEaKYou will learn how to calculate your personal carbon footprint, what actions you can take to significantly reduce your carbon emissions and be given the opportunity to join a Climate Change Action Group or form your own group with friends, family, co-workers or neighbors.LiNeBrEaKThe first 50 people to arrive will be given a free copy of "The Low Carbon Diet" workbook.LiNeBrEaKOrganizers will go over things you can do at home, such as install an aerator on your kitchen faucet. It can reduce water flow by about 25 percent. Wash only full loads of clothes in cold water because it takes natural gas to heat water. Pump up your car tires. Underinflated tires increase wear and reduce fuel-efficiency by 3 percent.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Texas Legislature to revive clean coal debate  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	571 words  	Jan. 12--The clean coal debate lives.LiNeBrEaKThe Texas Legislature this session will revive the issue by considering whether to give tax breaks to companies building cleaner, coal-fired power plants that capture greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe bill, filed by Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, is designed to make integrated gasification combined cycle power plants, or IGCC, economically viable by waiving up to $100 million in franchise taxes per plant, along with other incentives. The incentives are only for IGCC plants that capture and store at least 60 percent of their carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaK"People are afraid, the industry's afraid, to go and try to build a clean coal plant. I call it the prototype penalty," King said. LiNeBrEaKNew, prototype technology often costs more than older technology, so some developers shy away from the risk and cost of adopting something new. IGCC with carbon capture can cost as much as 50 percent more than traditional coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaKSen. Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, will sponsor the bill in the senate. He represents Odessa, one of the sites proposed to host the defunct federal clean coal project called FutureGen.LiNeBrEaKThe bill targets an IGCC plant proposed by Summit Power, which hired former Dallas mayor Laura Miller to help get it built. Summit wants to build at the Odessa site, but Miller said the company needs government incentives to make a business case for the plant.LiNeBrEaK"The reason there are legislators that are interested in this kind of plant is that Texas has the opportunity to be ground zero in the country for carbon capture and sequestration," Miller said. She will appear at a press conference in Austin on Thursday in support of the bill.LiNeBrEaKOther companies with IGCC proposals could also apply for the tax credit.LiNeBrEaKNRG Energy has applied for an air permit for an IGCC plant in South Texas. The company has said it needs government incentives to make the plant profitable.LiNeBrEaKAnd Energy Future Holdings' Luminant generation business has said it is considering building IGCC, but hasn't offered any proposals.LiNeBrEaK"This type of policy proposal is a solid first step by the Legislature," said Luminant's senior vice president of public affairs, Phil Wilson.LiNeBrEaKThe bill offers three incentives. The plant developer gets up to $100 million in franchise tax credit.LiNeBrEaKAlso, the University of Texas' Bureau of Economic Geology will monitor the sites where the carbon dioxide is stored to ensure that the greenhouse gas remains underground.LiNeBrEaKThird, any oil company that will take the carbon dioxide from the plant and use it for enhanced oil recovery gets a tax incentive.LiNeBrEaKA number of oil companies around the state buy naturally-occurring carbon dioxide produced out of state. The carbon dioxide is piped in, and injected into aging wells to bring up more oil.LiNeBrEaKIGCC plants are called "clean coal" because the plant turns the fuel into a gas. Burning the gas emits less pollution than burning the coal outright. The process also allows the plant to capture carbon dioxide more easily than a traditional coal plant.

The Denver Post 	January 12, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Solar-energy idea for new homes stirs up ire, praise  	DENVER and THE WEST; Pg. A-18  	472 words  	For a governor who vows to make renewable energy the state's "calling card," it wouldn't be a legislative session without a initiative from Gov. Bill Ritter on that issue. LiNeBrEaKThat moment came last week during his State of the State speech, in which Ritter threw his support behind a proposal requiring homebuilders to offer buyers the option of putting solar panels on their home or having the home pre-wired for the panels.LiNeBrEaK"Homebuyers already have choices when it comes to countertops, paint colors and flooring," he said. "People should have similar options when it comes to sustainability."LiNeBrEaKThe inclusion in the address thrilled environmental activists, who see the proposal as a chance to spread renewable energy throughout Colorado.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal also signifies a new front in green energy legislation.LiNeBrEaKWhile notable past efforts have focused on large-scale regulations - mandating how much energy big power providers must generate from renewable sources, for instance - lawmakers and advocates are pushing ideas to help individuals obtain renewable technology, what Ritter calls, "bringing the new energy economy home."LiNeBrEaK"It's, 'How can we make sure we can expand opportunity and access so that all Coloradans can afford to get involved in this economy?"' said Pam Kiely, the legislative director for Environment Colorado.LiNeBrEaKCoupled with this new push is a debate over how far government should go to aid what is ultimately a private industry.LiNeBrEaKJon Caldara, president of the conservative Independence Institute, called the solar home idea "insulting."LiNeBrEaK"That's insane," Caldara said. "Why don't we also require them to offer Corian countertops as well? This is between a private builder and a private owner, and the government's only responsibility is to make sure the building is up to safety codes."LiNeBrEaKKiely said connecting more solar panels to the electrical grid is a "statewide value" that benefits all Coloradans.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to clean up our air, it's going to clean up our water, it's going to clean up our global-warming pollution," she said.LiNeBrEaKBut state Sen. Shawn Mitchell, R-Broomfield, said there is a point when government reaches too far to promote what politicians think is best.LiNeBrEaK"Just because something is a good thing doesn't mean builders should be forced to offer it," Mitchell said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is the only state to have a similar requirement of homebuilders. A spokeswoman for the Colorado Association of Home Builders said the organization has yet to take a position on the proposal because the bill hasn't been formally introduced.LiNeBrEaKMcStain Neighborhoods, a local homebuilder, offers customers an option for solar panels in many of its communities. The option has been popular.LiNeBrEaK"It's the kind of thing the whole industry needs to be thinking of," said company co-founder Caroline Hoyt.LiNeBrEaKJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068LiNeBrEaKor jingold@denverpost.com		SOLAR ENERGY (91%); LEGISLATORS (91%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (91%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (89%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); ENERGY REGULATION (78%); LEGISLATION (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (74%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			BILL RITTER (92%)  	DENVER, CO, USA (79%) COLORADO, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  	John Ingold The Denver Post  															
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   ALL S EDITION	Chamber pushes climate change;  Survey gives high priority to development incentives 	BUSINESS; Pg.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Climbing site stays off-limits to protect frog  	NEWS  	357 words  	ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST - A popular rock-climbing site will be closed for at least a year longer than previously expected due to the presence of an endangered frog species, officials said. LiNeBrEaKThere are only a small number of mountain yellow-legged frogs left in the Williamson Rock area, officials said. The amphibian is on the federal endangered species list.LiNeBrEaKThis reflects a global trend of decline in amphibian populations, scientists said. No specific reasons have been identified, but experts attribute the problem to issues such as climate change and habitat limitation.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the brown, spotted Angeles Forest species' delicate situation, a closure of the Williams Rock area and Pacific Crest Trail has been extended until December, officials said.LiNeBrEaK"It's really on the brink," said Lisa Northrop, resource and planning officer for the Angeles National Forest. "Almost any activity, swimming, rock climbing, use of the trail, has the potential to impact the frog."LiNeBrEaKThere could be as few as 18 frogs remaining in the area, according to tagging, Northrop said.LiNeBrEaKThe closed area is about 1,000 square acres, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Stanton Florea, compared to the forest's 655,000 total square acres.LiNeBrEaKBut the area is home to a popular rock climbing site and hiking trail. LiNeBrEaKTroy Mayr, a longtime rock climber, said the closure of Williamson Rock has presented a major loss to the rock climbing community.LiNeBrEaK"Climbers are working in conjunction with the forest service and trying to come up with a way to keep the species protected and allow climbing access," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut no local sites offer what Williamson Rock does - a wide variety of climbing routes in the midst of breathtaking scenery, Mayr said.LiNeBrEaKMayr, who formed Friends of Williamson Rock when the area was closed in 2005, said thousands of climbers would come every year from all over the world to Williamson.LiNeBrEaK"Our objective is to have the resource available to climbers while at the same time protecting the habitat of the frog, which is an endangered species," he said.LiNeBrEaKNorthrop said forestry officials are working to protect the frog's habitat while allowing use of the public land.

The Janesville Gazette (Wisconsin)  	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Commuters change their plans to accomodate snowy weather  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	769 words  	Jan. 12--JANESVILLE -- Jean Wilson doesn't enjoy driving in the snow, but she's prepared for it.LiNeBrEaKThe Janesville woman keeps a change of clothes, toiletries and an emergency kit in her car in case she's stranded at her Verona job or on the way home late at night.LiNeBrEaKShe has friends and relatives she can stay with in the Madison area, alternate routes to take to and from work and a four-wheel-drive truck she can drive when the roads are bad. LiNeBrEaK"I've always been pretty adventurous," she said. "The roads really don't scare me."LiNeBrEaKAuthorities tell people to stay off the roads during bad weather, but some people don't have the luxury of skipping work.LiNeBrEaKAfter Janesville broke a record for winter snowfall in 2007-08 and the record for monthly snowfall in December 2008, people who work out of town have learned to make emergency plans and alternate arrangements.LiNeBrEaKThe good news is, Janesville drivers won't necessarily be dealing with the snowy weather every year--or even the rest of this winter, a UW-Madison expert said.LiNeBrEaKJust because Janesville had a snowy December doesn't mean it will have a snowy January and February, said professor Jonathan Martin, chairman of the atmospheric and oceanic sciences department.LiNeBrEaK"Last year's winter was so unusual in the persistent nature of storm traffic going right over us," Martin said. "You could never have expected that to happen."LiNeBrEaKSome experts have said climate change will cause more extreme weather in coming years, but it's too soon to tie last year's winter to global warming, Martin said.LiNeBrEaK"To pin that on global climate change is very tenuous," he said.LiNeBrEaKStill, Janesville residents are preparing for the next storm.LiNeBrEaKSandra Berger worked out a deal with her Madison employer that she can work from home when the weather is bad.LiNeBrEaKBerger, a paralegal, has a "virtual desk" on her home computer that lets her do many tasks she does at work.LiNeBrEaK"It is (a relief), but it's also a tough determination that you're not abusing it," she said.LiNeBrEaKBerger worked from home a couple of times last year and has done it three times so far this winter, she said. But she feels bad for people inside and outside her company who can't work from home.LiNeBrEaK"It's difficult for people who do make the drive in, too, to think of people having the luxury of working from home," she said.LiNeBrEaKDawn Stomski doesn't have that option. She got a part-time job at the Janesville Mall in 2007 and hates driving in the snow from and to her Center Township home.LiNeBrEaK"I'm deathly afraid to drive in the snow, but it's even worse when the plowing is bad," she said.LiNeBrEaKShe missed work Dec. 19 because she didn't think she'd make it through the storm.LiNeBrEaK"I know how impossible it would be to get out there into town," she said.LiNeBrEaKStomski said she does the only thing she can do when the weather is bad: Drive carefully. She allows more time and drives slower, she said.LiNeBrEaK"There's no other way you can really go," she said.LiNeBrEaKBAD WEATHER DRIVINGLiNeBrEaKIf you have to drive in bad conditions, here are some tips from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation:LiNeBrEaK-- Dial 511, the state's new traffic line, or visit www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/index.htm to check on the latest road conditions. Dial 911 only for emergency situations.LiNeBrEaK-- Make sure your gas tank is full and you have food, blankets and warm clothes in the vehicle in case of emergency. If you have a cell phone, make sure it's fully charged and working.LiNeBrEaK-- Tell others about your travel route and schedule so they can call police and tell them where to look if you don't arrive at your destination.LiNeBrEaKKeep others informed if you're going to be late so they don't worry needlessly.LiNeBrEaK-- If possible, travel with passengers and convoy with other vehicles.LiNeBrEaK-- Remember, the speed limit is based on clear roads and dry pavement. Don't drive too fast for conditions.LiNeBrEaK-- Watch for slippery spots on bridges and overpasses.LiNeBrEaK-- Take note of mileposts, exit numbers or crossroads in case you crash or slide off the road so you can tell police and tow truck operators where to find you.LiNeBrEaK-- If the storm makes driving too hazardous or your car breaks down, stay in the vehicle. Run your engine and heater for short intervals to stay warm. Be sure to crack the window to avoid carbon monoxide build-up.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Renewable energy gets push in Florida Legislature  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	679 words  	Jan. 12--Florida electric companies would have to rely on an increasingly heavy mix of wind, solar and biomass to generate their power over the next 11 years, under a proposed rule state regulators voted to send to the Legislature late Thursday.LiNeBrEaKCalling their decision "historic," the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously voted to send the Legislature the proposal that calls for 20 percent of their fuel mix to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. They also agreed that consumers could be charged up to 3 percent more in order to jumpstart the market for the clean technologies. LiNeBrEaK"We want to be a leader in this country in solar and wind," said Public Service Commission Chairman Matthew Carter. "We want to establish a dynamic and vibrant marketplace."LiNeBrEaKThe commission's draft rule would require that 75 percent of the renewable energy fee go to finance solar and wind production and 25 percent go to finance biomass production.LiNeBrEaKThe financial incentive is needed, commissioners said, because developing these projects is expensive and they want companies to be willing to build them in Florida.LiNeBrEaKThe Legislature can approve or reject the recommendation before the rule takes effect. The recommendation is only a small piece in a large and complicated debate over how to spark investment into more environmentally-friendly energy sources and reduce Florida's contribution to climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe rule also recommends the following goals:LiNeBrEaK* 7 percent of the fuel used by power companies come from renewable energy sources by 2013, 18 percent by 2019 and 20 percent by 2020;LiNeBrEaK* commissioners will review the goals every three years;LiNeBrEaK* penalties for companies that fail to meet the goals;LiNeBrEaK"We have a long term commitment to it so these industries are going to come to Florida," Carter said. "We're going to have jobs. Florida's going to be a leader and we may even be able to export solar technology to other states...I'm all for leading."LiNeBrEaKThe vote was a victory for Gov. Charlie Crist who first recommended the "20 percent by 2020" standard and won plaudits from the environmental and alternative energy industires. But PSC staff concluded last year that that wasn't achievable until 2041. Florida got 3. 6 percent of its electricity from alternative energy as of 2007, the commission said.LiNeBrEaKThe commission hired a private consulting company, Navigant, to conduct a thorough study and market analysis. Navigant concluded that Florida could reach at least 24 percent of its energy portfolio from renewable energy by 2020 with the right incentives.LiNeBrEaKAt Crist's insistence, the 2008 Florida Legislature authorized the PSC to set the rule, but the Legislature gave itself the authority to approve or reject it. At the heart of the debate is the question of how fast Florida can develop solar and wind power at a reasonable cost to consumers and how much more to allow consumers to be charged to get the new technologies up and running.LiNeBrEaKCommissioner Lisa Edgar said that while she "doesn't generally like carve-outs," it may be necessary to charge customers more money to meet the 2020 goals.LiNeBrEaKCommissioner Nathan Skop agreed: "20 percent by 2020 is an ambitious goal and it's going to take money to get there," he said.LiNeBrEaK"We agree the people of Florida don't want to pay a lot for renewable energy," said Jerry Karnas of the Environmental Defense Fund. "But we also know they want renewable energy and they want a lot of it so the key is how do we get the most renewable energy for the least cost."LiNeBrEaKThe commission also recommended that the Legislature exclude nuclear energy from the 20 percent requirement, something Florida Power and Light and other large utility companies fought hard to get.

The New York Post 	January 12, 2009 Monday 	THE MTA'S MATRIX OF MUSH  	All Editions; Pg. 24  	403 words  	Fare hikes? Service cuts?  LiNeBrEaKWho, us?  LiNeBrEaKSeemingly oblivious to their agency's dire financial straits, top Metropolitan Transportation Authority brass strutted off to Washington last Thursday to unveil recommendations from the MTA's environmental "sustainability" commission - developed by outside consultants at a cost of a cool one million very scarce public dollars.   LiNeBrEaKThe commission proposes, among other nonsense, that the MTA:  LiNeBrEaK* Purchase 80 percent of its energy from "renewable" sources by 2050 - largely by supporting proposed wind farms off the New York City coastline.  LiNeBrEaK* "Flex its market power" to "help drive green production throughout the mid-Atlantic region."  LiNeBrEaK* Develop a "decision matrix" to figure out what to do once global warming raises sea levels (presumably covering Long Island and flooding the subway tunnels, thus rendering the MTA itself somewhat beside the point).  LiNeBrEaK* And give riders the option of paying extra to help fund its "green" initiatives when buying MetroCards, which no doubt they will do with gay abandon.  LiNeBrEaKWe'd rather the million bucks had gone to develop a "decision matrix" for regularly emptying subway-station trash barrels - but that wouldn't have spoken to the real reason for Thursday's jaunt to the capital: begging for federal bucks.  LiNeBrEaKThese days, you see, painting one's tin cup green is an attractive strategy to access the federal kitty.  LiNeBrEaKTo that end, the commission recommends that Congress (what else?) raise gas taxes by 40 cents a gallon and pour the dough into mass transit. (We sure hope the consultants didn't charge too much for that battered chestnut.)  LiNeBrEaKStill, given the head-scratching nature of most of their proposals, MTA chief Lee Sander and his deputies would probably have done better truly conserving energy - by staying home.  LiNeBrEaKIndeed, apart from some common-sensical energy-saving ideas, the report has little to say about actually running a transit system.  LiNeBrEaKThe commission is notably silent, moreover, about what any of this will cost - an important consideration, given that the MTA is eyeing both massive fare hikes and major service cuts.  LiNeBrEaKThat's because the MTA is facing steep upcoming deficits in both its operating and capital budgets that no conceivable federal bailout will ever plug.  LiNeBrEaKBut Washington might find Sander's lamentations easier to take if he spent more time running the trains and less money matrixing decisions.  LiNeBrEaKWe know we would.

The New York Times 	January 12, 2009 Monday   Late Edition - Final	2 Britons Die During Peak Ascent In the Alps  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 7  	568 words  	Even for a country with a long tradition of adventuring in the world's most hazardous terrains and oceans, Rob Gauntlett was a remarkable young man.LiNeBrEaK  Two years ago, at the age of 19, he became the youngest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Over 14 months beginning in 2007, he and a companion traveled 26,000 miles, from the North Pole  to the South Pole, through North, Central and South America, and then the South Atlantic and Antarctica, on skis, dogsleds, bicycles and an oceangoing sailboat, in a demonstration of what could be accomplished by ''natural'' means of transport, requiring no environmentally damaging engines.LiNeBrEaK  On Saturday, trying a notoriously dangerous ascent of the east face of the 13,937-foot Tacul peak in the Mont Blanc mountain range in the French Alps, Mr. Gauntlett, 21, fell hundreds of feet to his death with another young Briton, James Atkinson, also 21, the police in the French city of Grenoble said. Mr. Gauntlett's mother, Nicola Gauntlett, who traveled to the Alpine town of Chamonix on Sunday with his father, David, said the two young men had been ice-climbing during a two-week trip to the Alps. LiNeBrEaK  ''There was obviously a big fall and they both died,'' she told the Press Association, Britain's national press agency. ''We had spoken about something like this happening only recently. We are all just devastated.LiNeBrEaK  ''He's far too young to die.''LiNeBrEaK  Another 21-year-old, James Hooper, Mr. Gauntlett's companion on his Everest ascent in 2006, and on the journey across the continents and oceans, which ended in 2008, accompanied him on the mountaineering trip to France. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Hooper, who met Mr. Gauntlett at school in West Sussex, south of London, told the Press Association on Sunday that they had been joined on the trip by two less-experienced British climbers and that they had split up for the Tacul peak ascent so each of them could mentor one of the other climbers.LiNeBrEaK  In a BBC interview last year, Mr. Gauntlett described himself and Mr. Hooper as ''two normal guys'' whose ambition was to show that young people can achieve their ''dreams'' through effort and determination. LiNeBrEaK  ''We've tried to really kind of show that the impossible is nothing; you can actually achieve whatever you want,'' he said. ''And at the same time, we wanted to show how rapidly climate change, whether it be man-related or whatever, is affecting the sensitive areas of the world.''LiNeBrEaK  In a ceremony in November in Washington,  Mr. Gauntlett and Mr. Hooper were named the National Geographic Society's adventurers of the year for their journey between the poles. Mr. Gauntlett came close to death on that journey, falling between Arctic floes while skiing between Canada and Greenland, and suffering severe hypothermia that left him unconscious for three hours.LiNeBrEaK  A passing yacht rescued the two and helped Mr. Gauntlett reach a hospital.LiNeBrEaK  The two men continued on to New York, on a bicycle and sailing journey of thousands of miles to southern Chile.LiNeBrEaK  On Sunday, before the name of the other climber killed in the accident was made known by the French police, Mr. Gauntlett was remembered during a church service in the English country town of Petworth, near the Christ's Hospital School in West Sussex where he and Mr. Hooper met. LiNeBrEaK  ''This is very tragic news, but what a wonderful life he enjoyed, however short it turned out to be,'' said the vicar, the Very Rev. Michael Till.	http://www.nytimes.com  	MOUNTAINS (92%); SKIING (76%); WINTER SPORTS (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE (73%); POLICE FORCES (67%); EXTREME SPORTS (66%); INTERVIEWS (60%)  	NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (50%)  			LONDON, ENGLAND (54%) MOUNT EVEREST (94%); HIMALAYAS (94%); ALPS (94%); MONT BLANC (79%); ATLANTIC OCEAN (73%) UNITED KINGDOM (93%); SOUTH AMERICA (90%); FRANCE (87%); ANTARCTICA (72%); ENGLAND (58%); NORTH and SOUTH AMERICAS (55%)  	January 12, 2009  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO: Rob Gauntlett was the youngest Briton to climb Everest.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   Sunrise Edition	Mayor's 'mad scientist' experiment could backfire  	Editorial; Pg. ETP  	560 words  	SUMMARY: In combining city bureaus of planning and sustainability,LiNeBrEaKSam Adams risks diminishing both operationsLiNeBrEaKMayor's 'mad scientist'LiNeBrEaKexperiment could backfireLiNeBrEaKI t's sad saying goodbye this month to the city of Portland's visionary planning director, Gil Kelley. And it's especially disconcerting to see him depart at such a suspenseful moment in the city's history.LiNeBrEaKPortland, among the best-planned cities in the world, is about to embark on the Portland Plan, to guide the city over its next few decades. True, Kelley has been planning director for nine years, a record length of service for anyone in that job. LiNeBrEaKTrue, as well, mayors deserve to pick the planning directors of their choice. And Mayor Sam Adams had every right to move in a new direction. Yet we can't help feeling a sense of being stranded, midstory line.LiNeBrEaKIt would have been fascinating to see what Kelley, a creative force and quintessential "idea guy," would have done with the Portland Plan. Under former Mayor Tom Potter for four years, Kelley was wasted.LiNeBrEaKThe Bureau of Planning sometimes seemed to be in hibernation, since planning the built environment was never a priority for Potter. Adams, to his credit, has no intention of letting the bureau slide along on autopilot. In fact, he's moving in the opposite direction.LiNeBrEaKWith a wild gleam in his eye, Adams is undertaking a bureaucratic experiment that reminds us, somewhat unnervingly, of a backyard science project. He's heaving the venerable Bureau of Planning, and its roughly 90 employees, together with the Office of Sustainable Development, and its 40 to 50.LiNeBrEaKIt could work. The office, which handles solid waste and recycling and green building, knows something about good planning, since it has overseen the well-regarded city-county plans on global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Planning Bureau, likewise, knows a lot about sustainability. The implication of putting sustainability's Susan Anderson in charge is that the smaller bureau is swallowing the larger one. (But some ruffled feelings on this point were soothed, of late, by the announcement of the new name: the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability.)LiNeBrEaKUnder Adams' watchful eye, of course, everyone's making the right noises about synergies and blah-blah-blah. But whether this is a true merger or more of a collapse remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the very idea of the merger owes much to Kelley's blue-green vision for Portland.LiNeBrEaKKelley will be remembered for his work, across city departments, on the River Renaissance project. Adams even paid a kind of backhanded tribute to Kelley by spinning that project off as a new office of its own under city Commissioner Amanda Fritz.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to his work on the river, Kelley helped reimagine --and expand --Portland's downtown at both ends. Not only did he help with the Pearl District's transformation, he also pushed to transform North Macadam into the South Waterfront (even coming up with the name change).LiNeBrEaK"If it wasn't for him, the South Waterfront plan would not have been accepted," former Mayor Vera Katz said Friday. "I couldn't have done what I did without him."LiNeBrEaKIt will be up to Adams to ensure that the Portland Plan is strengthened, not diminished, by Kelley's departure, and by this merger. And up to Adams, as well, to ensure that if this experiment doesn't work, he has the courage to admit it, like a real scientist, and pull the plug.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   Sunrise Edition	Dirty little secret of 'dirty snow effect"  	Local News; Pg. a01  	846 words  	SUMMARY: Soot   | Pollution causes the snowpack to melt faster in spring, Northwest researchers sayLiNeBrEaKNorthwest researchers say 'dirty snow effect' magnifies early snowmelt Pollution erodes Western mountain snowpack sooner than it would have melted otherwise Dirty little secret of 'dirty snow effect" Study amongLiNeBrEaKfirst to look at LiNeBrEaKregional effectLiNeBrEaKMICHAEL MILSTEINLiNeBrEaKYou probably don't notice it, but tiny particles of pollution constantly rain down on mountain snow from diesel engines, power and manufacturing plant smokestacks, and other fossil-fuel-burning elements of modern life.LiNeBrEaKThe soot, almost invisible in the snow, absorbs more sunlight, heating the snow and melting it as much as a month earlier in spring, amplifying the effect of already rising temperatures, according to a new study by scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash.LiNeBrEaKThe warming effect of the soot --known to scientists as the "dirty snow effect" --melts away as much as 2 inches of snow in some parts of the West before it would have melted otherwise, computer modeling showed.LiNeBrEaKThat erodes mountain snowpacks that Western farmers and cities have long relied on as a critical reservoir of water. It leaves less snow to melt and fill rivers later in the spring and early summer, when water is most needed for agriculture and thirsty cities.LiNeBrEaKThe dirty snow effect compounds an already recognized trend of earlier snowmelt that scientists have connected to higher temperatures attributed to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe study is one of the first to examine the effect on a regional scale. It found that Oregon snow is relatively clean, melting only slightly because of soot, and snow in Washington, British Columbia, Idaho and the central Rocky Mountains is dirtier and melts much more.LiNeBrEaKThe soot initiates a troublesome cycle, by melting snow and exposing darker ground, which also absorbs more sunlight and warms, melting even more snow.LiNeBrEaK"You get a kind of runaway effect," said William Gustafson, an author of the study and an atmospheric scientist at the Richland laboratory, which is part of the Department of Energy. The study will be published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres.LiNeBrEaKHe said the dirty snow effect is still minor compared to the larger acceleration of spring snowmelt caused by warmer temperatures. Average annual temperatures in the Pacific Northwest increased 1. 5 degrees Fahrenheit between 1920 and 2003.LiNeBrEaKBut the influence of soot is large enough to alter streamflows in the Western United States and should be weighed by water managers. It's also worth considering the benefits from controlling pollution.LiNeBrEaK"It's still a small part of the whole puzzle," he said. "It's not going to save us from water shortages, but it's one contributor."LiNeBrEaKPollution responsible for the melting comes from both nearby sources and distant regions such as Asia, said Yun Qian, another atmospheric scientist at the lab and lead author of the study. The amount of soot hasn't changed much in recent years, but that could come.LiNeBrEaK"If we have more in the air, we also have more deposited on the snow," he said.LiNeBrEaKBecause the study is based on computer modeling that calculated the effect of soot, it's not precise, the authors said. Philip Mote, Washington's state climatologist, said that although the report is an interesting attempt to demonstrate the influence from soot, it cannot measure specific consequences.LiNeBrEaK"The emissions of soot and their changes over time are not well known, and consequently, their role in the observed changes in snowpack and streamflow over time cannot be quantitatively determined," said Mote, a key author of an international report on the effects of climate change on global snow and ice.LiNeBrEaKResearchers at the Richland lab used a computer model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., to zero in on the effects of soot-driven heating. They also developed software that predicts the behavior of pollution particles to determine how much soot falls on snow in Western mountain ranges.LiNeBrEaKThey then calculated how much darker soot makes snow and how that would translate into extra melting.LiNeBrEaKThe soot in so-called dirty snow probably would be imperceptible to people unless clean snow was next to it, Gustafson said.LiNeBrEaKThe soot drives an average temperature rise of about 1. 2 degrees Fahrenheit at the snow's surface over most of the snow-covered areas in the Western United States, the researchers found. That drives melting of as much as 2 inches of the water contained in snow, the research found.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers did not include other particles, such as dust or the soot from forest fires, that may also fall into snow and speed melting, Qian said. Mote also said that snow deteriorates over the course of winter, darkening on its own, so the results of the study may overstate the effect of soot alone.LiNeBrEaKResearchers hope to expand on the research by trying to calculate how much of the Northwest's eroding snowpack is caused by soot.LiNeBrEaK"This was just a first step," Qian said.LiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689; michaelmilstein@LiNeBrEaKnews.oregonian.com		RESEARCH (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); MOUNTAINS (89%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (89%); RESEARCH REPORTS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); METEOROLOGY (89%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (78%); CLIMATOLOGY (78%); WEATHER (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (78%); PARTICULATE MATTER (78%); TRENDS (76%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (76%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (75%); TEST LABORATORIES (73%); MODELING and SIMULATION (73%); COMPUTER SIMULATION (52%)  				WEST USA (93%); OREGON, USA (93%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); IDAHO, USA (79%); NORTHWEST USA (79%); ROCKY MOUNTAINS (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	MICHAEL MILSTEIN, The Oregonian  															
The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   Sunrise Edition	OIT's geothermal journey to the center of the earth  	Local News  	888 words  	SUMMARY: Energy   | The college in Klamath Falls looks to become the first campus powered entirely by a renewable sourceLiNeBrEaKCollege's journey to the center of the earth OIT aims to become the first campus powered entirely by a renewable geothermal source OIT's geothermal journeyLiNeBrEaKto the center of the earth 50 truckloads LiNeBrEaKof equipment,LiNeBrEaKpipe to arriveLiNeBrEaKABBY HAIGHTLiNeBrEaKFor decades, the Oregon Institute of Technology has drawn from the earth to warm its classrooms, heat its swimming pool and melt snow from its sidewalks.LiNeBrEaKNow the rumble of heavy equipment and the installation of a 150-foot-tall drilling tower signal the school's leap toward energy self-sufficiency. Within a year, OIT will become the first campus in the world powered entirely by its own renewable geothermal source.LiNeBrEaKThe massive drilling rig will punch into a geological fracture almost a mile below ground, tapping 300-degree water to feed a 1. 5-megawatt electrical plant. The $4. 5 million high-heat plant will produce enough energy to power the entire Klamath Falls campus --and then some.LiNeBrEaKThe project has ambitions beyond energy independence, though.LiNeBrEaKAt a total cost of about $8. 5 million, the plan includes a second, low-temperature power plant that can run on existing wells on the campus. Two large, heated aquaculture ponds and a pair of greenhouses will become incubators for researchers and companies that could bring industry to Klamath County.LiNeBrEaKAbove all, the project will be a giant classroom for students drawn to OIT's growing emphasis on renewable energy, said John Lund, director of the school's Geo-Heat Center.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to instrument the heck out of them because it's part of learning," said Lund, who envisions high school and younger students also learning from the geothermal array. "The investment the Oregon University System has made into it hopefully will be paid off."LiNeBrEaKEventually, the geothermal system could become part of a renewable energy "park" at OIT, where students will get hands-on experience with solar, wind and biofuels.LiNeBrEaKKlamath Falls has taken advantage of the area's geology by tapping into the earth's heat for more than a century, and more than 500 wells warm homes and businesses, municipal swimming pools and sidewalks.LiNeBrEaKThe Geo-Heat Center, housed in a small office lined with books and research papers, is internationally known and has advised companies locally and globally. It helped Klamath Basin Brewing Co. five years ago to become the first in the world to use geothermal energy for its brewing process. And nearby Liskey Farms uses geothermal wells to heat its leased greenhouses for fruits and vegetables and for a predator mite operation, as well as a canola crusher to process oil for biodiesel.LiNeBrEaKBut OIT's electric plants take geothermal use a step further, drilling into the same crack in the earth's crust that supplies 195-degree water at three existing campus wells.LiNeBrEaKUltrasound testing last spring brought the fault into sharp focus, like the image of a baby in its mother's womb. Although the drill can change direction, engineers hope to have a direct shot from the drilling site in the middle of campus. Water drawn from about 4,000 feet should be at least 300 degrees, Lund said, and provide the pressurized steam to turn the turbine in the power plant. Wastewater will be used in the campus heating system, the low-heat power plant or sold to other users.LiNeBrEaKThere is no guarantee they will strike hot water --for example, recent exploratory drilling at Newberry Crater near Bend revealed plenty of heat but no water. But Lund and others are fairly certain their deep well will hit liquid.LiNeBrEaK"If it's fractured, that means there are avenues for water to flow into it," Lund said. "And we know there's water in there because we've tapped into it."LiNeBrEaKThe drilling job itself is straightforward.LiNeBrEaK"It will be a challenge logistically rather than geologically," said Patrick Hanson, marketing specialist for driller ThermaSource. "This is a highly unique project for us because it's right in the middle of the university --and right in the middle of a parking lot of the university."LiNeBrEaKThermaSource, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., normally does large, multiwell projects in the wilderness, sometimes drilling more than two miles beneath the surface. But the company's founders have worked with Lund, assistant director Toni Boyd and the Geo-Heat Center over the years.LiNeBrEaK"We wanted to be a part of this," Hanson said. "We're a longtime networking friend of John and Toni, and it's definitely something we're interested in."LiNeBrEaKFifty truckloads of equipment and pipe are due to arrive on campus today. Deep drilling should begin later this week and will take about a month, running round-the-clock.LiNeBrEaKFunding comes from federal and state money, and the Oregon University System. OIT will seek an additional $1. 3 million from the Department of Energy during the next congressional session, and Lund said he expects private investors also will step forward.LiNeBrEaK"Once you have a well, the investors flock to you because the risk is gone," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe school already saves about $1 million annually in heating costs and plans to make about $200,000 by selling geothermal heat. The power plant will also cut $500,000 in electrical costs --and excess electricity could be sold to a commercial power company.LiNeBrEaKAbby Haight: 503-221-8133;LiNeBrEaKabbyhaight@news.oregonian.com		POWER PLANTS (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (89%); GEOTHERMAL ENERGY (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (88%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (88%); BIOMASS (78%); BIOFUELS (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); SPORTS and RECREATION FACILITIES and VENUES (75%); AQUACULTURE (65%); BREWERIES (60%)  				OREGON, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 13, 2009  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2009 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  	ABBY HAIGHT, The Oregonian  															
Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   FINAL EDITION	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	OPINION; Pg. 10A  	599 words  	No truly 'clean' energy, but nuclear comes closerLiNeBrEaKI am responding to your editorial "Nuclear power has benefits; being truly 'clean' isn't one."LiNeBrEaKAs an engineer who has worked in the energy industry for more than 22 years, I can tell you that "clean energy" should be considered an oxymoron similar to "jumbo shrimp." Solar cells require cadmium or arsenic, toxic heavy metals which do not have half-lives (i.e., they last forever). Wind requires more steel per unit energy delivered than nuclear power, and making steel is not environmentally friendly. In addition, for solar and wind to supply baseload power, they would require electric energy storage systems which remain prohibitively expensive. Merely being renewable is not a benefit if the expense of using it is excessive and the higher environmental costs apparent once these sources are scaled up. LiNeBrEaKWhile there are no truly "clean" energy sources, nuclear power represents a baseload source of electric generation with low greenhouse emissions. Though there is still debate on whether to recycle or directly dispose of the spent fuel, it has a very small volume and is safely managed. To limit the percentage of nuclear energy allowed to chase the clean energy chimera only will deny us and our children of a valuable energy technology that can truly generate the large amounts of lower-emission electricity our nation and the globe need.LiNeBrEaKROBERT S. MARGOLISLiNeBrEaKPalm Beach GardensLiNeBrEaKGay marriage supporters laboring under technicalityLiNeBrEaKTo those committed same-sex marriage advocates who have a misunderstanding of the massive objections to their use of the term marriage as defined for millennia, I offer the Campbell Soup Co. solution.LiNeBrEaKMy inquiry to the company as to how it can promote and label V8 juice as "100% Vegetable Juice" when the product's major ingredient is tomato, a pulpy berry, they responded: "The United States Supreme Court designates the tomato as a vegetable for trade purposes, though it is technically a fruit."LiNeBrEaKPerhaps, someday by designation of court, there will be a group advocacy movement to change the U.S. flag's colors from red, white, and blue to green, black, and purple without actually changing the flag's colors.LiNeBrEaKCONRAD C. JANKOWSKILiNeBrEaKJupiterLiNeBrEaKChange will take time; bailouts still Bush's babiesLiNeBrEaKIn regard to the letter "Vote for change leaves us with what's in our pockets," our problem is that people don't take the time to understand the world around them. We voted for change, but the change hasn't taken place yet, a fact that the writer has missed. The AIG, bank and auto industry bailouts are happening on Mr. Bush's watch, not under the changed leadership the country voted for. Perhaps the writer needs a lesson in civics. He certainly needs to be a bit more thoughtful before making such a ridiculous complaint.LiNeBrEaKMICHAEL MERKERLiNeBrEaKLake WorthLiNeBrEaKDid writer forget? Bush still in charge until 1/20LiNeBrEaKThe writer of "Vote for change leaves us with what's in our pockets" (Jan. 7) must be at that "certain age."

Change begins on Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaKCHARLES MOSOLFLiNeBrEaKJuno BeachLiNeBrEaKJeb should steer clear until W.'s dust has settledLiNeBrEaKJeb Bush's decision not to vie for a Senate seat was one of his more intelligent ones. With his brother finally leaving the White House, after serving eight disastrous years, the voters need a break from any Bush in or near the nation's Capitol.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   SOONER EDITION	REPORT ASKS GREAT CARE BE TAKEN BEFORE STORING CARBON DIOXIDE  	HEALTH, SCIENCE, MEDICINE and TECHNOLOGY; Pg. B-1  	632 words  	The Obama administration should create a new commission with broad powers to regulate carbon dioxide capture and storage by utilities and industries that is needed to rein in climate change, according to a report unveiled last week in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKThe 150-page report by an academic and legal team headed by Carnegie Mellon University's Dr. M. Granger Morgan said a Federal Carbon Sequestration Commission would bring order to new and potentially chaotic regulation of efforts to keep carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere and, instead, store them deep underground. LiNeBrEaKThe commission could also help resolve legal questions about ownership and use of suitable rock formations more than a half mile below the surface for storing the carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKDr. Morgan, who briefed congressional and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staffers on the report Friday, said if the U.S. is to meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 80 percent by the end of the century, it will need to employ carbon capture and storage technologies along with a host of low-carbon solutions, but the process must be efficient, safe and effective.LiNeBrEaK"Let's not try to enact definitive regulation until some of the commercial scale carbon capture operations are up and running," Dr. Morgan said. "The commission should wait to draw lessons from the first handful of carbon capture and sequestration projects so regulations aren't enacted today that turn out to be counterproductive in the long run."LiNeBrEaKCarbon capture and storage, or CCS, is the process of collecting carbon dioxide before it is emitted into the atmosphere, compressing it into a liquid and then pumping it deep underground into depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep coal seams, salt formations or under the ocean floor, where it will do much less harm.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the report, produced by a team of investigators from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Minnesota, the Vermont Law School and the Washington, D.C.-based energy law firm Van Ness Feldman, geoscientists believe the risks associated with sequestration are modest and can be readily managed. And even if there is some leakage of carbon dioxide back to the surface, risks to humans will be minimal.LiNeBrEaKThe report also said all the technologies required for capture, transport and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide exist but have not yet been applied to emissions controls.LiNeBrEaKBut a proposed EPA rule for regulating the application of those technologies, developed under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act, doesn't address the legal questions surrounding access to and use of the deep geological formations.LiNeBrEaK"EPA's focus has been too narrow," Dr. Morgan said. "We need to resolve access to pore space, where carbon dioxide can be stored, in deep sub-surface formations and also address questions of liability."LiNeBrEaKWorldwide, man-made carbon dioxide emissions, primarily from coal-burning power plants and other fossil-fuel burning sources, have increased from an insignificant amount 200 years ago to more than 33 billion tons a year, with 8. 8 billion tons of that produced by the U.S. Those carbon dioxide emissions have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere, trapping radiant heat from the sun and causing global warming and potentially unhealthy changes in regional climates.LiNeBrEaK"If we are going to save coral reefs, many national parks and all the world's other valuable ecosystems, we have got to cut CO2 emissions by roughly 80 percent," Dr. Morgan said. "Because of our heavy use of fossil fuels, there's no way to get there without carbon capture and sequestration, but we have to do it right."LiNeBrEaKThe report, funded by a $1. 85 million grant from the New York-based Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, can be viewed at www.ccsreg.org/working_papers.html.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   Metro Edition	MATTEL, PLEASE CURE BARBIE OF RICKETS  	EXTRA; Pg. 6  	358 words  	I have it on good authority that Mattel is going to change Barbie's image and maybe more.LiNeBrEaKI think we can look upon this news as good, although the toy company hadn't said anything as I went to press. LiNeBrEaKHow about that? Going to press. Having ink in your veins.LiNeBrEaKI have lots of blood tests these days, and as far as I know, a group of doctors hasn't gathered around my bedside, one of them saying: "My God. He's got ink in his blood."LiNeBrEaKGoing to press these days means pushing a couple of buttons on the old computer and sending your copy downtown.LiNeBrEaKWell, that's the way it's supposed to happen, but I recently accidentally sent a picture of a nice little puppy I'd never seen before instead of a slashing piece of satire aimed at getting the country on the right road again.LiNeBrEaKAs far as I know, I'm still getting paid.LiNeBrEaKAnyway, we have gone far from the subject of this slashing bit of satire aimed at changes to Barbie.LiNeBrEaKWithout the help of the toy company, Old No. 36 remains on his own as far as guessing what these changes will be.LiNeBrEaKI think that they may make Barbie a little fleshier. I always thought the poor kid was suffering from rickets or scurvy or something.LiNeBrEaKHer knees looked like an advertisement for a replacement, and Twiggy could have beaten her up on the playground at lunch.LiNeBrEaKI didn't know how she had the strength to shift the gears in her sports car -- never mind operating as a brain surgeon.LiNeBrEaKCome on, a size 8 is fine.LiNeBrEaKAnd I hope they will take Ken out of those silly tennis clothes and make him look like Clint Eastwood when old Clint was younger.LiNeBrEaKI mean, if ever there was a guy who needed a break, it's old Ken. I hope the toy company knows the hell this guy has gone through.LiNeBrEaKI also hope they make Barbie a little more interested in global warming and in the wars that we are currently fighting.LiNeBrEaKWhen I was a boy, we had one war at a time and that way we tended to win -- without surges and stuff like that.LiNeBrEaKAnd I hope that somebody will apologize to all those mothers who used to ruin their eyes by sewing new Barbie outfits -- sequins and all.LiNeBrEaKAnd I hope that Barbie will admit that she is too old to be a doll anymore.LiNeBrEaKBoy, I hope this satire was slashing.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Stanford announces $100 million energy institute  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	614 words  	Jan. 12--Stanford University has received $100 million to create a new energy institute where scholars can study everything from solar cells to energy markets and economics.LiNeBrEaKThe institute will expand Stanford's role in energy research and national energy policy. It will consolidate Stanford's existing energy-focused efforts onto one site -- and allow the hiring of new faculty, support additional graduate students and offer seed money for major research projects.LiNeBrEaKThe donations came from three alumni who said they were motivated by the desire to protect the environment from greenhouse gases, improve energy efficiency and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. LiNeBrEaKOil and gas executive Jay Precourt donated $50 million to create what will be called the Precourt Institute for Energy. Farallon Capital Management partner Thomas Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, gave $40 million to create a new research center within that institute, the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. The final $10 million came from other donors.LiNeBrEaK"These generous gifts will help us overcome the enormous challenges that we are facing in energy research," Stanford President John Hennessy said at a Monday news conference. "It will create an independent institute for researchers on campus and around the world."LiNeBrEaKWhile commending the role that Silicon Valley has played in supporting alternative energy companies, "it needs some new discoveries," Hennessy said. "We need toLiNeBrEaKbe working on new technologies."LiNeBrEaKThe new institute will be directed Lynn Orr, professor of energy resources engineering and director of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project. He plans to pull together 136 faculty members in 21 departments to create interdisciplinary projects.LiNeBrEaKOrr will start recruiting new professors almost immediately, he said. He will also encourage graduate students to apply for the 20 new fellowships available at the institute.LiNeBrEaKAn even larger $500 million energy institute supports work at the University of California-Berkeley, but it is controversial because it's supported by international energy company BP and industry scientists collaborate on research.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked about Precourt's resume -- he's a former oil and gas executive -- Hennessy said the new program is an "independent institute."LiNeBrEaKStanford's new gifts are among the largest ever received by the university to support academic and research programs -- rather than new building construction, Hennessy said. Because of the downturn in the economy and Stanford's shrinking endowment, it could have taken a decade to create the needed program using the existing funds, he said.LiNeBrEaKOther recent gifts from alumni include a $75 million pledge in 2007 by Jerry Yang, co-founder and a director of the Internet search engine Yahoo and his wife, Akiko Yamazaki. Of that, $50 million was used to build the Environment and Energy Building, which will house the new Precourt Institute for Energy. In 2006, Stanford University trustee Ward Woods and his wife, Priscilla, committed $30 million for what is now named the Woods Institute for the Environment. The energy institute will work in tandem with Woods' environmental researchers; the two are in the same building.LiNeBrEaKContact Lisa M. Krieger at lkrieger@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5565.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   FINAL Edition		Datebook; Pg. E2  	504 words  	RATING: ALERT VIEWERSincerity Forever: Drama. By Mac Wellman. Directed by Megan Soto. With Jessica Kitchens, Alanna Coby, Ben Fisher, Khamara Pettus et al. Through Jan. 17. Brava Theater Center, 2781 24th St., San Francisco. 65 minutes. Tickets: $10-$25. Call 415 647-2822 or go to www.brava.org.  LiNeBrEaKSincerity is a much overvalued commodity, a handy excuse for all kinds of acts of ignorance, racism and homophobia. As the teenage Ku Klux Klansmen and women of Mac Wellman's "Sincerity Forever" put it - between sessions of premarital sexual activity straight and not and scoffing at believers of global warming and the Holocaust - "The most important thing is not what you know, but whether you're sincere or not."LiNeBrEaKWellman wrote "Sincerity" in 1990 and dedicated it to Sen. Jesse Helms "for the fine job you are doing of destroying civil liberties" and fundamentalist Donald Wildmon. The Brava Theater Center revival that opened Friday makes it look more timely than ever in the wake not only of Proposition 8, but also the election of Barack Obama. After all, when Jesus H. Christ shows up to excoriate moral blindness, she's black.LiNeBrEaKNot that "Sincerity" makes any kind of straightforward argument. Wellman can be among the most convoluted of playwrights, mixing heady arias of wordplay and esoteric references with cartoon-ish characters in a nonlinear framework. Staging "Sincerity" is no easy task, and it's to Megan Soto's credit that she evokes as much of Wellman's humor, anger and thought as she does in her directorial debut as part of Brava's new Emerging Artist program.LiNeBrEaKSoto's is a bare-bones staging, with a low-budget set and semi-professional cast in Brava's upstairs, converted-classroom second stage. Two modestly upholstered chairs serve as the car seats where most of the action takes place for the usual teen rituals of tentative automotive bonding and courting - though the kids' Klan robes and peaked hats add an eerie subtext to their ramblings.LiNeBrEaKAlanna Coby's somewhat reticent Molly and Jessica Kitchens' delightfully earnest Judy confide their ignorance, religious doubts, crushes and belief in sincerity. Chris McDonald's good old boy Tom and Michael Barrett Austin's bumptious, preacherly Hank mirror the girls' conversation with some more disturbing undertones amid the comedy. Judy and Ben Fisher's distracted George engage in some heavy first-date groping while he describes his father's death.LiNeBrEaKSoto can't always resist trying to layer comic action on top of the humor in the dialogue, sometimes to negative effect. There are times when less moving about would yield more direct impact. For the most part, though, she and her actors capture the heart of the piece, as Wellman creates more distorted fun-house mirrors of those first few scenes, with two scabrous, demonic Furballs Alden Moore and Madeline H.D. Brown contributing hilariously foul-mouthed rants.LiNeBrEaKAnd when Khamara Pettus' sharp and sassy Christ delivers her sermon on the nearest mound, "Sincerity" puts small-mindedness in cosmic perspective.

LiNeBrEaKThe air board is among the most powerful agencies in the state. With 11 members appointed by the governor, it sets pollution rules on a wide variety of issues, including diesel regulation, auto emissions standards, gasoline chemistry and most recently, global warming regulation. Members receive travel expenses, but no salary, and must be confirmed by the state Senate.LiNeBrEaKEstablished in 1967, the board has often set regulations that have been adopted by other states and the nation, including banning leaded gasoline, requiring the first auto engine standards and other measures.LiNeBrEaKYeager is a member of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the Association of Bay Area Governments, the California State Association of Counties Climate Change Task Force, the Santa Clara County Health Authority, the Valley Transportation Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.LiNeBrEaKAn avid triathlete and environmentalist, he previously served on the San Jose City Council from 2001 to 2006, and before that taught political science at San Jose State University.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	January 12, 2009 Monday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	MILESTONES AND MISSTEPS  	NATIONAL; Pg. 4A  	393 words  	Here are the high and low points in the first half of Gov. Charlie Crist's term:LiNeBrEaK- EVERGLADES: With a last-minute lobbying effort from his honeymoon suite, the governor secured water managers' approval for his $1. 3-billion plan to buy land from U.S. Sugar. Environmentalists hail it as a pivotal step to accelerating restoration of the Everglades, even though financial and legal hurdles remain. LiNeBrEaK- VOTING: He insisted on a switch to paper ballots in early 2007, which boosted public confidence in vote counting and led to a smooth election in '08.LiNeBrEaK- CLEMENCY: He streamlined a clemency process that allows some ex-felons to restore their civil rights more quickly. It took another year, however, to eliminate other hurdles that kept many felons from being able to register to vote.LiNeBrEaK- CLIMATE CHANGE: An aggressive plan to require new cars sold in Florida to comply with strict new emissions standards was approved by environmental regulators after intense lobbying by the governor's staff, but implementation could be delayed because the Legislature must vote. Lawmakers also put the brakes on the governor's ambitious timetable requiring power companies to use renewable energy.LiNeBrEaK- PROPERTY INSURANCE: Neither his promise to reduce the cost of windstorm insurance nor his threat to sue property insurance companies got much traction. The second year without a major hurricane helped ease rates, and 40 private insurers have taken thousands of policies out of Citizens, the state-run insurer. But the market is still unstable, and the state doesn't have the money to cover Citizens' costs if a major hurricane hits.LiNeBrEaK- GAMBLING:A compact to allow slot machines and table games at seven casinos of the Seminole Tribe of Florida led the Legislature to file suit for cutting the deal without them. The state Supreme Court sided with lawmakers, delivering Crist's most conspicuous defeat to date. He'll now seek legislative approval in March, but the state missed out on collecting $100-million from the tribe last year.LiNeBrEaK- TAXES: Property taxes didn't "drop like a rock" as he promised, but property values did; the voter-approved increase in the homestead exemption helped, but nobody got the forecast savings.LiNeBrEaK- TRAVEL: A lavish trade mission to Europe in July produced a torrent of criticism at home, few immediate trade wins, and partisan cries of "Empty Chair Charlie."

Tonawanda News (North Tonawanda, New York)  	January 12, 2009 Monday 	FISHING: Kenmore native makes profitable living on Alaskan seas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	545 words  	Jan. 12--When people in the Tonawandas are complaining about winter weather, Charles Wilkins is braving minus 40 degree weather and 40 mile per hour winds on the Bering Sea.LiNeBrEaKWilkins left Kenmore last year, looking for an adventurous and lucrative job. He found just that on board the Arctic Star, a fishing ship that trolls the chilly waters near the Arctic Circle.LiNeBrEaKWilkins' father, Dan, said his son inquired about the career after seeing the TV show "Deadliest Catch," which features the exploits of similar fishing boats doing the dangerous work. LiNeBrEaK"He applied for the job on-line through Seattle's Icicle Seafoods," Dan said.LiNeBrEaKAfter making his own way to Seattle, the company flew Wilkins to Anchorage and then to the port of Dutch Harbor on the Aleutian island chain.LiNeBrEaK"They had to come in like a corkscrew," Dan said. "He said it was the most terrifying thing he's ever done in a plane."LiNeBrEaKA helicopter carried him out to a processing boat, where he was initially assigned. But before long Wilkins made his way onto a fishing boat, where he operates the boat's crane and helps package the fish and crabs they catch.LiNeBrEaKWork starts at 6 a.m. and stops at 10 p.m., seven days a week. And there's no alcohol allowed on the ship to warm them up.LiNeBrEaK"He'd like to know where the global warming is," Dan joked.LiNeBrEaKThe work is tough, as the boats are tossed around by the high winds on rough seas. Setting and hauling half-ton crab pots as the boat battles the waves is dangerous work, but the pay is good and in such a tough economy few can claim such a secure, well-paying job. Dan said leaving the Buffalo area and all of his friends wasn't an easy decision for his son, just as it wasn't easy for him to travel all over the country during his radio career. But when Wilkins returns in a few years, he'll have enough money to start a life.LiNeBrEaK"You just have to look at what's best for you in the field you pick," Dan said.LiNeBrEaKIn the meantime, Wilkins has taken in plenty of interesting sights and places that few in his hometown will ever experience. The boats take long trips out so far north that he can see the ice cap, in an area where eagles are as plentiful in the sky as sparrows. When the ship finally comes into port at St. Paul Island, Dan said the small population of 500 residents treats the fishermen like celebrities.LiNeBrEaKWilkins' family sends him things Buffalo-centric items he just can't get up there, including sauces from Chiavetta's and Old Man River, where Wilkins once worked.LiNeBrEaKWhen the fishing area freezes in mid-February, Wilkins is planning a trip home to see his family and friends. Until then, it's tough to for him to get phone calls home, but he checks his e-mail as often as he can. His dad said folks who know Charles should feel free to send him an e-mail at beringsea716@yahoo.com since he's still curious about what's going on in his hometown.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	January 12, 2009 Monday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	in Western Va., firm aims to convert gas to electricity  	LOCAL; Pg. B2  	223 words  	By Jeff SturgeonLiNeBrEaKThe Roanoke TimesLiNeBrEaKCHRISTIANSBURGLiNeBrEaKA "green energy" company believes it can make a little money for itself and help local government and the environment by making electricity from landfill gas . LiNeBrEaKThe lease has been signed for Green KW Energy to install a generator fueled only by the gas rising from within the Mid-County Landfill in Christiansburg.LiNeBrEaKThe Montgomery Regional Solid Waste Authority attracted Green KW after an investigation revealed the closed landfill, holding 1 million tons of household and commercial waste deposited mostly during the 1980s and 1990s, will ooze a naturally occurring gaseous mixture containing flammable methane for the next 15 years.LiNeBrEaKThe authority burns the methane to keep it from being released as an agent of global climate change.LiNeBrEaKAt a cost of $350,000 to $400,000, Green KW plans to install a methane-fired engine and generator atop the landfill rated to produce 265 kilowatts of electricity. That's enough to power about 100 homes.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said 456 such projects operate in the United States, 20 of them in Virginia.LiNeBrEaKMethane from the Southeastern Public Service Authority's regional landfill in Suffolk is used by a chemical company. And the company has proposed a $26 million co-generation plant to produce electricity and steam from the landfill's methane.

The Washington Times 	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Obama climate czar has socialist ties;  Group sees 'global governance' as solution 	PAGE ONE; A01  	1102 words  	Until last week, Carol M. Browner, President-elect Barack Obama's pick as global warming czar, was listed as one of 14 leaders of a socialist group's Commission for a Sustainable World Society, which calls for "global governance" and says rich countries must shrink their economies to address climate change.LiNeBrEaKBy Thursday, Mrs. Browner's name and biography had been removed from Socialist International's Web page, though a photo of her speaking June 30 to the group's congress in Greece was still available. LiNeBrEaKSocialist International, an umbrella group for many of the world's social democratic political parties such as Britain's Labor Party, says it supports socialism and is harshly critical of U.S. policies.LiNeBrEaKThe group's Commission for a Sustainable World Society, the organization's action arm on climate change, says the developed world must reduce consumption and commit to binding and punitive limits on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama, who has said action on climate change would be a priority in his administration, tapped Mrs. Browner last month to fill a new position as White House coordinator of climate and energy policies. The appointment does not need Senate confirmation.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama's transition team said Mrs. Browner's membership in the organization is not a problem and that it brings experience in U.S. policymaking to her new role.LiNeBrEaK"The Commission for a Sustainable World Society includes world leaders from a variety of political parties, including British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who succeeded Tony Blair, in serving as vice president of the convening organization," Obama transition spokesman Nick Shapiro said.LiNeBrEaK"Carol Browner was chosen to help the president-elect coordinate energy and climate policy because she understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies; cooperation between federal, state and local governments; and partnership with the private sector," Mr. Shapiro said in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKMrs. Browner ran the Environmental Protection Agency under President Clinton. Until she was tapped for the Obama administration, she was on the board of directors for the National Audubon Society, the League of Conservation Voters, the Center for American Progress and former Vice President Al Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection.LiNeBrEaKHer name has been removed from the Gore organization's Web site list of directors, and the Audubon Society issued a press release about her departure from that organization.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans said Mrs. Browner's work with Socialist International raises questions.LiNeBrEaK"Does she agree with the group's positions on global governance - that the United States should abdicate its international leadership to international organizations? Does she support its position that the international community should be the ultimate arbiter of climate change policy?" said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican.LiNeBrEaK"These are questions that merit answers - especially when you consider this group's deep skepticism about America's ability to be a force for positive change in the world," she said.LiNeBrEaKAn aide on the Obama team said its information shows that Mrs. Browner resigned from the organization in June 2008. The aide, who asked not to be named because he was discussing internal matters, said the transition team was aware she had been a member of the group when she was vetted.LiNeBrEaKThe Socialist International Web site didn't have a copy of her June 30 speech, but the agenda for the meeting had her scheduled to speak as part of a panel on "How do we strengthen the multilateral architecture for a sustainable future?"LiNeBrEaKOther panel participants were Sergey Mironov, speaker of the Russian legislature's upper chamber and a close ally of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin; Zhang Zhijun, vice minister of the International Department of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee; and Jesus Caldera, a former Minister of Employment and Social Affairs of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party.LiNeBrEaKA woman answering the phone at Socialist International's headquarters in London said all officers were traveling.LiNeBrEaKNobody from the organization returned a message left Friday.LiNeBrEaKSocialist International bills itself as the world body of democratic socialist movements. It includes members ranging from Israel's Labor Party and France's Socialist Party to Angola's MPLA, which won the 1970s Angolan civil war with the aid of Soviet arms and Cuban troops.LiNeBrEaKThe organization distinguishes itself from violent or revolutionary communist parties. However, some such groups, including the Chinese Communist Party, have been invited to its events as guest organizations.LiNeBrEaKThe Democratic Socialists of America, not the Democratic Party, is listed as the group's U.S. representative. But Mrs. Browner was listed as an individual member of Socialist International, but not a member of the DSA.LiNeBrEaKWhile agreeing with Mr. Obama on the need for action to address climate change, the organization wants more draconian policies than the president-elect's preferred solution.LiNeBrEaKDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama called for a cap-and-trade system to control carbon emissions. He argued that such a system is efficient and lets the free market determine where it's easiest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKSocialist International says such "flexible mechanisms" do not clamp down hard enough on polluters.LiNeBrEaKThe organization often takes a decidedly critical view of the U.S.LiNeBrEaKAt this summer's meeting, the group issued a statement on economics that blasted the "neo-liberal market ideology and the unilateralist, U.S.-dominated approach in the global economic system," and attacked the U.S. for dominating international financial institutions.LiNeBrEaKAt its meeting earlier in 2008 in Santiago, Chile, Socialist International endorsed "global governance" as the solution to the world's problems of peace and climate change.LiNeBrEaKAt a July meeting in St. Petersburg, the commission said developed countries "should think of decreasing current consumption levels" - which would mean shrinking their economies - in order to help the environment.LiNeBrEaKSocialist International regularly blasts the construction of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. The fence was approved by both houses of Congress, including with Mr. Obama's vote in the Senate.LiNeBrEaKSocialist International was congratulatory when Mr. Obama won the election, issuing a statement noting that "the sky may seem a bit brighter today" but warning still that "there are enormous global challenges that must be addressed effectively and without delay."

The Washington Times 	January 12, 2009 Monday 	Farewell to George Bush, the president and the man  	NATION; PURPLE NATION; A04  	1205 words  	The headline of this column bidding George W. Bush farewell as our 43rd president refers to him as a president and as a man. And that is my central point: I have strong disagreements with Mr. Bush on policies and politics; but I have respect and affection for him as a person, going back to our years as friends at Yale College in the 1960s.LiNeBrEaKMy policy differences with Mr. Bush as president are major.LiNeBrEaKI thought his tax cuts favored the wealthy and were ill-advised. They helped convert a trillion-dollar surplus left behind by Bill Clinton, with some help from a Republican Congress, and converted it into hundreds of billions of dollars of red ink, even without accounting for the Iraq war and this past fall's economic meltdown. LiNeBrEaKI strongly disagreed with his decision to go into Iraq pre-emptively. And I still think, despite progress and some signs of stability and democracy in Iraq for which he deserves credit, that the war was not worth the lives lost or the hundreds of billions spent, with little sign that it had any effect on the war against terror and seems to have had a greater effect of empowering Iran in the region.LiNeBrEaKI was disappointed by Mr. Bush's apparent indifference to the dangers of global warming and to those in his administration who seemed to care more about ideology and the economic interests of the Republican Party base than science and facts.LiNeBrEaKI worried that, in the name of waging war on terror, Mr. Bush had allowed his Justice Department to approve actions without a sound legal basis, such as torture, renditions, indefinite imprisonment at Guantanamo, warrantless surveillance, and other actions in the name of the war on terrorism that I think have blemished America's reputation around the world as a nation of laws and constitutional principles.LiNeBrEaKBut I also think it is unfair not to give Mr. Bush the benefit of the doubt that he did these things sincerely, believing they were legal under the circumstances and helped protect America from another terrorist attack. And I believe, to be fair, he deserves some credit that no such attack has occurred since Sept. 11, 2001.LiNeBrEaKAnd to give credit where credit is due, Mr. Bush also at times exhibited what President John F. Kennedy defined as political courage - the willingness to stand on principle against the base of your own party. He did so on such issues as comprehensive immigration reform, providing more than 40 million seniors with Medicare-covered prescription-drug benefits, and "No Child Left Behind."LiNeBrEaKRegarding the latter, despite all the valid criticism that it was too driven by teaching-for-testing and a lack of adequate funding, it should be remembered that the liberal icon and hero Sen. Edward M. Kennedy stood with Mr. Bush at the White House in the early days of his administration to co-sponsor this legislation and still supports this program, because it did produce dramatic improvements in public school performance and accountability in certain respects, particularly among inner-city minorities and poor children.LiNeBrEaKFinally, lest we forget, Mr. Bush was also willing to touch the third rail of American politics still avoided by most Democrats - Social Security reform. His proposal that would have allowed individuals to divert a percentage of their contributions to Social Security to investments in the stock market would have added more than $1 trillion to the system's deficit. Obviously, given the market's recent historic plunge, it is just as well the proposal was DOA.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Bush is the first president to suggest the rather liberal concept of some form of needs-based consideration in Social Security entitlements. He raised the question of why it made sense for a billionaire to receive a check he does not need whereas the working poor receive a check much less than they need. This was Mr. Bush's "Nixon to China" moment: No Democrat would have dared make such a progressive proposal, even though we secretly were cheering him on.LiNeBrEaKAnd now to address Mr. Bush the man.LiNeBrEaKI have written before about his basic decency and empathy as a person, hearkening back to an incident I recall vividly during Yale days when we were both residents within the small community of Davenport College. We were hanging out one night when a classmate of mine, who was obviously gay, walked by. Someone made a nasty crack. Mr. Bush snapped, "knock it off" or something to that effect - "why don't you try walking in his shoes and seeing how it feels."LiNeBrEaKI remembered this incident more than once as I watched with dismay Mr. Bush allowing his political advisers to use gay marriage as a polarizing political tool to help him win re-election in 2004. But I also knew that Mr. Bush had provided tens of millions of dollars to Africans suffering from AIDS or other diseases.LiNeBrEaKI know him as a kind man who reaches out to friends in good times and bad, a husband and father who loves his family, and a son whose love and devotion to his mom and dad are profound.LiNeBrEaKAnd, finally, I know him as a president who can talk to a particular 10-year-old I know and make him feel important and not patronized. That 10-year-old is my son, Josh.LiNeBrEaKJosh came home one night from school and asked me whether it was really true that I knew and liked both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush, because his friends thought that was impossible. Weren't Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush presidents from different political parties, he asked? Aren't you a Democrat like Mr. Clinton? How can you be friends with Mr. Bush, too?LiNeBrEaKHe seemed skeptical that that was possible. I saw it as a challenge from my 10-year-old. So the next day, I sent a note to Mr. Bush, told him about Josh's skepticism, and asked whether I could bring Josh over to meet him.LiNeBrEaKA few weeks later, Josh was sitting in the Oval office with Mr. Bush. My wife and I were standing away, against the wall, not included in the conversation. We watched with amazement as the president and our 10-year-old engaged in what was apparently a serious conversation for 10 minutes or more.LiNeBrEaKThen the president reached into his desk drawer and took out a baseball (Josh is a pretty good baseball player, as was Mr. Bush when he was at Yale) and signed it. We overheard the president tell Josh how frightened he had been when he had to throw the first ball out in Yankee Stadium after 9/11, choosing to do so from the pitching mound. He told Josh that he feared - as Derek Jeter had warned him after a practice session in the player's tunnel leading to the field - that he might throw the ball into the dirt and embarrass himself.LiNeBrEaKJosh laughed, appreciating why that would be embarrassing to a baseball player.LiNeBrEaKWhen we were done, young Josh said goodbye with a firm handshake, a smile, and a clear, "Thank you, Mr. President." As we walked out of the West Wing, I asked Josh what he thought about Mr. Bush. "He's cool," was the reply, Josh's ultimate compliment.LiNeBrEaKNow do you understand, I asked him, why I can disagree with him, vote against him, but still like him? Josh nodded, yes.LiNeBrEaKMission accomplished.LiNeBrEaK* Lanny Davis, a Washington lawyer and former special counsel to President Clinton, served as a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board from 2006 to 2007.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   Main Edition	YOUR OPINIONS;  READERS WRITE 	@ISSUE; Pg. 20A  	896 words  	Higher taxes on gasolineLiNeBrEaKResponses to "Gas tax only exit off bad road," @issue, Jan. 4LiNeBrEaKTruck sales only a temporary excuseLiNeBrEaKThomas Friedman's opinion column is, to quote Zbigniew Brzezinski, "stunningly superficial," as it is based on the premise that the rise in truck sales that we saw last month will turn into an enduring trend. Friedman's premise is flawed.LiNeBrEaKGM is trying to find a buyer for the Hummer brand (as of now they cannot find one) and has canceled the next generation Suburban and Tahoe. That rise in truck sales last month comes as manufacturers are dumping inventory at discounts of up to $20,000. Once that inventory is exhausted, it will not be replaced. Though we have seen a marketing push by Chrysler and Ford on their Ram and F-150 trucks respectively, they are simply trying to sell off the vehicles they have produced. If Friedman wants to institute a draconian gas tax, he should find a better excuse. LiNeBrEaKCHRISTOPHER RAISSILiNeBrEaKMariettaLiNeBrEaKEnergy tax serves power tripLiNeBrEaKA tax imposed by a bloated, corrupt government will not solve anything but that government's voracious appetite for increased revenue to allocate for the purpose of remaining in power. Thomas Friedman refuses to see how Americans have been blued and tattooed by the manipulated cost of energy. There are obvious alternatives to a crippling tax, such as increased exploration and nuclear power under reasonable and necessary control. Carbon taxes are simply the seizure of money for redistribution, period. Climate change is in the hands of the Lord perhaps, but certainly not to be controlled by the likes of Charles Rangel, Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid.LiNeBrEaKThe imposition of more taxes on energy in any form, but particularly or directly as to gasoline, would immediately and perhaps permanently cripple the very same working people who exclusively pay the freight for this government ship to remain afloat, albeit with bizarre trillion-dollar deficits and out-of-control spending, which will kill us eventually and certainly.LiNeBrEaKKEN SISSELLiNeBrEaKLilburnLiNeBrEaKAttacks on Israel were ignoredLiNeBrEaKIn the news media, we see and hear people all over the world protesting the bombing of Hamas in Gaza by the Israelis. Where were all the demonstrators, protesters and the news media when Hamas was firing rockets and bombs into Israeli towns targeting civilians? This has been going on for years.LiNeBrEaKPAUL NORRISLiNeBrEaKFairburnLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming survivableLiNeBrEaKMike Luckovich's recent Sunday cartoon promotes the fear campaign of those who try in vain to put a picture on global warming (@issue, Jan. 4). The only humor is the idea that a new president could have any impact on the global climate.LiNeBrEaKPolar bears evolved to their current form over 100,000 years ago, and amazingly survived the heat wave of 12,000 B.C., when the glaciers that covered much of the U.S. retreated 4,000 miles.LiNeBrEaKPolar bears adapt, as humans do. But it takes putting a cute face on the problem to get children fearful over the potential one-degree temperature rise over the next 50 years. LiNeBrEaKThe world's other problems are far more important than global warming, and our money can be better spent saving real human lives.LiNeBrEaKNICK COOPERLiNeBrEaKAtlantaLiNeBrEaKPrevention foundation to healthLiNeBrEaKThe opinion column by Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a wake-up call for America ("Prevention is the best cure for health reform," @issue, Dec. 31). Baby boomers are aging and unless we change our lifestyles and make prevention a foundation of our health care, the costs for medical care for the boomers will be astronomical.LiNeBrEaKAt 65, the average person has two chronic illnesses. By 85, there is almost a 50 percent risk of having Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Association is committed to helping change health policy to promote prevention as the foundation for good health for all Americans. We are partnering with the CDC on a healthy brain initiative that seeks to convey what research has shown --- that what is good for the heart is good for the brain. Managing risk factors is especially important for African-Americans and Hispanics, who are at higher risks for chronic illnesses such as vascular dementia and diabetes.LiNeBrEaKGINNY HELMSLiNeBrEaKHelms is vice president, chapter services and public policy, Alzheimer's Association, Georgia chapter.LiNeBrEaKGeorgia Power right on nukesLiNeBrEaKJay Bookman's column ("Nuke revival puts all risk on customers," @issue, Jan. 4) ignores U.S. political influence. Is there not one political party that has opposed nuclear energy for 40-plus years? Is that party not in full ascendency and appointing those who do not support nuclear renewal?LiNeBrEaKBookman also associates "lucrative federal subsidies" with nuclear energy, an intellectually dishonest accusation especially in light of the fact that wind and solar energy technologies are allowed by federal law to reap huge tax credits and receive direct cash incentives from utilities that must use their power despite low-capacity factors, huge maintenance and repair costs and great unreliability of electricity supply. Bookman said nothing about these consumer-financed technologies, which makes his opinion all the more suspect.LiNeBrEaKGeorgia Power is doing the right thing. But in doing the right thing with such entrenched opposition, legal and finance experts would advise minimizing corporate risk, especially in light of possible Sarbanes-Oxley Act consequences.LiNeBrEaKCHARLES W.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   Main Edition	Gerberding's CDC legacy debated;  Director draws praise, criticism from observers 	NEWS; Pg. 10A  	660 words  	Since President-elect Barack Obama accepted the resignation of the head of the nation's leading public health agency last week, her admirers and detractors have been arguing about her legacy and the future of the Atlanta-based research facility.LiNeBrEaKDuring Dr. Julie Gerberding's six years directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, critics lambasted her, accusing her of sacrificing science for politics and carrying the Bush agenda on global warming and other issues into the world of scientific research. LiNeBrEaKHer defenders countered that she kept the agency above political concerns and expanded its mission to include bioterrorism research, combating AIDS globally and responding to national health threats. They say the government is losing a strong leader who could have provided continuity for the years ahead.LiNeBrEaKNew administrations often clean house at the top of their agencies. Gerberding's resignation, effective Jan. 20, became public Friday. She was unavailable for comment Saturday.LiNeBrEaKAs the CDC's first female director departs, some health care advocates say they hope a change in leadership spurs a change in direction and priorities for the agency, which employs 9,000 people and has a budget of $9 billion.LiNeBrEaK"In the last eight years, across the board in government, politics has been trumping science," said Jeff Levi, executive director of the Trust for America's Health, a public health watchdog group based in Washington. Levi said he hopes the new administration "returns to science as the basis of policy."LiNeBrEaKGerberding was criticized in 2007 after it was alleged she let the White House censor her congressional testimony on climate change. A deleted section of the testimony included the statement that "catastrophic weather events such as heat waves and hurricanes are expected to become more frequent, severe and costly."LiNeBrEaKGerberding said at the time that the White House review process was customary and that she'd spoken openly and without constraint.LiNeBrEaKSaturday, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said: "Dr. Gerberding is a very strong person when it comes to her integrity. She was never muzzled or constrained."LiNeBrEaKDebra Lappin, a health consultant who serves on the advisory board to the CDC director, said Gerberding has not played politics with her position. "Her commitment to science cuts across the aisle," Lappin said in an interview late last year.LiNeBrEaKA fractured view of Gerberding's tenure emerged in interviews Saturday.LiNeBrEaKTerrence Manning, head of the government employees union at the CDC, which represents 1,800 nonscientist employees, said she was a "people person" who "did the best she could with what was given."LiNeBrEaKBut Francesca Grifo, a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she spoke to CDC researchers who were "cheering" the departure of the director. Gerberding's critics say her 2003 reorganization of the CDC prompted an exodus of key scientific staff.LiNeBrEaKWhile some CDC watchers tossed out names of possible Gerberding replacements, others focused on the direction the agency will take under a new leader.LiNeBrEaKLevi, of the Washington watchdog group, said the CDC should place greater emphasis on preventing illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes.LiNeBrEaKHelene Gayle, president of Atlanta-based CARE USA, which battles hunger across the world, said the CDC should focus less on fighting bioterrorism and more on combating disease. LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) praised Gerberding for transforming the agency into a force against bioterrorism. "She's done an outstanding job overseeing those things while continuing to guide the CDC on its mission of fighting disease around the world," Isakson said.LiNeBrEaKAmong the candidates for CDC director whose names have surfaced in the public health community, according to advocates, are CARE President Gayle; New York City's health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Frieden; Baltimore's health commissioner, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein; and Los Angeles' health director Dr. Jonathan Fielding.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   Final Edition	OUTLOOK FOR KEY ISSUES IN THE 81ST LEGISLATURE  	MAIN; Pg. A11  	1124 words  	Budget and taxesLiNeBrEaKTexas has been in an enviable economic position compared with other states, boasting almost $12 billion in reserves and available revenue going into the 2010-11 budget. But the double blow of the national financial collapse and Hurricane Ike has darkened the state's outlook. Budget leaders expect relatively little money to pay for new expenses. The state's revised business tax, collected for the first time in 2008, will be closely examined for its effect on small businesses and different industries. Lawmakers will be reluctant to make too many changes because it's an integral part of the 2006 deal to reduce school property taxes, and the first-year collections have been well short of projections.LiNeBrEaKCriminal justice LiNeBrEaKWith the state budget tighter than tight, a primary goal will be to ensure funding for new prison treatment and diversion programs that were approved two years ago. More than half are still to be launched, with officials saying the initial programs have been successful. Look for the Texas Department of Public Safety to undergo a management makeover as part of its regular sunset review, with drivers' licensing and vehicle inspections likely to be moved to another agency. The proposed merger of the Texas Youth Commission and Texas Juvenile Probation Commission? There's a 50-50 chance, or another such effort is likely in two years. A push to allow Texans to openly pack pistols probably will produce a lively debate but might not pass.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentLiNeBrEaKMore than a dozen bills have been filed, including ones that include incentives for homeowners and businesses to install solar panels, one calling for more monitoring of an air pollutant and one barring homeowner associations from prohibiting solar panels. Speaker-apparent Joe Straus cut his teeth last session on a successful proposal to encourage Texans to buy Energy Star appliances. With him at the House's helm, look for that program to expand and for incentives for solar power generation to get traction. Anything touching explicitly on global warming has little hope of getting on the governor's desk and even less of getting his signature. Water conservation, a big issue last session, may recede this time.LiNeBrEaKGamblingLiNeBrEaKThe expansion of gambling, which never really got traction two years ago, is back. The state's tight finances won't hurt because proponents are sure to promise a hefty return if the state builds casinos, allows slots at racetracks and authorizes gambling on tribal reservations. But the opposition will argue that relying on gambling revenue is a bad bet. They say gambling brings more crime and social problems than it's worth. In the end, the legislative leadership would have to be convinced that there's enough support among lawmakers to give the issue a run.LiNeBrEaKHealth and human servicesLiNeBrEaKExpect lawmakers to debate whether to close some of the state institutions for people with mental retardation, how to continue reforming the foster care system and whether to expand Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Bills already filed would start a statewide workplace smoking ban, create a health insurance program for children in the child-support system, legalize needle-exchange programs, ban possession of the hallucinogen salvia and regulate laser hair-removal facilities. Abortion-related bills filed include one that would require women who seek an abortion to first get an ultrasound and another - backed by Gov. Rick Perry - that would issue a 'Choose Life' license plate.LiNeBrEaKHigher educationLiNeBrEaKSeveral measures proposing limits on tuition increases at public universities have been filed. Prospects are uncertain; lawmakers have thus far declined to fiddle with the tuition-setting powers they ceded to the boards of regents in 2003. The University of Texas and its legislative allies will try once again to scale back a 1997 law that allows students in the top 10 percent of their Texas high school graduating class to attend any public university in the state. Also up for debate are proposals to boost funding for community colleges; establish a commission to prepare a long-range plan for higher education; designate one or more universities for flagship, or top-tier, status; increase financial aid, perhaps with more stringent merit standards; and provide health benefits for graduate students.LiNeBrEaKImmigrationLiNeBrEaKThough the issue seems to have lost some steam, many conservatives still expect Republicans in the Legislature to show that they're cracking down on illegal immigration. Action could still be difficult because of resistance from business groups and Democrats and the fact that immigration is primarily a federal issue. Proposals are likely to include a reverse in the law allowing undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition and crackdowns on businesses that hire unauthorized workers. Perry will seek more funding for crime-fighting along the border.LiNeBrEaKInsuranceLiNeBrEaKOn the griddle: How to continue the state program that is the hurricane-battered insurer of last resort for residential and commercial property along the Gulf coast. After exhausting other funding sources to pay claims, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association last year told Texas property insurers to pony up $430 million for excess losses associated with Hurricane Ike, on top of $100 million levied earlier for damage caused by Hurricane Dolly. In the short term, the insurers can recover some of the money by taking state tax credits. In the long term, a key question is how the state continues the coverage method and whether it'll be harder for property owners to get insured.LiNeBrEaKPublic educationLiNeBrEaKThe high-stakes Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills appears on its way out. In its place, legislators want to create a school accountability system that reduces the emphasis on a single test and focuses on a student's progress from year to year.

The Boston Globe 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Global warming au naturel in the Northwest  	TRAVEL; Pg. M7  	848 words  	NORTHBONNEVILLE, Wash. - At first glance, the scene is typical of any hotel pool area. A young man with goggles swims laps. Children giggle and splash each other in the shallow end. A woman lies on a lounge chair absorbed in a paperback.LiNeBrEaKBut this was no ordinary pool. The water, at 97 degrees Fahrenheit, has been warmed not by a boiler, but from heat deep within the earth. A poster listing minerals in the water reads like the back of a vitamin bottle: sulfur, silica, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium. This is because the pool at Bonneville Hot Springs Resort and Spa is fed from a nearby natural hot spring. LiNeBrEaKHot springs destinations in the Northwest range from rustic, backcountry spots to high-end resorts. Bonneville is one of the more lavish in the Pacific Northwest. The 12,000-square-foot spa offers 40 treatments. A three-story great room features a massive stone fireplace, plush leather couches, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a forest.LiNeBrEaKThe resort's flagship experience is a mineral bath and wrap. An attendant led me and a friend into a candlelit room with claw-foot bathtubs. As the bath was drawn a faint smell of boiled eggs from the sulfur in the water filled the air. But the odor was worth it. The water felt thick and therapeutic. And after 25 minutes of soaking, I had worked up a toxin-releasing sweat. Next came the wrap. Lying on warm towels trickled with eucalyptus oil, we were each tucked into a cotton sheet and warm blanket. A cool towel was placed over our eyes to block any light and the soothing sound of violin and piano lulled me to a semi-sleep state.LiNeBrEaKIn the 19th century, hot spring water was widely claimed to possess curative powers. Resorts built around springs promised relief from arthritis, kidney and liver problems, and other maladies. With the growth of modern medicine in the early 20th century, "taking the waters" began to seem old-fashioned and time-consuming. By the mid-1900s, many of the resorts were closed and abandoned.LiNeBrEaKOver the past few decades, as Americans are increasingly turning to alternative medicine, hot springs have made a comeback.LiNeBrEaKDrawing from another spring farther south, Breitenbush Hot Springs Retreat and Conference Center is completely booked most weekends. "This is an easy way for us to get into nature with our child," said Czeslaw Czapla, a software engineer from Portland, Ore. His son, Roman, 2 1/2, played alongside his parents in a rock-lined soaking pool. Breitenbush is nestled in a forest with cabins or tent sites for lodging. A stay includes three tasty vegetarian meals a day and several well-being and body movement classes.LiNeBrEaKSoaking after dark was an enchanting experience. To the soothing sound of a nearby rushing river, I lay in the hundred-plus-degree water, propped up by rock carved out along the edge of the pool. Thousands of stars glittered in the mid-August sky.LiNeBrEaKMore modest folks might have difficulty at Breitenbush and some other rustic spring sites. Clothing is optional in most of the bathing areas and stripping down in front of strangers felt funny at first. (A small percentage of people wear bathing suits.) Having children around helped lighten the experience. Getting to know the down-to-earth people I was soaking with came easily.LiNeBrEaKI met Janine Wanee, who was visiting from Somerville, one morning in the steam sauna at Breitenbush. A trip there last year sparked a year of transformation, Wanee said. She quit an unfulfilling job to pursue her passion, music, and went to an alternative health practitioner. "I was feeling lost. This place woke up a lot of stuff."LiNeBrEaKHot springs form when water descends through the planet's cracks and fissures. The deeper it travels, the hotter it gets and eventually enough pressure is formed to push the water back to the surface. The Cascade Range, spanning from southern British Columbia to Northern California, is an area ripe for springs. That's because it lies along a subduction zone where the edge of one tectonic plate slides under the edge of another and penetrates the planet's mantle. When this occurs, trapped heat is released.LiNeBrEaKWalking to Terwilliger Hot Springs, an hour drive east of Eugene, Ore., felt like entering the Ewok village in "Star Wars," only more peaceful. Giant trees, moss, and fern line the quarter-mile trail from the parking lot to the springs. A wooden railing leads you into a narrow ravine where six steamy soaking pools fall in tiers down the valley.LiNeBrEaKTerwilliger is one of many hot springs sites maintained by the US Forest Service. Without a resort built around it, these springs were the most rustic we visited.LiNeBrEaKHot water spills out of a rock formation and into the upper soaking pool. Overflow from this pool falls into the others in succession. The temperature of the water cools about five degrees with each drop, with the upper pool averaging about 116 degrees.LiNeBrEaKWith growing concern about global warming, the use of nature's energy soothes not only a spa-goer's body but also her conscience.LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR:LiNeBrEaKIF YOU GO . . .LiNeBrEaKPLEASE SEE PDF FOR CHART DATA.

The Boston Globe 	January 11, 2009 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Dark green A scientist argues that the natural world isn't benevolent and sustaining: it's bent on self-destruction  	IDEAS; Pg. C1  	2583 words  	WHEN WE LOOK at nature, it has become commonplace to see a fastidiously self-regulating system at work: wildebeest trim the savannah grasses, lions cull the wildebeest herds, and vultures clean the bones of both. Forests take in the carbon dioxide we exhale, use it to grow, and replace it with oxygen. The planet even has a thermostat, the carbon cycle, which relies on the interplay of volcanoes, rain, sunlight, plants, and plankton to keep the earth's temperature in a range congenial to life. LiNeBrEaKThis idea of nature's harmonious balance has become not just the bedrock of environmental thought, but a driving force in policy and culture. It is the sentiment behind Henry David Thoreau's dictum, "In wildness is the preservation of the world." It lies behind last summer's animated blockbuster "Wall-E," in which a single surviving plant helps revive an earth smothered beneath the detritus of human overconsumption. It underlies environmental laws that try to minimize the damaging influence of humans on land and the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKIn this line of thought, the workings of the natural world, honed over billions of years of evolution, have reached a dynamic equilibrium far more elegant - and ultimately durable - than the clumsy attempts humankind makes to alter or improve them. LiNeBrEaKAccording to the paleontologist Peter Ward, however, nothing could be further from the truth. In his view, the earth's history makes clear that, left to run its course, life isn't naturally nourishing - it's poisonous. Rather than a supple system of checks and balances, he argues, the natural world is a doomsday device careening from one cataclysm to another. Long before humans came onto the scene, primitive life forms were busily trashing the planet, and on multiple occasions, Ward argues, they came close to rendering it lifeless. Around 3. 7 billion years ago, they created a planet-girdling methane smog that threatened to extinguish every living thing; a little over a billion years later they pumped the atmosphere full of poison gas. (That gas, ironically, was oxygen, which later life forms adapted to use as fuel.)LiNeBrEaKThe story of life on earth, in Ward's reckoning, is a long series of suicide attempts. Four of the five major mass extinctions since the rise of animals, Ward says, were caused not by meteor impacts or volcanic eruptions, but by bacteria, and twice, he argues, the planet was transformed into a nearly total ball of ice thanks to the voracious appetites of plants. In other words, it's not just human beings, with our chemical spills, nuclear arsenals, and tailpipe emissions, who are a menace. The main threat to life is life itself.LiNeBrEaK"Life is toxic," Ward says. "It's life that's causing all the damn problems."LiNeBrEaKWard, a paleontologist at the University of Washington and a scholar of the earth's great extinctions, calls his model the Medea Hypothesis, after the mythological Greek sorceress who killed her own children. The name makes clear Ward's ambition: To challenge and eventually replace the Gaia Hypothesis, the well-known 1970s scientific model that posits that every living thing on earth is part of a gargantuan, self-regulating super-organism.LiNeBrEaKWard holds the Gaia Hypothesis, and the thinking behind it, responsible for encouraging a set of fairy-tale assumptions about the earth, and he'd like his new book, due out this spring, to help puncture them. He hopes not only to shake the philosophical underpinnings of environmentalism, but to reshape our understanding of our relationship with nature, and of life's ultimate sustainability on this planet and beyond.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Ward's ideas have yet to reach a broad audience, some scientists are welcoming his portrait of a constantly off-kilter earth as a corrective to the gauzier precepts that have cast their spells on environmental philosophy and policy. Others, however, describe his hypothesis as simply Gaia's dark twin, a model undermined by the same inclination to see one tendency as the whole story. Ward is open to the criticism that he's taken things too far; what's important, he believes, is weaning people from the idea that the earth works better without us. Even if Medea is an incomplete framework for viewing the natural world, it introduces a hardheadedness into environmental debates often driven by an unexamined idealism about Mother Nature.LiNeBrEaKWard himself believes that the only help for the planet over the long run is management by human beings - whether that means actively adjusting the chemical composition of the atmosphere or using giant satellites to modify the amount of sunlight that reaches us. As Ward sees it, the planet doesn't need our help destroying itself. It will do that automatically. It needs us to save it. LiNeBrEaKFor most of human history, it would have been alien to think of the planet as a "system" at all - the earth seemed an essentially infinite expanse of lands and seas that, depending on your theology, awaited human cultivation or demanded human deference. But with the Industrial Revolution it started to become clear that humans themselves were making changes with far-reaching, unintended, and destructive consequences, and over the 20th century an alternative understanding of the natural world began to take hold. This view saw the earth as a closed system with an inherent natural order, and pointed out the ways it broke down when we stressed it by pumping chemicals into the air or killing off animals that were vital links in food chains.LiNeBrEaKBy the late 1970s, when the British scientist James Lovelock proposed the Gaia Hypothesis, something that once might have seemed like science fiction - the notion that all living things on the planet were linked like the cells in a single body - seemed like a persuasive model.LiNeBrEaKLovelock was a serious scientist - a creation of his, the electron capture detector, was to prove instrumental in revealing the depletion of the ozone layer - and he had plenty of evidence for his theory. He pointed to the fact that, despite the wide variability of the sun's heat over the eons, microbes and plants have altered both the atmosphere and the ground to keep the temperature almost entirely within the narrow range in which terrestrial life thrives. For nearly as long, the amount of oxygen that plants and geological processes released into the atmosphere has remained at a point high enough to feed the metabolisms of quintillions of animals, but not so high that every forest was constantly going up in flames.LiNeBrEaKIn the Gaian model, the world is maintained by an interlocking feedback system that puts a brake on drastic changes. Lovelock pointed to the role that plants play in the carbon cycle's planetary thermostat: When the planet warms, forests and phytoplankton suck carbon dioxide out of the air at a faster rate and create sheltering layers of clouds, both of which work to cool the planet. In a more familiar example from the animal kingdom, populations of predator and prey limit each other's sizes.LiNeBrEaKWhile the Gaia Hypothesis may be the most explicit version, the idea of a self-regulating, counterpoised planet has been central to the thinking of conservationists and environmentalists, and to the policies they have helped to shape. Removing dams, fighting the encroachment of alien plant and animal species, restoring the Everglades, reintroducing wolves into the American West, all are justified at least partly because they help restore a balance that man has disturbed.LiNeBrEaKAs Ward sees it, however, this is almost exactly backward. Looking at the evidence of past extinctions - written in fossils and in the chemical makeup of deeply buried rock sediments - as well as the workings of today's oceans, atmosphere, and myriad food chains, he finds evidence of a planet that tends not toward harmony but toward extremes. Although windows of stability are possible, they are simply respites between catastrophic boom-and-bust cycles. He attributes one of the largest extinctions in history to the out-of-control proliferation of plankton feeding on upwellings of nutrients from the ocean floor. Rather than being elegantly brought back to equilibrium, the tiny organisms reproduced until they choked off much of the life in the upper ocean. Exhausting their newfound food supply, they died en masse, and decaying by the trillions used up all the oxygen in the water, killing off everything else.LiNeBrEaKAs for the earth's temperature control, Ward, drawing on the writing of the environmental scientist James Kirchner, points out that more often than not the thermostat seems to be hooked up backward, with warming triggering more warming, and cooling more cooling. In a process we're seeing today, as the planetary temperature rises, warming increases the rate at which soil releases greenhouse gases - not only carbon dioxide, but methane and nitrous oxide. It leads to more forest growth in places that formerly were barren tundra, even as more carbon dioxide in the air makes plants hardier and better able to grow in areas once given over to desert. More plants in more places means a darker earth, and therefore a more heat-absorbent and warmer one. It's an escalating feedback loop that becomes even more powerful as the planet's white, ice-covered poles give way to darker open water.LiNeBrEaKThe dangerous positive feedback can run the other way, too, Ward argues. He blames a planetary glut of plant life for the two prehistoric "snowball earth" episodes, 2. 3 billion and 700 million years ago, when the planet froze from pole to pole. In a reverse greenhouse effect, the earth's plants, photosynthesizing madly, sucked so much carbon dioxide out of the air that temperatures plunged. Far from nurturing life, the world's plants nearly froze it to death.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Ward is a leading expert on the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction (the one, 65 million years ago, that killed off the last of the dinosaurs), his reputation in recent years has been as a writer of popular science books - his best known, "Rare Earth," is an argument against the likelihood of complex life being found elsewhere in the universe, coauthored in 2000 with the astronomer Donald Brownlee. Ward hopes the forthcoming book will find a wide readership, but also intends it as a serious theoretical framework for research into the interplay between living things and their environment.LiNeBrEaKSo far, since Ward has not presented the Medea Hypothesis in papers or at conferences, it remains relatively unknown to environmental researchers and earth scientists. But among those familiar with it, there is a sense that its focus on nature's lethal erraticism could shape the debate, both in and out of academe, over the planet's long-term prospects.LiNeBrEaK"I think that it's a very valuable contribution to be focusing on the very serious destabilizing effects of life," says David Schwartzman, a professor at Howard University who reviewed a draft of Ward's book. Schwartzman's field, biogeochemistry, grew to prominence largely out of arguments over the Gaia Hypothesis. "There's no a priori reason to think that life's feedback with the environment necessarily is stabilizing."LiNeBrEaK"We do tend to think about everything being coordinated and helping each other," says Tyler Volk, an earth systems scientist at New York University and author of the book "CO2 Rising." "I basically agree with Ward that organisms can come along and create conditions that make it very difficult for a lot of other species."LiNeBrEaKBut Schwartzman and Volk, among others, also caution that Medea may be as incomplete a model in its way as Gaia is. Since the late 1970s, even prominent Gaian thinkers such as Lovelock have moderated some of their stronger claims: They no longer describe the biosphere as a single organism, and they concede that not all the planet's feedback loops tend toward stability.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, most earth scientists see no need to choose between Gaia and Medea: The earth, naturally, is a bit of both. "The natural world is an interestingly complex place," says Kirchner, director of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research.LiNeBrEaKStephen Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University, is more dismissive. "Anybody who tells you [the feedbacks] are all positive or all negative is writing a potboiler," he says.LiNeBrEaKOther scientists take issue with Ward's reading of the prehistoric record, suggesting he may be blaming early life forms for catastrophes they did not cause. In the field of paleontology, some of the fiercest arguments of recent decades have been over what caused prehistory's great die-offs, and Ward has been in the middle of a few of those arguments. There's still significant debate, for example, over whether living things actually caused the Great Oxidation Event (and ensuing extinction) 2. 5 billion years ago, and whether plants and other organisms can really be blamed for the "snowball earth" deep freezes and some of the more recent mass extinctions.LiNeBrEaKWard cheerfully concedes that he may be proven at least partly wrong.LiNeBrEaK"I'm just erecting a series of hypotheses - some are going to turn out to be true," he predicts. "But there is nothing else to balance Gaia, there's nothing else for people to take a swat at. I welcome that. I have thick skin."LiNeBrEaKAt the very least, Ward hopes to shape the image of the earth in the public imagination, and by extension in public policy. Beneath much environmental regulation lies the basically Gaian belief that, when faced with a brewing global problem like climate change, our best response should be to try as much as possible to take ourselves out of the equation, to reduce our carbon emissions to the point where we're no longer a factor in the feedback loops. Trying instead to manage something as hopelessly complex as the climate is seen as an act of Frankensteinian hubris.LiNeBrEaKWard, however, argues that this way of seeing things only makes sense if one assumes that the earth will, once righted, inevitably return to the set of conditions most suitable for our continued survival. History, he argues, suggests it very well may not. Faced with a planet where life is almost guaranteed to wipe itself out - and take us with it - he is urging us to be active, and occasionally intrusive, guardians.LiNeBrEaKTo combat climate change, Ward sees that role including engineering projects on a previously unimaginable scale, like cooling the atmosphere by seeding it with sulfuric acid or installing giant shields in space to deflect away sunlight. As the scientific consensus around climate change has spread and hardened, these so-called "geoengineering" projects have received more of a hearing, but most climate and earth scientists remain skeptical because of the enormous uncertainties about what their full effects would be.LiNeBrEaKIronically, Lovelock himself has also, in the last few years, become an advocate for a geoengineering fix for climate change - specifically, an armada of vertical pipes placed in the oceans to bring colder, nutrient-rich water to the surface to absorb more carbon out of the air. But while Lovelock has described his proposal as an "emergency treatment" for a critically ill planet, Ward believes such schemes are going to have to become business as usual if we and our descendants are going to survive.LiNeBrEaK"The longevity of the biosphere can only be sustained through large-scale geoengineering," Ward argues. Without our firm hand, he believes, "the earth will go to hell in a handbasket," just as it has again and again in the past.LiNeBrEaKDrake Bennett is the staff writer for Ideas.
