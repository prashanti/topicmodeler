Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition	Major companies join Austin's clean energy push  	Claudia Grisales AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  	METRO; Pg. B05  	592 words  	Business and community leaders announced a new partnership Wednesday with nine major companies - including Dell Inc. , Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and Microsoft Corp. - to help bring a new clean energy economy to Central Texas. LiNeBrEaKThe companies could deploy dozens of employees to the Pecan Street Project, a 9-month-old public-private initiative to develop a local clean energy power system.LiNeBrEaKSome early ideas include Internet-based thermostats that can be adjusted from a remote computer and a solar panel project for tens of thousands of Austin homes and businesses.LiNeBrEaK"This will be a beacon for cities around the world," said David Yarnold , executive director of the national environmental advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund, which helped negotiate the partnerships.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement, which was made at the Clean Energy Venture Summit at the University of Texas, signals that the Pecan Street Project has drawn the muscle necessary to move forward.LiNeBrEaKIt also shows state leaders that significant members of the Texas business community are ready to move forward with clean energy plans - with or without their help.LiNeBrEaKLast month, Gov. Rick Perry said potential federal legislation to curb pollution to address global climate change could hurt the Texas economy.LiNeBrEaKThis "sends a great message about the opportunity for Texas should we embrace the clean energy economy wholeheartedly," said Austin City Council member and possible mayoral candidate Brewster McCracken, who helped jump-start the initiative in March.LiNeBrEaKThe City of Austin, UT, Austin Energy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the new corporate partners and others plan to research and design a clean energy system that will produce 300 megawatts of electricity within Austin city limits. One megawatt can power about 750 homes.LiNeBrEaKThe corporate partners also include GE Energy , IBM Corp. , Intel Corp., Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Arlington-based GridPoint Inc. Sematech will consult on the project and could potentially host the clean energy laboratory.LiNeBrEaK"The ability to do something local that can be a model for the state, for the nation, perhaps even for the global community is something that fits with Dell's preferred method of attacking the global climate crisis," said Jeff Krech, manager of Dell's Global Facilities Sustainability Program.LiNeBrEaKThe initiative had its origins at a downtown lunch in early March between McCracken and B.J. Stanbery , CEO of Austin-based solar energy company HelioVolt Inc. Stanbery laid out a compelling future of decentralized energy distribution driven by solar cells atop homes and businesses, McCracken said.LiNeBrEaKAn April meeting followed with Austin Energy chief Robert Duncan and experts and executives from UT, the Austin Technology Incubator and the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaK"We were working backwards," McCracken said. "We looked 20 years into the future and said, 'If you had solar power all over, what systems would you have to have in place to make that work?'"LiNeBrEaKMcCracken said the Pecan Street Project will work in three phases: planning and innovation, implementation of existing technology and research and development.LiNeBrEaKBy August, project leaders hope the new collaboration will lay out its short- to long-term recommendations and any potential public investment proposals, McCracken said.LiNeBrEaKIt's too early to say how much money the system might generate or how many jobs it might bring to Central Texas. The planning and implementation could last five to 15 years.LiNeBrEaKcgrisales@statesman.com; 912-5933LiNeBrEaKAdditional material from staff writer Asher Price.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition	LETERS  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A14  	770 words  	Turning their backs on Austin?LiNeBrEaKRe: Nov. 29 editorial "Firefighters turn their backs on Austin."LiNeBrEaKI am a recent retiree, a 30-year captain of the Austin Fire Department.LiNeBrEaKI had the honor to work with a wide diversity of firefighters on companies under my command - male, female, Hispanic, African American and white.LiNeBrEaKI was a member of the first negotiation team that worked to change so we hired a more diverse department. I worked for 10 years as a team leader with the oral interview boards and brought about many changes on how we recruited, interviewed and hired the most diverse people that we could get to apply. LiNeBrEaKThe only way to circumvent the civil service hiring process is by contract, and management and the union have gained through this system, as have the residents of Austin. Firefighters will still give the best service they have always given the people of Austin.LiNeBrEaKThe headline you used does a disservice to the hard-working, diverse department.LiNeBrEaKTravis BoringLiNeBrEaKAustinLiNeBrEaKRegardless of how you cover, print, slant and editorialize about the current contract woes between the City of Austin and its firefighters, one thing will simply not change: the excellent and professional fire, medical and rescue services the department provides.LiNeBrEaKThere will be no job actions, work stoppages or strikes. By law, the firefighters' only labor recourse will be to build upon and exceed the current level of services provided and to maintain the public's trust.LiNeBrEaKThis becomes necessary to defray the slash and burn tactics of the American-Statesman as it continues to vilify and discredit the tremendous efforts of one of Austin's finest services and the men and women who make up the department.LiNeBrEaKJack MorrisseyLiNeBrEaKJackMorrissey1958@yahoo.comLiNeBrEaKAustinLiNeBrEaKBig ThreeLiNeBrEaKNationalize the Big Three. Merge them into a larger program of green public works, one designed to repair and modernize our systems of energy and transportation. Manage the companies democratically, with representatives for labor, local communities, consumers-taxpayers and environmental organizations.LiNeBrEaKThis would help reduce unemployment, improve our infrastructure, slow global warming, diminish our desire for fossil fuels, combat free-market rubbish and point the way to further, deeper reforms.LiNeBrEaKRequire banks that are not lending to provide some of the funding. Banks that refuse can be nationalized, too, also under democratic forms of management.LiNeBrEaKIt is past time for the common good to begin to take precedence over private interests that only pretend to serve the public's welfare.LiNeBrEaKAndrew SleddLiNeBrEaKasledd@sbcglobal.netLiNeBrEaKAustinLiNeBrEaKAuto bailoutsLiNeBrEaKDemocrats should consider this alternative to bailing out ChryForGM: For the next 12 months, make the purchase price of a new car 100 percent tax-deductible. That would amount to a 25 percent or better discount for many Americans.LiNeBrEaKIf the government had to forego $25 billion in tax revenue because of this deduction, then ChryForGM will have made more than $100 billion in incremental sales, a way to get well in a hurry.LiNeBrEaKIt's the perfect test. If Americans don't buy with such a favorable discount, why would they buy from ChryForGM after a $25 billion loan? This alternative would let the market decide who really deserves to survive, so ChryForGM would have to work for sales, possibly giving additional discounts. Some will say this is unfair to people who don't pay IRS taxes. I say that if you don't qualify, you shouldn't be buying a new car.LiNeBrEaKJim DowningLiNeBrEaKjimdowning@austin.rr.comLiNeBrEaKAustin LiNeBrEaKMinimum wageLiNeBrEaKRe: Nov. 17 commentary "Commit to helping the homeless."LiNeBrEaKIt was suggested that 64 percent of homeless people desired a regular full-time job "even if it would only pay minimum wage." No one should take this as anything more than the stated desperation of people with no job and no options.LiNeBrEaKIt is not an endorsement for paying minimum wage, which is an inflexible, antiquated and failed bureaucratic policy. It is minimum wage that in many instances has led to their homelessness - $6. 55 per hour will get no one an efficiency apartment with food on the table.LiNeBrEaKWe need nothing less than "living wages" to survive. Paying anything less is not a "fair wage for a fair day's work," and it is unconscionable.LiNeBrEaKRichard R.

The Boston Globe 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	A blueprint for a green agenda  	Armando Carbonell  	OP-ED; Pg. A23  	733 words  	PRESIDENT-ELECT Barack Obama intends to make an economic stimulus package a priority, with the emphasis on investments in public works infrastructure. While moving quickly is important, this is an opportunity for more coherent planning that accomplishes multiple goals.LiNeBrEaKInvesting in infrastructure can boost a sagging economy, by adding an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 new jobs for every $1 billion invested. The projects are place-based, giving an advantage to local workers, and producing positive ripple effects in the local economy. LiNeBrEaKHowever, special attention should be paid to the kinds of infrastructure projects to be funded, and how these projects fit into a broader, long-range plan. We're at a transformational moment when economic competitiveness, energy independence, responding to climate change, and developing a transportation system for the 21st century can all converge. The New England region can do its part by being ready with a model plan that transcends traditional boundaries.LiNeBrEaKA $61 billion stimulus package approved by the House of Representatives in September, but not acted on by the Senate, included $37 billion for infrastructure, with a preference for contract-ready projects - but no consideration for energy, climate, or other long-range national priorities. More recent calls for a package of $300 billion to $600 billion similarly include an emphasis on projects that may take us farther away from long-term goals.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration should assess the projects that will bring infrastructure systems into the 21st century, jump-start the economy, and prepare for the post-carbon, post-cheap oil future. Not just any old infrastructure will do.LiNeBrEaKInstead of new highways, which often enable unsustainable land development patterns, the policy should be "fix it first" - keeping existing roads and bridges in a state of good repair. The major infrastructure projects in any stimulus package should emphasize transit - bus systems, streetcars, light rail, and inter-city rail - and moving more freight capacity to rail as well.LiNeBrEaKCities need help retrofitting older buildings for greater energy efficiency, replacing taxi fleets with hybrids, and updating antiquated water and wastewater systems. Former Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis has noted that Amtrak is ready to go with up to $3 billion in system upgrades that would improve service, such as replacing bridges and old overhead catenary wires on the Acela line, or laying down double tracks to better coordinate passenger and freight service. Inter-city rail service around Chicago and Atlanta, and in California and Florida, could replace short-haul jet trips.LiNeBrEaKThe group Transportation for America has a list of projects that meet the critical performance test: helping to reduce energy consumption and harmful greenhouse gas emissions while laying the foundation for a multimodal transportation system.LiNeBrEaKAnother useful organizing framework is something the Lincoln Institute has worked on with the Regional Plan Association - dividing the country into about a dozen "megaregions," like the Boston-to-Washington corridor or the Pacific Northwest. Investments in transportation infrastructure should be organized and coordinated so that they make sense for these large regions and are not just a compilation of existing projects from each metropolitan area. It would be the responsibility of each of these megaregions to come up with the transportation agenda most meaningful to them, and that means governors must work together on transportation initiatives that transcend state boundaries.LiNeBrEaKDone right, the stimulus package could become a crucial foundation for two other bills that await action in 2009: the reauthorization of over $350 billion in federal transportation spending and the next iteration of the Warner-Lieberman cap-and-trade climate protection bill. Transportation infrastructure tied to land use is central in both those massive tasks. The stimulus could begin that work, while producing jobs.LiNeBrEaKWe'll need good planning and better follow-through on construction management so the projects don't drag on for years. But choosing investments that align with a green agenda is not that hard to do. The crucial first step is to put those blueprints for new bridges to nowhere and freeway expansion back on a shelf where they belong.LiNeBrEaKArmando Carbonell is senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy.

The Boston Globe 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Polluting, even as he exits  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A22  	451 words  	WHILE President Bush seems to have gone on automatic pilot in the waning days of his term, bureaucrats in the bowels of his administration are laboring feverishly on 11th-hour rules intended to free drillers, loggers, miners, factory-farm owners, and coal-plant operators of environmental restrictions. Getting rules on the books just before the witching hour is common. President Clinton's most famous rule protected one-third of all national forest acreage from road-building, but Bush administration officials have worked to revise it. Congress and the Obama administration should be willing to undo any Bush rules that seriously threaten the nation's air, water, or national parks and forests. LiNeBrEaKThe most controversial Bush measure would gut the Endangered Species Act by banning federal wildlife scientists from weighing the effect of greenhouse gases on species and their habitats. This could be called the "leave no polar bear alive" clause. Administration officials were alarmed earlier this year by the prospect that the Department of the Interior's designation of the polar bear as a threatened species could derail new coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKBush also wants to weaken the Endangered Species Act by letting a federal agency like the Army Corps of Engineers determine that a new dam, for instance, would have no adverse impact on listed species or their habits - without consulting with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, the corps could unilaterally determine that a project would have just a "marginal" impact on a species, ignoring the cumulative effect of many such marginal impacts. John Kostyack of the National Wildlife Federation calls this "death by a thousand cuts for many threatened and endangered species."LiNeBrEaKOther new rules would ease oil-shale development, which requires large amounts of water; curb limits on the waste that mining companies can dump into streams; and exempt factory farms from air-pollution reporting. The Environmental Protection Agency is changing regulations to permit more coal-burning plants and other pollution sources near national parks and wilderness areas. The parks are also threatened by a hurry-up auction of drilling leases near their borders, although the Bureau of Land Management has agreed to stop some sales.LiNeBrEaKIt is regrettable that at this troubled hour in the nation's history, Congress and the new administration will have to expend time and energy reversing the Bush administration's last of many favors for industry. But they will have to, for the good of the nation's environment. "The evil that men do lives after them" will be the Shakespearean epitaph for this administration. It certainly won't be "All's Well that Ends Well."

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Texas urged to embrace, not resist, carbon regulation  	Elizabeth Souder, The Dallas Morning News  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	525 words  	Dec. 4--AUSTIN -- When and if Congress passes legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions, Texas could be in the crosshairs.LiNeBrEaKWith its big petrochemical industry, long commutes and growing electricity demand, Texas emits more carbon dioxide than any other state. Regulating those emissions could be big business. LiNeBrEaK"Texas is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the United States. That makes us the center of the universe," said Randy Lack, managing director for Element Markets LLC, during a presentation at the Clean Energy Venture Summit in Austin. "We can embrace it and figure out how to make it a good, profitable venture -- or resist. Thus far Texas has resisted."LiNeBrEaKThe question among some executives and environmentalists at the summit Wednesday was why Gov. Rick Perry seems to be resisting the inevitable, rather than embracing it.LiNeBrEaKMost energy executives expect Congress to pass greenhouse gas regulations in the next few years. Mr. Lack anticipates carbon dioxide regulations in 2010 or 2011.LiNeBrEaKLast month, Mr. Perry warned that such regulation could seriously harm the Texas economy. He asked three officials he appointed to energy-related posts to consider the impact of such regulations.LiNeBrEaKThose officials said in a report that regulation of greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act "would create extreme economic hardships" for Texas.LiNeBrEaKJim Marston, head of the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas, said a new project that he is coordinating in Austin offers an answer to Mr. Perry's concerns.LiNeBrEaK"We're not going to wait for the state to have an epiphany and get on board," he said at the summit, pointing out that other Republican governors are working with the environmental group to help guide greenhouse gas regulation.LiNeBrEaKThe city of Austin announced Wednesday that it aims to turn its electricity grid into a testing ground for technology to help people use less juice and to integrate solar panels into the grid.LiNeBrEaKThe local regulated utility, Austin Energy, is working with the Environmental Defense Fund, the University of Texas and large corporations on a grid that can give consumers and power companies real-time information about usage and market power prices. The grid would give consumers incentives to use power more wisely.LiNeBrEaKA number of regions are installing meters and other equipment for such a grid, including Oncor in North Texas. But Austin wants to go a step further and invite companies to test products and services that could help people take full advantage of the new technology.LiNeBrEaKThe group also wants to create the infrastructure and business models to support solar power. Right now, installing solar panels on a home or business is expensive and consumers cannot efficiently sell the solar power to the grid.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Utility's plan pays customers for energy;  Gainesville The electric company's 20-year contract sets price for kilowatt-hours.;  ENVIRONMENT A climate change activist applauds the "historic development."	STEVE PATTERSON  	Pg. B-1  	887 words  	A Gainesville utility's plan to buy solar-powered electricity is raising hopes of alternative-energy advocates who want to greatly expand use of renewable power in Florida.LiNeBrEaKThe plan would make Gainesville Regional Utilities the first American testing ground for a system that made less-than-sunny Germany a world leader in solar technology.LiNeBrEaKThe utility wants to sign 20-year contracts to buy power from customers who set up solar cells at their property. The contracts would lock in a permanent price for each kilowatt-hour of power at a rate that's high enough to make selling solar power profitable for some customers. LiNeBrEaKThat approach treats home-based solar cells like small, scattered power plants being paid premium prices for their product, rather than tools to reduce the power their owners draw from electric lines. Supporters say that shift can jump-start a new kind of technology that could create jobs and reduce dependence on imported fuel.LiNeBrEaK"This is actually a pretty historic development," said Jerry Karnas, an environmental activist who was part of a state panel on climate change appointed by Gov. Charlie Crist.LiNeBrEaK"Anybody who has a roof, and anybody who has some land ... anybody who has an entrepreneurial spirit can be part of the solution," said Karnas, Florida climate project director for the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKMany communities, including Jacksonville, use a system called "net metering" to receive power from homes with solar cells when the cells make more electricity than the customer needs. That approach normally creates a credit that can be used to lower the customer's monthly bill but won't make solar units profitable.LiNeBrEaKA Jacksonville homeowner who made all his own electricity, for example, would still pay a $5. 50 monthly base fee just for having access to a power line.LiNeBrEaKPeople signing a contract to sell their power could weigh costs of installing and maintaining solar equipment against predictable revenue streams. In theory, they could use the projections to apply for private loans to finance installing the equipment, especially for large projects like outfitting a grocery store roof.LiNeBrEaKAdvocates say that system of guaranteed payment inspired widespread investment in renewable power in Germany. Last year about 14 percent of Germany's electricity came from renewable sources such as solar and wind power, according to the German Renewable Energy Federation.LiNeBrEaKUtility managers expect solar power production could grow dramatically but it will still be just a small part of Gainesville's total power use. Less than 1 percent of Gainesville's power is solar now, but in five years the utility wants to reach 3 percent, said Ed Regan, assistant general manager for strategic planning.LiNeBrEaKThe vast majority of people installing solar choose systems that heat water, not those that produce electricity, said Mark Krenn, who owns American Solar Energy, a Jacksonville solar contractor. He said water systems pay for themselves in two to four years, but it would take years of savings on utility bills to cover the more expensive up-front price.LiNeBrEaK"Solar electric is not the direction we should be focusing on. We should be focusing on conservation," said Krenn, who started his company in the 1980s. "I've sold roughly 8,000 watts of solar electric, and I've probably sold a couple of gigawatts of solar thermal."LiNeBrEaKIn late 2006, builder Charles Milner constructed a Fernandina Beach house he says was the first in town with a solar electrical system. After factoring in government rebates, he said solar electric and water systems raised the cost of the house about $13,000.LiNeBrEaKMilner said solar systems for heating water and making electricity both help protect customers from sticker shock when utility rates change.LiNeBrEaK"Electricity has already doubled," he said. "But what's it going to do in another two years?"LiNeBrEaKJEA is watching what happens in Gainesville but isn't planning to follow suit right now, said Jay Worley, the director of environmental programs. He said JEA's only plan for now is to rewrite its net metering rules so customers can roll over unused credit from month to month.LiNeBrEaKJEA gets less than a tenth of a percent of its power from a couple of dozen customers with solar systems but wants to see how well Gainesville's plan works.LiNeBrEaK"We believe it's very interesting," Worley said.LiNeBrEaKLike JEA, Gainesville's utility is city-owned and can't start the new solar scheme until the City Commission lets it. Regan outlined the plan to commissioners last month and was told to draft an ordinance detailing the project. He said the long-term contract system could be in place next year.LiNeBrEaKThe program would pay a homeowner 26 cents for a kilowatt-hour of electricity on a contract signed next year, more than twice what that power is worth under net metering. A homeowner who waited until 2011 to set up solar panels would be offered 25 cents, and 19 cents in 2016.LiNeBrEaKThe price for new contracts drops because the utility expects the cost of installing and maintaining solar cells will fall as solar-energy equipment companies compete for customers.LiNeBrEaKBecause Gainesville is subsidizing solar power, a typical household's monthly bill might eventually increase as much as $2 per month, Karnas said. But he said that's a good trade-off for cleaner power that's made at home.LiNeBrEaKsteve.patterson@jacksonville.com,	SOLAR ENERGY (92%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (91%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (90%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (89%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (78%); POWER PLANTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (78%); IMPORT TRADE (76%); WIND ENERGY (73%); STRATEGIC PLANNING (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); GROCERY STORES and SUPERMARKETS (69%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (67%); JOB CREATION (53%)  		ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE (54%)  			CHARLIE CRIST (55%)  	JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA (91%) FLORIDA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%); GERMANY (90%); CENTRAL EUROPE (58%)  	December 4, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Florida Times-Union

Charlie Crist proposed last year.LiNeBrEaKThe analysis from consultants hired by the Florida Public Service Commission projected that by 2020, anywhere from 6 percent to 27 percent of the electricity used in Florida could be derived from renewable sources such as solar power. LiNeBrEaKCrist suggested a 20 percent benchmark for 2020 when he launched a broad initiative in 2007 to address climate change, which is widely attributed to the buildup of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels and other sources.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental activists asked the commission to try hard to reach that mark.LiNeBrEaK"It's an important goal. It shows that Florida is open for business" with companies making alternative energy, said George Cavros, an attorney for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.LiNeBrEaKThe Legislature has told the Public Service Commission to propose a firm requirement for utilities to meet and to have that ready by Feb. 1. The commission hired Navigant Consulting to project how available and financially competitive renewable fuel sources would be by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThe answer delivered Wednesday wasn't conclusive, and commissioners didn't make any final decisions.LiNeBrEaKThe consultants said the price of traditional fossil fuels would be the biggest - and most unpredictable - issue on how fast alternatives would be financially viable.LiNeBrEaK"There is a very large range of potential," said Jay Paidipati, a managing consultant at Navigant. He said market conditions could make renewable sources useful for anywhere from 1. 8 billion to 18 billion watts of power capacity. By comparison, JEA has capacity to produce about 2. 4 billion watts of power at any given time.LiNeBrEaKConsultants said they projected a half-dozen different situations involving good and bad market conditions. The projections also figured in whether utilities that make power from renewable sources could sell certificates that other utilities could use like credit for making green power themselves.LiNeBrEaKOnly the brightest scenario showed the state reaching Crist's goal, but the second-best projection came close.LiNeBrEaKA team of Navigant analysts said solar power has drawbacks, but by 2020 some solar should be a viable choice in almost any energy market. The same consultants said gases from landfills and sewage treatment plants will be affordable power sources, as will some items like unused parts of sugar cane and scrap wood left over from tree farming and clippings.LiNeBrEaKWind power could be competitive, but only with renewable-energy credits being sold, they concluded.LiNeBrEaKCavros said the Southern Alliance, a prominent advocate for renewable power, estimates that meeting Crist's goal in 2020 would cost a typical consumer an extra $3. 50 a month. He said that was based on information in Navigant's estimates, although the consultants didn't suggest a specific price for reaching Crist's goal.LiNeBrEaKWorried about setting unrealistic schedules, commission staff members drafted a preliminary rule early in the fall that aimed for the 20 percent mark by 2041.LiNeBrEaKAfter hearing the consultants Wednesday, staffers suggested weighing three possible timelines: reaching Crist's goal on time, 10 years late or 21 years late. They presented projections that said it would cost billions of dollars less to use the slower timelines.LiNeBrEaKBut discussion of longer timelines stopped shortly after that, when Commissioner Nathan Skop stated his support for Crist's goals and suggested potential rules that could help steer investment into each of several kinds of alternative fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe commission will meet in January to create a final rule.LiNeBrEaKsteve.patterson@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4263	RENEWABLE ENERGY (92%); BIOFUELS (91%); CONSULTING SERVICES (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); BIOMASS (90%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (90%); WIND POWER PLANTS (88%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); ELECTRICITY MARKETS (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (78%); LEGISLATORS (77%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (73%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (72%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); NURSERY and TREE PRODUCTION (69%); LANDFILLS (50%)  	NAVIGANT CONSULTING INC (55%)  	FLORIDA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (57%)  	NCI (NYSE) (55%)  		CHARLIE CRIST (93%)  	TALLAHASSEE, FL, USA (92%) FLORIDA, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 4, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Florida Times-Union   																
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   ALL S EDITION	Big Three auto firms will need music, too  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A11  	621 words  	The American "love affair" with cars is close to dead, then-Ford Motor chief Bill Ford lamented six years ago. "In California, people used to write songs about T-Birds and Corvettes," said Henry Ford's great-grandson. "Today, they write regulations." Ford had earlier shocked Detroit by admitting that sport utility vehicles caused environmental problems.LiNeBrEaKFord got it, even before the recent spike in gasoline prices sent consumers stampeding out of gas-guzzlers. As the Big Three automakers again ask Washington for help, Ford Motor is the only one not begging for an immediate taxpayer bailout. LiNeBrEaKOne reason: It's the farthest along in developing fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaKPublic campaignLiNeBrEaKOnce the companies restructure and have the technology in place, they can turn to winning back the public. A car isn't like a refrigerator. You buy a fridge, and if the appliance works, it quickly fades into the wallpaper. A car is your steed and daily companion. It develops a personality, even if only in your head.LiNeBrEaKAnd what kind of personality has Detroit offered in recent decades?LiNeBrEaKOften not a pleasing one. A half-century has passed since ads promoted the 1957 Chevy Bel Air as "Kitten-Quiet and Cream-Smooth." Gone are the automotive hymns of the '60s -- the Beach Boys' "Little Deuce Coupe" or Jan and Dean's "Surf City." Would Bruce Springsteen ever serenade an SUV (or its owner) as he did the pastel Caddy in his 1984 rockabilly song "Pink Cadillac"?LiNeBrEaKA moment of silence for the female curves and rocket ship fins that made Detroit's golden age so much fun. At some point, cars designed to seduce turned into trucks of potential aggression -- humorless, muscle-bound brutes.LiNeBrEaKThe SUV was old technology sold at big mark-ups in a market dependent on cheap gas.LiNeBrEaKPromoting wrong cultureLiNeBrEaKDetroit lost hearts and minds. Environmentalists raged at its killing of rules to cut smog and emissions of planet-warming gases. National-security experts decried its promotion of a gas-guzzling culture that enriched our oil-producing enemies. While General Motors fought fuel-efficiency regulations, Toyota successfully marketed itself as the earth-loving maker of the Prius (even as it churned out gluttonous Sequoia and Tundra trucks).LiNeBrEaKYes, Detroit had to think short-term if it was to maintain its very generous employee and retiree benefits, some of which were excessive. (Even friends of labor strain to justify paying laid-off autoworkers $31 an hour plus benefits to do nothing.) The United Auto Workers are not to blame, though. They tried to get what they could. The carmakers should have drawn lines.LiNeBrEaKThus, when the Big Three went to Washington last month for their bailout, they met a Congress that was not so much lame duck as mad duck. Imagine Donald Duck's nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie flying their private jets to ask Uncle Scrooge McDuck for a handout.LiNeBrEaKWin over DemsLiNeBrEaKNote that President-elect Obama and the enhanced Democratic majority in Congress are not rushing forth with alms.LiNeBrEaK"Taxpayers can't be expected to pony up more money for an auto industry that has been resistant to change," Obama said after the three executives were sent home empty-handed. "And I was surprised that they did not have a better-thought-out proposal when they arrived in Congress."LiNeBrEaKUncle Scrooge couldn't have said it better.LiNeBrEaKDetroit's plan should include a return to romance. Picture an ad with a cowboy. He's leaning against a big-tailed 1957 DeSoto Fireflite in "Fiesta Red" with white trim. "Choose any car in the De Soto corral, and pardner," the cowboy says, "you've got yourself a thoroughbred."LiNeBrEaKNothing wrong with plain, reliable cars, but surely Detroit can market something sexier than the appliances produced by Honda and Toyota.LiNeBrEaKThere may be a song in it.

The Marin Independent Journal (Novato, California)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Electric vehicles slowly make their way to Marin  	Nancy Isles Nation, The Marin Independent Journal, Novato, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	563 words  	Dec. 4--Electric cars haven't exactly been flying out the door at Marin Cycleworks in Corte Madera, but dealer Carter Sweet delivered three of them to a Point Richmond security company Thursday in the first of what he hopes will be multiple orders.LiNeBrEaKSweet has had Zap electric cars in his showroom for about a year and offers several brands of electric scooters, but they are not yet the solution to volatile gas prices or global warming. LiNeBrEaK"The No. 1 issue is getting the word to potential buyers," Sweet said. "It is still a very beginning concept."LiNeBrEaKElectric cars can be plugged in and charged anywhere, but current technology limits battery capacity and speed. The Zap cars that Marin Cycleworks sells go up to 45 mph, which is great for driving around town. But traversing Marin often involves using Highway 101, and getting to town can take drivers up some steep hills.LiNeBrEaK"You need a very sturdy battery pack to get around the backroads of Marin," Sweet said, adding that the technology is improving.LiNeBrEaKBut right now, electric cars are practical for short trips and for businesses like Forbes Security, which will use them to patrol campuses, housing complexes and malls.LiNeBrEaKKirk Forbes, owner of the Point Richmond company, said the three-wheel trucks his company ordered appear to meet expectations and will be sent out to sites for trial.LiNeBrEaK"It not only saves us money, but one of our mission statements is we serve and protect people and property," Forbes said. "Now, we also serve andLiNeBrEaKprotect the environment."LiNeBrEaKSweet said businesses that move repeatedly in limited areas like college campuses are ideal customers for electric cars because they cost less to fuel and maintain than gasoline-powered cars. They also are more affordable at $12,500.LiNeBrEaKHe is working with a San Rafael florist who is considering an electric vehicle for deliveries.LiNeBrEaK"She delivers in a four-mile radius and does a lot of stop-and-go driving," Sweet said.LiNeBrEaKSome more advanced electric cars are coming onto the market but they are in short supply.LiNeBrEaKIn Mill Valley, Mike Ryan won approval from city planners for an electric vehicle dealership at 433 Miller Ave. but has not had cars available until this month. He plans a "soft" opening Saturday and a grand opening in January.LiNeBrEaKRyan will be selling the Buckshot three-wheel trucks, which go up to 55 mph and can travel 85 miles on a single battery charge, and Triacs, a three-wheel car that cruises up to 70 mph and can travel for 100 miles on a charge.LiNeBrEaKThe advanced technology comes at a price. The Buckshot retails at $22,995 and the Triac goes for $23,995.LiNeBrEaKRyan thinks there is a lot of excitement in town about the dealership, where he has a variety of electric vehicles and scooters on display.LiNeBrEaK"Every time I go to the dealership to do anything, people come by and knock on the window," Ryan said.LiNeBrEaKContact Nancy Isles Nation via e-mail at nnation@marinij.comLiNeBrEaKRead more Business and stocks stories at the IJ's Business and stocks section.

Alan - who owns 200 acres of farmland in upstate Craryville and is a member of the New York Farm Bureau - has sent out an e-mail asking friends to protest proposed state environmental legislation that would penalize farmers for flatulence emitted by their cows and sheep.

The New York Times 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	From Hoof to Dinner Table, A New Bid to Cut Emissions  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1  	1576 words  	The cows and pigs dotting these flat green plains in the southern Netherlands create a bucolic landscape. But looked at through the lens of greenhouse gas accounting, they are living smokestacks, spewing methane emissions into the air. LiNeBrEaK  That is why a group of farmers-turned-environmentalists here at a smelly but impeccably clean research farm have a new take on making a silk purse from a sow's ear: They cook manure from their 3,000 pigs to capture the methane trapped within it, and then use the gas to make electricity for the local power grid. LiNeBrEaK  Rising in the fields of the environmentally conscious Netherlands, the Sterksel project is a rare example of fledgling efforts to mitigate the heavy emissions from livestock. But much more needs to be done, scientists say, as more and more people are eating more meat around the world. LiNeBrEaK  What to do about farm emissions is  one of the main issues being discussed this week and next, as the environment ministers from 187 nations gather in Poznan, Poland, for talks on a new treaty to combat global warming. In releasing its latest figure on emissions last month, United Nations climate officials cited agriculture and  transportation  as the two sectors that remained most ''problematic.''  LiNeBrEaK  ''It's an area that's been largely overlooked,'' said Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, head of the Nobel Prize-winning United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He says people should eat less meat to control their carbon footprints. ''We haven't come to grips with agricultural emissions.'' LiNeBrEaK  The trillions of  farm animals around the world generate 18 percent of the emissions that are raising global temperatures, according to United Nations estimates, more even than from cars, buses and airplanes. LiNeBrEaK  But unlike other industries, like cement making and power, which are facing enormous political and regulatory pressure to get greener, large-scale farming is just beginning to come under scrutiny as policy makers, farmers and scientists cast about for solutions. LiNeBrEaK  High-tech fixes include those like the project here, called ''methane capture,'' as well as inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane, which traps heat with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide. California is already working on a program to encourage systems in pig and dairy farms like the one in Sterksel. LiNeBrEaK  Other proposals include everything from persuading consumers to eat less meat to slapping a ''sin tax'' on pork and beef. Next year, Sweden will start labeling food products so that shoppers can look at how much emission can be attributed to serving steak  compared with, say, chicken or turkey. LiNeBrEaK  ''Of course for the environment it's better to eat beans than beef, but if you want to eat beef for New Year's, you'll know which beef is best to buy,'' said Claes Johansson, chief of sustainability at the Swedish agricultural group Lantmannen. LiNeBrEaK  But such fledgling proposals are part of a daunting game of catch-up. In large developing countries like China, India and Brazil, consumption of red meat has risen 33 percent in the last decade. It is expected to double globally between 2000 and 2050. While the global economic downturn may slow the globe's appetite for meat momentarily, it is not likely to reverse a profound trend. LiNeBrEaK  Of the more than 2,000 projects supported by the United Nations' ''green'' financing system intended to curb emissions, only 98 are in agriculture. There is no standardized green labeling system for meat, as there is for electric appliances and even fish. LiNeBrEaK  Indeed, scientists are still trying to define the practical, low-carbon version of a slab of bacon or a hamburger. Every step of producing meat creates emissions. LiNeBrEaK  Flatus and manure from animals contain not only methane, but also nitrous oxide, an even more potent warming agent. And meat requires energy for refrigeration as it moves from farm to market to home. LiNeBrEaK  Producing meat in this ever-more crowded world requires creating new pastures and planting more land for imported feeds, particularly soy, instead of relying on local grazing. That has contributed to the clearing of rain forests, particularly in South America, robbing the world of crucial ''carbon sinks,'' the vast tracts of trees and vegetation that absorb carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaK  ''I'm not sure that the system we have for livestock can be sustainable,'' said Dr. Pachauri of the United Nations. A sober scientist, he suggests that ''the most attractive'' near-term solution is for everyone simply to ''reduce meat consumption,'' a change he says would have more effect than switching to a hybrid car. LiNeBrEaK  The Lancet medical journal and groups like the Food Ethics Council in Britain have supported his suggestion to eat less red meat to control global emissions, noting that Westerners eat more meat than is healthy anyway. LiNeBrEaK  Producing a pound of beef creates 11 times as much greenhouse gas emission as a pound of chicken and 100 times more than a pound of carrots, according to Lantmannen, the Swedish group.LiNeBrEaK  But any suggestion to eat less meat may run into resistance in a world with more carnivores and a booming global livestock industry. Meat producers have taken issue with the United Nations' estimate of livestock-related emissions, saying the figure is inflated because it includes the deforestation in the Amazon, a phenomenon that the Brazilian producers say might have occurred anyway. LiNeBrEaK  United Nations scientists defend their accounting. With so much demand for meat, ''you do slash rain forest,'' said Pierre Gerber, a senior official at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Soy cultivation has doubled in Brazil during the past decade, and more than half is used for animal feed. LiNeBrEaK  Laurence Wrixon, executive director of the International Meat Secretariat, said that his members were working with the Food and Agriculture Organization to reduce emissions but that the main problem was fast-rising consumption in developing countries. ''So whether you like it or not, there's going to be rising demand for meat, and our job is to make it as sustainable as possible,'' he said.  LiNeBrEaK  Estimates of emissions from agriculture as a percentage of all emissions vary widely from country to country, but they are clearly over 50 percent in big agricultural and meat-producing countries like Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. LiNeBrEaK  In the United States, agriculture accounted for just 7. 4 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2006, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. LiNeBrEaK  The percentage was lower because the United States produces extraordinarily high levels of emissions in other areas, like transportation and landfills, compared with other nations. The figure also did not include fuel burning and land-use changes. LiNeBrEaK  Wealthy, environmentally conscious countries with large livestock sectors -- the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and New Zealand -- have started experimenting with solutions. LiNeBrEaK  In Denmark, by law, farmers now inject manure under the soil instead of laying it on top of the fields, a process that enhances its fertilizing effect, reduces odors and also prevents emissions from escaping. By contrast, in many parts of the developing world, manure is left in open pools and lathered on fields.LiNeBrEaK  Others suggest including agriculture emissions in carbon cap-and-trade systems, which currently focus on heavy industries like cement making and power generation. Farms that produce more than their pre-set limit of emissions would have to buy permits from greener colleagues to pollute.LiNeBrEaK  New Zealand recently announced that it would include agriculture in its new emissions trading scheme by 2013. To that end, the government is spending tens of millions of dollars financing research and projects like breeding cows that produce less gas and inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane, said Philip Gurnsey of the Environment Ministry. LiNeBrEaK  At the electricity-from-manure project here in Sterksel, the refuse from thousands of pigs is combined with local waste materials (outdated carrot juice and crumbs from a cookie factory), and pumped into warmed tanks called digesters. There, resident bacteria release the natural gas within, which is burned to generate heat and electricity. LiNeBrEaK  The farm uses 25 percent of the electricity, and the rest is sold to a local power provider. The leftover mineral slurry is an ideal fertilizer that reduces the use of chemical fertilizers, whose production releases a heavy dose of carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaK  For this farm the scheme has provided a substantial payback: By reducing its emissions, it has been able to sell carbon credits on European markets. It makes money by selling electricity. It gets free fertilizer. LiNeBrEaK  And, in a small country where farmers are required to have manure trucked away, it saves $190,000 annually in disposal fees. John Horrevorts, experiment coordinator, whose family has long raised swine, said that dozens of such farms had been set up in the Netherlands, though cost still makes it impractical for small piggeries. Indeed, one question that troubles green farmers is whether consumers will pay more for their sustainable meat. LiNeBrEaK  ''In the U.K., supermarkets are sometimes asking about green, but there's no global system yet,'' said Bent Claudi Lassen, chairman of the Danish Bacon and Meat Council, which supports green production. ''We're worried that other countries not producing in a green way, like Brazil, could undercut us on price.''

The New York Times 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Proposal Ties Economic Stimulus to Energy Savings  	By JOHN M. BRODER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 34  	1251 words  	President-elect Barack Obama and leaders in Congress are fashioning a plan to pour billions of dollars into a jobs program to jolt the economy and lay the groundwork for a more energy-efficient one.LiNeBrEaK  The details and cost of the so-called green-jobs program are still unclear, but a senior Obama aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a work in progress, said it would probably include the weatherizing of hundreds of thousands of homes, the installation of ''smart meters'' to monitor and reduce home energy use, and billions of dollars in grants to state and local governments for mass transit and infrastructure projects.LiNeBrEaK  The green component of the much larger stimulus plan would cost at least $15 billion a year, and perhaps considerably more, depending on how the projects were defined, aides working on the package said.LiNeBrEaK  During the campaign, Mr. Obama supported a measure to address global warming by capping carbon emissions while allowing companies to buy and trade pollution permits. He said he would devote $150 billion of the revenue from the sale of those permits over 10 years to energy efficiency and alternative energy projects to wean the nation from fuels that are the main causes of the heating the atmosphere. LiNeBrEaK  But the Obama adviser who discussed the green energy project said Mr. Obama would not await passage of a global warming bill before embarking on the new energy and infrastructure spending. House and Senate supporters of a climate bill said they would continue working on legislative language but did not expect quick action on a cap-and-trade law because of the economic emergency.LiNeBrEaK  That means that the green-jobs program would not be financed with pollution credits bought by power generators and other carbon emitters, but instead would be added to the budget deficit.LiNeBrEaK  Congressional officials working with the Obama administration said the stimulus program was also likely to involve tax breaks or direct government subsidies for a variety of clean energy projects, including solar arrays, wind farms, advanced biofuels and technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants.LiNeBrEaK  The programs will be a part of a larger economic stimulus package whose outlines are faint but which is expected to cost $400 billion to $500 billion. Mr. Obama has said that his goal is to create or save 2. 5 million jobs in the next two years. He has assigned to his economic and environmental advisers the task of devising a proposal that is expected to combine a shot of new federal money into existing federal and state programs and the possible creation of  agencies modeled on New Deal public works programs. LiNeBrEaK  ''We'll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizing schools that are failing our children, and building wind farms and solar panels, fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead,'' Mr. Obama said in a radio address last month, echoing a campaign promise with a new sense of urgency.LiNeBrEaK  The political climate seems favorable to an economic stimulus plan, but large sums of new money touch off lobbying frenzies and energy projects spur  debate between conservationists and those who want to more fully exploit domestic sources of oil, natural gas and coal.LiNeBrEaK  Some experts said  the record of government's intervention in energy markets and new technologies was not promising, citing as a spectacular example the Carter-era Synthetic Fuels Corporation, which spent more than $3 billion without producing any commercially usable amount of coal-based liquid fuel.LiNeBrEaK  Ethanol and other non-oil-based fuels have also not proved their commercial value, in some cases yielding less energy than was needed to produce them, or, in ethanol's case, diverting land to corn and driving up food prices. LiNeBrEaK  The plan could also face resistance from fiscal hawks. In 2004, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, almost single-handedly blocked a $100 billion energy package, saying  the billions of dollars in subsidies for ethanol and other alternative fuels were little more than a special-interest boondoggle. The bill was revived a year later at half the cost, and much of the money in it has not been spent.LiNeBrEaK  ''Now they're talking about some large amount of money -- what, $100 billion? -- and spending it on windmills, job training, whatever,'' said David Kreutzer, who studies energy economics and climate change at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. ''But where do you get the $100 billion in the first place? Are you going to take $100 billion from some other part of the economy, are you going to tax some people to pay for it? Are you just going to print it or borrow it? The money has to come from somewhere.''LiNeBrEaK  The Obama team and Congressional leaders say they want a plan ready shortly after Congress reconvenes in January.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama has said that, after stabilizing the economy and the markets, putting the nation on the path to a more energy-efficient future is his top priority. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said this week that rebuilding infrastructure and creating green jobs was ''the first order of business that we will have'' when Congress reconvenes in January. Several hearings are planned even before Mr. Obama takes office on Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaK  State officials say a lack of financing has stalled billions of dollars in projects. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California told Mr. Obama this week that the states were ready to break ground with $136 billion in infrastructure projects that could provide new jobs within two years.LiNeBrEaK  The American Public Transportation Association, which represents local mass transit authorities, said there were $8 billion in ''ready-to-go'' projects that could preserve or create thousands of jobs and provide more energy-efficient transportation.

Scott, the chief executive of Atlanta's transit agency and head of the national association, told Congress in October that the projects included diesel-electric hybrid buses for Chicago; a new bus maintenance shop for Eugene, Ore.; and a set of crossover tracks to allow San Francisco's rapid transit trains to turn around more quickly and carry more riders.LiNeBrEaK  The Obama aide said  the residential smart meters were a relatively small project that would not create a large number of jobs, but the aide said  they would be an essential building block for the electric grid of the future. The new grid -- a multiyear, multibillion-dollar project -- would more efficiently move electricity from its source to its destination and would reward those who saved power or used it during off-peak hours.LiNeBrEaK  Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who heads the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said  he was sympathetic to Mr. Obama's desire to pump up the economy and reduce energy usage. But Mr. Bingaman said he was wary of big government spending programs without sufficient oversight or expertise.LiNeBrEaK  ''Just buying smart meters for everybody doesn't really move the ball very far,'' said Mr. Bingaman, who will hold a hearing next week to gather ideas for energy-related stimulus spending. ''Realistically speaking, getting money properly spent in a short period of time requires some degree of competence in the government agency doing it. The best plan is to start with existing programs that work, like weatherization, and build on those.''

The New York Times 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	The Life of an Antarctic Archipelago  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 42  	296 words  	Life on this planet always surprises us. Animals turn out to be smarter than humans expect. Biological interrelationships turn out to be more intricate and more finely tuned than we had predicted.  LiNeBrEaK  The latest example is a biological survey in and around the South Orkney Islands -- a clutch of islands halfway between the tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula -- that shows greater biodiversity than scientists had expected. It included familiar species, like chinstrap penguins, as well as less familiar ones, like aquatic worms and soft corals. Scientists also discovered five new species of sea mosses and minute crustaceans related to wood lice. LiNeBrEaK  It is a welcome reminder that the perceived biological ''poverty'' of the polar regions derives from the fact that it's easier to count species on land than in the ocean. Once you look beneath the waves -- the team of scientists aboard a British Antarctic Survey research vessel spent seven weeks doing so -- it becomes clear how rich these regions are. The vast majority of the species recorded -- 821 out of 1,224 -- live on the ocean floor. LiNeBrEaK  One of the more striking conclusions is that the South Orkney Islands, and other polar islands like them, may be the last regions on the globe where biodiversity has changed relatively little over the past century. This survey provides a base-line estimate of polar life before the increasing effects of climate change are felt. It is part of the Census of Marine Life, a 10-year project.LiNeBrEaK  What those effects may be, and how hard we need to work against them, are also suggested in a new report from the World Wildlife Fund. It warns that 75 percent of the major penguin colonies in the Antarctic may well perish with a 2 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures.

The News-Times (Danbury, Connecticut)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	A Clearinghouse for green ideas  	Robert Miller, The News-Times, Danbury, Conn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	586 words  	Dec. 4--Keeping water clean. Keeping soil fertile and safe from erosions. Guarding wetlands against developers. Offering advice on plants that will help the environment, not run roughshod over it.LiNeBrEaKThose are the traditional duties of the state's conservation districts, the non-profit organizations that offer planning expertise to towns and individuals throughout Connecticut.LiNeBrEaKBut in recent years, the Northwest Conservation District, which works with the towns of Litchfield and northern Fairfield County, has been extending its range. LiNeBrEaKIt's taken a lead in spreading the gospel of Smart Growth -- the idea of clustering development on places where there's the infrastructure to support it, rather than letting sprawl continue unabated.LiNeBrEaKNow, it's taking on another job -- giving towns and individuals ways to get greener in their energy use, with a program called ConnVert. For Jean Cronauer, the district's executive director, the choice to do this was obvious.LiNeBrEaK"We could not ignore energy," Cronauer said. "We're not abandoning our traditional work with soil and water conservation. But energy is such a critical issue."LiNeBrEaKIt's critical because conserving energy, and bolstering the use of alternative energy, are linked directly to combatting global warming, Cronauer said. And global warming has the potential to change soil and water in ways we can't imagine right now.LiNeBrEaKCronauer said the district decided what it could do best is act as a sort of clean energy clearing house, Rather than trying to answer all clean energy questions, it will work to steer people in the right direction.LiNeBrEaK"People need a reliable source of information," she said.LiNeBrEaKIt's also worked with the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, which is trying to spread the gospel of energy, town by town.LiNeBrEaK"We'll work with any town that wants to set up an energy task force," Cronauer said.LiNeBrEaKThat campaign is starting to catch on. Right now, seven towns in the region -- Danbury, Newtown, Redding, Ridgefield, Roxbury, Sherman and Washington -- have signed on to be Clean Energy communities, taking the pledge that by 2010, each town will use alternative energy sources to supply at least 20 percent of the electricity used in town buildings.LiNeBrEaKThey must also get an energy assessment of town buildings and commit to reducing energy use by 10 percent. They must get the community involved, with families and business committing to use clean energy.LiNeBrEaKThe prize is a free solar panel.LiNeBrEaKSo far, Newtown, Ridgefield and Redding have passed the test. Dan Holmes, the head of Newtown's Energy Committee, said this town has already picked out the building -- Reed Intermediate School -- where it will go.LiNeBrEaK"If it's up by Earth Day, we'll be happy," he said of the annual environmental celebration, which will fall on April 22 this year.LiNeBrEaKBut Holmes said the town would like to install a much larger array atop the school to give it even more solar power. And there may be other innovations coming.LiNeBrEaK"We're just skimming the surface right now," Holmes said. "There are so many neat, interesting ideas out there."LiNeBrEaKContact Robert MillerLiNeBrEaKat bmiller@newstimes.comLiNeBrEaKor at (203) 731-3345	RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (88%); WETLANDS (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (78%); EARTH DAY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (77%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (65%)  			OtherOTC:CLER  	General  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (55%)  	CONNECTICUT, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081204-VS-A-Clearinghouse-for-green-ideas-1204  	VS  													
The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Sunrise Edition	Green-building plan scaled back  	DYLAN RIVERA, The Oregonian  	Local News  	911 words  	SUMMARY: Rules   | New commercial buildings would still face fees and rebates, but existing homes would not be affectedLiNeBrEaKPortland's green-building plan scaled back New commercial buildings would still face fees and rebates, but existing homes would not be affectedLiNeBrEaKGreen-building plan scaled back LiNeBrEaKPlan revealsLiNeBrEaKrift betweenLiNeBrEaKthe industriesLiNeBrEaKDYLAN RIVERALiNeBrEaKA year ago, City Commissioner Dan Saltzman unveiled a sweeping, green-building policy --a package of fees, inspections and rebates for homes, offices and shopping centers. He announced it in Chicago, at a giant environmental-building conference, intending to polish Portland's image as a leader in all things green.LiNeBrEaKUpon returning home, however, a firestorm of resistance singed the commissioner and nearly torched the entire policy. Saltzman retreated, forming committees --adding the Realtors and homebuilders who were left out of initial discussions --to rework the policy.LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, Saltzman unveiled the results: A scaled-down policy that would not touch owners of existing homes. Starting in 2010, it would impose the original fee-and-rebate idea on virtually every category of commercial buildings. Existing ones would be asked to disclose energy-efficiency information, and only the worst would be asked to improve.LiNeBrEaKNew homes would not get the new fees or rebates. But the city would ask of the homebuilding industry: Meet a citywide goal of getting more new homes certified green each year, or else Portland would impose a fee-and-rebate system to make builders comply.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal seeks to cut down on the consumption of electricity, heating oil and natural gas in homes, offices and shopping centers --collectively, the top source of emissions in Portland that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKEven the scaled-down plan would be among the toughest in the nation. Only a handful of cities have taken steps to require the private sector to build more Earth-friendly buildings --and most of them are more limited and don't take effect for several years.LiNeBrEaKSaltzman said his new, humbler policy is an improvement. And rather than hamstring a real estate industry that's already reeling from a massive downturn, it could generate energy savings and employment in green industries that have a positive impact on the local economy, he said.LiNeBrEaK"The unprecedented urgency of global warming, rising energy prices, and the need to create new jobs makes this a key moment for Portland," Saltzman said.LiNeBrEaKA public comment period on the policy begins today and runs through Jan. 20. The City Council could consider it for a vote this spring, but Saltzman said it could come later.LiNeBrEaKThe policy has already laid bare a rift among the larger Portland real estate players, mirroring a division apparent nationwide. The nation's biggest commercial developers have caught onto the green-building trend and often brag about their energy efficiency strides and certification plaques. Portland's biggest developer, Gerding Edlen Development, built a global reputation for green building by using state and local incentives to help finance its projects.LiNeBrEaKBut Earth-friendly standards for homebuilders have been slower to develop. Certification programs are more varied, and the residential industry remains hostile to government requirements --even if the rules promise rebates for compliance.LiNeBrEaKDave Nielsen, chief executive officer of the Home Builders Association of Metropolitan Portland, said Saltzman is rushing to impose new rules without assessing their potential impact. Buyers of new homes might or might not recoup the higher price they pay for energy efficiency measures, Nielsen said.LiNeBrEaK"They have no clue in terms of what the costs are to do this and what the value will be, to the consumer or the value of the home," Nielsen said. "They're just trying to be first to something, and it's crazy."LiNeBrEaKThe commercial real estate industry, however, is far less hostile to Saltzman's proposal. The Oregon chapter of NAIOP, the commercial real estate association, has "mixed emotions" about it, said Mike Wells, a local developer and chairman of the chapter's public affairs committee.LiNeBrEaK"The industry is really moving to having buildings that are LEED certified," Wells said. "I'm not sure how much regulations are needed to prod the market to do it, because the market's already doing it."LiNeBrEaKMid- to large-scale office, apartment and shopping centers would be charged a fee if they merely comply with the state energy code. If they exceed energy- and water-use standards by 25 percent or more, they would get a waiver from the fee. And if they exceed by 35 percent or more, they would get money back from the city. Industrial buildings would be exempt.LiNeBrEaKFor new homes, the city would require that 20 percent built in the first year meet third-party green certification standards. If the industry falls short of that benchmark, the city would establish fees and rebates like the program for office buildings.LiNeBrEaKUntil recently, homebuilders could sell anything they produced, so they didn't have to concern themselves with environmental issues, said Jerry Yudelson, a green-building consultant in Tucson, Ariz.LiNeBrEaK"There's no reason why a homebuilder cannot build a home that's not 50 percent more efficient and not spend an extra penny," Yudelson said. "This is building science, not rocket science."LiNeBrEaKof nation's toughestLiNeBrEaKDylan Rivera: 503-221-8532;LiNeBrEaKdylanrivera@news.oregonian.comLiNeBrEaKFor environment news, go to:LiNeBrEaKoregonlive.com/environment	ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); GREEN BUILDING (90%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (89%); CITIES (89%); COMMERCIAL PROPERTY (89%); REAL ESTATE (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (86%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); REAL ESTATE AGENTS (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); CITY GOVERNMENT (76%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); EMISSIONS (75%); CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (73%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (71%); RETAILERS (70%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (66%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (65%); OIL and GAS CONSUMPTION (64%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (64%); JOB CREATION (60%); HEATING OIL (50%)  						PORTLAND, OR, USA (90%) OREGON, USA (92%); EARTH (53%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  								Saltzman Proposal still one								
Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Dire need: Countering hurricanes' deadly fury  	Jerry W. Jackson, The Orlando Sentinel, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	479 words  	Dec. 4--LAKE BUENA VISTALiNeBrEaKHurricane experts and others meeting this week near Orlando delivered more dire warnings Wednesday about the urgent, short-term need to harden existing homes and build stronger structures, while planning for the long-term loss of coastal buffer zones that will make Florida and other states even more vulnerable to big storms. LiNeBrEaKLeaving aside the political debate over global warming, the evidence is clear that financial losses to catastrophic storms have been soaring worldwide, sea levels are rising, ocean temperatures are going up and warmer waters fuel more powerful storms, said Amanda Staudt, a scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaK"Small increases in storm intensity mean big increases in damage," said Staudt, a panel moderator during the opening day of the Hurricane Science for Safety Leadership Forum in the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Hotel conference center.LiNeBrEaKMore than 160 professionals, planners and policy makers are attending the two-day conference, sponsored by insurance-related companies such as WeatherPredict Consulting Inc. and industry-supported nonprofits such as the Institute for Business and Home Safety and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers, regulators and university researchers from throughout the country said that a sense of urgency must be maintained because the amount of work to be done is monumental, and it's easy for the public and for policy makers to become complacent.LiNeBrEaK"We know hurricanes will come," said U.S. Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. But what no one can say for sure, he said, is who will next suffer the fate of a Hurricane Katrina-like catastrophe or when the next mega-storm might hit. Although it has been more than three years since that great Gulf of Mexico storm flooded New Orleans and shredded much of Mississippi's coastline, "the devastation, for the most part, is still there," Thompson said.LiNeBrEaKHe vowed to reintroduce federal legislation to promote more programs that encourage "mitigation" -- the strengthening of existing homes and buildings to make them more resistant to hurricanes and tropical storms. Such legislation has failed in the past but has a much better chance of passing once the Obama administration takes office in January, said Thompson, the longest-serving black legislator in Mississippi.

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE WAS MEASURE OF LAST RESORT, FPL PROTESTER SAYS  	By SUSAN SPENCER-WENDEL Palm Beach Post Staff Writer  	LOCAL; Pg. 3B  	623 words  	A leader of a local environmental action group testified Wednesday that he resorted to civil disobedience -- blocking the entranceway to a huge power plant's construction site -- after other efforts to stop the project failed.LiNeBrEaKPanagioti Tsolkas, 27, and six others are on trial, charged with unlawful assembly, resisting arrest without violence and trespassing after their arrest Feb. 18 while protesting Florida Power and Light's West County Energy Center. Tsolkas testified that the groups Everglades Earth First! and the Palm Beach County Environmental Coalition had tried letter writing and speaking at planning meetings. LiNeBrEaK"We found ourselves basically ignored," Tsolkas said.LiNeBrEaKSo he and others linked themselves together in a contraption of PVC pipe, chicken wire and tar and would only move if FPL's chief executive or the governor arrived and agreed to stop the plant's construction. Meanwhile traffic along Southern Boulevard backed up for miles as trucks were blocked from entering the site. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office dispatched a helicopter and its Emergency Field Force to resolve the matter, according to testimony.LiNeBrEaK"This was a moment that felt pretty crystal clear to me," Tsolkas said.LiNeBrEaKTsolkas' partner, Lake Worth City Commissioner Cara Jennings, and other supporters packed County Judge Laura Johnson's small courtroom. Jennings signalled to Tsolkas to look at jurors as he testified.LiNeBrEaK"Why not go in the free-speech zone?" asked Assistant Public Defender Charles Fountain II, referring to an area set aside for protesters.LiNeBrEaK"Because I came to stop a power plant, not stand in a free-speech zone," Tsolkas said.LiNeBrEaKA fellow defendant on trial, Lynne Purvis, testified that she ignored the "No Trespassing" signs on the Palm Beach Aggregates property and intentionally disobeyed the sheriff deputies' commands to leave, which surprised her a little, she said.LiNeBrEaK"We were hoping they would sympathize with us and say, 'Thanks,'" said Purvis, 29.LiNeBrEaKAlso on trial for the misdemeanor offenses are Marc Silverstein, Russell McSpadden, Richard Halsted, Brandon Block and Noah Wilson. They are using a rarely employed "necessity" defense-- that it was necessary to commit the crimes to prevent imminent danger or death.LiNeBrEaKTo that end, jurors heard hours of testimony from experts Wednesday about global warming and the effects of the new natural gas-powered plant on the surrounding water supplies and aquifers.LiNeBrEaKDr. Sydney Bacchus, a hydroecologist, testified the plant's water requirements equal that of 50,000 homes and it is potentially one of the largest plants of its kind in the nation. Bacchus testified FPL is permitted to unload 13. 5 million gallons a day of contaminated water, injecting it into underground aquifers and allowing it to seep into water bodies. With her testimony came charts and graphs and photos of aquifers and water bodies.LiNeBrEaKTwo jurors leaned all the way forward in their chairs, mouths agape as they studied them.LiNeBrEaKBacchus talked of cypress roots which will rot and trees that will topple after marshes are drained. She compared it to receding gums, showing jurors a large photo of a set of teeth.LiNeBrEaK"Are you saying this tooth decay was caused by the West County Energy Center?" prosecutor Danielle Croke repeatedly asked.LiNeBrEaKOn cross examination, Croke sought to demonstrate that none of the power plant's perceived threats to safety and the environment is imminent enough to necessitate a crime.LiNeBrEaKThe state attorney's office has aggressively pursued the arrested protesters, in part because of the considerable cost the sheriff's office incurred after dispatching the elite field force.LiNeBrEaKThe protesters could face steep fines and jail or probation if convicted.LiNeBrEaKClosing arguments are expected today.LiNeBrEaK~ susan_spencer_wendel@pbpost.com	POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); SHERIFFS (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (89%); TRESPASSING (89%); CRIMINAL TRESPASS (89%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (89%); TESTIMONY (89%); CRIMINAL OFFENSES (89%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (78%); ARRESTS (77%); MISDEMEANORS (77%); PUBLIC DEFENDERS (77%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (76%); CRIMINAL DEFENSES (76%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (75%); EXPERT WITNESSES (73%); JUDGES (72%); CITY GOVERNMENT (66%); WATER POLLUTION (66%); WATER QUALITY (60%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (58%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); JURY TRIALS (89%)  	FLORIDA POWER and LIGHT CO (57%)  	ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION (84%); EARTH FIRST (57%)  				FLORIDA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	January 15, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	The Big Three need music, too  	FROMA HARROP  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	625 words  	THE AMERICAN  love affair  with cars is close to dead, then-Ford Motor CEO William Clay Ford Jr. lamented six years ago.  In California, people used to write songs about T-Birds and Corvettes,  said Henry Ford s great-grandson.  Today they write regulations.  Ford had earlier shocked Detroit by admitting that sport utility vehicles caused environmental problems.LiNeBrEaKFord got it then, and, as a car man who openly supports Barack Obama s green-energy vision, gets it now. Notably, Ford is the only Big Three automaker not begging for an immediate taxpayer bailout. LiNeBrEaKA car isn t like a refrigerator. You buy a fridge, and if the appliance works, it quickly fades into the wallpaper. A car is your steed and daily companion. It develops a personality, even if only in your head.LiNeBrEaKAnd what kind of personality does your car have today? Probably not much of one. A half century has passed since ads promoted the 1957 Chevy Bel Air as  Kitten-Quiet and Cream-Smooth.  Gone are the automotive hymns of the  60s   the Beach Boys   Little Deuce Coupe  or Jan and Dean s  Surf City.  Would Bruce Springsteen ever serenade an SUV (or its owner) as he did the pastel Caddy in his 1984 rockabilly hit  Pink Cadillac ?LiNeBrEaKA moment of silence for the feminine curves and rocket-ship fins that made Detroit s golden age so much fun. At some point, cars designed to seduce turned into trucks of aggression   humorless, muscle-bound brutes. The SUV was old technology sold at big mark-ups in a market dependent on cheap gas.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists raged at Detroit s killing of rules to cut smog and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. National-security experts decried a gas-guzzling culture that enriched our oil-producing enemies. While General Motors fought those who would raise fuel efficiency, Toyota successfully marketed itself as the Earth-loving maker of the Prius (even as it churned out fuel-gluttonous Sequoia and Tundra trucks).LiNeBrEaKThe weird thing is that Detroit has made impressive strides in developing fuel-efficient vehicles. American carmakers get little credit for it, because they ve opposed tighter energy standards for so long.LiNeBrEaKYes, Detroit had to think short-term if it was to maintain its very generous employee and retiree benefits. And even friends of labor have a hard time justifying a union contract that pays laid-off autoworkers $31 an hour plus benefits to do nothing. The United Autoworkers are not to blame, though. They tried to get what they could. The carmakers should have drawn lines.LiNeBrEaKThus, when the Big Three went to Washington for their bailout, they met a Congress that was not so much lame duck as mad duck. Imagine Donald Duck s nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie flying their private jets to ask Uncle Scrooge McDuck for money. LiNeBrEaKNote that Obama and the enhanced Democratic majority in Congress did not rush forth with alms.  Taxpayers can t be expected to pony up more money for an auto industry that has been resistant to change,  Obama said after the three executives were sent home empty-handed.  And I was surprised that they did not have a better-thought-out proposal when they arrived in Congress. LiNeBrEaKUncle Scrooge couldn t have said it better.LiNeBrEaKDetroit must restructure and march in the green parade. Once that happens, it should turn its thoughts back to romance.LiNeBrEaKPicture an ad with a cowboy. He s leaning against a big-tailed 1957 DeSoto Fireflite in  Fiesta Red  with white trim.  Choose any car in the De Soto corral and, pardner,  the cowboy says,  you ve got yourself a thoroughbred. LiNeBrEaKNothing wrong with plain, reliable cars, but surely Detroit can offer something sexier than the appliances produced by Honda and Toyota. There may be a song in it.LiNeBrEaKFroma Harrop is a member of The Journal s editorial board and a syndicated columnist.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Climate expert offers solutions  	By Peter B. Lord, Journal Environment Writer  	NEWS; Local; Pg. 1  	650 words  	SOUTH KINGSTOWN   For three months scientists have warned about the perils and dimensions of global climate change in special presentations at the University of Rhode Island. This week a Princeton University scientist described possible solutions   a broad spectrum of responses rather than any single action.LiNeBrEaKEngineering Prof. Robert Socolow and ecologist Stephen W. Pacala, codirectors of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative at Princeton, which is a 10-year, $20-million research program, have developed the  stabilization wedge  theory designed to cap carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere at current levels. LiNeBrEaKSocolow, speaking Tuesday at URI s Honors Colloquium on Global Environmental Change, said increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide could be fought with a series of individual responses, each designed to remove one  wedge  from the graph showing rising CO2 levels.LiNeBrEaKThe wedges include improved energy efficiency, removing carbon emissions from electric power production, reducing methane emissions, planting more trees and other vegetation to take up carbon and replacing gasoline-driven vehicles with electricity-powered ones.LiNeBrEaKSocolow said he has been criticized by some for not proposing steep cutbacks in carbon emissions that cause global warming, but that he fears crash programs would cause  terrible mistakes. LiNeBrEaK We should do far more than what the people in the Senate imagine,  Socolow said.  But less than what some greens want. LiNeBrEaKSocolow also takes issue with some, such as NASA scientist James Hansen, who contend that the world is fast approaching a point of no return when it comes to climate change.LiNeBrEaK This is a risk management problem, not a threshold problem,  Socolow said.LiNeBrEaKURI Provost Donald H. DeHayes introduced Socolow as the key person in the country developing solutions to global warming. While work on environmental issues is often depressing, DeHayes said, Socolow s work offers reasons to be hopeful.LiNeBrEaKSocolow said there is 3,000-billion tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today, 800 million more than just 100 years ago. At the height of the last Ice Age, he said, there was 1,500 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKSocolow said he still believes there is some headroom that would allow for more CO2 increases, but the only ethical thing to do would be for developed countries to cap or reduce their emissions, so the poorest countries have some space to grow and create more emissions of their own.LiNeBrEaKBurning fossil fuels creates 30 billion tons of CO2 annually. About 8 billion tons is removed by the oceans and 7 billion tons taken up by plant life on land, so about 15 billion tons is added to the atmosphere each year. That additional CO2 is what Socolow wants to prevent.LiNeBrEaKPeople in developed countries should be limited to 4 or 5 tons of CO2 annually, Socolow said. But it takes very little to reach that level. You could do it by driving an economy car 10,000 miles or flying 10,000 miles a year or heating one house.LiNeBrEaKPeople need to become carbon literate, he said, so they can do more to reduce their emissions.LiNeBrEaK I tell climate scientists that never in history has the work of so few led to so much being asked of so many,  Socolow said.LiNeBrEaKThree factors that give him hope, Socolow said, are that the world s energy systems are terribly inefficient now so they can be improved, carbon emissions have just begun to be priced, and most of the world s infrastructure that will be in place 50 years from now has yet to be built.LiNeBrEaKOne big roadblock in the United States, he said, is that most of its coal-powered power plants are old but they ve been paid for, so utilities are reluctant to replace them with modern plants that burn more efficiently or use cleaner fuels.LiNeBrEaK Just when the world is bringing on new technologies, we re there nursing our old plants,  Socolow said.LiNeBrEaKFor more information on the Princeton carbon research, go to: http://www.princeton.edu/~cmi/resources/	SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ENGINEERING (78%); ETHICS (76%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (76%); METHANE (76%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (75%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (73%); POWER PLANTS (73%); RESEARCH (73%); MOTOR VEHICLES (72%); RISK MANAGEMENT (71%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (71%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (69%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (68%) News Environment; News Rhode Island; News Education  		PRINCETON UNIVERSITY (93%); UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND (84%)  				RHODE ISLAND, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 4, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Providence Publications, LLC All Rights Reserved  									A Princeton University scientist tells a URI audience that global warming could be fought with a series of individual responses.  	plord@projo.com / (401) 277-8036

Angry environmentalists launched an online campaign yesterday urging President-elect Barack Obama to undo a federal rule that clarifies when coal companies can dump mining waste in streams, calling it a long-awaited  parting gift  from the Bush administration. North Carolina-based Appalachian Voices and others blasted Tuesday s Environmental Protection Agency decision to endorse the mining rule as the death of freshwater streams and the likely start of a new surge in mountaintop removal surface mining across Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition	Scientists study drilling off Virginia coast  	STEVE SZKOTAK  	AREA/STATE; Pg. B-10  	351 words  	 Scientists are beginning to assess what they know - and what they don't - about the environmental consequences of drilling for gas and oil in a triangular section of the Atlantic Ocean off Virginia's coast. LiNeBrEaK What they learn could open more Southern coastal waters to drilling.LiNeBrEaK The government began a two-day workshop yesterday for researchers and scientists to discuss drilling's impact on sea life and commercial and recreational fishing, along with other environmental and economic issues. The proposed drilling would occur 50 miles from shore in an area believed to contain 130 million barrels of oil and 1. 14 trillion cubic feet of gas.LiNeBrEaK "We have some of the top scientists from the East Coast here to inform us on the environmental information that's available as well as data gaps," said Jim Cimato of the Minerals Management Service, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior.LiNeBrEaK Many of the scientists said climate change is just one factor that has altered some research that dates back decades. Science on some species is also either lacking or incomplete.LiNeBrEaK Scott Krauss of the New England Aquarium in Boston offered detailed research on the impact of ship traffic on whales and sea turtles and the "rising tide of noises" in the acoustic spaces of dolphins and whales.LiNeBrEaK The Bush administration has pushed forward with the leasing of waters off Virginia's coast, and President-elect Barack Obama has said he would support a limited expansion of offshore oil and natural-gas development.LiNeBrEaK House Democratic leaders have backed that position, stating last month that they would not seek to reinstate a quarter-century ban on drilling in 85 percent of the nation's offshore federal waters.LiNeBrEaK Currently, virtually all Outer Continental Shelf drilling occurs in the Gulf of Mexico.LiNeBrEaK Cimato said any leasing wouldn't occur until late 2011 or 2012.LiNeBrEaK The offshore waters identified for possible drilling cover 2. 9 million acres over a pie-slice-shaped region that is 50 miles wide nearest the Virginia shore. The area discussed by scientists yesterday generally included a wider swath of the mid-Atlantic shore.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Need to create jobs doesn't make environmental goals disappear  	McClatchy Newspapers  	COMMENTARY  	632 words  	The following editorial appeared in the Sacramento Bee on Wed., Dec. 3LiNeBrEaKWhenever California builds freeway lanes, flood-control levees or other major construction projects, the public gets a chance to review the plans and suggest changes to minimize the environmental impact.LiNeBrEaKSuch input has paid off. It has resulted in replanted forests to compensate for trees lost when a levee is rebuilt or widened. Outside pressure has also prompted Caltrans to build stormwater basins to prevent highway runoff from damaging creeks or polluting beaches. LiNeBrEaKIn an effort to speed up projects financed by state bond money, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is now proposing to streamline these environmental reviews. Agencies such as Caltrans would have to obtain environmental permits for highway or transit projects, but opportunities for the public or regulators to shape the final product would be severely truncated.LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to understand why the governor wants to fast-track the process. President-elect Barack Obama has asked states to identify billions of dollars in public works projects that could be started in the next 120 days. Since California voters have approved more than $50 billion in infrastructure spending in recent years, the state is in a prime position to leverage federal assistance for projects that could create thousands of jobs.LiNeBrEaKIt's also easy to understand why the governor fears that unrestrained application of the California Environmental Quality Act could derail this opportunity. As this page has frequently noted, CEQA has a long history of litigious abuse by various interest groups, including unions that want to extract favorable labor terms for certain projects.LiNeBrEaKIt is also fair to say that, when combined with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, CEQA can add years to the time it takes to build even the most beneficial project, such as a transit line or sewage treatment plant.LiNeBrEaKThat said, the governor and lawmakers need to be extremely careful with plans to truncate certain environmental reviews, particularly for new highway lanes.LiNeBrEaKMany of these highway projects were on the books before the governor signed Assembly Bill 32, a state law that requires reductions in greenhouse gases. Some will likely spur sprawl out toward valuable farmlands, adding to the carbon footprint of the Central Valley.LiNeBrEaKClearly, the governor and lawmakers need to engage in a balancing act when considering stimulus proposals. Priority should go to projects that don't compromise the state's environmental goals and serve essential immediate needs, such as public safety.LiNeBrEaKTo find this balance, both sides will have to give a little bit. Democrats and environmental groups will have to drop their insistence that CEQA can't be touched or that state agencies can't contract with "design-build" firms to speed up public works. The governor and Republicans will have to concede to environmental reviews for highway widenings that might conflict with the state's climate policies.LiNeBrEaKSomewhere in the middle could be a mix of projects that could include new hospitals, revamped levees, road rehabilitation, transit lines, school buildings and infrastructure for affordable housing. To find this middle ground, lawmakers of both parties need to come out of their corners, find an immediate solution to the state's fiscal crisis and come up with a stimulus package that stimulates green public works.LiNeBrEaKVisit The Sacramento Bee online at http://www.sacbee.com/	GOVERNORS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); FLOOD CONTROL (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); FLOODS and FLOODING (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (89%); LEGISLATORS (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (87%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (87%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); REFORESTATION (78%); CONSTRUCTION SPENDING (78%); HIGHWAY FUNDING (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); HEAVY and CIVIL CONSTRUCTION (78%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (77%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (77%); EMISSIONS (77%); WATER POLLUTION (76%); INFRASTRUCTURE (74%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (74%); CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (73%); LEGISLATION (71%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (70%); JOB CREATION (70%); APPROVALS (69%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (66%); ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (89%)  					ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (57%); BARACK OBAMA (56%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 4, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Sacramento Bee   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	20081204-BC-ENV-ECONOMY-EDITORIAL  	SA  													
The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Solar car completes 1st ever round-the-world trip  	By Vanessa Gera The Associated Press  	BREAKING; News; National; World; Local  	647 words  	POZNAN, Poland &raquo; If a solar-powered car can drive 32,000 miles (52,000 kilometers) around the globe without using a drop of oil, perhaps it can be forgiven for not having a coffee cup holder.LiNeBrEaKOr maybe that makes Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer's journey even more remarkable. LiNeBrEaKPalmer rolled into the U.N. climate conference in his solar car Thursday, a man with a mission: To prove that the world can continue its love affair with the car without burning any polluting fossil fuels and still enjoy a smooth ride.LiNeBrEaKWhile some 11,000 delegates sought an ambitious new climate change deal to slash emissions of heat-trapping gases, Palmer was convinced that whatever they agreed upon won't be enough to avert environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaK"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent -- and that's what we need for the future."LiNeBrEaKPalmer, a teacher on leave from his job, spent 17 months driving his own creation -- a fully solar-powered car built with the help of Swiss scientists -- through 38 countries. The two-seater travels up to 55 mph (90 kph) and covers 185 miles (300 kilometers) on a fully charged battery.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has traveled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," he said, adding that he lost only two days to breakdowns.LiNeBrEaKTo make his point, he took an Associated Press reporter for a ride Thursday.LiNeBrEaKPalmer lifted a light plastic flap that acts as a door before climbing in. He then flipped a switch to activate the electric engine and set off as the motor hummed softly, much more quietly than a traditional car.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the aluminum and fiberglass car is still a prototype, and it feels like one. The car, designed to be light and efficient, is powered by solar cells that it hauls on a trailer. It has plastic windows, three wheels instead of four and ironically, no climate control.LiNeBrEaKDesigned like a race car, it can hold two people comfortably and has a radio. It meets all safety standards in Switzerland and has headlights, brakes, blinkers and other standard safety features. Before his world trip, Palmer, 36, used it for a year to commute to the school in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he taught.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he tried to avoid what he called "dinosaur technology," his steering wheel was from a Renault, his windshield wipers from a Fiat and his wheels were from a Smart car, the Daimler AG two-seater that is ubiquitous in many European cities.LiNeBrEaKHe has given a ride to approximately 1,000 people so far, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and on Thursday, U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer.LiNeBrEaKDelegates in Poznan are seeking a new climate treaty that would replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012 and has required that 37 countries slash emissions of heat-trapping gases by an average 5 percent from 1990 levels. The goal is for the new treaty to be finalized at the next U.N. climate meeting in December 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.LiNeBrEaKAfter a summer that saw fuel prices rise uncontrollably, many automakers -- from the U.S. to Japan -- are investing in research with the aim of producing alternatively powered cars using electricity, biofuel and even hydrogen. Environmental advocates hope these efforts will continue even as oil prices have dropped substantially.LiNeBrEaKHawaii this week unveiled plans to build a network of charging stations for electric cars and to provide recharged batteries. There are also plans to offer similar services in Australia, Denmark and Israel.LiNeBrEaKPalmer says there's no reason why car companies couldn't make a much better version of his solar-powered car if they set their mind to it.LiNeBrEaK"These new technologies are ready," he said. "It's ecological, it's economical, it is absolutely reliable. We can stop global warning."

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Water agency needs an overhaul, congressman says  	By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune  	NEWS  	404 words  	The federal government's water-management agency can no longer operate as though Colorado River water is abundant, said one of Congress' leaders on natural resources Thursday night. LiNeBrEaK"The Bureau of Reclamation has to reinvent itself," said U.S. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. and longtime leader on natural resource policy. "It has to address the future in an innovative way and not be tied so strongly to the past."LiNeBrEaKMiller made the remarks as he accepted the David R. Brower Award for Conservation by the Salt Lake City-based Glen Canyon Institute, an organization that made its name by calling for the draining of Lake Powell.LiNeBrEaKThe institute now focuses on scientific issues surrounding the vitality of the Colorado River, and much of Thursday's program was devoted to updates about how climate change might affect the 27 million people and 3. 5 million acres of farmland that rely on the 1,450-mile river.LiNeBrEaKMiller was a driving force behind legislation in the early 1990s to complete the Central Utah Project -- the water program behind construction of the Jordanelle Dam in Wasatch County -- along with the creation of a mitigation fund to address the environmental damage caused by decades of dam-building in Utah.LiNeBrEaKHe also pushed for moderating flows through the Glen Canyon Dam to lessen the harm high-energy water releases were causing to Grand Canyon National ParkLiNeBrEaKThe northern California lawmaker served from 1991 to 1994 as the chairman of the House committee that oversees the nation's mining programs, water, national parks and other natural resources.LiNeBrEaKMiller attacked the departing Bush administration for what he described as a culture of corruption in the Interior Department. Science, he added, was "tampered with" and "pushed aside."LiNeBrEaK"You don't get to change the conclusions for political reasons," he said. Instead, with a change in administration in Washington, science should be harnessed to help make smarter decisions about preserving already-taxed water supplies.LiNeBrEaKScientists who spoke at the conference talked about Western water resources that are dwindling in the face of growing populations and are threatened by global warming.LiNeBrEaKTim Barnett, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, told the conference that no models of Colorado River water -- even without climate change factored in -- predict an increased flow.LiNeBrEaK"You have a river that's on the brink of failure," he said.LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.com	US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (92%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); RIVERS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); DAMS and RESERVOIRS (90%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (90%); NATIONAL PARKS (89%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (88%); LAKES (78%); LEGISLATORS (78%); WATER and WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT (77%); SCIENCE NEWS (74%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); DAM and HYDROELECTRIC CONSTRUCTION (71%); OCEANOGRAPHY (70%); WATER QUALITY (60%); POPULATION GROWTH (60%)  		BUREAU OF RECLAMATION (84%)  			GEORGE MILLER (US REPRESENTATIVE) (58%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%); SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  																
THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 04, 2008 Thursday 	REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE RELEASED  		NEWS; Pg. B1  	114 words  	A task force created by Gov. Chris Gregoire has released final recommendations on how to curb climate change in Washington. The report by the Climate Action Team calls for more energy-efficient buildings, compact urban development, better collection of recycled materials, using tolls to reduce driving and revising development rules to account for greenhouse gas emissions. The team has been working since last year to find ways to help the state reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and even further by 2050. The report outlines two dozen recommendations, but doesn't say how state agencies are to carry them out. A plan dealing with specifics is expected in two weeks.

A2  	601 words  	The U.S. government released the first part of a $400 million aid package Wednesday to support Mexico's police and soldiers in their fight against drug cartels. The effort also is aimed at weeding out corrupt police. The money comes at a critical time: Mexico's death toll from drug violence has soared above 4,000 so far this year, and drug-related murders and kidnappings are spilling over the U.S. border as well.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Ambassador Tony Garza formally released $197 million at a signing ceremony in Mexico City, calling it "the most significant effort ever undertaken" by the U.S. and Mexico to fight drugs. The rest will be disbursed throughout the year. LiNeBrEaKPANAMALiNeBrEaKRUSSIAN WARSHIP DOCKING AT FORMER U.S. NAVAL BASELiNeBrEaKRussia said Wednesday it is sending a warship through the Panama Canal for the first time since World War II, a journey loaded with symbolic weight: The ship will dock at a former U.S. naval base, showcasing Russia's growing influence in the region. Russia appears to be relishing the idea of stopping at what was long a symbol of U.S. power. The Russian Navy announced it would visit "the Rodman naval base" - a name that the host nation, Panama has not used since taking over the base from the United States in 1999.LiNeBrEaKThe destroyer Admiral Chabanenko is scheduled to enter the Panama Canal on Friday morning and arrive late in the day at what Panama calls the Balboa Naval Base.LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON, D.C.LiNeBrEaKGREENHOUSE GASES ON THE RISE AGAIN AFTER DECREASELiNeBrEaKThe amount of U.S. greenhouse gases flowing into the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, increased last year by 1. 4 percent after a decline in 2006, the Energy Department reported Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKThe report said carbon dioxide, the leading pollution linked to global warming, rose by 1. 3 percent in 2007 as people used more coal, oil and natural gas because of a colder winter and more electricity during a warmer summer. Half of the country's electricity is generated by coal-burning power plants. A shortage of hydropower also contributed to an increase in the demand for fossil fuels, said the department's Energy Information Administration.LiNeBrEaK\ INDIANALiNeBrEaKSOLDIERS SUE CONTRACTOR FOR TOXIC CHEMICAL EXPOSURELiNeBrEaKSixteen Indiana National Guard soldiers sued the big defense contractor KBR Inc. on Wednesday, saying its employees knowingly allowed them to be exposed to a toxic chemical in Iraq five years ago. The federal suit filed in U.S. District Court alleges the soldiers from a Tell City-based unit were exposed to a carcinogen while protecting an Iraqi water pumping plant shortly after the U.S. invasion in 2003.LiNeBrEaKThe 23-page complaint claims that Houston-based KBR knew at least as early as May 2003 that the plant was contaminated with sodium dichromate, a known carcinogen, but concealed the danger from civilian workers and 139 soldiers from the Indiana Guard's 1st Battalion, 152nd Infantry.LiNeBrEaKNEW YORKLiNeBrEaKNEW ANGLICAN BRANCH CATERS TO CONSERVATIVESLiNeBrEaKTheological conservatives upset by liberal views of U.S. Episcopalians and Canadian Anglicans formed a rival North American branch Wednesday, in a long-developing rift over the Bible that erupted when Episcopalians consecrated the first openly gay bishop.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement in New York City represents a new challenge to the already splintering world Anglican fellowship and the authority of its spiritual leader, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. The new Anglican Church in North America includes four breakaway Episcopal dioceses, dozens of individual parishes in the U.S. and Canada, and splinter groups that left the Anglican family years, or in one case, more than a century, ago.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	'The Best American Poetry 2008'  	By Allie Klionsky, South Florida Sun-Sentinel  	LIFESTYLE  	772 words  	I would compare naming a book "The Best American Poetry 2008" to naming a restaurant Buster's Gourmet Road Stop _ a sure bet that the book isn't great and the eatery isn't gourmet.LiNeBrEaKBut The Chicago Tribune wrote of "The Best American Poetry 2008" that it is "a 'best' anthology that really lives up to its title." I'm inclined to agree. Plus, who am I to argue with The Chicago Tribune? It is important to note that all the poems in the anthology are chosen by the yearly guest editor. This year it is poet Charles Wright, author of "Scar Tissue" (2008). LiNeBrEaKIf the selected poetry reflects America's consciousness in 2008, then I predict good things to come. Reacting to a variety of large scale contemporary issues like the war in Iraq, the genocide in Darfur, global warming and the recession, most of the poets honored by Wright are not, as he writes in the book's introduction, "anxious to excise emotion and its intensity out of their poems," a trend seen in recent literary history. While all the poets represented in this anthology delight in the art of language itself, some more than others, none favor form over function. Perhaps this evidences less a trend in contemporary poetry than Wright's own preference; also in the book's introduction, he writes that "like(s) things to make sense nowadays."LiNeBrEaKTo be honest, there are poems in this book that I simply do not understand. And I count on it taking me awhile to finally do so _ perhaps years, if ever. But of the ones I do understand, and especially understand as an optimistic 17-year-old, personal favorites include Tom Andrews' "Evening Song," Brenda Hillman's "Phone Booth," Mark Jarman's "Snoring," Mary Karr's "Recuperation from the Dead Love through Christ and Isaac Babel," W.S. Merwin's "A Letter to Su Tung Po," Paul Muldoon's "The Water Cooler," Adrie Kusserow's "Skull Trees, South Sudan," Susan Mitchell's "Ritual" and Patti Smith's "Tara."LiNeBrEaKMy favorite poems, the best ones on my list, are usually those that give meaning to my life. In Hillman's "Phone Booth," a phone booth serves as a symbolic victim of a society devolving in the hands of too much technological innovation. Hillman starts, "There should be more nouns/ For objects put to sleep/ Against their will." In his poem "Snoring," Jarman writes of the "unlovable" and the "loveless": "When they die, either they find the arousal, the constant arousal of love,/ Glaring them in the face, shaking them with its welcome, and do not understand./ Or they find another welcoming, the rich dark of slumber, which passes all understanding." I both cases, I wish I'd thought of such verse myself!LiNeBrEaKI recommend the book for all aspiring poets, people who think real verse died with Shakespeare, and people who know real verse didn't die with Shakespeare. For young readers like me who wouldn't recognize nods to icons of ages past, each poet, along with his/her bio, wrote a brief explanation to accompany his/her poem. Do not be discouraged, though, if after reading these supplemental paragraphs, you still find yourself lost. That's what Google is for _ and it seems as if contemporary poets capitalize on our generation's Internet dependency. Writing for a readership that can use Google to demystify itself to the obscurest of references has only encouraged writers to use them. This seems to be the most widely voiced complaint about contemporary poetry _ that poets tend to drive their readers away by employing too much of their own specialized knowledge. But, as I said, 2008 just got a lot more heart. The result: pretentiousness turned down a notch.LiNeBrEaKAllie Klionsky attends Atlantic High School in Delray Beach, Fla., and is a writer for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel's TeenLink.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Sun-Sentinel on the World Wide Web at http://www.sun-sentinel.com/LiNeBrEaKTO SUBSCRIBE TO KIDS and TEENS ELEMENTSLiNeBrEaKItems in the KIDS and TEENS ELEMENTS package are not included in your MCT News Service subscription.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Seven who protested construction of FPL plant in February convicted  	Jerome Burdi, Sun Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	366 words  	Dec. 4--A jury today convicted seven defendants of misdemeanor charges of unlawful assembly, trespassing and resisting arrest without violence. The defendants in February illegally protested the Everglades construction of a Florida Power and Light Co. power plant. LiNeBrEaKConvicted were Peter Tsolkas, Lynne Purvis, Marc Silverstein, Russell McSpadden, Richard Halsted, Brandon Block and Noah Wilson. They are members of the activist groups Everglades Earth First! and the Palm Beach County Environmental Coalition. Their attorneys, Assistant Public Defenders Erich Taylor and Charles Fountain II, argued that the group, who were among about 100 others, acted out of necessity to save their environment.LiNeBrEaKExpert witnesses testified that that plant would use the water equivalent to 50,000 homes and pollute the habitat of the wetland area, therefore feeding the global warming crisis.LiNeBrEaKProsecutors Danielle Croke and Laura Burkhart argued that environmental issues were not on trial, but whether the means the group used to make their statement was illegal.LiNeBrEaKOn Feb. 18, protesters, fearful the plant will harm the region and its wildlife preserves, held signs, banged on drums and chanted outside the gate of Palm Beach Aggregates, which sold property to FPL for the plant north of Southern Boulevard near 20-Mile Bend.LiNeBrEaKThe protest blocked truck access into the mining company and drew more than 100 Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office deputies and fire and rescue officers who closed a section of Southern Boulevard during the protest.LiNeBrEaKThe Sheriff's Office lost about $100,000. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw asked the State Attorney's Office not to make plea deals with those arrested and to take them to court with a demand that restitution be part of their sentences. They will be sentenced Feb. 2.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Human noise may disorient whales  	The Associated Press  	NEWS; Pg. A4  	297 words  	ROME - The songs that whales and dolphins use to communicate, orient themselves and find mates are being drowned out by human-made noises in the world's oceans, U.N. officials and environmental groups said Wednesday. LiNeBrEaKThat sound pollution - everything from increasing commercial shipping and seismic surveys to a new generation of military sonar - is not only confounding the mammals, it also is further threatening the survival of these endangered animals.LiNeBrEaKStudies show that these cetaceans, which once communicated over thousands of miles to forage and mate, are losing touch with one another, experts said on the sidelines of a U.N. wildlife conference in Rome.LiNeBrEaK"Call it a cocktail-party effect," said Mark Simmonds, director of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, a private British-based group. "You have to speak louder and louder until no one can hear each other anymore."LiNeBrEaKAn indirect source of noise pollution may also be coming from climate change, which is altering the chemistry of the oceans and making sound travel farther through sea water, the experts said.LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of more than 100 governments are gathered in Rome for a meeting of the U.N.-backed Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups are increasingly finding cases of beached whales and dolphins that can be linked to sound pollution, Simmonds said.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Experts say sea mammals drowning in humans' noise  	ARIEL DAVID, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. 049  	695 words  	The songs that whales and dolphins use to communicate, orient themselves and find mates are being drowned out by human-made noises in the world's oceans, U.N. officials and environmental groups said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKThat sound pollution - everything from increasing commercial shipping and seismic surveys to a new generation of military sonar - is not only confounding the mammals, it also is further threatening the survival of these endangered animals.LiNeBrEaKStudies show that these cetaceans, which once communicated over thousands of miles to forage and mate, are losing touch with each other, experts said on the sidelines of a U.N. wildlife conference in Rome. LiNeBrEaK"Call it a cocktail-party effect," said Mark Simmonds, director of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, a Britain-based NGO. "You have to speak louder and louder until no one can hear each other anymore."LiNeBrEaKAn indirect source of noise pollution may also be coming from climate change, which is altering the chemistry of the oceans and making sound travel farther through sea water, the experts said.LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of more than 100 governments are gathered in Rome for a meeting of the U.N.-backed Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.LiNeBrEaKThe agenda of the conference, which ends tomorrow, includes ways to increase protection for endangered species, including measures to mitigate underwater noise.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups also are increasingly finding cases of beached whales and dolphins that can be linked to sound pollution, Simmonds said.LiNeBrEaKMarine mammals are turning up on the world's beaches with tissue damage similar to that found in divers suffering from decompression sickness. The condition, known as the bends, causes gas bubbles to form in the bloodstream upon surfacing too quickly.LiNeBrEaKScientists say the use of military sonar or seismic testing may have scared the animals into diving and surfacing beyond their physical limits, Simmonds said.LiNeBrEaKSeveral species of cetaceans are already listed as endangered or critically endangered from other causes, including hunting, chemical pollution, collisions with boats and entanglements with fishing equipment. Though it is not yet known precisely how many animals are affected, sound pollution is increasingly being recognized as a serious factor, the experts said.LiNeBrEaKAs an example, Simmonds offered two incidents this year which, though still under study, could be linked to noise pollution: the beaching of more than 100 melon-headed whales in Madagascar and that of two dozen common dolphins on the southern British coast.LiNeBrEaKThe sound of a seismic test, used to locate hydrocarbons beneath the seabed, can spread 1,800 miles underwater, said Veronica Frank, an official with the International Fund for Animal Welfare.LiNeBrEaKA study by her group found that the blue whale, which used to communicate across entire oceans, has lost 90 percent of its range over the last 40 years.LiNeBrEaKDespite being the largest mammal ever to inhabit Earth, the endangered blue whale still holds mysteries for scientists.LiNeBrEaK"We don't even know where their breeding grounds are," Simmonds said. "But what's most important is that they need to know where they are."LiNeBrEaKOther research suggests that rising levels of carbon dioxide are increasing the acidity of the Earth's oceans, making sound travel farther through sea water.LiNeBrEaKThe study by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in the United States shows the changes may mean some sound frequencies are traveling 10 percent farther than a few centuries ago. That could increase to 70 percent by 2050 if greenhouse gases are not cut.LiNeBrEaK"This is a new, strange and unwanted development," Simmonds said. "It shows how the degradation of the environment is all linked."LiNeBrEaKHowever, governments seem ready to take action, said Nick Nutall, a spokesman for the U.N. Environment Program, which administers the convention being discussed in Rome. The conference is discussing a resolution that would oblige countries to reduce sound pollution, he said.LiNeBrEaKMeasures suggested include rerouting shipping and installing quieter engines as well as cutting speed and banning tests and sonar use in areas known to be inhabited by the endangered animals.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   2 Tampa Edition	TAMPA ELECTRIC DEAL GOES TO VOTE  	JANET ZINK, Times Staff Writer  	TAMPA BAY; Pg. 3B  	461 words  	The City Council today is scheduled for a final vote on a 25-year contract with Tampa Electric Co., one of the most divisive issues to come before it in recent memory. LiNeBrEaKThe agreement determines how much the utility pays to use city rights of way for power lines. Opponents say itshould include more commitments to such issues as conservation and burying power lines.LiNeBrEaKAt a news conference Wednesday near City Hall, Don Mellman, with the Physicians for Social Responsibility, said the utility should curb its reliance on coal because the resulting pollution causes health problems such as asthma and lung damage.LiNeBrEaK"The citizens of Tampa Bay are at a severe risk," he said.LiNeBrEaKWarren Clark, pastor at First United Church of Tampa, said he wants to see Tampa Electric do more to protect the environment. "We want to pass forward to Florida's children a livable creation where we have turned the corner on global warming," he said.LiNeBrEaKCity Council member Linda Saul-Sena, the most vocal opponent of the agreement, hosted Wednesday's news conference. She said the council should postpone approving the agreement for six months to try to gain concessions from Tampa Electric.LiNeBrEaKThe utility and Mayor Pam Iorio have argued that conservation issues are the purview of the state and can't be included in the franchise agreement.LiNeBrEaKThe City Council approved the contract last month, but a week later rejected it when council member Joseph Caetano changed his vote, saying the city had already spent too much time and money negotiating the deal.LiNeBrEaKThat prompted harsh exchanges between Caetano and council member Charlie Miranda and John Dingfelder and Mary Mulhern, who oppose it.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Miranda walked out of a Hillsborough County Democratic Party meeting when Saul-Sena urged opposition to the agreement.LiNeBrEaKThe League of Women Voters is circulating a letter lodging its complaints. Among other things, the League worries that the contract contains "no provision for a city buyout, full or partial," wrote president Linda D'Aquila.LiNeBrEaKTampa Electric spokesman Rick Morera said the contract is fair and the utility has pledged to take part in a task force proposed by Iorio to work on conservation issues after the council approves the deal. "Some of the issues like renewable energy and energy efficiency are issues that we care greatly about," he said.LiNeBrEaKRight now about 3 percent of electricity provided by Tampa Electric comes from renewable sources, he said. But about a year ago the utility invited proposals on more renewable projects.LiNeBrEaK"We're not ready at this point to discuss the specifics," he said. "But we certainly have been looking at all our options."LiNeBrEaKHe said the utility also has submitted a plan to state regulators for a wind turbine facility.LiNeBrEaKThe council vote is scheduled at 1: 30 p.m. today.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	A greener world for $25 a slice: Adirondack Council sale ensures pollution credits won't be used by industry  	Brian Nearing, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	517 words  	Dec. 4--A congresswoman from the Capital Region became the first individual in the country to help lock away pollution rights under a multistate program to fight global warming. LiNeBrEaKRep. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-Greenport, was the first customer of a program created by the Adirondack Council to retire carbon dioxide pollution allowances under the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.LiNeBrEaKThe Adirondack Council bought 1,000 tons of RGGI allowances in the inaugural September auction for the program, which seeks to limit CO2 emission from power plants from Maine to New Jersey. The council is offering to retire three tons of allowances in individuals' names in return for $25 donations.LiNeBrEaKBy retiring an allowance, it will never be available for later use by a power plant to cover emissions, meaning that CO2 will never reach the atmosphere. A growing international scientific consensus blames the known greenhouse gas for global climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe council is offering three-ton blocks to help average people get involved without having to spend $3,000 or more necessary to buy the minimum 1,000-allowance lots offered at RGGI auctions.LiNeBrEaK"Not many people have that kind of money for a holiday gift," said Brian L. Houseal, executive director of the Adirondack Council, a privately funded, not-for-profit organization dedicated to ensuring the wild character and ecological integrity of New York's 9,300-square-mile Adirondack Park. "We wanted to create a program where people could pay a modest amount of money, yet still make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions."LiNeBrEaKThree tons of CO2 is equivalent to slightly less than a half year's worth of an average driver's gasoline use, or two round-trip airline flights from New York to Rome.LiNeBrEaKGillibrand also purchased credits for each of her sons as holiday gifts.LiNeBrEaKCertificates for retired allowances are offered through the council's Web site at http://www.adirondackcouncil.org under the Cool Park/Healthy Planet Program or by calling 877-873-2240.LiNeBrEaKMoney raised is tax deductible and will allow the council to buy more CO2 allowances at future RGGI auctions, said Houseal, and support research, advocacy and education efforts.LiNeBrEaKUnder RGGI, the nation's first "cap and trade" CO2 program, New York and nine other states set a cap on total emissions from electrical power plants beginning in 2009 and each year will auction allowances on those emissions to the highest bidders. New York is set to join RGGI's second auction Dec. 17.LiNeBrEaKPlants that emit low levels of CO2 would need fewer allowances, while less-efficient operations would need more allowances. Allowances can be sold and traded like any other commodity among interested buyers.

Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Virginia)  	December 4, 2008 Thursday 	Kaine favors stronger efforts to address climate change  	Scott Harper, The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	479 words  	Dec. 4--RICHMOND -- Gov. Timothy M. Kaine on Thursday told his Commission on Climate Change that he welcomes its recommendation to seek greater cuts in greenhouse gases than what he originally proposed as part of Virginia's plan to combat global warming. LiNeBrEaKSpeaking to the 30-member commission as it debated the details of its final report, Kaine said he intends to carry out as many of the panel's recommendations "as we reasonably can." He did not offer a specific agenda but said he intends to adopt new measures to fight global warming through the state budget process, through legislation next year and via executive orders.LiNeBrEaKKaine, a Democrat entering his final year in office, said 2009 will see a focus on energy and environmental issues through an initiative he termed "Renew Virginia."LiNeBrEaKDespite a $2. 5 billion budget deficit, the governor said he intends to add funds for environmental programs in the coming year, and he expressed hope that the incoming Obama administration will provide financial aid for infrastructure projects in Virginia such as new rail lines and public transit. In addition to creating jobs and minimizing traffic, he said, the projects would reduce air pollution that contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Commission on Climate Change is recommending that Virginia cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. When he formed the panel last year, Kaine asked members to find ways to reduce those emissions by 30 percent by 2025.LiNeBrEaK"Going further makes a lot of sense," Kaine said Thursday. He cautioned, though, against setting goals out to 2050 without any benchmarks in between, saying pressure is needed in the interim years to keep political momentum going.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups praised the commission's tougher overall recommendation, but took umbrage that it did not endorse mandatory requirements that utilities produce electricity with a certain percentage of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal. Instead, the commission is suggesting the state offer incentives for utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewables by 2025. It is a voluntary goal.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately, in the absence of a mandatory standard for renewable energy production, it will remain difficult for Virginia to reach the greenhouse gas emission reductions the commission recognizes are needed," said J.R. Tolbert, field organizer for Environment Virginia, an advocacy group.

LiNeBrEaKStudies show that these cetaceans, which once communicated over thousands of miles to forage and mate, are losing touch with each other, the experts said on the sidelines of a U.N. wildlife conference in Rome.LiNeBrEaK"Call it a cocktail-party effect," said Mark Simmonds, director of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, a Britain-based nongovernmental organization . "You have to speak louder and louder until no one can hear each other anymore."LiNeBrEaKAn indirect source of noise pollution may also be coming from climate change, which is altering the chemistry of the oceans and making sound travel farther through seawater, the experts said.LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of more than 100 governments are gathered in Rome for a meeting of the U.N.-backed Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.LiNeBrEaKThe agenda of the conference, which ends Friday, includes ways to increase protection for endangered species, including measures to mitigate underwater noise.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups also are increasingly finding cases of beached whales and dolphins that can be linked to sound pollution, Simmonds said.LiNeBrEaKMarine mammals are turning up on the world's beaches with tissue damage similar to that found in divers suffering from decompression sickness. The condition, known as the bends, causes gas bubbles to form in the bloodstream upon surfacing too quickly.LiNeBrEaKScientists say the use of military sonar or seismic testing may have scared the animals into diving and surfacing beyond their physical limits, Simmonds said.LiNeBrEaKSeveral species of cetaceans are already listed as endangered or critically endangered from other causes, including hunting, chemical pollution, collisions with boats and entanglements with fishing equipment. Though it is not known precisely how many animals are affected, sound pollution is increasingly being recognized as a serious factor, the experts said.LiNeBrEaKAs an example, Simmonds offered two incidents this year that , though still under study, could be linked to noise pollution: the beaching of more than 100 melon-headed whales in Madagascar and that of two dozen common dolphins on the southern British coast.LiNeBrEaKThe sound of a seismic test, used to locate hydrocarbons beneath the seabed, can spread 1,800 miles under water, said Veronica Frank, an official with the International Fund for Animal Welfare.LiNeBrEaKA study by her group found that the endangered blue whale, which used to communicate across entire oceans, has lost 90 percent of its range over the past 40 years.LiNeBrEaKDespite being the largest mammal ever to inhabit Earth, the blue whale still holds mysteries for scientists.LiNeBrEaK"We don't even know where their breeding grounds are," Simmonds said. "But what's most important is that they need to know where they are."LiNeBrEaKOther research suggests that rising levels of carbon dioxide are increasing the acidity of the Earth's oceans, making sound travel farther through seawater.LiNeBrEaKThe study by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in the United States shows the changes may mean some sound frequencies are traveling 10 percent farther than a few centuries ago. That could increase to 70 percent by 2050 if greenhouse gases are not cut.LiNeBrEaK"This is a new, strange and unwanted development," Simmonds said. "It shows how the degradation of the environment is all linked."LiNeBrEaKHowever, governments seem ready to take action, said Nick Nutall, a spokesman for the U.N. Environment Program, which administers the convention in Rome. The conference is discussing a resolution that would oblige countries to reduce sound pollution, he said.LiNeBrEaKMeasures suggested include rerouting shipping and installing quieter engines as well as cutting speed and banning tests and sonar use in areas known to be inhabited by the endangered animals.LiNeBrEaKNavy sonarLiNeBrEaKLast month, the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a defeat to environmentalists and cleared the way for the Navy to use high-powered sonar off the Southern California coast even if it poses a threat to whales and other marine mammals.LiNeBrEaKChief Justice John Roberts said the Navy needs to train its crews to detect enemy submarines and cannot be forced to turn off its sonar when whales are spotted nearby.

The Washington Post 	December 4, 2008 Thursday   Regional Edition	Obama Roots for College Football Playoff  	Fred Bowen  	STYLE; Pg. C14  	453 words  	President-elect Barack Obama will have lots of important issues, such as the economy, two wars and global warming, facing him when he becomes the 44th president of the United States next month. LiNeBrEaKBut Obama has made up his mind on one important sports issue: He wants a college football playoff. The president-elect said during a recent interview, "I think any sensible person would say that . . .  we should be creating a playoff system. Eight teams, that would be three rounds to determine a national champion. . . . You could trim back on the regular season. I don't know any serious fan of college football who has disagreed with me on this. . . . I think it's the right thing to do."LiNeBrEaKI agree with our future president. I think a college football playoff would be great.LiNeBrEaKUnder the current system, the national college football champion is decided by the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Teams are evaluated by a complicated computer formula, and the two top-ranked teams play in the national championship game.LiNeBrEaKThe latest BCS ratings have Alabama (12 wins, 0 losses) and Oklahoma (11-1) in the top two spots. But wait a minute: Texas (11-1) beat Oklahoma 45-35 when the teams played in October. Why aren't the Longhorns ranked ahead of the Sooners? And how about Utah (12-0), Florida (11-1) or Penn State (11-1)? They have had terrific seasons, too.LiNeBrEaKThe only fair way to find out which team is the best, as our president-elect has said, is to have a playoff among the top eight teams. After all, almost every college sport decides its national champion on the field of play.LiNeBrEaKBut I also hope that college football fans noticed everything our next president said. Obama said college teams could "trim back on the regular season." In other words, if college football teams and fans want a playoff system, they should give up at least one or two games during the regular season.LiNeBrEaKThat makes sense. Most big-time college football teams play 12 games during the season plus a league championship. If they added three games for an eight-team playoff, some teams would play 16 games. That's a pro schedule! College players are supposed to be student-athletes.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Obama's suggestion to shorten the regular season also makes sense because that is how people work out problems, whether the problems are big or small. You may have to give up something you already have  in order to get something you want even more.LiNeBrEaKKids know this. For example, sometimes kids have to prove they can do household chores before they get a pet.LiNeBrEaKIf President--elect Obama can solve the BCS mess, maybe he is ready to tackle the country's biggest problems.LiNeBrEaKFred Bowen writes KidsPost's sports opinion column and is an author of sports novels for kids.

Americus Times Recorder (Georgia)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Local Youth Compete in FIRST Lego League Science and Technology Tournament  	Americus Times Recorder, Ga.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	644 words  	Dec. 3----  -- In a climate where technology changes the world around us almost faster than we can keep up with, the challenge lies with our youth to understand and master technology to make their global community a healthier, safer and more sustainable one. Five young people in Sumter County have accepted that challenge and are preparing to present their work in competition in Atlanta on Saturday, December 6th.LiNeBrEaKFive home schooled students, aged 11-15, have been working since August as a FIRST Lego League team. This team is part of an international league of students who work with robots and LEGOS to address real-world engineering challenges, discover career possibilities and make meaningful contributions to their communities. The participants design, build and program robots which are then used to complete "missions" representing challenges facing today's scientists. The teams research an issue related to the League's theme (this year's theme is Climate), identify how the issue impacts their community, and create solutions using detailed research. The culmination of the team's work is a tournament in which they compete against other teams to demonstrate their robot's abilities, present their research project, and demonstrate their teamwork skills. LiNeBrEaKSumter County students Ben Thornburgh, Adrian Navarro, Sol Pomeroy, and Levi and Luke Lyman Barner have identified carbon emissions as a problem directly related to climate change and the consequences that brings. They have chosen to research the topic of carbon footprints (the measurement of an activity in terms of the carbon dioxide it produces), specifically the footprint of Koinonia Farm, and to make recommendations toward the goal of reducing the Farm's carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaKEnergy audits were conducted by the students on twenty-two buildings on Koinonia's campus. This involved determining the material used to build and insulate the buildings, evaluating energy use in each building (electricity, propane and other fuels), and looking for ways to increase the energy efficiency of the structures. Students then surveyed the residents of the Farm to determine a secondary carbon footprint -- a measurement of carbon dioxide produced indirectly by a person's activities -- such as food choices (vegetarian vs. omnivore, in-season food vs. imported, etc.) clothing and furniture purchases, recycling habits, and vehicle use.LiNeBrEaKThe research then moved to experts. The team traveled to Atlanta for a conference on climate. Georgia Tech professors presented three forums on data collection, the effect of weather on the climate, and research methods. Team members also researched the internet and interviewed local experts for more information before they made their conclusions and presented them to the Koinonia community in a meeting on November 25th.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of how the team competes at the tournament on Saturday, they have shown tremendous skill and interest in their project and their community. Their recommendations to Koinonia Farm will help reduce the impact the Farm's activities have on climate change and, if applied more broadly, could have an impact on the quality of life for future generations. Sumter County should be proud!LiNeBrEaKIf you are interested in participating in FIRST's Lego League like thousands of other middle- and high school youth and their mentors and coaches, contact Cori Lyman Barner at cori.llb@gmail.com for more information.

Arab News (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Kingdom, US forge science and technology cooperation  	Mohammed Rasooldeen, Arab News, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	464 words  	Dec. 3--RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia and the United States yesterday signed an agreement for cooperation in science and technology. Claudia McMurray, assistant secretary of state for oceans, environment and science, inked the agreement with Prince Turki bin Saud, vice president of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST). Speaking after the ceremony, Prince Turki said it was a historic agreement that would take the Kingdom to greater heights in the field of science and technology. Although the duration of the agreement has been limited to 10 years, it could be extended. LiNeBrEaKPrince Turki said the two parties formed a joint committee, which will meet in March to work out details of the program. "The joint committee will initially focus on research and industrial development in the private sector. We will also attract industrial investments in the process," he said.LiNeBrEaKMcMurray said the agreement formalizes a decades-long, low-key relationship between the two countries involving numerous US technical agencies, academic institutions and private business.LiNeBrEaKShe added that the agreement would permit greater agency-to-agency cooperation in a range of scientific and technological fields.LiNeBrEaK"It will enable enhanced cooperation between Saudi Arabia and the United States in priority areas, including science and technology entrepreneurship, materials sciences, water purification, education methods, plant genomics, and other advancements in agriculture, health and biotechnology," said McMurray.LiNeBrEaKThe agreement will also facilitate mutual efforts to develop national and regional capacities in monitoring and protecting the marine environment, studying and identifying ways to mitigate negative aspects of climate change and learning how to better conserve energy resources.LiNeBrEaKMcMurray said the success of Saudi Arabia's leadership in advancing science and technology activities in the country and region is evident in the Kingdom's significant decision to implement a five-year, $30-billion program to upgrade its science and technology infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKMcMurray said the agreement will benefit the US by giving its scientists greater access to new research opportunities, US academic institutions the chance to form new partnerships with centers of learning in the Middle East, and the US science and technology business community new ways to be more globally competitive.

The Boston Globe 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	Two national security advisers talk about the future  	Rich Barlow  	LIVINGARTS; Pg. G10  	576 words  	Book ReviewLiNeBrEaKAMERICA AND THE WORLD:LiNeBrEaKConversations on the Future of American Foreign PolicyLiNeBrEaKBy Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent ScowcroftLiNeBrEaKBasic, 291 pp., $27. 50LiNeBrEaKDuring the Cold War, American defense planners war-gamed a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. As described by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, we'd know the targets and scale of coming destruction two minutes after the Soviets launched. At three minutes, we'd know when the missiles would hit. Between three and seven minutes, the president would have to decide how to respond. Four minutes to decide how much to shoot back, and at what.LiNeBrEaK"Six hours later, one hundred fifty million Americans and Soviets are dead," says Brzezinksi in "America and the World."  LiNeBrEaKBrzezinksi and Brent Scowcroft, his counterpart in President George H.W. Bush's and President Ford's administrations, chat about the world facing our next president in this conversation-between-covers. (The book is made up of transcripts of discussions between the two men, moderated by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.)LiNeBrEaKAs foreign-policy realists, their main concern is America's national interest, tempered by values. Both conservatives and liberals will find their blood pressure spiking at times. That means there is wisdom here. LiNeBrEaKBrzezinski and Scowcroft agree that the United States must do more to combat world poverty and global warming, though these are sentiments rather than plans addressing the knotty economic and political details. They agree that Israeli-Palestinian peace is the Mideast priority, especially to slow the conveyor belt of angry recruits into terrorism. With fears that Iran is enriching uranium to go nuclear, Scowcroft suggests we call the Iranians on their claim that they want only energy, not weapons, by offering to sell them enriched uranium, with a deal to remove it once it's spent. Brzezinski says international law allows Iran to enrich; to stop them, we should offer to lift current economic sanctions.LiNeBrEaKBoth men opposed the Iraq war, but Brzezinski would remove American troops sooner, though he's open to leaving behind a residual force to guard against the nation becoming a terrorist haven a la Afghanistan before 9/11. Scowcroft thinks such a residual force would smack of a permanent American presence and should be avoided. On that point, Brzezinski's more persuasive.LiNeBrEaKThe other dispute is over expanding NATO to Russia's borders, welcoming former Soviet satellites Ukraine and Georgia. Brzezinski argues that caving to Russian demands against expansion would only be "reinforcing their imperial nostalgia." It's an emotionally appealing argument, but given that Vladimir Putin has nukes, that we'd be outraged by a similar encroachment on our border, and that there are less provocative ways to bind the satellites to the West (Scowcroft suggests their joining the European Union, unlike NATO a nonmilitary alliance), Scowcroft makes the better case.LiNeBrEaKIgnatius should have probed more on some questions rather than padding his prose with repetition and fawning. ("You each famously had the courage and foresight to speak out before the Iraq war and warn that it was a mistake" is an early example, and not the last.) Still, had Sarah Palin read this handy primer before the election, she might have had more to talk about than the view of Russia. The rest of America should read it now to understand what lies before us.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   Home Final Edition	PARTISAN POLITICS ON THE CLOCK?;  Republican asking for city e-mail on Obama;  Public-records request denied as 'too broad,' not about city business	Martin Rozenman, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	NEWS; Pg. 01B  	446 words  	Mike Elicson wanted to know if Columbus City Hall staff members spent their time campaigning for Barack Obama after state officials were reprimanded for using public e-mail accounts to solicit support for the Democratic presidential candidate. LiNeBrEaKSo Elicson made a public-records request for all city e-mail that included the word "Obama."LiNeBrEaKCity attorneys denied his request, saying that because e-mails about Obama are not related to city government, they are not public documents. State law says public records "serve to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or other activities of the office."LiNeBrEaKGovernments in Ohio have been using that definition since the late 1990s to block access to records that could show that employees are misusing public equipment and time, said David Marburger, a Cleveland lawyer who specializes in open records.LiNeBrEaK"I call it the stealth exemption," he said. "It's stealth because people don't realize the definition of record is being used to block access to government-stored records."LiNeBrEaKEven without that tactic, Elicson's expansive request isn't supported by past rulings of the Ohio Supreme Court, said Marburger, who cited a Sandusky records request that a judge ruled was too broad.LiNeBrEaKElicson, a freelance commercial photographer, has run for state representative as a Republican and also operates the Winnery, which provides marketing material to political candidates.LiNeBrEaK"I think the whole thing with the 'Joe the Plumber' scenario prompted my interest in making a public-records request," Elicson said. "I was interested to see what sort of information is out there."LiNeBrEaKThe public has the right to know if its public servants are misusing time and equipment in pursuit of partisan politics, said Dan Williamson, spokesman for Mayor Michael B. Coleman. But he said he knows of no e-mails that would fit Elicson's request.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, Williamson said, the mayor's chief of staff stressed to staff members that they should not send partisan e-mails or campaign on city time.LiNeBrEaKThe warning came after a police spokesman complained that Coleman's urban ventures coordinator, Mike Brown, sent a mass e-mail to city employees that included a Washington Post article about Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's views on global warming.LiNeBrEaKAfter Elicson's original request was denied, Williamson said, a staff member called him and asked him to reword it.LiNeBrEaKElicson remains suspicious and yesterday afternoon narrowed his request to e-mails from Coleman and nine other city officials.LiNeBrEaK"If they say they have nothing to hide, it makes me suspicious that they're trying to withhold public records," he said.LiNeBrEaKmrozenman@dispatch.com	US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); ELECTRONIC MAIL (90%); POLITICS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (90%); CITIES (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (90%); MAYORS (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); EMAIL MARKETING (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); POLICE FORCES (78%); LITIGATION (77%); LAWYERS (76%); SETTLEMENTS and DECISIONS (75%); DECISIONS and RULINGS (75%); FREELANCE EMPLOYMENT (74%); SUPREME COURTS (71%); JUDGES (71%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (66%); PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES (51%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  		SUPREME COURT OF OHIO (55%)  			BARACK OBAMA (95%); SARAH PALIN (51%); MICHAEL MCMAHON (50%)  	COLUMBUS, OH, USA (93%); CLEVELAND, OH, USA (79%) OHIO, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 3, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  																
The Daily Star (Beirut, Lebanon)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Young activists call on Lebanese consumers to use fewer plastic bags  	Dalila Mahdawi, The Daily Star, Beirut, Lebanon  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	604 words  	Dec. 3--BEIRUT --  On the occasion of the Global Day of Action against Waste and Incineration, youth activists on Monday urged Lebanese consumers to use fewer disposable plastic bags in an effort to curb accelerating climate change and damage to Lebanon's ecosystems.LiNeBrEaK"People against Plastics," the IndyYOUTH division of under-18-year-old campaigners from activist league IndyACT took to the streets in Beirut to distribute reusable cloth bags that read "My fabric bag just saved a turtle -- People against Plastics." IndyACT was established in 2006 and works to "achieve a healthy, safe and equitable planet." LiNeBrEaKAccording to IndyACT deputy executive director Soumar Dakdouk, cloth bags were given away to raise awareness of the damage plastic bags caused to the environment. Each year, millions of non-biodegradable plastic bags are burned, inappropriately disposed of, or find their way into Lebanon's delicate river, forest, sea or ocean ecosystems. Creatures such as turtles, dolphins or birds often mistake floating plastic bags for jellyfish and choke to death, or become entangled in them and drown.LiNeBrEaKThe campaign was the first in a series planned by People against Plastics, said Dakdouk, with the ultimate goal being to "introduce charges on plastic bags at supermarkets." So far, no shops in Lebanon charge for plastic bag use, although the Lebanon Trade Center reportedly offers biodegradable bags.LiNeBrEaK"People have to realize the damage plastic bags cause to the environment," said IndyYouther and People against Plastics activist Dima Mabsout. "We have to take action to prevent the systematic poisoning of our ecosystems from chemicals and particles coming out of plastic bags."LiNeBrEaKIn response to a meeting this week in Poland to negotiate a new international climate change treaty, IndyACT has adopted a worldwide call for governments to implement Zero Waste strategies, which included the reduced use of plastic bags or incinerators.LiNeBrEaK"The Lebanese government is ignoring the cheapest and easiest way to avoid greenhouse gas emissions that causes climate change," said IndyACT Executive Director Wael Hmaidan. "Implementing a national reduce-reuse-recycle program would cut emissions as much as taking half off the country's cars off the road," he said.LiNeBrEaKZero Waste strategies, an IndyACT press release said, aim "to reduce to zero the volume and toxicity of materials being disposed of in landfills and incinerators by creating a closed-loop economy where all discards are reused, repaired, recycled or composted." The strategies would also legally sanction the implementation of "clean production, extended producer responsibility and other policies to redesign goods that cannot be safely reused, recycled or composted," said IndyACT.LiNeBrEaKLebanon suffers myriad environmental problems, including rapid deforestation and a four-storey toxic waste dump in the southern city of Sidon which regularly collapses into the Mediterranean Sea.LiNeBrEaKMost of Lebanon's raw sewage is pumped directly into the Mediterranean, as is some chemical waste from small, unregulated industries along the coast. Furthermore, tons of untreated hospital waste washes up along Lebanon's Southern coastlines each week, including used syringes.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   ALL S EDITION	Farmers see new policies blowing in;  Michigan Farm Bureau addresses climate change 		BUSINESS; Pg. E1  	467 words  	GRAND RAPIDS -- The forecast calls for warmer, wetter weather in the coming decades, and that could boost Michigan agriculture.LiNeBrEaKBut also expect climate change to bring greenhouse gas regulation that might not be as fruitful for the industry, especially if farmers do not speak up soon. LiNeBrEaKThe 89th annual meeting of the Michigan Farm Bureau this morning was scheduled to discuss a proposed climate change policy, after hearing from a panel of experts Tuesday at the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel.LiNeBrEaK"If there is going to be legislation coming down, we better accept that as reality and give our 2 cents," said Merle Langeland, a bureau board member who farms on 240 acres near Coopersville.LiNeBrEaK"A $175 fee on a Holstein cow, that's a major thing if you've got a herd of 500. (Regulation) can go right on to the exhaust out of your tractor."LiNeBrEaKThe meeting, a gathering of 67 county farm bureaus, tabled a policy proposal on climate change last year.LiNeBrEaKNow, as an annual United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland discusses the issue this week, Michigan farmers want to make their voice heard before it is too late.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed policy calls for a voluntary, market-based carbon credit trading system that recognizes farmland and forests as carbon reducers and compensates farmers for methods that keep carbon in the soil.LiNeBrEaKWhat policy opposesLiNeBrEaKThe policy opposes carbon taxes, cap-and-trade policies and any regulation of emissions from animals and farm equipment.LiNeBrEaK"This is not an 'if' or 'maybe' situation. A federal cap-and-trade (system), in my mind, is a near certainty," said Jon Allan, director of environmental and laboratory services for Jackson-based Consumers Energy Co. and a member of the state-sponsored Michigan Climate Action Council.LiNeBrEaK"The discussion really has largely moved away from the science. It's about what the policy will be. It's really critical for interested parties to make sure their interests are known. We're talking about dollars with a 't.' "LiNeBrEaKAllan said energy rates could jump 15 percent under one carbon-reduction scenario.LiNeBrEaKStaci Bohlen, a national issues specialist with the Minnesota Farm Bureau, said new mandatory carbon-emission reductions are affecting farmers in her state, where 14 percent of emissions come from agriculture.LiNeBrEaKIn Michigan, agriculture accounts for 3 percent of carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKJeff Andresen, an agricultural meteorologist at Michigan State University, said average global temperatures are expected to rise 2 to 7 degrees through 2100.LiNeBrEaK"We're looking at a trend toward warmer and wetter climate," he said. "In Michigan, that's a positive thing. Productivity would likely increase."LiNeBrEaKBut, he added, climate change could bring increased weather variability that would trouble agriculture.LiNeBrEaKThe bureau gathering runs through Friday at DeVos Place and the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel.

The Kansas City Star (Missouri)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	'Flow: For Love of Water'  	By Robert W. Butler, McClatchy Newspapers  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	377 words  	In "Quantum of Solace" the villains buy up the water rights of Bolivia so they can gouge the citizenry for every life-sustaining sip.LiNeBrEaKAccording to "Flow: For Love of Water," this isn't a figment of some screenwriter's imagination. LiNeBrEaKBefore ending on a somewhat hopeful note of defiant activism, Irena Salina's globe-hopping documentary is a terrifying downer. The film maintains that we're being poisoned by our supposedly safe drinking water, future wars will be fought over water rather than oil, and rapacious corporations will decide who is wealthy enough to afford clean H2O.LiNeBrEaKMost people lack access to clean water. In many countries, international water treatment and distribution companies _ often with the backing of the World Bank _ have taken over public water utilities. Now the tap works only if you scan a credit card proving you have enough money to pay for a drink.LiNeBrEaKNot only is Earth heating up, but also efforts to capture and divert water have backfired. The stagnant water trapped behind dams gives off methane gas, contributing to, yes, global warming.LiNeBrEaKThank goodness we've got it good here in the good old USA.LiNeBrEaKExcept that the herbicide Atrazine has found its way into this country's ground water. Frogs and fish exposed to Atrazine have changed sex, and the chemical triggers reproductive problems in men. Atrazine has been banned in Europe (where it is made), but the Bush administration cut a deal to allow its continued use here.LiNeBrEaKYou could always stick with bottled water, but "Flow" points out that it's an unregulated industry; often you're paying premium prices for a product of poorer quality than what comes from the tap.LiNeBrEaKThe good news is that people are wising up. "Flow" should play an essential role in that process.LiNeBrEaKFLOW: FOR LOVE OF WATERLiNeBrEaK3 starsLiNeBrEaKDirector: Irena SalinaLiNeBrEaKCast: Bunch of scientistsLiNeBrEaKNo MPAA rating; in various languages with subtitlesLiNeBrEaKRunning time: 1: 24LiNeBrEaKVisit The Star Web edition on the World Wide Web at http://www.kansascity.com.

LiNeBrEaKDr Seif Mohammed Al Ghais, Executive Director of the department, said recently that the system would be introduced in January next year.LiNeBrEaKHe noted that the studies conducted by the department recently showed that diesel vehicles emitted most of the dangerous gases.LiNeBrEaK"Old vehicles in poor mechanical conditions and those using cheap fuels, especially diesel, emit most of the dangerous gases which harm the ozone layer and can lead to global warming," said Al Ghais.LiNeBrEaKThe new system will require periodical examinations of all heavy trucks and old vehicles in the emirate.LiNeBrEaKismail@khaleejtimes.com	VEHICLE EMISSIONS (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); OZONE DEPLETION (72%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (69%)  			General  		DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (86%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (95%)  	December 3, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081203-KJ-BRF-New-System-to-Reduce-Vehicular-Emissions-in-Ras-Al-Khaimah-1203  	KJ  													
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	U.S. grant will help China's new buildings go green  	Les Blumenthal, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	727 words  	Dec. 3--WASHINGTON -- A $518,000 grant that will be awarded to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on Wednesday could have potentially important consequences in the effort to control global warming amid the continuing political fallout from the Kyoto climate change treaty.LiNeBrEaKBy 2015, the World Bank estimates, half the world's building construction will be in China. Over the next 20 years, China will build 430 billion square feet of floor space, or the equivalent of 20,000 to 50,000 new skyscrapers, the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of New York-based McKinsey and Co., a global management consulting firm. LiNeBrEaKPacific Northwest National Laboratory will be helping China create more energy efficient buildings.LiNeBrEaKBuildings, both commercial and residential, consume about one-third of all the energy used in China. Meanwhile, between one and two new coal plants come on-line in China every week, releasing carbon dioxide and other gases that are borne by upper level winds across the Pacific to the West Coast of the United States.LiNeBrEaKIn an effort to control its greenhouse gas emissions, China introduced green building codes two years ago, requiring all cities to cut their building energy use in half by 2010 and by 65 percent by 2020. The codes involve such things as lighting, insulation, heating and air conditioning.LiNeBrEaKOnly about 4 percent of China's existing buildings meet the codes.LiNeBrEaKThe grant announced Wednesday would allow the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to help train construction companies and inspectors in two Chinese cities about green construction. Eventually, a handbook will be created and distributed throughout China.LiNeBrEaK"China is committed to reducing its energy consumption," said Bin Shui, PNNL's project manager for the two-year pilot project.LiNeBrEaKPNNL is one of 10 Department of Energy laboratories. Headquartered in Richland, Wash., near the Hanford nuclear reservation, PNNL has about 4,200 employees. It also operates a marine research facility in Sequim, Wash., and has offices in Seattle, Tacoma, Wash., Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKAmong the projects the lab is working on are underground carbon sequestration, advanced fuel-efficient transportation and improved energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings.LiNeBrEaKShui said China's new construction codes compare favorably with those in the United States.LiNeBrEaK"While these are noble goals, in actuality it can take a long time," said Merydydd Evans, who is also working on the grant for the lab, adding that new buildings can be 50 percent more fuel efficient than existing ones. "This is not rocket science. It's a lot easier to build in efficiencies in the beginning."LiNeBrEaKThe grant is part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which was launched by the Bush administration three years ago to accelerate the development and use of green energy technologies. Its members include the United States, China, India, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea.LiNeBrEaKThree of those countries -- the United States, China and India -- never signed the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels.LiNeBrEaK"We are bringing the Chinese and Indians to the table," said Griffin Thompson, a senior energy adviser at the State Department and program manager for the Asia-Pacific Partnership. "This isn't about U.N. negotiators and arcane texts. China already has the building codes. Enforcement and compliance have always been the Achilles heel."LiNeBrEaKEfforts to control greenhouse gases don't get anywhere without China and India, and China appears "very much" committed to implementing its building codes, Thompson said.LiNeBrEaK"We are trying to figure out how to do things without the U.N.," Thompson said.LiNeBrEaKSen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said the PNNL grant was significant because, in lieu of Kyoto, the administration had been seeking agreements directly with China about global warming.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first agreement," Cantwell said.LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Nip in air should dissipate by afternoon: The temperature was colder than usual in South Florida, where the temperature hovered around 48 degrees Fahrenheit. But warmer weather is on the way.  	Jose Pagliery, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	390 words  	Dec. 3--Although temperature records won't be broken Wednesday morning, South Florida will still experience quite the chill -- and a warm afternoon.LiNeBrEaKDan Gregoria, meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said temperatures in Miami-Dade will hover in the upper 40s in the morning -- and a slight wind is pushing it even lower. LiNeBrEaK"Even if it's not strong, it's enough to add an extra bite to make it feel even chillier," Gregoria said, referring to the 5 mph winds out of the northwest.LiNeBrEaKNear the coast, the temperature is just a bit warmer: about 50 degrees Fahrenheit.LiNeBrEaKThe Salvation Army of Broward County recognized the colder weather by opening its doors to give homeless people a place to stay. According to their staff, food and hot drinks will be served.LiNeBrEaKAnd no one will be turned away, according to staff.LiNeBrEaKOfficials at Miami-Dade Fire Rescue urged homeowners to be extra careful when using heaters, which may light on fire if they're dirty or broken.LiNeBrEaKFor drivers who want a taste of the north, Gregoria explained, the trick may be to just pull down the windows.LiNeBrEaK"If you have air blowing at you as you go 60 to 65 miles per hour, it'd create wind chills around freezing at 32 degrees," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut the temperature is expected to rebound and hit 73 degrees by about 2 p.m., Gregoria said. By nightfall, it will be around 60 degrees, slightly warmer than the previous evening.LiNeBrEaKThe warming trend will continue throughout the week. Thursday's projected high temperature may be in the upper 70s.LiNeBrEaKAnother cold front, albeit a much weaker one, may hit South Florida by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.LiNeBrEaKThe service issued a small craft advisory Wednesday morning, given the moderate chop in intercoastal waters. Northern winds have caused high seas in the gulf stream, where waves may reach as high as 8 feet.LiNeBrEaKAnd the record? Not close, Gregoria said. The record temperature, set at Miami International Airport in 1910, was 37 degrees.

Monterey County Herald (California)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Hotels, eateries go green to make green: Upgrades translate into savings  	Emmanuel Romero, The Monterey County Herald, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	840 words  	Dec. 3--Holiday travelers visiting the Monterey Bay area can feel less guilty about leaving on holiday lights back home.LiNeBrEaKMore than 300 local hospitality businesses upgraded their facilities with energy-efficient technology, according to the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments. The energy savings mean a smaller carbon footprint for local businesses.LiNeBrEaK"Hospitality businesses often are operational 24/7," said Jennifer Parrish, assistant projects manager for Energy Watch, an energy efficiency program affiliated with AMBAG. "We realized if we were to provide them with the free equipment we offer, that would create tremendous energy savings." LiNeBrEaKCombined, Energy Watch's upgrades to hotels and restaurants reduce energy use by 19. 5 million kilowatt-hours, said Elisabeth Russell, special projects manager of Energy Watch. That's the equivalent of removing 2,541 cars from the road for a year, or growing 355,796 trees for 10 years, according to the online Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator, hosted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKContractors working with Energy Watch, such as Staples and Associates, provide free equipment and installation. Upgrades to equipment ranging from vending machines to light bulbs can save businesses a lot of money.LiNeBrEaKThe portion of the power bill that includes lighting could be cut 75 percent after installing energy-efficient technology, said Robert Howell, project manager of Staples and Associates.LiNeBrEaKNew bulbs installedLiNeBrEaKStaples is replacing standard fluorescent lighting tubes with T8 tubes. Not only are T8 tubes more efficient, but they illuminate a room without the humming and flickering characteristic of standard fluorescent tubes, Howell said.LiNeBrEaKLight bulbs have been replaced with light-emitting diodes in the exit signs of establishments. This form of lighting, similar to the tiny dots that make up traffic lights, has a longer life than incandescent light bulbs while using less electricity, Howell said.LiNeBrEaKNew motion detectors installed by Staples shut off lights in rooms not in use. This makes up for guests who forget to turn off the power after leaving a room.LiNeBrEaKThe motion detectors also operate vending machines. Hotel guests can buy midnight snacks and beverages from machines that use less power during late night or early morning, when they are less busy.LiNeBrEaK"It ends up saving approximately a couple hundred dollars a year in energy costs," Howell said of the vending machines.LiNeBrEaKFunding for upgradesLiNeBrEaKThe upgrades, free to customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., are funded by an $8. 6 million partnership between PGandE and AMBAG, paid for by utilities ratepayers. The partnership, which operates under the auspices of the California Public Utilities Commission, created Energy Watch with the intent of improving energy efficiency in the tri-county area and fighting climate change.LiNeBrEaKWhile applying for public service funding from the CPUC, the partnership decided early to focus on the "huge hospitality industry within the region," Russell said. Current funding, which also covers municipal facilities and residences, was slated to run from 2006 to the end of this year.LiNeBrEaKThe partnership is applying for new funding to continue its projects through 2011. The proposal is awaiting approval from the CPUC.LiNeBrEaKPrograms like these "help reduce the possibility that we will have to live through the worst impacts of climate change," said Stanley Young, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board.LiNeBrEaKThe board on Dec. 11 will deliberate a plan that lays out strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in California. Energy efficiency is a cornerstone of the plan, and the local hospitality improvements are a prime example of what people can expect, Young said.LiNeBrEaKMarketing strategyLiNeBrEaKUntil then, local businesses are incorporating their environmentally friendly improvements into their marketing strategy.LiNeBrEaK"We have just started marketing ourselves as an energy-efficient hotel, and in the last couple of months we've noticed that we're getting more green tourists to come stay with us," Phillip Paim, facilities manager of the Dolphin Inn in Carmel, said in a press release.LiNeBrEaKA complete list of hotels and restaurants taking advantage of Energy Watch is available at www.ambag.org/programs/EnergyWatch/hospitality/hospitality.html. The list spans Monterey, San Benito, and Santa Cruz counties. Qualifying customers of PGandE can also find information on Energy Watch's residential services.LiNeBrEaKThe Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator can be found at the United States Environmental Protection Agency Web site at www.epa.gov/solar/energy.-resources/calculator.html	ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (91%); LEISURE TRAVEL (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); RESTAURANTS (90%); HOME SECURITY (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (89%); VENDING MACHINES (87%); LODGING (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (77%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (77%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (77%); EMISSIONS (77%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (72%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (72%); CLIMATE CHANGE (72%); NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (72%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (71%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (67%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (67%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (67%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (67%)  	PGandE CORP (85%)  		PCG (NYSE) (85%) NASDAQ-NMS:SPLS, NYSE:PCG  	NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (85%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (85%) Energy  		CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 3, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Monterey County Herald   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081203-MN-Hotels-eateries-go-green-to-make-green-1203  	MN  													
Monterey County Herald (California)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Summit tackles changing oceans: Nation's aquariums, zoos seek ways to educate public  	Daniel Lopez, The Monterey County Herald, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	622 words  	Dec. 3--Officials from aquariums and zoos across the nation and Canada have convened in Monterey for a summit on climate change and the oceans.LiNeBrEaKThe gathering of representatives from about 50 institutions is taking place at the Monterey Plaza Hotel on Cannery Row and is the first of its kind.LiNeBrEaKThe intent is to learn how aquariums and zoos can better educate the public about changes taking place. LiNeBrEaK"We are at a point on the issue of climate change now where the science is quite clear now that global warming is under way and that we are starting to see profound changes," Bud Ris, president of Boston's New England Aquarium, said Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKRising sea levelLiNeBrEaKBut much of the discussion about climate change hasn't focused on its impact on oceans, Ris said.LiNeBrEaKThat is where he hopes the summit will make a difference.LiNeBrEaK"We feel we have a role and a responsibility at our institutions to begin to educate the public about that," Ris said. "Climate change is going to effect the level of the sea and it's going to effect it in two different ways."LiNeBrEaKRis said that as water warms, it expands, and melting glaciers and ice in Greenland and Antarctica will add water to the ocean, increasing the sea level.LiNeBrEaK"We may see a sea level rise of a couple of feet or more by the end of this century," he said.LiNeBrEaKA changing ocean could affect habitats, wetlands and development along coasts around the globe.LiNeBrEaK"If you raise the level of the sea a foot or two, it doesn't look realLiNeBrEaKgood for the future," Ris said.LiNeBrEaKReaching millionsLiNeBrEaKOn the New England coast, some impacts are already being felt and seen, Ris said. Lobsters are leaving areas where they were once abundant and moving north. Winter is getting shorter.LiNeBrEaK"We want to begin to help people understand what those changes are going to be so we can be better prepared for it," he said. "In all of our institutions, we have lots of animals that are going to be affected by climate change, so animals in some ways are our key way of reaching people to talk about these issues."LiNeBrEaKJulie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, said aquariums are trusted sources of information for the public when it comes to issues such as climate change.LiNeBrEaKCollectively, the aquariums and zoos represented at the summit can reach an audience of millions.LiNeBrEaK"We really have a responsibility to be connecting people with the science and also giving them personal actions and a sense of hope how it's worth their involvement," she said.LiNeBrEaKComing exhibitLiNeBrEaKAt the Monterey Bay Aquarium, an exhibit about global climate change and the oceans is expected to open in spring 2010.LiNeBrEaKThe aquarium is working to lead by example, searching for ways to minimize its carbon footprint, Packard said.LiNeBrEaK"If we love the ocean and ocean animals, we collectively really need to take some action to ensure a future for all of them," she said.LiNeBrEaKSomething people can do to mitigate climate change is to make wise decisions about the kind of vehicles they buy and how they drive them, Ris said.LiNeBrEaK"The more efficient the better. We want to reduce the amount of carbon that we emit into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels," he said. "This is probably the environmental issue of our time. It's a huge challenge, and we need everybody's help to begin to tackle it."

The New York Times 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final	Floodwaters, Worst Since '86, Begin to Recede in Venice  	By RACHEL DONADIO  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 12  	389 words  	Floodwaters in Venice began to subside on Tuesday after reaching their highest point in 22 years on Monday, forcing residents and tourists alike to stay inside or venture out in hip-waders. LiNeBrEaK  On Tuesday morning, the waters  dropped to 39 inches, down from a high of 61 inches on Monday, the fourth highest flood level in contemporary history, Venice's Tide Center said. LiNeBrEaK  ''We sent out another warning about very high tides this morning,'' said Leonardo Cossutta, who runs the center's control room. He said transportation was returning to normal, although some canal ferries, or vaporetti, were forced to take alternative routes because they could not fit under the bridges. A transport union called off a planned strike because of the floods.LiNeBrEaK  This week's flooding reached the highest levels since 1986 but they were still below the record  76 inches reached in 1966. Venice sets the flood level at 40 inches.LiNeBrEaK  The waters rapidly flooded into shops and homes early Monday morning. They engulfed the cafe tables in St. Mark's Square and forced its famous pigeons to find higher ground. In news photos, people waded through the streets in high boots.LiNeBrEaK  Because the water levels rose so quickly, the city was unable to erect the wooden platforms it uses to help pedestrians traverse  high waters. On Monday, the city sounded alarms, urging residents to stay indoors. LiNeBrEaK  Venice routinely floods several times a year, but in recent years the phenomenon has worsened. Experts say global warming is the main culprit. The flooding reopened a running debate on the Moses project, a controversial system of offshore dams designed to prevent such flooding. LiNeBrEaK  Work began on the $5. 5 billion project five years ago and is expected to be completed around 2011. Had the dam system been in place, ''it would have prevented what happened yesterday and also today,'' said Flavia Faccioli, a spokeswoman for the state consortium that is building the dams. LiNeBrEaK  Some environmental groups oppose the project, calling instead for reduced carbon emissions. ''We've seen for a long time that global warming presents problems for a city like Venice,'' said Michele Bertucco, the president of the Veneto branch of Legambiente, an environmental organization.LiNeBrEaK  The mayor of Venice, Massimo Cacciari, said the project was moving forward, The Associated Press reported.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	TEEN PATROL // Millersburg students out front in using practical conservation  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A14  	416 words  	How better to acquaint young people with the importance of saving energy than assigning students to ensure the lights aren't left on in empty classrooms and the faucets aren't leaking and to be otherwise on the lookout for ways to cut back on energy use? LiNeBrEaKThe results aren't in yet from the efforts of the Energy Patrol at the Millersburg Area Middle School. But we'd bet the students are having a positive impact both at their school and in their own homes.LiNeBrEaKThis is an initiative that combines learning with the real- world need to deal with a projected sharp in crease in electric rates in 2010, when rate caps are due to come off for PPL Electric cus tomers.LiNeBrEaKSome help in dealing with electric rates may come from the recent general decline in energy prices. Half of Pennsylvania's electricity is produced from the burning of coal, which like oil dramatically increased in price last summer but has since declined almost as quickly as it went up.LiNeBrEaKStill, that is no cause to pull back from the efforts to save energy at Millersburg and we suspect virtually every other school district in the area. Many districts -- among them Central Dauphin and Steelton-Highspire -- have conducted or are planning energy audits to look for areas where energy savings can be obtained with investments that pay for themselves relatively quickly.LiNeBrEaKWhether the price of energy continues to fall or remains in a range to which society has become more accustomed, these energy-saving initiatives are bound to pay both short-term and long-term dividends. Energy prices have come down because of the worldwide global economic downturn, which eventually will run its course. Once the economy revives, it's reasonable to assume that demand for energy will increase, along with prices.LiNeBrEaKBut beyond saving dollars, efforts in behalf of energy efficiency and conservation are commendable because they force us to examine how we do things and to recognize waste. So there also is an ethical dimension to using energy more wisely and minimizing the negative consequences. There is less pollution, less carbon going into the atmosphere and contributing to climate change, while the finite supplies of fossil fuels are extended further into the future, to a time when the world may have more fully developed alternative fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe students of the Millersburg Middle School Energy Patrol are doing important work in behalf of their school district and their planet. It's an effort that should be emulated at every school in the commonwealth.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition; East Edition	Day-to-day meteorologists, long-range climatologists in hot debate  	Michael Scott, Plain Dealer Reporter  	NATIONAL; Pg. A1  	1068 words  	They will tell you when the skies might rain or snow in fickle Northeast Ohio, when to bundle up the kids in a cold snap and when to make weekend plans if steady sunshine spans the five-day forecast.LiNeBrEaKThey also will tell you that human-caused global warming is hogwash. LiNeBrEaKThey're your local TV meteorologists.LiNeBrEaK"This cry that 'We're all going to die' is an overreaction and just not good science," said Andre Bernier, a meteorologist at WJW Channel 8. "I don't think I personally know any meteorologists - here in Cleveland or anywhere else I've worked - who agree with the hype over human-induced warming."LiNeBrEaKThe local TV weatherscape is indeed populated with on-air personalities who are pushing hard against the prevailing winds of climate science.LiNeBrEaKThat prevailing thought - supported by the United Nations' 1,200-member Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Meteorological Society and others - is this:LiNeBrEaKThe Earth's climate overall is warming and the human burning of fossil fuels in cars and industry - which release carbon dioxide - is helping to accelerate that change.LiNeBrEaKFurther, climate experts say, there could be dire consequences if humanity doesn't quickly lessen the accumulation of greenhouse gases and adequately adapt to a warming globe. The American Meteorological Society has strongly affirmed that stance, but accredits even the on-air meteorologists who rail against it.LiNeBrEaK"Our stance is pretty clear on this and we're in agreement with the global warming scenario as set out by the international panel," said Keith Seitter, AMS executive director.LiNeBrEaK"Still, we think they should research all that they can," he said. "And really, there should be less and less skepticism out there as the science improves each year - not more."LiNeBrEaKPrime-time doubtersLiNeBrEaKBut, there are doubters - all AMS certified - in prominent on-air positions at each of the four Cleveland television stations.LiNeBrEaKBernier and Dick Goddard - the patriarch of Cleveland weather forecasters - predict the weather at WJW Channel 8.LiNeBrEaKBoth cite natural fluctuations in the Earth's climate and dismiss the industrialization of the 20th century and the subsequent spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide as the cause for warming.LiNeBrEaKGoddard compared the current anxiety over warming with the global cooling concerns of the 1970s, which have since dissipated. He and Bernier both point to solar cycles as the key ingredient in climate change.LiNeBrEaKBernier also said he believes the climate is no longer warming - but, rather, cooling again.LiNeBrEaK"I have a hunch that in 10 years we're all going to be longing for global warming because it will be so cold," Bernier said. His Web site, andrebernier.com, links to a Canadian documentary that suggests the same.LiNeBrEaKOthers in the skeptic camp include meteorologists Jon Loufman at WOIO Channel 19, Mark Johnson at WEWS Channel 5 and Mark Nolan at WKYC Channel 3. Nolan has since moved to the news desk, but he said he still gets questions about his skeptic's stance.LiNeBrEaK"Climate records also show that long before industrialization, the Vikings had settled in Greenland because it was warm enough," said Loufman, who has taught meteorology courses at both Case Western Reserve University and Lakeland Community College. "I think the jury is still out on this."LiNeBrEaKSo what in the name of the National Weather Service is going on here?LiNeBrEaKDo the local weather guys know more than an international committee of several thousand climate scientists? Or are they too blinded by lake-effect snow squalls to see the big picture?LiNeBrEaKFor starters, the drift away from global warming among TV weather forecasters is hardly limited to Cleveland.LiNeBrEaK"This is nationwide," said Stu Ostro, meteorologist and director of weather communications for the Weather Channel in Atlanta.LiNeBrEaKAMS chief Seitter agreed: "I've seen the trend, too," he said. "But I still don't understand why there would be more skepticism among the TV meteorologists than in the field overall - but there is."LiNeBrEaKThe most notable example of dissent among meteorologists has been the Weather Channel's founder, John Coleman, now a TV forecaster in San Diego.LiNeBrEaKColeman - whom Seitter quickly points out remained with the Weather Channel for only a year in the early 1980s - has said human-induced warming is "the greatest scam in history."LiNeBrEaKThere have been others, from the longtime director of the National Hurricane Center to Accu-Weather.com's long-range forecaster, who told The Plain Dealer that "global warming is being forced down the throats of the public."LiNeBrEaKSource of dissentLiNeBrEaKSo what's behind all of this?LiNeBrEaKDick Goddard said the answer is that weather forecasters appreciate better the lack of reliable records.LiNeBrEaK"There's only one constant, and that's change," he said. "We've only got accurate weather records back to 1874 and things have been changing back and forth since long before that."LiNeBrEaKBernier said local meteorologists "are just more practical" and not swayed by the opportunity for more grant money to do more research proving climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut Seitter, a former skeptic himself, said meteorologists who make daily weather calls have a natural rivalry with climatologists who look at longer-range trends.LiNeBrEaK"Those of us in weather are used to seeing extremes all the time," he said. "Why should we think that anything is different today just because one day is hot, another day has heavy rains? Meteorologists often see those things as natural variability."LiNeBrEaKSeitter said many meteorologists also don't trust models - "because we've seen how wrong they can be in predicting weather" - and that most don't interact with other scientists beyond other meteorologists.LiNeBrEaK"We sort of live in our own world and haven't been exposed to the same volumes of research that the climatologists have," he said.LiNeBrEaK"And that can sometimes lead to a rivalry among the two groups - where some meteorologists are defensive and some climatologists might be condescending, or at least come off that way."LiNeBrEaKJay Hobgood, head of the Atmospheric Sciences Department at Ohio State University, agreed. He said the university teaches the IPCC findings on global warming, but allows for debate.LiNeBrEaK"The day-to-day meteorologists are seeing anecdotal evidence, but not the research that goes back thousands of years," he said. "The two disciplines are very related, but the time span being looked at is very different.LiNeBrEaK"Looking at the daily weather doesn't necessarily tell you the climate is changing."

Richmond Register (Kentucky)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Winter temps to be below normal  	Ronica Shannon, Richmond Register, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	379 words  	Dec. 3--It is no secret that winter brings cold temperatures and snow, but as for what to expect in Kentucky -- it is never set in stone. LiNeBrEaK"There is no strong signature predicted (for Kentucky) in December," said John Jacobson, senior meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Jackson.LiNeBrEaKWith the absence of La Nina and El Nino in the Pacific Ocean this season (climate patterns that give forecasters clues about potential weather events months in advance), predicting weather patterns on seasonal time scales becomes increasingly challenging, according to the 2008 Winter Weather Outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).LiNeBrEaK"Climate prediction is tough," Jacobson said. "It's something that we're getting better at all the time."LiNeBrEaKInstead, other climate patterns over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions may play a significant role in influencing U.S. winter weather.LiNeBrEaK"These patterns are only predictable a week or two in advance and could persist for weeks at a time," said Michael Halpert, deputy director at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. "Therefore, we expect variability, or substantial changes in temperature and precipitation across much of the country."LiNeBrEaKThere is about a 40-percent chance that winter temperatures for this area will be below normal, Jacobson said.LiNeBrEaK"The prediction now for the 30-day (forecast) is below normal temperature," said Keys Arnold, staff meteorologist for the University of Kentucky Agriculture Weather Center. "For December, the average drops to 37. 2 percent, but we can expect our temperatures to cool off even more.LiNeBrEaKAs for November, it was "one of the coldest Novembers we've had," he said. "We had a measurable snowfall event (in November), and that is the first time that's happened since 2002."

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: A balancing act is key to stimulus: NEED TO CREATE JOBS DOESN'T MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS DISAPPEAR  	The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	637 words  	Dec. 3--Whenever California builds freeway lanes, flood-control levees or other major construction projects, the public gets a chance to review the plans and suggest changes to minimize the environmental impact.LiNeBrEaKSuch input has paid off. It has resulted in replanted forests to compensate for trees lost when a levee is rebuilt or widened. Outside pressure has also prompted Caltrans to build stormwater basins to prevent highway runoff from damaging creeks or polluting beaches.LiNeBrEaKIn an effort to speed up projects financed by state bond money, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is now proposing to streamline these environmental reviews. Agencies such as Caltrans would have to obtain environmental permits for highway or transit projects, but opportunities for the public or regulators to shape the final product would be severely truncated. LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to understand why the governor wants to fast-track the process. President-elect Barack Obama has asked states to identify billions of dollars in public works projects that could be started in the next 120 days. Since California voters have approved more than $50 billion in infrastructure spending in recent years, the state is in a prime position to leverage federal assistance for projects that could create thousands of jobs.LiNeBrEaKIt's also easy to understand why the governor fears that unrestrained application of the California Environmental Quality Act could derail this opportunity. As this page has frequently noted, CEQA has a long history of litigious abuse by various interest groups, including unions that want to extract favorable labor terms for certain projects.LiNeBrEaKIt is also fair to say that, when combined with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, CEQA can add years to the time it takes to build even the most beneficial project, such as a transit line or sewage treatment plant.LiNeBrEaKThat said, the governor and lawmakers need to be extremely careful with plans to truncate certain environmental reviews, particularly for new highway lanes.LiNeBrEaKMany of these highway projects were on the books before the governor signed Assembly Bill 32, a state law that requires reductions in greenhouse gases. Some -- such as the Kings-Tulare State Road 196 Expressway -- will likely spur sprawl out toward valuable farmlands, adding to the carbon footprint of the Central Valley.LiNeBrEaKClearly, the governor and lawmakers need to engage in a balancing act when considering stimulus proposals. Priority should go to projects that don't compromise the state's environmental goals and serve essential immediate needs, such as public safety.LiNeBrEaKTo find this balance, both sides will have to give a little bit. Democrats and environmental groups will have to drop their insistence that CEQA can't be touched or that state agencies can't contract with "design-build" firms to speed up public works. The governor and Republicans will have to concede to environmental reviews for highway widenings that might conflict with the state's climate policies.LiNeBrEaKSomewhere in the middle could be a mix of projects that could include new hospitals, revamped levees, road rehabilitation, transit lines, school buildings and infrastructure for affordable housing. To find this middle ground, lawmakers of both parties need to come out of their corners, find an immediate solution to the state's fiscal crisis and come up with a stimulus package that stimulates green public works.

San Antonio Express-News 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   METRO Edition	American colleges not at head of the class  	Melissa Ludwig, STAFF  	A SECTION; Pg. 1A  	807 words  	College has become so unaffordable, and graduation rates so stubbornly low, that America's great higher education engine may be sputtering, according to Measuring Up 2008, the latest report by the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a San Jose, Calif.-based nonprofit.LiNeBrEaKIssued every two years, the report card measures progress in academic preparation for college, enrollment, graduation rates, economic benefit and affordability for all 50 states, assigning grades in each category. LiNeBrEaKEvery state except California earned an F in affordability, and despite modest improvements in other categories, America stacked up poorly when compared with other countries. About 39 percent of young Americans have at least an associate's degree, compared with more than 50 percent in countries such as Canada, Japan and South Korea, the report found.LiNeBrEaKTexas made some progress, earning a B in academic preparation, but the 18 percent gap in college graduation rates between Anglos and Hispanics - Texas' fastest-growing population - is one of the largest in the nation.LiNeBrEaK"This is not a problem you can act on after it exists, sort of like global warming," said Patrick Callan, president of the National Center. "When you see the ice cap melting, it is too late to fix it. If we don't begin to act on it now, we could see absolute decline."LiNeBrEaKThough experts have been sounding the alarm about higher education for a while, the issue has reached a turning point, Callan said.LiNeBrEaKIn the next few years, 78 million baby boomers will retire and the nation needs at least enough degreed workers to replace them, and even more to compete in a global, knowledge-based economy.LiNeBrEaKIn an ailing economy, state lawmakers soon will begin wrestling with thinning state budgets, and dumping more of the cost of higher education onto students could worsen the problem.LiNeBrEaK"When the economy is good, we raise tuition as little as possible," Callan said. "During a recession, we sock it to students and families when people can least afford it."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the report, since 1982 college tuition increases have far outpaced wages, inflation, housing and even medical costs. College costs make up a larger share of family income than in 1999, especially among low-income families, and student borrowing has more than doubled.LiNeBrEaKMiddle- and upper-class families still are doing whatever it takes to put their kids through college, said James Boyle, president of College Parents of America. But a breaking point may be coming soon.LiNeBrEaK"Delaying the day of reckoning, if you will, can only go so far," Boyle said. "By the entering class of 2010, you will start to see some fraying at the edges, where those parents will be looking for lower-cost alternatives."LiNeBrEaKTexas beat other states in affordability, but earned an F on the report card because lower- and middle-class families have to shell out 37 percent of their income after financial aid to afford a public, four-year university.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia got the report's highest score in affordability, a C minus, because of its cheap community colleges, Callan said.LiNeBrEaKIn Texas, Callan blamed state lawmakers' vote to deregulate tuition in 2003, calling it a "back door invitation for colleges to raise tuition as much as they dared."LiNeBrEaKCallan also said lawmakers ought to restrain the ambitions of a handful of public universities - University of Texas at San Antonio included - clamoring to be the next national research university. When money is tight, dollars should be focused on undergraduate education, he said.LiNeBrEaKDavid Gabler, a spokesman for UTSA, disagreed.LiNeBrEaKThe lack of state funding has forced universities to raise tuition in order to maintain quality, Gabler said. And though every institution can't climb the ranks, there is statewide consensus that Texas needs at least one more national research university.LiNeBrEaK"There is brain drain from Texas. That does not serve our state well," Gabler said.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Alan Richard, a spokesman for the Southern Regional Education Board, Texas ought to focus on college graduation rates, especially among minorities.LiNeBrEaKTexas' six-year graduation rate is about 50 percent, compared with 55 percent nationwide. But among African Americans, the rate is 36 percent, and 38 percent among Hispanics. That inequity costs Texas $98 billion a year in personal income, the report found.LiNeBrEaK"Enrolling students in college who do not finish a degree takes up valuable classroom space and costs students money," Richard said. "Without more minority students completing degrees, we could slide backward."LiNeBrEaKThe report gave Texas a C minus in completion.LiNeBrEaKIn participation, which measures enrollment rates, Texas earned a D minus. At 35 percent, likelihood of 19-year-olds to enroll in college is low compared with other states, the report found, largely because Texas has one of the lowest high school graduation rates in the country.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Energy chief dedicates biofuel development lab;  EMERYVILLE;  Scientists from UC and national labs working together	Jim Doyle, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Metro; Pg. B1  	982 words  	Fast growing and tenacious species such as eucalyptus and poplar trees on the West Coast, and prairie grasses and switchgrass in arid portions of the Midwest, are prime candidates for the next generation of energy crops needed for liquid biofuels. LiNeBrEaKBut first, scientists must discover new, cost-efficient technologies to break down these organic plant fibers into the fermentable sugars that can be processed into biofuel replacements for petroleum products.  LiNeBrEaK"Welcome to the future," said Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman as he dedicated the new Joint BioEnergy Institute in Emeryville, a research center supported by the Bay Area's national laboratories, leading academic institutions and private industry. "This is America, where we have made a habit of accomplishing the seemingly impossible, especially in the areas of science and technology." LiNeBrEaKBodman later said his boss, President Bush, who had repeatedly voiced skepticism about global warming during his first term in office, was a key backer of the institute and two additional biofuels research centers in Tennessee and the Great Lakes region. LiNeBrEaKThe new Emeryville facility, funded for five years with $135 million from the Department of Energy, has recruited renowned scientists, as well as graduate and postdoctoral students, to take on the toughest obstacles in creating new biofuels by using modern genomics and molecular biology, robotics and mass spectrometry, chemistry and materials analysis.LiNeBrEaKOne goal, for example, is to develop a universal biomass solvent that can cost-effectively break down plant fibers in order to extract 100 percent of the sugar within.LiNeBrEaKThe institute is housed on the top floor of a leased office building - with 65,000 square feet of laboratory space. About 120 people work there, but many of the researchers are working just part time because of their obligations at Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories, as well as at the Cal and UC Davis campuses.LiNeBrEaKRoyalties an incentiveLiNeBrEaKAs an incentive, the institute's leading scientists will be entitled to earn royalties from any new patents they create. And the institute's sponsors have agreed to pump some of the institute's future revenue stream back into the Emeryville lab.LiNeBrEaK"What needs to be invented now has to be able to thrive in the marketplace. Cost is a huge factor," said Steve Chu, director of science at the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, one of the institute's sponsors along with Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, the UC Berkeley and Davis campuses, the Carnegie Institution for Science and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.LiNeBrEaKThe Joint BioEnergy Institute has "grown from a gleam in the eye" of a handful of scientists and visionaries a few years ago to an experimental, integrated research laboratory capable of groundbreaking work, Chu said. "This has just got to be solved. We can't fail on this one. The fact that we have so many brilliant people working on this gives me great hope."LiNeBrEaKJay Keasling, who runs the institute, said its core mission is "to deliver groundbreaking science in the development of new biofuels."LiNeBrEaKHe said the institute's leading scientists consult with representatives of nine companies a couple of times a year about its research. He also plans to bring in entrepreneurs who can help identify positive technology and build the business case for taking a specific technology to market.LiNeBrEaKKeasling, a molecular biologist, said the urgent need to convert the world's abundance of biomass to new fuels is based on the acceleration of global warming, the depletion of fossil fuels and the world's growing population.LiNeBrEaKThe United States uses about 225 billion gallons of transportation fuels each year. According to state environmental regulators, about 40 percent of California's greenhouse gases derive from transportation sources, especially tailpipe emissions.LiNeBrEaK While the energy industry has already developed ways to convert cornstalks into ethanol, scientists hope to next engineer microbes from nonfood plant fibers to produce additional fuels that do not require modifications to internal combustion machines. They also hope to tap additional cellulose reserves such as including fallen trees, agricultural waste, rice, algae, and paper in landfills.LiNeBrEaKAnna Palmisano, associate director of the Department of Energy's Office of Science for Biological and Environmental Research, said the institute in Emeryville is on "the front lines of the next green revolution."LiNeBrEaK"Today's technologies will not provide us with the long-term, sustainable energy sources that America needs," Palmisano said. "Incremental improvements in today's technologies will not be enough. We need transformational breakthroughs in basic science that provide the foundation for truly disruptive technologies. We need to fundamentally change the rules of the game."LiNeBrEaKResistance to decayLiNeBrEaKShe pointed out that recalcitrance - or the chemical resistance of organic matter to decomposition - is the key scientific and technological obstacle for the center's scientists, who need to identify the enzymes that make up a plant walls and find ways to modify them.LiNeBrEaK"Plant fiber has evolved over the millennia to resist breakdown," Palmisano said. "The result is that plant fiber has incredible strength and resilience - a sort of flexible concrete. ... The crystalline nature of cellulose resists attack by enzymes."LiNeBrEaKCurrent technology requires pretreatment of plant fibers by harsh chemicals that result in a loss of sugars, or high temperatures, which is not energy efficient, she said.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Obama and his new crew  	Debra J. Saunders  	Op-Ed; DEBRA J. SAUNDERS; Pg. B9  	670 words  	If you're not a "Star Trek" fan, you might not get this, but as I've watched President-elect Barack Obama these past few weeks, I feel as if the country is passing the torch from the brash, rule-breaking Capt. James T. Kirk, whose Starship Enterprise boldly went where no man had gone before in the original sci-fi series, to the more cerebral governance of Capt. Jean Luc Picard, who ran the Enterprise, not so much as his merry ship but as a cutting-edge corporate venture, which culled databases and held meetings to brainstorm possible responses to new challenges. Note: when "Star Trek: the Next Generation" first aired in 1987, viewers didn't look at corporate execs as greed-filled panic-fueled incompetents.LiNeBrEaKMonday, Obama made some savvy editions to his new crew. LiNeBrEaKHillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state? A smart political move. For Obama's foreign policy to succeed abroad, he needs support at home. Clinton in the Senate would have a stake in Obama failure, but Clinton at the helm of the State Department will have a stake in Obama's success, and no incentive to undermine it.LiNeBrEaKPoor Joe Biden. With Hillary Clinton in charge, it looks as if he will be attending funerals - not, as he may have imagined, pontificating and passing on to a less-seasoned president in training his sage advice on foreign policy, such as his plan to partition Iraq in three. LiNeBrEaK Obama's decision to keep on Defense Secretary Robert Gates has angered the anti-war left, as it signals that Obama is prepared to drop his pledge to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq within 16 months of taking office. I'm thrilled. Gates would not agree to stay if he expected a precipitous troop withdrawal. LiNeBrEaKThus, the big question about Obama has been answered: While Democrats - even Clinton and Biden, who both voted to authorize the war - may play the blame game with Bush about Iraq, Obama understands that if Iraq collapses after U.S. troops are withdrawn, then it won't matter who started the war. America loses, and he loses.LiNeBrEaKNow the question is: When did Obama know he would not honor his hard timeline pledge - during the primary, as I suspect, or over time, as the Bush-Gates troop surge brought about increased security in Iraq? Either way, Obama is where he should be on the issue. LiNeBrEaKAs for Obama's national security adviser nominee, James L. Jones Jr. : It turns out that, to the horror of some enviroes, Jones is involved with Chevron and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the global warming issue. It's like Christmas for global-warming skeptics. LiNeBrEaKOn foreign policy, the left will have to content itself with Obama talking with Iran - the left loves talks - and honoring his pledge to close Guantanamo Bay. Meanwhile, the rest of us will have to cross our fingers and hope the number of released Gitmo inmates who have been killed or captured fighting with terrorists abroad does not climb above the June count of 13. Beware: A Pentagon fact sheet estimated that 7 percent of released Gitmo detainees returned to terrorist activities.LiNeBrEaKObama's pick for attorney general - Eric Holder, formerly of the Clinton Justice Department - promises to disappoint some on the left and on the right. Holder's role in the 2001 Clinton pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich showed a smarmy side of Obama's would-be top law man. Yes, recent presidents - both Bushes, Bill Clinton, Gerald Ford - have pardoned political allies who broke the law. While it is not pretty, the practice has precedent, and does temper efforts to criminalize politics.LiNeBrEaKThe Rich pardon broke the mold. When Holder issued a "neutral, leaning toward" favorable appraisal of Rich's pardon request, he did so without a full briefing from federal prosecutors, in complete disregard of Rich's fugitive status and despite intelligence reports that Rich had done business with rogue states Iraq and Iran. As Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, told the New York Times, "If a Republican official had engaged in this kind of activity, he would never receive Senate confirmation."LiNeBrEaKI believe Smith is right.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Dyer: Four truths about climate change we can't ignore  	Gwynn Dyer  	OPINION; Columnists  	845 words  	About two years ago, I realized that the militaries in various countries were starting to do climate change scenarios in-house -- scenarios that started with the scientific predictions about rising temperatures, falling crop yields and other physical effects -- and examine what that would do to politics and strategy.LiNeBrEaKThe scenarios predicted failed states proliferating because governments couldn't feed their people; waves of climate refugees washing up against the borders of more fortunate countries; even wars between countries that shared the same rivers. LiNeBrEaKSo I started interviewing everybody I could get access to. Not only senior military people, but scientists, diplomats and politicians.LiNeBrEaKAbout 70 interviews, a dozen countries and 18 months later, I have reached four conclusions that I didn't even suspect when I began the process. The first is simply this: The scientists are really scared. Their observations over the past two or three years suggest that everything is happening a lot faster than their climate models predicted.LiNeBrEaKThis creates a dilemma for them, because for the past decade they have been struggling against a well-funded campaign that cast doubt on the phenomenon of climate change.LiNeBrEaKNow, finally, people and even governments are listening. Even in the United States, the world headquarters of climate change denial, 85 percent of the population now sees climate change as a major issue, and both presidential candidates in last month's election promised 80 percent cuts in American emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists are understandably reluctant at this point to announce publicly that their predictions were wrong; that it's really much worse and the targets will have to be revised. Most of them are waiting for overwhelming proof that climate change really is moving faster, even though they are already privately convinced that it is.LiNeBrEaKSo governments, now awakened to the danger at last, are still working to the wrong emissions target. The real requirement, if we are to avoid runaway global warming, is probably 80 percent cuts by 2030, and almost no burning whatever of fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil) by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe second conclusion is that the generals are right. Food is the key issue, and world food supply is already very tight: We have eaten up about two-thirds of the world grain reserve in the past five years, leaving only 50 days' worth in store. Even a 1. 8-degree rise in average global temperature will take a major bite out of food production in almost all the countries that are closer to the equator than to the poles, and that includes almost all of the planet's breadbaskets.LiNeBrEaKSo the international grain market will wither for lack of supplies. Countries that can no longer feed their people will not be able to buy their way out of trouble by importing grain from elsewhere, even if they have the money. Starving refugees will flood across borders, whole nations will collapse into anarchy -- and some countries may make a grab for their neighbors' land or water.LiNeBrEaKThese are scenarios that the Pentagon and other military planning staffs are examining now. They could start to come true as little as 15 or 20 years down the road. If this kind of breakdown becomes widespread, there will be little chance of making or keeping global agreements to curb greenhouse gas emissions and avoid further warming.LiNeBrEaKThe third conclusion is that there is a point of no return after which warming becomes unstoppable -- and we are probably going to sail right through it. It is the point at which human-caused warming triggers huge releases of carbon dioxide from warming oceans, or similar releases of both carbon dioxide and methane from melting permafrost, or both. Most climate scientists think that point lies not far beyond 3. 6 degrees hotter.LiNeBrEaKOnce that point is passed, the human race loses control: Cutting our own emissions may not stop the warming. But we are almost certainly going to miss our deadline. We cannot get the 10 lost years back, and by the time a new global agreement to replace the Kyoto accord is negotiated and put into effect, there will probably not be enough time left to stop the warming short of the point where we must not go.LiNeBrEaKSo -- final conclusion -- we will have to cheat. In the past two years, various scientists have suggested several "geo-engineering" techniques for holding the temperature down directly. We might put a kind of temporary chemical sunscreen in the stratosphere by seeding it with sulphur particles, for example, or we could artificially thicken low-lying maritime clouds to reflect more sunlight.LiNeBrEaKThese are not permanent solutions; merely ways of winning more time to cut our emissions without triggering runaway warming in the meanwhile. But the situation is getting very grave, and we are probably going to see the first experiments with these techniques within five years.LiNeBrEaKThere is a way through this crisis, but it isn't easy and there is no guarantee of success. As the Irishman said to the lost traveler: "If that's where you want to go, sir, I wouldn't start from here."

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Opinion: Funds for clean car tech should not be diverted to Big 3 bailout  	By Elon Musk Special to the Mercury News  	NEWS; Opinion  	711 words  	Congress is debating the automobile industry "bailout" this week, and the outcome will have enormous implications from Detroit to Silicon Valley, not to mention on consumers, public policy and the environment.LiNeBrEaKAt stake is the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which the Department of Energy administers. The program provides new and established automakers and suppliers with low-interest loans and other incentives so they may build fuel-efficient vehicles and get them to customers faster.LiNeBrEaKAfter Congress earmarked $25 billion for the program in September, the economy cratered. November vehicle sales were the lowest in 26 years. Detroit automakers scrambled to find a solution to quickly depleting cash reserves. LiNeBrEaKThe Detroit Three asked for some of the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program for the finance industry. When the White House refused, automakers focused on the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, trying to refashion it as a bailout.LiNeBrEaKAlthough some on Capitol Hill don't grasp or acknowledge the distinction, make no mistake: Diverting a progressive program for next-generation car technology into a general bailout would be a dangerous and sad irony: The Detroit Three have resisted building hybrids and electric vehicles for decades.LiNeBrEaKThe Detroit Three say they need cash to avoid firing millions of workers. But mortgaging the future to cover up the auto industry's mistakes would have dire consequences for the next generation. Last month, President-elect Barack Obama outlined an economic recovery plan that could put 2. 5 million Americans to work, many of them in "green collar" jobs building wind turbines, installing solar panels and developing fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is already showing that America needn't buy into the specious argument that pits the environment vs. the economy: In October, the University of California-Berkeley released data showing that the state's energy-efficiency policies created nearly 1. 5 million jobs from 1977 to 2007 and boosted salaries by $44. 6 billion.LiNeBrEaKSan Carlos-based Tesla Motors is applying for $400 million in federal loans. These are not handouts. Rather, the funds would support two projects: The first would supply recyclable batteries and components for other automakers hoping to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. The second would help finance a manufacturing facility to make a five-passenger family sedan   all-electric and zero-emission, freeing owners of petro-state dictators, OPEC-mandated price fluctuations and Big Oil oligopoly.LiNeBrEaKSince its creation nearly five years ago, Tesla Motors has directly addressed the crises of energy security and climate change. Tesla is already producing the all-electric, zero-emission Roadster, which delivers double the efficiency and generates one-third the carbon dioxide of popular hybrids. The sports car is the technical validation and precursor to a planned family sedan and subcompact in Tesla's product pipeline   evidence that EV technology is already viable.LiNeBrEaKThose who question whether the government should fund a company building a $109,000 sports car don't understand a cardinal rule of the tech industry: Early generations of any breakthrough product are always expensive. Cellular phones in the 1980s cost $2,000. So-called early adopters are willing to pay more for the newest items, amortizing RandD and subsidizing later buyers.LiNeBrEaKHardware also becomes more affordable within several product cycles, whether on the time frame of Moore's Law (for semiconductor-based electronics) or, in the case of Tesla's lithium-ion battery capacity, at the fair clip of 8 percent per year. That's how Tesla will move from a six-figure sports car to a $57,500 sedan to a $30,000 subcompact within several years.LiNeBrEaKGiven the tight venture capital lately, a government loan to Tesla would speed delivery of more affordable vehicles that eliminate dependence on foreign oil and reduce drivers' carbon footprint. Tesla is applying for the loans in the truest spirit and intent of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. I don't endorse corrupting it   nor should the American public.LiNeBrEaKElon Musk is chairman, CEO and product architect for Tesla Motors Inc. He wrote this article for the Mercury News.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   FIRST EDITION	WU getting gift for coal research $12 million o Arch Coal, Peabody, Ameren contributing. goal o Reduce cost of cutting emissions from power plants.  	By Jeffrey Tomich ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH  	BUSINESS; Pg. C1  	771 words  	The nation's two largest coal companies and one of the largest coal-burning utilities agreed to give Washington University $12 million over five years to help make the St. Louis area a hub for clean-coal research.LiNeBrEaKPeabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. will contribute $5 million apiece, and Ameren Corp. will provide $2 million to help establish the Consortium for Clean Coal Utilization, university Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton announced Tuesday at a news conference on the school's campus. LiNeBrEaKCoal is burned to produce half of the nation's electricity, and global demand is expected to rise sharply over the next 20 years. But burning coal is a major source of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas associated with global warming. And scientists urge steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dire environmental consequences.LiNeBrEaKWrighton and energy company executives said the dual challenges of keeping the world's economy running and halting or reversing climate change necessitates advances in technology.LiNeBrEaK"I see this as one of the most important challenges, if not the most important challenge of this century - providing abundant affordable energy without adverse consequences to the environment," Wrighton said.LiNeBrEaKThe consortium's goal is advancing education and research that help make available clean-coal technology - specifically, the ability to capture harmful carbon dioxide and pump it underground or use it to enhance oil recovery.LiNeBrEaK"Technology is the critical enabling solution," said Steven F. Leer, chief executive of Creve Coeur-based Arch Coal Inc. "If you're serious about stabilizing CO2 in the atmosphere, we have to develop the technology."LiNeBrEaKAdvances in coal-combustion technology over the last 40 years have helped achieve big cuts in emissions of other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and mercury, Leer said. He believes similar cuts in carbon dioxide emissions are possible.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists and opponents of coal say the term "clean coal" is an oxymoron, and the concept of a fossil fuel that's almost emissions-free is a mirage - something that will always be out of reach, economically if not technologically.LiNeBrEaKEnergy executives at Washington University said Tuesday that the technology to strip carbon dioxide from coal and pump it underground exists. They said more testing and research is necessary to reduce the cost so it can be widely deployed.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has urged implementation of a cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 1990 levels by midcentury.LiNeBrEaK"Those kind of cuts are significant and will require technology to be able to achieve them," Ameren Chief Executive Gary L. Rainwater said. "You can't do it any other way."LiNeBrEaKObama also has called for partnerships between government and industry to build commercial-scale coal power plants able to capture carbon dioxide and store it in the ground. One such partnership, dubbed FutureGen, was scrapped by the U.S. Department of Energy earlier this year and overhauled - a move that's expected to delay the project by years.LiNeBrEaKFor Ameren and other utilities that rely on coal to generate electricity, the clock is ticking. In fact, the likelihood of carbon emission limits and costs of burning coal are a big reason why AmerenUE, the company's Missouri utility, is pursuing a second nuclear reactor near Fulton, Mo., at an estimated cost of more than $6 billion.LiNeBrEaKRainwater and the other energy executives said the money committed to Washington University on Tuesday represents a tiny fraction of the billions of dollars needed to accelerate clean-coal technology.LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based advocacy group, says 20 gigawatts of coal-fueled generation (more than a dozen large power plants) with carbon capture and sequestration technology must be installed by 2020 to meet longer-term carbon reduction goals, said John Thompson, director of the group's coal transition program.LiNeBrEaKTo do that, the group estimates that more than $100 billion of investment in clean-coal technology is required over the next decade.LiNeBrEaK"It is a daunting task, but it is one that is actually quite solvable,'" said Thompson, who works in Carbondale, Ill. "But we have to muster the political will to do it now."LiNeBrEaKThe clean-coal consortium announced Tuesday it will operate as part of Washington University's International Center for Advanced Renewable Energy and Sustainability, established in June 2007.LiNeBrEaKThe $60 million committed to the center will help fund six new professors.

However, the article left out one key factor: carbon dioxide (CO2).LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is the most serious of all environmental problems because of its multiple impacts. CO2 emissions from coal plants are a leading cause of global warming. The proposed Big Stone 2 plant will emit approximately 4 million tons of CO2, more CO2 than all the trucks and cars in South Dakota.LiNeBrEaKSouth Dakota has approved it to be built near their eastern border. Minnesota would be importing much of its energy, so we have a say too. Our Public Utilities Commission needs to vote down the new power lines the new plant would need to bring the power to Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKIn 1997, Minnesota adopted the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. President-elect Obama has the same goal. We can't get there if we build new coal plants or import our electricity from new coal plants. The money to build a new coal plant needs to go to wind, solar, non-food biofuels, energy efficiency and conservation.LiNeBrEaKJOE FOSSLiNeBrEaKMOUNDS VIEWLiNeBrEaKNo loan for Big 3LiNeBrEaKIt's ridiculous to hand over any type of loan to the auto industry! If they need money, they should be producing products that people buy. It would seem they lost sight of what people want. If they present a good enough idea or product, people will invest in it. Handing over taxpayers' money will do nothing to inspire quality or innovation.LiNeBrEaKJAMES PIERSONLiNeBrEaKANDOVERLiNeBrEaKThe next stepLiNeBrEaKIt seems to me Congress should insist on a reorganization of the Detroit automakers before we send any money their way. For a starter I'd eliminate them all and combine them as one company with congressional oversight and a VP from Toyota American to run the new company. Everything else is details.LiNeBrEaKPETER ZAREMBOLiNeBrEaKSHOREVIEWLiNeBrEaKFans deserve betterLiNeBrEaKSeems like the T-Wolves are always building up a big lead and then losing at the end. They play hard but just don't have that scorer that can put the game away.LiNeBrEaKWe draft Ray Allen and trade him for Stephon Marbury, we draft Brandon Roy and trade him for Randy Foye, we draft OJ Mayo and trade him for Kevin Love. Any of those original drafted players would make all the difference in the final outcome. I know that Kevin McHale was a great basketball player, but how long is it going to take before Glen Taylor finally realizes that McHale is a terrible GM? Give the fans what they need, a GM who knows basketball talent and can build the Wolves into a playoff team.LiNeBrEaKED KELLYLiNeBrEaKCOON RAPIDSLiNeBrEaKFeeling like a foolLiNeBrEaKFool me once, shame on you. Fool me for the 50th time ... typical Gopher football. What a cruel joke and the punch line is we continue to have hope. I challenge Tim Brewster to play a schedule that actually reflects his team's talent. Then again, Minnesota is a Division I program.LiNeBrEaKBLAIR SORVARILiNeBrEaKCHAMPLINLiNeBrEaKNo accountabilityLiNeBrEaKOn consecutive days, you reported on state government officials who left their jobs under clouds of suspicion of fraud or misuse of government money (Sonia Pitt with MnDOT and Mike and Cathy Hamm with the DNR). It appears that what they did was very clear but in both cases the legal authorities decided not to press charges because the suspects' superiors either tacitly approved their actions or were so lax in their management that no prosecution was possible. It is no wonder government is suspected of being inept and wasteful. You apparently can do whatever you want in Minnesota government and walk away free. There truly is no one in charge.LiNeBrEaKKEN ORTTELLiNeBrEaKANDOVER	COAL INDUSTRY (89%); VOTERS and VOTING (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (87%); IMPORT TRADE (87%); EMISSIONS (87%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (87%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); POLITICS (76%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (74%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (72%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (72%); POWER PLANTS (72%); BIOMASS (72%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (72%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (72%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (70%); AUTOMAKERS (69%); ENERGY EXPORTS and IMPORTS (68%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (68%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (68%); WIND ENERGY (67%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (66%); MOTOR VEHICLES (64%); APPROVALS (64%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (63%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (52%); BIOFUELS (50%) opinion  					BARACK OBAMA (84%)  	SOUTH DAKOTA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 9, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved  										NORTH ONLY  						
St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	HIGHER-ED SCORECARD STINGS  	DONNA WINCHESTER, Times Staff Writer  	TAMPA BAY; Pg. 1B  	570 words  	Florida once again has received mediocre scores on a national report card evaluating the state's colleges and universities.LiNeBrEaKWhile college enrollment among the state's 18- to 24-year- olds has improved since the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education released its first study in 2000, the group's latest report, which will be released today, ranks Florida near the bottom in college participation.LiNeBrEaKWorse, Florida got an F for affordability, even though the state's tuition rate is among the lowest in the nation. LiNeBrEaKThat's because the study emphasized not only the cost of tuition, but the percent of income families must devote, even after financial aid, to higher education.LiNeBrEaKRelying on federal and state statistics, the group concluded that Florida families spent 18 percent of their income to attend public four-year colleges in 2007, up from 12 percent in 1999. For two-year colleges, the amount was 25 percent, up from 18 percent.LiNeBrEaKFurther eroding Florida's affordability score was the relatively meager state investment in need-based financial aid, said center president Patrick Callan.LiNeBrEaK"While a lot of students get money from Bright Futures Scholarships, a lot of it goes to those who are going to college anyway," Callan said. "It doesn't reach the kids who need it the most."LiNeBrEaKThe report card also graded states on the percentage of young adults who earn a high school diploma, the percentage of residents who have a bachelor's degree, and the number of undergraduate degrees awarded relative to the number of students enrolled.LiNeBrEaKFlorida scored two C's and a B-plus, respectively, in those categories.LiNeBrEaKAdditional findings show that:LiNeBrEaK- Only 27 percent of Florida high school students take at least one upper-level science course, compared with 46 percent in the top states.LiNeBrEaK- Only 68 percent of freshmen at four-year colleges in Florida return for their sophomore year, compared with 82 percent in the top states.LiNeBrEaK- The proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds with a college degree in Florida is 27 percent, 10 percentage points less than the top states. Fifteen countries, including Japan, Korea, France and Canada, also surpass Florida on this measure.LiNeBrEaKSuch lackluster scores are an indication that the state's access to a competitive work force likely is diminishing, leading to a weaker economy, Callan said.LiNeBrEaK"This is not a problem you can act on after it exists," he said. "It's sort of like global warming. When the ice cap has melted, that's when you fully see the consequences, but it's too late to fix it."LiNeBrEaKWhile there is no "silver bullet" to correct all of Florida's education woes, Callan said policymakers should refrain from making things worse.LiNeBrEaKOne way to do that is to vote against Gov. Charlie Crist's recently announced plan to let state universities raise tuition by as much as 15 percent.LiNeBrEaK"It's a dangerous time to be taking another chunk of a family's income and saying, 'They'll just borrow to be able to afford it.'" Callan said.LiNeBrEaKBill Edmonds, spokesman for the group that oversees Florida's 11 state universities, strongly disagreed with the report's conclusions.LiNeBrEaK"I just can't get past the F for affordability," Edmonds said. "It's a nonsense response to the reality of higher-education opportunities in Florida."LiNeBrEaKOfficials at the state Department of Education declined to comment on the report, saying they needed more time to study it in detail.LiNeBrEaKTimes researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	SOUND ADVICE ABRUPTLY CLOSES AHEAD OF PLANS  		TAMPA BAY; HEARD IT HERE; Pg. 6B  	512 words  	The hedge fund that owns Sound Advice abruptly pulled the rug on customers and 50 employees Wednesday, shutting the chain down before the scheduled Sunday ending of its liquidation sale. Employees were sent home with no promise of getting their final two weeks' pay, vacation pay and retention bonus for staying to the finish. Customers who bought TVs or store fixtures but didn't take them home may have to put up a fight to get them. Schultze Asset Management plans to plunge Sound Advice's 70-store Canton, Mass., parent company, Tweeter Home Entertainment, into Chapter 7 liquidation. Reportedly, the chain has $14-million in unsold inventory. LiNeBrEaKRecruitment group names new leaderLiNeBrEaKThe Committee of One Hundred, a Tampa area business recruitment agency, has filled its executive managing director position after a 10-month vacancy. Keith A. Norden, senior vice president of the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance in Norfolk, Va., was chosen from more than 120 applicants. Norden's agency helped recruit 70 companies that generated more than 14,000 jobs in southeast Virginia. Though the Committee of One Hundred is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce, Norden will have greater autonomy than his predecessor, Myron Hughes, who resigned in February. After a reorganization this year, the Committee of One Hundred was placed under control of a cabinet of senior executives from the private and public sectors, chaired by TECO Energy president John Ramil. Norden starts Jan. 5.LiNeBrEaKMeetings address Progress nuke planLiNeBrEaKThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission will hold public meetings Thursday in Crystal River on Progress Energy's planned $17-billion nuclear project. The St. Petersburg utility wants to build two 1,100-megawatt Westinghouse AP1000 reactors. The meetings will be from 1 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. at the Florida National Guard Armory, 8551 W Venable St.LiNeBrEaKFPL breaks ground on solar-gas plantLiNeBrEaKFlorida Power and Light broke ground Tuesday on a solar-natural gas hybrid plant that, when completed in 2010, will make Florida the second-largest solar-energy-producing state. The plant will be the world's first hybrid solar plant, and the first utility-scale solar facility in Florida, the company said. The 75-megawatt Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center near Indiantown will use a collection of 180,000 mirrors spread over 500 acres to harness the sun's heat to create the steam needed to turn electric turbines. Natural gas will be used to supplement the solar energy when the sun isn't shining.LiNeBrEaKRegulators favor clean-car rulesLiNeBrEaKFlorida took a step Tuesday toward adopting California's stringent clean-car rules. The state Environmental Regulation Commission voted 6-1 in favor of the rule, which is designed to reduce tailpipe emissions of the greenhouse gases believed to cause climate change. Gov. Charlie Crist had pushed for the rule as part of his efforts to slash Florida's greenhouse gas emissions. However, some legislators hotly opposed the standard. The commission's decision will have to win legislative approval next year.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Clean Up TECO Agreement  	LYNN RINGENBER and DONALD MELLMAN  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 19  	667 words  	By LYNN RINGENBER and DONALD MELLMANLiNeBrEaKThe Tampa Bay Chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) is very concerned about an unspoken public health issue affecting the citizens of the Tampa Bay region, including the city of Tampa: the pollution from TECO's coal-powered plants.LiNeBrEaKWe suggest an inserted clause in the proposed franchise agreement between TECO and Tampa could reassure the public their health will not be further compromised over the life of the franchise. LiNeBrEaKBecause of the TECO power plants, the citizens of the Tampa Bay area may well be part of the American Lung Association's 2007 estimate of more than 54 million people who live in regions with harmful year-round levels of particulate matter. TECO has documented its concern in its 2005 white paper, "Vision and Commitment: an Environmental Report."LiNeBrEaKTECO's understanding of the situation and its acceptance of accountability and responsibility are evident when it writes of its efforts to take "significant steps to dramatically reduce its air emissions through a series of voluntary actions, including technology selections, a responsible fuel mix that takes into account price and availability impacts to its customers, and a significant capital expenditure program to add emissions controls."LiNeBrEaKImportantly, it continues: "Our values as a company mean that we must take a lead role in activities that protect the environment: the air, land, and water that comprise our service territory."LiNeBrEaKWe applaud TECO's good corporate citizenship in honoring its commitment to improving the public's health.LiNeBrEaKThe problem is this: TECO uses coal to power its Big Bend Power Station (100 percent coal-fired) and its H.L. Culbreath Bayside Power Station (60 percent coal and 40 percent natural gas).LiNeBrEaKFrom inhaling the particulate matter produced at these two stations, Tampa Bay area citizens are exposed to a wide range of adverse health conditions, including asthma, lung tissue damage, stroke, heart attack and premature death.LiNeBrEaKA 2000 study by Abt Associates estimated that particulate matter from coal plants is responsible for nearly 24,000 deaths each year in the U.S.LiNeBrEaKWhile coal is touted to be a cheap source of power, it becomes the most expensive when the adverse health effects are factored in.LiNeBrEaKCoal plants remain the single largest manufactured source of sulfur dioxide, mercury and toxic emissions and the second largest source of nitrogen oxide pollution. Moreover, once emitted, these compounds combine to form "secondary pollutants," such as ozone and particulate matter that pose an equally significant threat to public health."LiNeBrEaKTampa Bay's proximity to the Gulf, with its rising sea levels from global warming, makes us primary victims of these problems.LiNeBrEaKThe debate over the proposed franchise agreement between the city of Tampa and TECO offers an opportunity to codify a commitment to improve Tampa Bay's public health.LiNeBrEaKWe would like a clause inserted that states these health concerns and formalizes willingness, over the life of the franchise, for the parties to work together to improve the local environment by consideration of any progressive changes in technology that become available.LiNeBrEaKThose who live, exercise and enjoy the beauty on Davis Islands, Harbour Island and Bayshore can literally and figuratively see (and breathe) the health problems in the plumes from the stacks of TECO's Big Bend and Bayside plants.LiNeBrEaKHowever, all the people of Tampa Bay are directly affected by TECO's use of coal. Our local economy is threatened by the resulting burden to our health care system and the health of the work force.LiNeBrEaKThis issue is so important to our citizens that Tampa and TECO leadership must formally recognize and work in concert to minimize the adverse public health impact of this franchise.LiNeBrEaKLynn Ringenberg, MD, is president of Physicians for Social Responsibility - Tampa Bay.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	Nuclear cleanup to cost billions: State-funded study puts almost $10 billion price on effort at West Valley  	Brian Nearing, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	497 words  	Dec. 3--While it will cost taxpayers billions to clean out dangerous radioactive waste from a defunct nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, storing it there would cost billions more over the centuries -- and risk contamination of Lake Erie. LiNeBrEaKThat was the conclusion of a state-funded report on the 3,300-acre West Valley nuclear site, closed since the early 1970s and once the nation's only commercial center for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel.LiNeBrEaKReleased Tuesday, the report comes during a growing national debate about stepping up nuclear power as a way to cut the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Critics continue to question the fate of spent fuel, which is dangerous for thousands of years.LiNeBrEaKThe report by Cambridge-based Synapse Energy Economics claimed it will cost nearly $10 billion to clean radioactive waste from West Valley over the next 60 years and ship it to a federal dump that does not exist yet.LiNeBrEaKBut leaving the waste where it is -- about 30 miles from Buffalo-- would cost up to $13 billion to keep contained over the next 1,000 years. The report said the task could be technologically difficult in an area prone to erosion. It could cost up to $27 billion if radiation escapes the area a century from now and gets into creeks that flow into Lake Erie, endangering the drinking water supply.LiNeBrEaK"No generation has the right to impose such terrible hazards on future generations," said Barbara Warren, executive director of the Albany-based Citizens Environmental Coalition, one of the grassroots groups that sought the study.LiNeBrEaKWest Valley operated from 1966 to 1972, when it was closed as unsafe and inefficient. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the U.S. Department of Energy are partners in the decontamination and decommissioning of the site.LiNeBrEaKThe cleanup, which was authorized in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, has been long delayed. The federal government issued its first suggested cleanup report in 1996, and followed that up in 2005. Another report was issued last week by the Energy Department,LiNeBrEaKThis latest analysis recommended a phased shutdown, a process that will take 30 years. It leaves many key issues open, including which government is responsible for cleanup, and where the radioactive waste would be shipped.LiNeBrEaKThe report was paid for by a $90,000 state grant arranged by Sen. Cathy Young, an Olean Republican whose district includes West Valley.LiNeBrEaKThe federal report on West Valley can be found online at http://www.westvalleyeis.com	HAZARDOUS WASTE (94%); NUCLEAR WASTE (92%); NUCLEAR FUEL MFG (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENERGY RESEARCH (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); LAKES (77%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (73%); GRANTS and GIFTS (72%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (71%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); POLITICAL DEBATES (70%); RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT (66%); US PRESIDENTS (63%)  	NEW YORK STATE ENERGY RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (65%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%)  			General  	JIMMY CARTER (53%)  	ALBANY, NY, USA (90%); BUFFALO, NY, USA (79%) LAKE ERIE (91%); NEW YORK, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 3, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Times Union   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081203-AL-Nuclear-cleanup-to-cost-billions-1203  	AL

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	December 3, 2008 Wednesday 	OPINION: Break an Egg  	Bill Britt, St. Clair News-Aegis, Pell City, Ala.  	COMMENTARY  	739 words  	Dec. 3--In last week's editorial I was trying to make a satirical point when I wrote that incoming college freshmen would know, "That everyone should get a hit and get on base, that America is no better or worse than any other Western country, that all religions are valid and that there is more than one way to get to heaven, that global warming is going to kill them, that SUVs, meat, guns, states like Alabama and Sara Palin are bad."LiNeBrEaKMy meaning was that media and left-leaning educational systems are teaching our children things that are contrary to our American history and best traditions. LiNeBrEaKI am sorry if that was not made clear.LiNeBrEaKIn his book Story of the New World, published in 1565, Girolamo Benzoni, wrote: "Columbus was dining with many Spanish nobles when one of them said: 'Sir Christopher, even if your lordship had not discovered the Indies, there would have been, here in Spain which is a country abundant with great men knowledgeable in cosmography and literature, one who would have started a similar adventure with the same result.' Columbus did not respond to these words but asked for a whole egg to be brought to him. He placed it on the table and said: 'My lords, I will lay a wager with any of you that you are unable to make this egg stand on its end like I will do without any kind of help or aid.' They all tried without success and when the egg returned to Columbus, he tapped it gently on the table breaking it slightly and, with this, the egg stood on its end. All those present were confounded and understood what he meant: that once the feat has been done, anyone knows how to do it."LiNeBrEaKThe story of the egg of Columbus or Columbus' egg is use to illustrate that an idea or discovery may seem simple, or even easy, after the fact.LiNeBrEaKGreat ideas or discoveries are generally preceded by great effort. Hard work, more often than chance, yields the "Viola" moment.LiNeBrEaKIn his new book OUTLIERS, The Story of Success, Malcolm Gladwell looks at the underlying circumstances that lead to success.LiNeBrEaK"It is not the brightest who succeed," Gladwell writes. "Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities--and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them."LiNeBrEaKGladwell, the author of The Tipping Point and Blink, has offered up some interesting looks at social psychology, mass marketing and even the genre of self-help.LiNeBrEaKIn his new book, he does a good job of looking at the underlying elements of success.LiNeBrEaKMore than ever, we live in an instant-message, digitally-mastered, faux reality, American idol, overnight-success orientated society. Fame and instant accomplishment is not just hyped as a goal but is given virtue. Guitar Hero, the game, has replaced hours learning to play cords and scales. Lives carelessly lived as if they will soon be plucked from obscurity and placed of the stage of celebrity. It is no great mystery that many of today's youth are addicted to any number of drugs and distractions. If our young believe that success is easily achieved then disappointment becomes a pain in need of numbing.LiNeBrEaKYears ago, I had a friend who had been very successful in the music business. He had discovered some of the great talents of the 60s, 70s and 80s.LiNeBrEaKOne day he said to me, "Bill, you know, the opportunity bus stops on a corner near some very talented person everyday but very few ever get on."LiNeBrEaKHe went on the say that some were afraid to ride the bus, some thought that the bus was not for them and others wanted to wait for a better bus. The smart ones he said were the ones who had prepared themselves for the ride and those were the ones who hopped on the bus gladly.LiNeBrEaKAs the man said, I worked very hard for 20 years to become an overnight success.LiNeBrEaKTalent is an inherited ability, perfecting one's talent is hard work, succeeding with what we have is where opportunity meets readiness, that is the gift.LiNeBrEaKWe need to provide our childern with good eggs.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Waxman will steer to left: L.A. congressman to lead powerful House energy and commerce panel  	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	478 words  	Dec. 2--These days, "change" is all the rage in Washington. While relative newcomer President-elect Barack Obama popularized the idea, it may be an old hand who demonstrates it most forcefully. LiNeBrEaKLos Angeles Rep. Henry Waxman reportedly surprised even many insiders when he was elected by secret ballot of House Democrats to head the powerful Energy and Commerce committee, ousting Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, the House's longest-serving member. This was no mere changing of the guard. Dingell, more moderate, pragmatic and a defender of Detroit's auto industry, often warred with Waxman, one of the House's farthest-left liberals, who has served since 1974.LiNeBrEaKThe leadership change should bring quick and dramatic action in areas under Waxman's purview, such as global warming, alternative fuels and health care, which is to say vastly more government interference, mandates and imposed costs.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps for fear of worsening the economy, President-elect Obama already has sent signals that he may not move quite as quickly or as far left as the left end of his party may have expected. He could be tested soon by the zealous Waxman, who now is in a position to more aggressively push his government-interventionist preferences. Waxman decades ago worked to create the Environmental Protection Agency and advanced auto emission and anti-pollution regulations while expanding Medicare.LiNeBrEaKCongress toyed last year with cap-and-trade global warming legislation, a proposal that allows companies to meet emissions targets through "trade," but which is estimated to produce a cumulative loss to the U.S. gross domestic product of $4. 8 trillion by 2030, as Heritage Foundation analysis found. Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy with the Competitive Enterprise Institute free-market think tank, says Waxman's cap-and-trade bill introduced last month is much worse, and "would send us back to the Stone Age."LiNeBrEaKThere may be dispute over how much damage such government interference can do, and even whether global warming poses a threat. But there's no dispute about Waxman's intentions.

The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Security priorities: There is a lot of work ahead for President-elect Obama's national security team, including recent rival Sen. Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state nominee  	The Baltimore Sun  	COMMENTARY  	727 words  	Dec. 2--The members of President-elect Barack Obama's new national security team are talented, opinionated and diverse in their views.LiNeBrEaKThere is Sen. Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, who fiercely criticized Mr. Obama for his foreign affairs naivete, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who once expressed alarm at the president-elect's setting of a deadline for Iraq withdrawal and retired Gen. James L. Jones, the former NATO commander, who frequently challenged his civilian bosses. That's all right with the man who will lead them. He knows that White House staff can "get wrapped up in group think." That was a chief flaw of President Bush's inner circle, which helped lead the U.S. into the Iraq war.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama welcomes vigorous debate, and after eight years of "group think," the American public should too. LiNeBrEaKWith his limited foreign policy experience, Mr. Obama is sure to benefit from having strong personalities and strong opinions around him. Facing an array of tough problems -- including war, international recession, genocide and global warming -- there is clearly a need to think beyond a one-dimensional obsession with terrorism when framing U.S. foreign policy. Here are five corners of the world that deserve immediate attention from Mr. Obama's national security team:LiNeBrEaKIraq: The Obama administration should prepare a strategy for swift withdrawal of most U.S. troops from combat in Iraq by mid-2010. Training forces should leave before the Dec. 31, 2011 deadline set in a new agreement with the Iraqi government. At the same time, American diplomats should work aggressively to mediate political and economic differences among the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, the three principal power groups in the nation. And if the Iraqis want a small contingent of military advisers on hand, some accommodation should be made.LiNeBrEaKAfghanistan: Troop reductions in Iraq should mean more U.S. forces here, but the administration needs to firm up its strategy for fighting a resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida forces. The effort should be as much economic as military. Serious infrastructure and business investments are needed to demonstrate the benefits of democracy and persuade tribal leaders to support the central government.LiNeBrEaKIndia-Pakistan: The Obama team's anti-terrorism strategy should be centered on Pakistan. That would defuse tensions with India and improve the work of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The Pakistani government should receive continued support to avoid economic collapse, but that aid should be tied to improved military cooperation and assistance to uproot al-Qaida from the country's northeast tribal areas.LiNeBrEaKIsrael-Palestine: Elections in Israel and the Palestinian territories early next year will influence how the Obama administration approaches one of the most intractable international problems of the past half-century. But there are at least two issues related to any peace agreement that would benefit from a fresh perspective and immediate planning from the Obama team. Israeli settlement expansion should be stopped and the areas adjacent to Jerusalem reimagined to account for a handful of settlements that have become exurbs of Jerusalem. A compensation package for Palestinian refugees should be drafted with an economic development initiative that would help relocate them from rundown camps in nearby countries and provide them with new housing.LiNeBrEaKIran: The ruling clerics in Tehran must be persuaded to halt the country's nuclear development program. What that will take is anyone's guess, since Iran rejected the last incentive package offered with support from the Bush administration. It's time for face-to-face diplomacy with the Iranians, but Tehran should understand that it's in its interest to show some measure of goodwill and serious intentions to end the decades-long standoff. Any move toward Tehran by the U.S. administration should keep Russia in the loop and preferably as an ally.

The Boston Globe 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Letters  		LETTERS; Pg. A18  	637 words  	Let's not turnLiNeBrEaKSomalia piratesLiNeBrEaKinto liberal causeLiNeBrEaKIN JAMES Carroll's Nov. 24 op-ed "What the pirates say," a disservice has been rendered to Boston Globe readers. Carroll romanticizes the causes for terrorism on the high seas with his hyperbolic and unfounded David-vs.-Goliath argument. He needs to go back to his history books and study piracy in Africa. It has existed prior to the American Revolution, and was the first foreign policy crisis post-revolution America had to face.LiNeBrEaKIn Michael B. Oren's "Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East: 1776 to the Present," African piracy was discussed as it pertained to the Barbary wars. At the time, many Americans held Carroll's view, and paid the pirates their requested "tribute," which amounted to 20 percent of the 1790 federal income, with no results. LiNeBrEaKThe end to piracy came not through negotiation but through a demonstration of force. This was the impetus for the creation of our navy as well as the beginning of American dominance on the high seas.LiNeBrEaKWithout doubt, every African country has been scarred by infighting and past colonial abuses; however, Carroll's warnings of global warming, "bio-piracy," and the "corporate disregard for the common good" are not excuses for terrorism. These pirates are not Robin Hood.LiNeBrEaKSamuel M. AshnerLiNeBrEaKBostonLiNeBrEaKSimple solutionLiNeBrEaKto imbalance in healthcare costsLiNeBrEaKTHE HIGHER payments received by Massachusetts General and other major hospitals for the same procedures provided at lower prices by local hospitals are, to an economist, a straightforward problem with a simple solution. This type of problem occurs whenever the decision maker is different from the payer.LiNeBrEaKIn this case, the decision maker is the patient, whose out-of-pocket costs are the same regardless of where the treatment is provided. The insurer or the government is the payer. Not surprisingly, the patient, economically indifferent to where he or she is treated, chooses the hospital where he or she expects to receive the best care.LiNeBrEaKThe solution is to charge significant copays generally and to charge even higher copays for the more expensive hospitals. Faced with a bill for an extra $200 or $300 for the privilege of being treated at Brigham and Women's, the patient might decide that for the routine hip replacement or hernia repair, MetroWest Medical Center was just fine. For the more cutting-edge procedures, the patient might consider that the Brigham was worth the extra money.LiNeBrEaKEmployers, public and private, need to insist on healthcare plans with copays that represent significantly higher out-of-pocket costs to the patients at the high-end hospitals. This would align the economic interests of the decision maker and the payer. Mass. General and the Brigham would find their facilities underutilized for the routine procedures, and their pricing would fall into line.LiNeBrEaKPhilip Saunders Jr.LiNeBrEaKWestonLiNeBrEaKThe writer is principal of a firm that provides economic and financial analysis.LiNeBrEaKHow the SATLiNeBrEaKdidn't changeLiNeBrEaKmy life (phew)LiNeBrEaKRE "WHAT an SAT score doesn't say" (Op-ed, Nov. 27): In 1958, my high school guidance counselor informed me that, based upon my poor performance on the SATs, I had no aptitude for medicine or dentistry, and that I would probably fail if I attempted to pursue my dream in college. Nearly 50 years later I still think about that day and wonder what might have been if I had listened to him.LiNeBrEaKI have never felt that the SATs offered any real insight into one's ability to succeed either in college or in life's adventure.LiNeBrEaKI also wonder how many lives have been changed or how many dreams have never been realized because too much emphasis had been placed upon an examination of questionable value.LiNeBrEaKBarry S.

The Boston Globe 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Brazil vows to cut deforestation in half  	REUTERS  	FOREIGN; Pg. A3  	222 words  	DAILY BRIEFINGLiNeBrEaKBRASILIA - Brazil pledged yesterday to cut the rate at which it was destroying its Amazon forest in half over the next decade to help combat global warming. LiNeBrEaKSetting its first such target after years of global criticism, Brazil will aim to reduce clearing of the world's largest rain forest to an annual 2,260 square miles by 2018, about half the recent rate.LiNeBrEaK"This plan improves Brazil's image; we'll have more moral authority internationally," Environment Minister Carlos Minc told reporters after a launching ceremony attended by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.LiNeBrEaKBrazil wants to become a major voice in global environmental issues and hopes the plan will help allay criticism it has done too little to fight burning and clearing by loggers, farmers and ranchers.LiNeBrEaKAmazon destruction makes Brazil one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases because trees release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when they're cut down or burned.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement of the new plan, more than a decade after Brazil said it would adopt targets, coincided with the opening of a United Nations climate conference in Poznan, Poland.LiNeBrEaKSome conservationists said the plan marked an important change in the government's attitude from blaming rich countries to taking action.LiNeBrEaKBut critics said it was not ambitious enough and had been too slow coming.

The Boston Globe 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday  Correction Appended  	US backing of wind farm could come this week  	Bina Venkataraman GLOBE CORRESPONDENT  	METRO; Pg. A1  	1003 words  	THIRD EDITIONLiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration is expected to issue as early as Friday a favorable final environmental review of the nation's first offshore wind farm project, clearing the way for Cape Wind to obtain a federal lease to erect 130 wind turbines in Nantucket Sound.LiNeBrEaKNicholas Pardi, a spokesman for the Minerals Management Service, said last week that the agency, part of the Interior Department, is planning to release its findings "by the end of the year." Supporters of the project who have been told of the agency's timetable said a favorable review should come in the next few weeks and possibly on Dec. 5. LiNeBrEaKInterior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne would then have to wait 30 days to make the decision official and award the lease allowing the project to be located in federal waters. The supporters, as well the leader of the main opposition group, said they believe the administration wants this accomplished before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20. LiNeBrEaKFinal state backing could follow early next year, said a spokesman for the state's Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, culminating the developer's long struggle to gain approval for what seemed like a green power pipe dream when it was announced seven years ago: A giant wind farm anchored in the waters off Cape Cod.LiNeBrEaK"This is important not only for Massachusetts but for the nation as a whole," said Jack Clarke, director of public policy and government relations for Mass Audubon, a conservation group that came out in support of the project after evaluating its impact on wildlife.LiNeBrEaKMark Rodgers, communications director for Cape Wind, said the company predicts the $1 billion project could be operating by 2011, though opponents have said they will go to court to try to block it. The developer expects the turbines to produce about 170 megawatts of power a year, equivalent to almost three-quarters of the average electricity demand for the Cape and Islands.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal from a once little-known company has endured years of environmental review, several rounds of political maneuvering by the likes of Senator Edward M. Kennedy and former governor Mitt Romney, and strong opposition from a group of homeowners on the Cape and Islands. They worry that the 440-foot-high turbines, visible on the horizon, would mar their views, depress property values, and deter tourists. But the project has gained momentum as the public's appetite has grown for renewable energy to help forestall global warming. The turbines would be placed about five to eight miles from the Cape coast.LiNeBrEaKThe Minerals Management Service signaled its inclination to approve the project when it issued a draft environmental review in January, which concluded that it would cause little harm to migratory birds and fish and have a "minor" impact on tourism. The agency solicited comments on the draft report from the public and from state and other federal agencies, and they will be considered in the final environmental impact statement.LiNeBrEaKLast month, the US Fish and Wildlife Service forwarded a report to the minerals agency saying that the project would not jeopardize the survival of two bird species protected under the Endangered Species Act, piping plovers and roseate terns.LiNeBrEaKAside from the final environmental review, Cape Wind cannot get its lease until the agency finalizes federal regulations governing offshore wind projects, scheduled for completion by the end of December.LiNeBrEaKAt the state level, the Office of Coastal Zone Management must still approve the project, and Cape Wind is seeking a "composite" permit that will wrap several remaining local permits into one, quicker approval process, said Robert Keough, spokesman for the energy and environmental affairs agency. He said that these steps could be concluded "weeks" into the new year.LiNeBrEaKBut the project is expected to face new obstacles, including the financial crisis.LiNeBrEaK"Now is not a good time to raise money for anything," said Ethan Zindler, head of North American research for New Energy Finance, a company that sells research to renewable energy investors. "But the good news about that project is that it is going to potentially provide a massive amount of clean energy in a very tight market."LiNeBrEaKMassachusetts' requirement that a certain percentage of the state's electricity come from renewable energy ensures wind power will have a market, said Zindler, and may help Cape Wind attract financiers despite the economy.LiNeBrEaKPeople on all sides predict legal challenges as well. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, which opposes Cape Wind, is already pointing to what it sees as flaws in the federal approval process. The group believes the outgoing administration has overlooked environmental and aviation safety concerns in a rush to approve the project. The environmental review may be issued before the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration have completed their final studies of the project, but their analyses of Cape Wind's impact on navigation and air safety could be incorporated into the terms of the lease.LiNeBrEaKThe Minerals Management Service "is trying to shortcut the review process and pressure other agencies to get this approved under the Bush Administration," said Audra Parker, the alliance's executive director. "We are prepared to do what it takes to defeat this project, and if that requires litigation, we will do that."LiNeBrEaKOthers believe the decision is coming too late.LiNeBrEaK"The big picture failure to get this zero-emissions renewable generation online in New England is a real shame," said Seth Kaplan of the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group. "It's hard to find a silver lining to that cloud that we have allowed this much time to go by."LiNeBrEaKFrom Cape Wind's perspective, the financial crisis aside, the wind is blowing in the project's favor. "We're very encouraged," said Rodgers. "With the incoming Obama administration, you are seeing that people link our energy and environmental challenges directly to our economic challenges."

The Daily Times (Farmington, New Mexico)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Exploring energy options is good for many reasons  	The Daily Times, Farmington, N.M.  	COMMENTARY  	406 words  	Dec. 2--Energy independence has become a hot topic for dinner table conversations as Americans have faced ballooning gas prices and tension with the oil-rich Middle East in the past few years. LiNeBrEaKBut with a push for more oil and gas drilling should come a responsibility to our health and our environment.LiNeBrEaKThat's why it is exciting to see new technology emerging from our state.LiNeBrEaKNew Mexico Tech scientists are working with ConocoPhillips on a project that involves injecting millions of tons of carbon dioxide beneath the earth's coal beds, otherwise known as sequestration. As the CO2 is forced in, it pushes natural gas out of the coal, enabling producers to harvest it.LiNeBrEaKThe project is being funded by a $15 million grant from the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKThese project sites are called injection wells and scientists are testing them near Navajo City.LiNeBrEaKScientist Red Grigg is working to perfect this injection technique, which he started using 35 years ago to increase oil well production.LiNeBrEaKThis technology not only could help natural gas producers, but it's also a way for power plants to dispose of carbon dioxide, which makes up about 15 percent of power plant emissions.LiNeBrEaKWith two power plants in the area and possibly a third on the way, this is good news for Four Corners residents and their health concerns.LiNeBrEaKWe hope scientists are able to make this technology a viable option for the energy industry.LiNeBrEaKWe realize there always are issues such as cost effectiveness thatLiNeBrEaKhave to be worked out, but it's an encouraging sign that more and more technology seems to be emerging from our ever-pressing energy concerns. It's also encouraging to see the Department of Energy willing to fund such projects, as it's almost daily that we hear about global warming, species disappearing and ice caps melting -- all occurrences that could affect us in some way.LiNeBrEaKWhile the jury still is out on the causes, we must turn to technology to help us keep our planet sustainable. There's only one earth and we must do what we can to keep it turning.

The Denver Post 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Letters To The Editor  		Pg. B-11  	758 words  	Terror in India is a reminder about U.S. securityLiNeBrEaKThe terrorist attacks in Mumbai are evidence that radical Islam has not abandoned its intent to target Westerners, including Americans and Britons. They are a wakeup call to the Western world that a strong antiterror defense is absolutely essential, as the catastrophe in India graphically illustrates. The fact that more than 12 terrorist attacks have occurred in India since 2005 is a case in point.LiNeBrEaKWhat has the incident in Mumbai to with America? It has everything in the world to do with it. If Islamic radicals can penetrate the antiterror defense in India, is it unreasonable to believe that such an attack could occur in the U.S? LiNeBrEaKSince 9/11, liberals in Congress and the mainstream media have attempted to excoriate President Bush on the issue of electronic surveillance. The fact that no terror events have occurred on U.S. soil since 9/11 is a credit to Bush for doing whatever is necessary to defend our nation from another catastrophic attack.LiNeBrEaKIf the Mumbai incident serves any useful purpose, it is as a reminder that a strong antiterror defense is not an option. It is an absolute necessity, especially in time of war.LiNeBrEaKBrian Stuckey, DenverLiNeBrEaK"Militants"? "Attackers"? No, these were terroristsLiNeBrEaKRe: "Battle shifts to Jewish site," Nov. 28 news story.LiNeBrEaKYour articles refer to the perpetrators of these atrocities as "militants" and "attackers." What ever happened to the use of the word "terrorist"?LiNeBrEaKPeople who picket and block intersections and shout down speakers are "militants." People who perpetrate attacks on public places and against the unfortunate individuals who just happen to be in those places are terrorists. What transpired at nine places in Mumbai were acts of terror. They were atrocities; they most certainly were not acts of militancy.LiNeBrEaKIf these atrocities were not acts of terrorism, please instruct your readers on what level of violence, mayhem and murder is required to reach the level of behavior you would consider terrorism.LiNeBrEaKFred Nadel, WestminsterLiNeBrEaKMore reasons to not leave your car idlingLiNeBrEaKRe: "Cars left running may draw warning," Nov. 27 news story.LiNeBrEaKYour article gives only theft as a reason not to leave your car running. In fact, an idling vehicle causes many more problems: local pollution, wasting a non-renewable resource (petroleum), wastes your money and causes global climate change. Actually, with today's modern vehicles, which have fuel injection and electronic control, a one-minute warm up is sufficient to get rolling and five minutes on the road are adequate before hitting 60 mph highway speeds. So, no warm-up needed.LiNeBrEaKAlso, I heard this on "Car Talk," so it must be true.LiNeBrEaKJoel Leventhal, LakewoodLiNeBrEaK---------------------------------------- Presidential picks based on political ideologyLiNeBrEaKRe: "To the victor go the appointees?" Nov. 28 editorial.LiNeBrEaKI find it very interesting that you strongly support President-elect Barack Obama's right and desire to make appointments to government agency jobs based on ideology and policy. As you say, elections have consequences. The president has a right to appoint, and change people, based on their ideology.LiNeBrEaKMy question for you is why you wrote so negatively about President Bush when he fired lawyers from the Department of Justice during his second term. Doesn't he have the same right as Obama to have people in jobs who agree with his ideology?LiNeBrEaKWhy am I not surprised at this dramatic inconsistency? Another example of Bush bashing and Obama worship!LiNeBrEaKRick Hale, Highlands RanchLiNeBrEaKPut more pressure on the energy companiesLiNeBrEaKLately, many states have passed legislation requiring utility companies to increase their renewable energy sources. They have all passed, notably without objection from the utility companies themselves.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, these initiatives require only a certain percentage of renewables in a certain timeframe. A case must be made to rapidly advance these initiatives across the country, with a higher percentage to achieve. We cannot continue to let our energy providers use "unclean" energy sources that weaken our environment. Furthermore, we can't rely on these initiatives for long, as they merely take the age-old wait-and-see attitude.LiNeBrEaKWe must start mandating our power companies to decrease their reliance on coal and oil, and instead produce their energy with a majority of clean and renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKWe simply cannot wait one week for a solution when we know our answer is achievable tomorrow.LiNeBrEaKJin Alexander Tsuchiya,LiNeBrEaKDenver	TERRORISM (91%); SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK (90%); RELIGION (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); MUSLIMS and ISLAM (90%); COUNTERTERRORISM (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (60%); SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY (53%); MUMBAI TERRORIST ATTACKS (78%)  					MICHAEL MCMAHON (68%); GEORGE W BUSH (56%)  	MUMBAI, INDIA (91%); DENVER, CO, USA (79%) COLORADO, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); INDIA (94%); UNITED KINGDOM (73%)  	December 2, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  							Letter  									
Jordan Times (Amman)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Eco-labels for tourism facilities, beaches introduced to Aqaba  	Dalya Dajani, Jordan Times, Amman  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	998 words  	Dec. 2--AMMAN -- A global programme recognising hotels and coastlines with high eco-friendly standards and practices within their daily operations has spurred several enterprises in Aqaba to aspire to that challenge.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Key and Blue Flag initiatives, two Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) programmes, were recently introduced to the southern port city by the Jordan Royal Marine Conservation Society (JREDS).LiNeBrEaKThe country's marine environmental authority, which became an FEE member in June, was appointed to implement the programmes here. LiNeBrEaKJREDS Executive Director Fadi Sharaiha said the initiative, which encourages eco-friendly standards at both hotels and beaches, is an important part of the developing tourism industry in Aqaba.LiNeBrEaK"We want to encourage the hospitality industry to step up environment-friendly strategies within their daily operations and improve the quality of the coastal environment too," he told The Jordan Times over the phone.LiNeBrEaK"It makes good business for them and promotes tourism while also protecting the environment from the increasing investments here," Sharaiha added.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Key programme is an eco-label for tourism facilities that aims to contribute to prevention of climate change and sustainable tourism by awarding and promoting good initiatives. It aims to change the practices and behaviours of tourism actors including enterprises, authorities guests and local communities, and to involve them in increasing their responsibility towards their own environment.LiNeBrEaKThese facilities have to show that they have adopted environmentally sound practices and strategies within their operations in line with standardised international criteria, which are mandatory in each country, as well as more specialised national criteria, adjusted to national legislation, infrastructure and culture.LiNeBrEaKThe criteria focus on environmental management, technical demands, and the involvement of guests, staff and suppliers, and cover fields such as water, waste, energy, environmental management, use of chemicals and open spaces, and food and beverages.LiNeBrEaKThe award is voluntarily applied for and granted for one year at a time, during which control visits are made to check that certain standards are upheld and that all criteria are met.LiNeBrEaKThis is the first time the programme has been introduced in the Middle East, with JREDS appointed as the national organisation certified to award the eco-label in the region.LiNeBrEaKSharaiha said JREDS has already approached several hotels in Aqaba and three hotels have expressed interest.LiNeBrEaK"Their applications are in the process of being audited and hopefully by springtime we are going to announce the first two or three hotels awarded the Green Key eco-label in Jordan," he added.LiNeBrEaKMany major hotel chains around the world have been going green by adopting economically and environmentally sound practices and management schemes. These include saving energy and water to minimise the impact on the environment while also reducing energy costs. For example, some hotels have begun providing guests with the option of reusing their bath towels instead of washing daily, reducing laundry cycles and water usage.LiNeBrEaKSharaiha said these practices are just one avenue for trying to promote awareness of the environment and it is also a good marketing tool that attracts selective tourists, who also care about the environment.LiNeBrEaKJREDS will also be implementing the Blue Flag programme, a voluntary eco-label awarded to beaches and marinas that embrace high standards of environmental protection within their site management and encourage similar attitudes from the public.LiNeBrEaKThe award is based on 27 criteria for beaches and 16 criteria for marinas dealing with water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management and safety and services.LiNeBrEaKAs the campaign's managing organisation, FEE, along with national and international controllers, carries out checks during the Blue Flag season to ensure that the criteria are being met.LiNeBrEaKIf problems are found, the flag is withdrawn until they are fixed and if the problem is very serious or is not fixed within a given period of time, then the flag is withdrawn for the rest of the season.LiNeBrEaKThe fact that the Blue Flag is awarded a season at a time ensures countries work hard at sustaining these conditions.LiNeBrEaKShariaha said they are looking at one hotel beach and another area to be certified as first Blue Flag in the region, but are still in the process of developing national criteria for the programme which he expects will be completed at the end of the year.LiNeBrEaKHe noted that the Aqaba Development Corporation is interested in sponsoring the Blue Flag.LiNeBrEaKMore than 3,200 beaches and marinas in 37 countries have been awarded the eco-label.LiNeBrEaKAnother programme slated for implementation is FEE's Eco-schools, which works to raise awareness about sustainability issues through various academic subjects and activities at schools.LiNeBrEaKStudents learn about issues such as climate change, litter and waste, biodiversity, water and healthy living as part of the programme which involves teachers, students and their parents.LiNeBrEaKSharaiha said the programme will provide students with a more hands-on and holistic approach to environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKEstablished in 1981, FEE is an international umbrella organisation that promotes sustainable development through environmental education. It currently runs five programmes: Blue Flag, Green Key, Eco-schools, LEAF and Young Reporters for the Environment. It has 64 member organisations in 56 countries Europe, North and South America, Africa and Oceania.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	U.S. grant will help China's new buildings go green  	By Les Blumenthal, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	717 words  	WASHINGTON _ A $518,000 grant that will be awarded to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory on Wednesday could have potentially important consequences in the effort to control global warming amid the continuing political fallout from the Kyoto climate change treaty.LiNeBrEaKBy 2015, the World Bank estimates, half the world's building construction will be in China. Over the next 20 years, China will build 430 billion square feet of floor space, or the equivalent of 20,000 to 50,000 new skyscrapers, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of New York-based McKinsey and Co., a global management consulting firm. LiNeBrEaKPacific Northwest National Laboratory will be helping China create more energy-efficient buildings.LiNeBrEaKBuildings, both commercial and residential, consume about one-third of all the energy used in China. Meanwhile, between one and two new coal plants come online in China every week, releasing carbon dioxide and other gases that are borne by upper level winds across the Pacific to the West Coast of the United States.LiNeBrEaKIn an effort to control its greenhouse gas emissions, China introduced green building codes two years ago, requiring all cities to cut their building energy use in half by 2010 and by 65 percent by 2020. The codes involve such things as lighting, insulation, heating and air conditioning.LiNeBrEaKOnly about 4 percent of China's existing buildings meet the codes.LiNeBrEaKThe grant announced Wednesday would allow PNNL to help train construction companies and inspectors in two Chinese cities about green construction. Eventually, a handbook will be created and distributed throughout China.LiNeBrEaK"China is committed to reducing its energy consumption," said Bin Shui, PNNL's project manager for the two-year pilot project.LiNeBrEaKPNNL is one of 10 Department of Energy laboratories. Headquartered in Richland, Wash., near the Hanford nuclear reservation, PNNL has about 4,200 employees. It also operates a marine research facility in Sequim, Wash., and has offices in Seattle, Tacoma, Wash., Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKAmong the projects the lab is working on are underground carbon sequestration, advanced fuel-efficient transportation and improved energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings.LiNeBrEaKShui said China's new construction codes compare favorably with those in the United States.LiNeBrEaK"While these are noble goals, in actuality it can take a long time," said Merydydd Evans, who is also working on the grant for the lab, adding that new buildings can be 50 percent more fuel efficient than existing ones. "This is not rocket science. It's a lot easier to build in efficiencies in the beginning."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKThe grant is part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which was launched by the Bush administration three years ago to accelerate the development and use of green energy technologies. Its members include the United States, China, India, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea.LiNeBrEaKThree of those countries _ the United States, China and India _ never signed the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels.LiNeBrEaK"We are bringing the Chinese and Indians to the table," said Griffin Thompson, a senior energy adviser at the State Department and program manager for the Asia-Pacific Partnership. "This isn't about U.N. negotiators and arcane texts. China already has the building codes. Enforcement and compliance have always been the Achilles' heel."LiNeBrEaKEfforts to control greenhouse gases don't get anywhere without China and India, and China appears "very much" committed to implementing its building codes, Thompson said.LiNeBrEaK"We are trying to figure out how to do things without the U.N.," Thompson said.LiNeBrEaKSen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said the PNNL grant was significant because, in lieu of Kyoto, the administration had been seeking agreements directly with China about global warming.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first agreement," Cantwell said.

The Marin Independent Journal (Novato, California)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Saving public services must be highest priority  	The Marin Independent Journal, Novato, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	533 words  	Dec. 2--MARIN supervisors need to be extra cautious about launching new, costly initiatives.LiNeBrEaKThe recent projection by county officials that an additional $6 million will have to be cut should come as no surprise given the dismal state of California's economy -- and the widening state budget deficit. LiNeBrEaKState lawmakers' repeated failure to come to grips with the deepening budget crisis should prompt county officials to be especially prudent in their decisions. The county's fiscal outlook also promises many painful choices.LiNeBrEaKAny state budget-balancing strategy likely will include cuts in county funding and cutbacks in state-funded services.LiNeBrEaKCounty Administrator Matthew Hymel already has taken some important steps, including a broad hiring freeze, putting capital projects on hold and temporarily halting the tapping of the county's $15 million 2006-07 windfall, which supervisors set aside for specific capital improvements.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, the county is committed to pay raises in a three-year contract it reached with county workers and a federal requirement that it set aside millions to cover current and future retiree health benefits.LiNeBrEaKThe combination of cuts and obligations is not painting a pretty picture.LiNeBrEaKCounty supervisors should focus on maintaining basic services and keeping the local budget knife away from people who depend on health-care and social services.LiNeBrEaKHymel said he hopes to shield programs that have the greatest impact on local residents from budget cuts.LiNeBrEaKTheLiNeBrEaKcounty has gone through one round of layoffs and officials are not ruling out more. They are hopeful they can avoid layoffs by not filling vacancies when they occur.LiNeBrEaKLast January, when the county budget outlook did not look half as bad as it does today, supervisors talked about having to evaluate future spending initiatives through the prism of the strong prospect of deeper cuts.LiNeBrEaKWe're not sure they have followed through with that cautionary approach.LiNeBrEaKThey need to -- in public -- scrutinize every new or existing program, even if it was approved in the budget they endorsed last summer.LiNeBrEaKSome of the numerous expenses supervisors swiftly approve every week on their "consent calendar" deserve a second look before their vote.LiNeBrEaKOf course, most politicians would rather launch new initiatives than roll up their sleeves and tackle painful budget issues.LiNeBrEaKIn April, supervisors outlined their top five priorities. Attacking global warming, flood-control improvements, repairing county roads, enhancing bike and pedestrian paths and emergency preparedness are all worthwhile goals.LiNeBrEaKSupervisors should add a sixth and put it at the top of the list:LiNeBrEaKKeeping a tighter lid on spending in order to protect basic and vital public services. That's the leadership these difficult times require.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Adopt emission rules: Environmental Regulatory Commission can improve our air  	The Miami Herald  	COMMENTARY  	368 words  	Dec. 2-- It is the task of Florida's Environmental Regulatory Commission to protect the state's ecological health by deciding what standards state regulators will use to protect the air, water and land. Today the ERC has an opportunity to improve air quality by approving new standards to control auto emissions. The standards should be adopted. For that matter, it would be irresponsible not to embrace rules that can reduce air pollution and the gases that cause global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe proposed new rules are based on California's auto-emission standards. The federal Clean Air Act allows other states to adopt these standards, and 12 states have done so. Six more, including Florida, are considering them. Tailpipe emissions are a major contributor to the greenhouse effect, where heat-causing gases are trapped in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the Earth to warm up.LiNeBrEaKThe new rules were proposed by Gov. Charlie Crist, and we commend him for pushing the ERC on this issue. The governor wants to improve the state's air quality and have Florida do its part to help reduce the threats of global warming. Our state, which is bounded on three sides by water, is among the most vulnerable in the country to the sea rise caused by global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe new standards would require a 23-percent reduction in tailpipe emissions from new cars by 2012 and a 30-percent cut by 2016. Costs would vary depending on the make of car. For some, this would mean a $50 increase, while the impact could be up to $700 in other models.LiNeBrEaKForty percent of Florida's carbon dioxide comes from cars and light trucks. Reducing that percentage would have a positive impact on our air -- a boon to those with respiratory problems and to residents and visitors who treasure Florida beaches but fear seeing them washed away by rising sea levels.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Climate change increases problems for Florida reefs: Despite new federal protections, Elkhorn Coral may disappear from the waters off the coast of South Florida  	Curtis Morgan, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1105 words  	Dec. 2--The last, largest stands of ancient elkhorn coral survive in shallow waters off North Key Largo, where rough seas sometimes expose thick golden branches reaching toward the sunlit surface.LiNeBrEaKForty years ago, elkhorn grew in dense forests that would cover parking lots. Now, the biggest clump would barely fill one space.LiNeBrEaKIn another 40 years, elkhorn could disappear altogether -- along with just about every other hard coral forming South Florida's once-vibrant barrier reefs. LiNeBrEaKFederal regulators last week designated a 1,329-square-mile strip of sea bottom stretching from southern Palm Beach County to the Dry Tortugas as critical habitat for elkhorn and staghorn corals, two species that have long formed the foundation of barrier reefs off Florida and in the Caribbean.LiNeBrEaKBut a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund and co-authored by two University of Miami scientists argues localized protections will do little to address the biggest threat to reefs.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is not only accelerating problems that already have sickened and shrunken coral reefs, it has created a new, potentially more lethal threat: Increasingly acidic ocean waters that can reduce living coral to dead rubble.LiNeBrEaKThe report, "Corals and Climate Change: Florida's Natural Treasures at Risk," concludes that 5,000-year-old reefs, which support an array of marine life, will be among the first ecosystems to collapse if greenhouse gas levels continue to rise in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK"All of the forecasts show that at the rate we're going that somewhere at the middle or the end of the century, it's going to be very challenging for corals," said Harold Wanless, UM's chairman of geological sciences.LiNeBrEaKWanless, who has studied rising sea levels in South Florida for decades, is one of the report's six co-authors, along with department colleague James Klaus, a UM assistant professor. The others: Terry Gibson, longtime environmental journalist in Florida; Patricia Foster-Turley, wildlife biologist based in Fernandina Beach; and Karen Florini and Thomas Olson, attorneys with the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKGREENHOUSE EMISSIONSLiNeBrEaKJerry Karnas, director of Environmental Defense's Florida climate project, said the report bolsters the case for dramatic state, federal and international steps to reduce greenhouse emissions -- particularly of carbon dioxide -- largely produced by cars and power plants burning fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK"We're ground zero for impacts," said Karnas, who served on Gov. Charlie Crist's climate action team.LiNeBrEaKThe report doesn't break new ground but it does compile the latest studies of reef decline, threats and ripple effects on both the environment and economy.LiNeBrEaKIt estimates the loss of reefs, which are a magnet for tourists, divers and anglers, would cost 70,000 jobs and $5. 5 billion in sales annually in five southeast counties alone: Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe, Palm Beach and Martin.LiNeBrEaKStaghorn and elkhorn corals, the first coral species to be listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act in May 2006, came under new federal protection issued last week.LiNeBrEaKOnce the major reef builders in South Florida's shallow barrier reefs, the large corals, whose stalks resemble the horns of their animal namesakes, have declined by as much as 97 percent off the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. Scattered colonies also have been found off Broward and Palm Beach counties.LiNeBrEaKLast month, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations focused on direct human damage from anchoring, groundings, fishing, pollution and collection -- similar to protections already in place in the Florida Keys National Marine Keys sanctuary.LiNeBrEaKThe agency followed up last week by designating waters less than 30 feet deep off the Southeast coast -- from Boynton Beach to the Dry Tortugas -- as critical habitat for the corals. It's only about a third the size originally proposed, eliminating sections of Florida Bay and northern waters where the agency ruled the corals have not been historically found.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and many scientists argue the new protections don't address broader and increasing assaults on reefs, including assorted diseases and bouts of coral bleaching -- a whitening that can weaken corals.LiNeBrEaKBleaching, linked to warming ocean temperatures, is just one of threat posed by climate change. Another one call ocean "acidification" is a potentially far more damaging, said Chris Langdon, a professor at UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.LiNeBrEaKA NEW STRESSORLiNeBrEaK"This is a new stressor over and on top of everything you have heard about already," said Langdon, whose is among several UM scientists who have chronicled rising acidity in oceans.LiNeBrEaKSimply put, oceans absorb much of the atmosphere's excess carbon dioxide, where it dissolves. The resulting rise in the acidity of sea water -- it's jumped 30 percent over the last century -- can cripple corals, which are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, light and chemistry.LiNeBrEaKIt hinders polyps -- the tiny living animals inside coral -- from processing calcium, an essential component to building the hard coral skeleton that shelter them and build reefs. As ocean acidity increases, Langdon said, the rates of coral growth and reproduction slow and the swaths of the ocean where they can survive shrink.LiNeBrEaKThe coral itself also becomes thinner, more brittle and vulnerable to disease, hurricanes, human damage and natural parasites. Wanless likened what can happened to weakened or damaged reefs to "termites going at a complex of wood." Corals can literally dissolve into calcified sediment.LiNeBrEaKIf carbon dioxide emissions aren't curtailed, the threats add up to what Langdon called a "perfect storm" that could destroy much of the world's reefs -- perhaps within four to five decades.LiNeBrEaKWanless considers a four- to six-foot rise in sea level almost unavoidable over the next 50 to 100 years, an increase that would inundate the Everglades and hundreds of millions worth of coastal real estate. But he believes there is still time to prevent far more catastrophic damage -- if people and policymakers will only pay closer attention to what already is happening just a few miles offshore.LiNeBrEaK"People just can't imagine the world changing as it may this century," he said.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   BALDWIN REGISTER 01 EDITION	Watershed group hopes    to expand its efforts       Group hopes to expand its efforts  	GUY BUSBY  	Z; Pg. 01  	582 words  	Watershed group hopesLiNeBrEaKto expand its effortsLiNeBrEaKGroup hopes to expand its effortsLiNeBrEaKBy GUY BUSBYLiNeBrEaK8GroupLiNeBrEaKStaff ReporterLiNeBrEaKWhile coastal Alabama's population has grown in the last decade, what has not changed is the need to balance development with protecting the ecology that brings people to the region, environmental preservation members said Monday.LiNeBrEaKThe Wolf Bay Watershed Watch marked its 10th anniversary recently with a celebration in which more than 150 members, officials and regional environmental organization representatives took part, said Stan Mahoney, group director. LiNeBrEaKMahoney said members are not trying to stop development, but are working to help residents and business owners understand that growth will not continue if the area's natural attributes are hurt.LiNeBrEaK"We've got to do something to preserve what we have. Otherwise nobody's going to want to come here," Mahoney said. "Our economy and ecology are linked at the hip."LiNeBrEaKIn its 10 years, the group has demonstrated how community members in a developing coastal area can work with officials and businesses to help protect the environment, Quenton Dokken, executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, said.LiNeBrEaK"Groups like the Wolf Bay Watershed Watch are a perfect example of what people can do to get involved and do something," he said. "The local community has to get involved and that involves more than just picking up trash on the beach. You have to get involved politically at all levels. Get on the city council agenda, talk about what's going on and what needs to be done."LiNeBrEaKDokken said that while education is an important part of preservation efforts, residents have to be prepared to act now and not wait.LiNeBrEaK"You can't just work on educating children and hope that they'll do something about it when they're in charge," he said. "There has to be something left for them when that time comes."LiNeBrEaKDevelopment is changing the entire Gulf Coast from Cancun, Mexico, to Key West, Fla., Dokken said. He said the population in those areas is growing at a time when rising sea levels and stronger and more frequent hurricanes are making the region more vulnerable to environmental changes.LiNeBrEaKMahoney said that on the Alabama Gulf Coast, one of the biggest immediate environmental threats is drainage.LiNeBrEaK"I'd say 85 percent of our pollution problems stem from stormwater runoff; the pollutants washing into our streams, the siltation that clogs the waterways and turns the water cloudy," Mahoney said. "We have to get a handle on that, but it's not going to be easy."LiNeBrEaKWatershed Watch members have worked throughout the decade to monitor water quality in the areas around Wolf Bay, Mahoney said.LiNeBrEaKTwice a month, members check factors such as the clarity, temperature and acidity of the water at 40 monitoring stations in and near the bay, Mahoney said. He said the testing kits used cost about $200 each and require about two hours of work for each test. The tests are conducted from piers, bridges and other locations along the shore.LiNeBrEaKMahoney said the group is working to buy an electronic testing kit, at a cost of about $3,700, which will allow testing to be done in a few minutes. With a boat, which is another goal of the group, a few members could conduct tests in many other areas around the bay in a short time.LiNeBrEaKHe said that over the years, members have realized that water quality monitoring and preservation involve more than protecting one part of Wolf Bay. He said another goal is to expand efforts to check waters in areas such as Perdido Bay.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Reviews of recent and upcoming DVD releases  	By Billy O'Keefe, McClatchy-Tribune  	LIFESTYLE  	1478 words  	"Wanted: 2-Disc Special Edition" (R, 2008, Universal)LiNeBrEaKCube rat and lifelong doormat Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is actually an inhumanly gifted assassin. He just doesn't know it yet. "Wanted" explains the how and why of Wesley's heretofore-hidden talents, and it's pretty interesting in an entirely implausible way, but it's completely your call whether to care about Wesley's dad, his powers, and this mysterious fraternity of assassins (Angelina Jolie, Common and Morgan Freeman, among others) and to which he appears destined to belong. Like "Shoot 'em Up" earlier this year, "Wanted" exists primarily to entertain by whatever violent and flashy means it can, and the ridiculous, special-effects-laden and sometimes hilarious results it delivers are done so with tongue lodged deeply in cheek. Take it too seriously, and you might as well not bother: Between the absurd script, convenient twists and logic holes large enough to swallow us all, "Wanted's" cracks are deep and omnipresent. But if that reads like a recipe for possibility rather than disaster _ and if a tragicomic opera about superhuman humans and bullets that curve around corners sounds like your idea of a good time _ "Wanted" might be some of the most fun your movie-watching eyes have all year. LiNeBrEaKExtras: Extended scene, four behind-the-scenes features, digital copy.LiNeBrEaK"Garbage Warrior" (NR, 2007, Open Eye Media)LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to feel humbled by and jealous of Michael Reynolds during the first act of "Garbage Warrior." Yes, his housing development literally is made of soil and other people's trash. But the world he and his fellow dwellers designed also made him a completely independent man _ able to eat, live, play and even enjoy the latest in electronic convenience without any need to make a dime or lean on the government. Naturally, that's all the powers that be need to hear in order to begin the process of pulling Reynolds' dream down an undertow of paperwork, filibusters and absurd legalese. As documentaries go, "Warrior" doesn't pull any fancy tricks, but it doesn't really need to. Reynolds' story is inspiring at first and aggravating shortly after, but what happens in act three _ when the issue becomes bigger than all the players combined _ is what really makes it interesting. Your preconceived beliefs likely will dictate whether you're rooting for or against him by this point, but Reynolds makes a case for changing minds by establishing himself as a practical, accessible component of an issue often begging for just such a thing. "Warrior" does engage the global warming dialogue _ it'd look silly ignoring it _ but this is Reynolds' film, and those ideals expressed in act one remain the film's indisputable point of attraction.LiNeBrEaKExtras: Interviews.LiNeBrEaK"Step Brothers: 2-Disc Unrated Edition" (NR, 2008, Sony Pictures)LiNeBrEaKBrennan Huff (Will Ferrell) is a middle-aged manchild who still lives at home with his mom (Mary Steenburgen). Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) is pretty much the same thing, but living at home with his dad (Richard Jenkins). Given the title of the film, you probably can see where this is going, and "Step Brothers," for its part, doesn't disappoint in the predictability department. But if you're a fan of Ferrell's starring roles, then this, too, comes as no surprise. "Step Brothers" is about laughs first and everything else a distant second, and those who enjoy the dry, funny, sometimes-gross stupidity that happens when Ferrell and Reilly get together likely won't be disappointed here. That reads like stock praise, but "Step Brothers" is a stock comedy _ a film that likely won't stick with you much at all after it ends, but one that's well-equipped to entertain while it's on. Adam Scott (who practically steals the movie as Brennan's bullying older brother) and Kathryn Hahn also star.LiNeBrEaKExtras: Deleted scenes, six behind-the-scenes features, digital copy.LiNeBrEaK"Fly Me to the Moon" (G, 2008, Summit Entertainment)LiNeBrEaKBugs and computer-animated films have a strange love affair that refuses to quit, and in "Fly Me to the Moon" _ about a trio of adventurous critters who sneak a ride on the space shuttle during the Apollo 11 expedition _ ordinary houseflies finally get their big moment. On its own merits, "Moon" is a harmless but likeable kids movie _ nowhere near Pixar's ballpark, but miles better than the likes of "Space Chimps" and similar such dreck. Our fly friends and their relatives are pretty universally likeable, and if "Moon" gets kids curious about space travel and history, so much the better. Of course, the wonders of space will pale in kids' eyes once they take the included 3D glasses for a test drive. "Moon" includes an optional 3D cut of the film and throws in a couple serviceable pairs of 3D glasses, and skeptics beware: The effect works amazingly well. Watching the film in its entirety this way isn't at all advisable _ hello, eyestrain _ but the gimmick is slick enough to merit checking out for at least a little while. Too bad there's no way to switch between cuts on the fly.LiNeBrEaKExtras: Interactive planetarium game, two sets of 3D glasses for 3D version of film.LiNeBrEaK"Lower Learning" (R, 2008, Anchor Bay)LiNeBrEaKWere you to reimagine "Lower Learning" as a flow chart or some sort of brainstorming mind map, the result might look positively horrifying on paper. For a film with such pedestrian storytelling designs _ elementary school is going under, evil principal (Rob Corddry) is purposely tanking it and well-meaning but somewhat hopeless vice principal (Jason Biggs) must rally fellow teachers (Monica Potter, Will Sasso and Hayes MacArthur, among others) and students to save the school _ "Learning" has a ridiculous amount going on. There's the main plotline, a bunch of side plots involving those and other teachers, even more material about the kids (some who crack wise like grownups and one, in particular, who is the most adorable thing ever), a little corner devoted to a surprise inspector (Eva Longoria Parker), a completely bizarre dissection of our vice principal's haunted past, and a character (Ed Helms) who exists solely for gag purposes in a film already facing a huge gag surplus.LiNeBrEaKIt's as if someone outlined a television series, had a change of heart, and crammed the whole thing inside a 97-minute film. Predictably, "Learning" is a mess. Surprisingly, though, it's not a disaster. There's so much going on and so much talent involved that some things were bound to work no matter what, and while "Learning" is nowhere near the best comedy you can rent this year or even this week, its short attention span continually ensures that something good is never too far off.LiNeBrEaKExtras: Behind-the-scenes feature, deleted scenes, outtakes.LiNeBrEaK"Slap Shot 3: The Junior League" (PG, 2008, Universal)LiNeBrEaKWhen fans of a beloved franchise catch wind of a straight-to-video sequel, the reaction typically ranges from revulsion to stark, irrational fear of the worst. Often, the fear goes at least partially unrealized. In the case of "Slap Shot 3: The Junior League," though, the reality likely is even worse than whatever darkness your imagination could possibly conjure. Whereas the original "Slap Shot" stands even today as one of the great countercultural sports films ever made, "League" is a mopey teen dramedy with an absurd premise (win the game, save the town!) and a laughably bland romantic subplot. That's a bit brutal in its own right, but it's nothing compared to how the film turns the great Hanson brothers (Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and David Hanson) into the film equivalent of a hair metal band headlining a county fair. They're trying to recreate the magic, they fail miserably, and you don't know whether to feel worse for them for falling so hard or for yourself for wastinLiNeBrEaKg time and money to watch them do it. All of which begs the question: Who in the world is this for? New viewers won't even know who the Hansons are, while Hanson devotees will be left horrified by what money and executive stupidity did to their heroes.LiNeBrEaKExtras: Deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes feature, hockey legends feature.LiNeBrEaK(Billy O'Keefe writes video game and DVD reviews for McClatchy-Tribune News Service.)LiNeBrEaKTO SUBSCRIBE TO WHAT'S NEXTLiNeBrEaKItems in the What's Next package are not included in your MCT News Service subscription.

The New York Times 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	It's Still Making The World Go 'Round  	By MICHIKO KAKUTANI  	Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Pg. 1  	1166 words  	THE ASCENT OF MONEYLiNeBrEaK  A Financial History of the WorldLiNeBrEaK  By Niall FergusonLiNeBrEaK  442 pages. The Penguin Press. $29. 95LiNeBrEaK  Niall Ferguson's latest book, ''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World,'' went to press in May 2008, but it shrewdly anticipates many aspects of the current financial crisis, which has toppled banks, precipitated gigantic government bailouts and upended global markets. LiNeBrEaK  ''Are we on the brink of a 'great dying' in the financial world,'' Mr. Ferguson asks, ''one of those mass extinctions of species that have occurred periodically, like the end-Cambrian extinction that killed off 90 percent of Earth's species, or the Cretaceous-Tertiary catastrophe that wiped out the dinosaurs? It is a scenario that many biologists have reason to fear, as man-made climate change wreaks havoc with natural habitats around the globe. But a great dying of financial institutions is also a scenario that we should worry about, as another man-made disaster works its way slowly and painfully through the global financial system.'' LiNeBrEaK  In the course of this useful if somewhat lumpy volume, Mr. Ferguson looks at the roots of the current economic meltdown, examining how, in a globalized world that uses increasingly complex financial instruments, defaults on subprime mortgages in American cities like Detroit and Memphis could unleash a fiscal tsunami that spans the planet. LiNeBrEaK  But the book does not focus primarily on speculative manias and financial crises; for that, the reader is better off with two old-school classics, ''Manias, Panics and Crashes'' by Charles P. Kindleberger and Robert Aliber, and ''Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds'' by Charles Mackay. Instead Mr. Ferguson discusses such cycles of euphoria and panic within a larger historical context: he traces the evolution of credit, debt and the idea of risk management over several centuries, and as he did in an earlier book, ''The Cash Nexus,'' he examines the potent links between politics and economics. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Ferguson explains why money went from coinage to paper and the advantages and disadvantages of the gold standard. He argues that aging societies (like those facing a large baby-boom  generation entering retirement years) have ''a huge and growing need for fixed income securities, and for low inflation to ensure that the interest they pay retains its purchasing power.'' LiNeBrEaK  And he looks at how exotic financial innovations (like collateralized debt obligations) and wide support for adjustable rate and subprime mortgages (endorsed, he says, by proponents of wider home ownership as disparate as Alan Greenspan and President Bush) pushed the snowball of the current financial crisis. LiNeBrEaK  Whereas Mr. Ferguson's recent books ''Empire'' (2003) and ''Colossus'' (2004) were highly polemical histories promoting the virtues of British and American empire, this volume is considerably less ideological and less tendentious. No doubt Mr. Ferguson, who earlier called for the United States to export democracy and capitalism, has been chastened by the continuing war in Iraq and by the growing economic difficulties of the United States. LiNeBrEaK  Noting the high savings rate of Chinese households and Chinese corporations (in sharp contrast to Americans' penchant for living on credit), he observes that the direction of capital flow is now from East to West. LiNeBrEaK  ''In 2007 the United States needed to borrow around $800 billion from the rest of the world; more than $4 billion every working day,'' he writes. ''China, by contrast, ran a current account surplus of $262 billion, equivalent to more than a quarter of the U.S. deficit. And a remarkably large proportion of that surplus has ended up being lent to the United States. In effect, the People's Republic China has become banker to the United States of America.'' LiNeBrEaK  Although ''The Ascent of Money'' is pockmarked by digressions (about things like the Black-Scholes model of options pricing)  that many lay readers will find arcane and difficult to understand, the book as a whole is animated by Mr. Ferguson's narrative gifts, among them his ability to discuss complex ideas in user-friendly terms. LiNeBrEaK  He also has a knack for illustrating his larger hypotheses with colorful stories about people like Nathan Rothschild (the subject of one of his earlier books); the Scottish economist and gambler John Law (described as ''the man who invented the stock market bubble''); and the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and his so-called Chicago Boys, who helped bring economic reforms  to  Pinochet's Chile. LiNeBrEaK  It is Mr. Ferguson's belief that ''behind each great historical phenomenon there lies a financial secret,'' and much of this volume aims to explicate that argument. He writes, for instance, that the Confederacy's lack of hard cash, as much as its lack of industrial capacity or manpower, undercut its cause. And he suggests that the Renaissance boom in art and architecture can be traced to Italian bankers' application of Eastern and Arabic mathematics to finance. LiNeBrEaK  ''The Dutch Republic prevailed over the Habsburg Empire,'' he argues, ''because having the world's first modern stock market was financially preferable to having the world's biggest silver mine. The problems of the French monarchy could not be resolved without a revolution because a convicted Scots murderer had wrecked the French financial system by unleashing the first stock market bubble and bust. It was Nathan Rothschild as much as the Duke of Wellington who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. It was financial folly, a self-destructive cycle of defaults and devaluations, that turned Argentina from the world's sixth-richest country in the 1880s into the inflation-ridden basket case of the 1980s.'' LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Ferguson is fond of making Darwinian comparisons in the book, writing that ''financial history is essentially the result of institutional mutation and natural selection,'' and noting that ''as in the natural world, the evolutionary process has been subject to big disruptions in the form of geopolitical shocks and financial crises.''  LiNeBrEaK  Also contributing to ''the inherent instability of the financial system,'' he says, are the vagaries of human behavior: ''our innate inclination to veer from euphoria to despondency'' and ''our perennial failure to learn from history.''  LiNeBrEaK  ''Those who put their faith in the 'wisdom of crowds' mean no more than that a large group of people is more likely to make a correct assessment than a small group of supposed experts,'' he writes. ''But that is not saying much. The old joke that 'Macroeconomists have successfully predicted nine of the last five recessions' is not so much a joke as a dispiriting truth about the difficulty of economic forecasting. Meanwhile, serious students of human psychology will expect as much madness as wisdom from large groups of people. A case in point must be the near-universal delusion among investors in the first half of 2007 that a major liquidity crisis could not occur.''

The New York Times 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	A New Understanding Of Iceberg Formation May Aid Climate Studies  	By HENRY FOUNTAIN  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; OBSERVATORY; Pg. 3  	205 words  	One process that contributes to the rise of sea levels is the calving of icebergs from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. As these expanses of ice flow from land into water, they form floating extensions, or shelves. It's at the leading edge of these shelves that icebergs break off. LiNeBrEaK  Scientists studying the potential impact of climate change need to be able to simulate how ice sheets and shelves behave, including how fast icebergs form. But no one has been able to formulate a basic rule for calving. LiNeBrEaK  Now Richard B. Alley of Pennsylvania State University and colleagues have come up with one. The rate of calving, they report in Science, is primarily a function of the rate at which an ice shelf spreads. LiNeBrEaK  This rather simple rule was devised after long study of data from ice shelves, including the largest in the world, the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. They found that faster-spreading shelves have a higher rate of calving, while shelves that spread more slowly due to buttressing from the sides or the seafloor produce icebergs at a lower rate. LiNeBrEaK  The researchers say that while their rule isn't perfect, it could be useful in plugging into computer models to help study the behavior of ice sheets in a warming world.

As someone with A.D.H.D., I vehemently disagree.  LiNeBrEaK  As a child, I had a difficult time focusing on any particular task . In college, however, I eschewed any pretense that I could focus on a single field of study and instead sought out the most interesting teachers and classes. I then wove this collection of classes into a bachelor's degree with three majors, and later added master's and law degrees. In many ways, A.D.H.D. continues to define aspects of my life, yet my life and career are by any standard a triumph.LiNeBrEaK   Aharon Shifron-Ronnie Concord, Calif.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  The debate we should be having -- if we weren't so hamstrung by the culture of disability -- is whether A.D.H.D. is a valid diagnosis. Problems with concentration and executive functioning are completely nonspecific, with everything from excessive television watching to post-traumatic stress disorder contributing to impairments in this regard. LiNeBrEaK  I realize it's a lot safer politically to label problems a ''chemical imbalance'' than to call out overstretched parents on their unavailability, be it emotional or otherwise. But much like global warming, we can't make progress while simultaneously ignoring or dismissing the underlying problems.

Brazil said it  would aim to reduce clearing of the rain forest to 2,260 square miles a year by 2018. Brazil, which had refused to adopt targets until wealthier countries offered more help, hopes the plan will help allay criticism that it has done too little to fight burning and clearing by loggers, farmers and ranchers. Rain forest destruction has made Brazil one of the top greenhouse gas producers because trees release carbon dioxide when they are cut down or burned.

The New York Times 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Times Building Climber Is Sentenced to Three Days of Community Service  	By JOHN ELIGON  	Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 31  	483 words  	Alain Robert, the first of three men to climb the ladderlike facade of The New York Times Building during the summer, pleaded guilty on Monday to disorderly conduct, a violation that has no criminal record attached. LiNeBrEaK  As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Robert will pay a $250 fine and serve three days of community service at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a nonprofit organization based in the city that provides education about H.I.V. and AIDS and helps victims. The Criminal Court judge, Barry M. Kamins, agreed to have the record of the proceeding expunged after one year.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Robert scaled the building, at 620 Eighth Avenue, on June 5, and was followed hours later by Renaldo Clarke. Both men ascended to the roof of the 52-story tower. Mr. Robert, a French stuntman known for climbing tall buildings around the world, said he had done it to promote the fight against global warming; Mr. Clarke said his cause was malaria. A third man, David Malone, scaled several floors of the building on July 9. After his climb, The Times altered the building's facade.LiNeBrEaK  While a grand jury dismissed all criminal charges against Mr. Robert, grand juries indicted Mr. Clarke and Mr. Malone on several charges, including misdemeanor reckless endangerment, which is punishable by up to a year in jail. The cases against Mr. Clarke and Mr. Malone are pending.LiNeBrEaK  The assistant district attorney, Heather Pearson, had asked Judge Kamins to prevent Mr. Robert from doing his community service with an environmental organization because of the cause he was promoting while climbing the building.LiNeBrEaK  ''The defendant has not expressed what I would term as remorse for his actions in this city,'' Ms. Pearson said. She added that, in his grand jury testimony, Mr. Robert gave indications of his intention ''to climb additional buildings.''LiNeBrEaK  Asked outside the courtroom if that was true, Mr. Robert replied: ''Not in New York.''LiNeBrEaK  He said he was a bit disappointed with the outcome of the case.LiNeBrEaK  ''I was expecting not having to go for some community service,'' he said. ''The good thing is I can still do it for some nonprofit organization.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Robert is scheduled to return to France on Wednesday, and has until next summer to fulfill his community service in New York.LiNeBrEaK  Daniel N. Arshack, Mr. Robert's lawyer, told Judge Kamins that he felt community service was unwarranted. At the very least, he asked the judge to allow Mr. Robert to do his community service in France.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Pearson objected because, she said, Mr. Robert's act cost New York taxpayers money.LiNeBrEaK  ''Mainly because the defendant's criminal conduct was aimed at New York City,'' she said.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Arshack countered that it was in the best interest of the people of New York, ''that Mr. Robert spend as little time as possible in New York.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Robert said he was scheduled to climb La Cigale Hotel in Qatar next week -- but this time as an organized event.

The New York Times 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Carbon Detectives Are on the Case in Colorado, Tracking Gases  	By SUSAN MORAN  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; Pg. 3  	1186 words  	As she squeezed herself into a telephone-booth-size elevator to ascend a 984-foot tower in Colorado's eastern plains, Arlyn Andrews said with a grin, ''This makes me want to go rock climbing.''LiNeBrEaK  It's a good thing she loves climbing tall structures.  Dr. Andrews, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, climbs the tower periodically  to make sure the narrow tubes running from the tower to analyzers nearby are properly taking continuous samples of carbon dioxide, methane and a cocktail of other greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK  The elevator grumbled to a halt about five minutes later at an 820-foot perch, where the tower's slender shadow stretched into a neighboring sunflower field in the early morning sunlight. ''We're able to detect the whole mix of emissions here -- what comes from automobile traffic, from industry, from residential development and from agriculture,'' Dr. Andrews said.LiNeBrEaK  She is one of many carbon sleuths, scientists who track and analyze where greenhouse gases come from and where they go over time. Think of it like personal finances. To plan for a sound financial future, it helps to create a budget and keep track of how one is  spending money. Similarly, atmospheric scientists need to develop a ''budget'' for greenhouse gases.  LiNeBrEaK  But the atmosphere delivers no monthly statement on greenhouse gas dynamics, so scientists have to tease out the information from disparate and often contradictory sources. The key task is measuring the sources, or emissions, of these planet-warming gases, and the ''sinks'' -- forests, cropland and oceans that absorb carbon. This budget can then inform intelligent climate-control policy, whether it be managing one forest or shaping national emissions regulations. LiNeBrEaK  The quest to track carbon began 50 years ago when an atmospheric scientist, David Keeling, cranked up an analyzer and started running the world's first carbon dioxide-measuring observatory, at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Now,  thanks to an expanding combination of atmospheric and land-based measuring techniques, scientists can quantify more precisely the sources and sinks of CO2. They also better understand how heat-trapping gases vary over time and space, not just globally but on continental and even regional scales. LiNeBrEaK  By applying the various methods and checking them against each other and against computer models, scientists are also more accurately distinguishing certain human-caused greenhouse gases from those that stem from natural fluctuations in terrestrial and ocean ecosystems.LiNeBrEaK  The stakes are much higher now than they were 50 years ago. Globally, carbon sinks are being outpaced by rising emissions. Atmospheric instruments like the NOAA-financed network of eight tall towers offer climate scientists a window into processes that control greenhouse gas emissions and sinks. LiNeBrEaK  But uncertainty remains high -- often as high as estimates themselves. For instance, researchers think about half of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere gets absorbed by oceans and land, but they do not  know precisely where the gases come from and where they end up. This knowledge gap has serious policy implications; until it becomes clear where emissions are going, it will  remain difficult to have  verifiable credits for sequestering carbon. LiNeBrEaK  ''We need to make sure that carbon markets are affecting climate change, not just putting money in the hands of some companies and people,'' said Lisa Dilling, an assistant professor of environmental science at the University of Colorado, Boulder.LiNeBrEaK  A vexing challenge is that surface inventory assessments -- based on measuring forests, agricultural fields and smokestack emissions, for instance -- generally do not agree with atmospheric measurements. LiNeBrEaK  ''We've got to close the carbon budget to know precisely what's going where,'' said Kevin Gurney, an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Purdue University in Indiana. LiNeBrEaK  Toward that goal, last April, Dr. Gurney started the Vulcan Project. Named after the Roman god of fire, Vulcan is a massive database and a graphic map that shows hourly changes of CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in every locale by every source, including vehicles, power plants and factories. LiNeBrEaK  Another carbon budget-mapping tool for atmospheric scientists is called CarbonTracker, a data analysis system begun last year by Pieter Tans, a senior scientist at NOAA's Earth Systems Research Laboratory and his colleagues at NOAA. The online system shows how CO2 ebbs and flows across continents and how that varies year to year. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Tans started the tall tower network in 1992. He hopes to expand it to 30 structures from the current eight. The most advanced instruments were introduced last year in California -- one in San Francisco and the other in the San Joaquin Valley,  near Sacramento.LiNeBrEaK  This summer, a continuing study at a tall tower located on corn and soybean fields in West Branch, Iowa, revealed that the crops sucked a surprisingly large amount of CO2 out of the atmosphere during the summer growing season -- as much as 55 parts per million out of a background CO2-equivalent  level of 380 parts per million. LiNeBrEaK  Any farmer knows that corn grows fast and soaks up lots of carbon in the process, and later respires CO2 when it is harvested or left to decay. But this was the first time that scientists detected such a large reduction of CO2  inventory over a specific region during growing season. The study also showed a large drop in CO2  concentration from the previous summer, probably because floods delayed the growing season this year, Dr. Andrews said. LiNeBrEaK  The network of tall towers has drastically improved on air samples taken from small airplanes. And the towers cover a broader area than shorter, land-based instruments like so-called flux towers that measure how many tons of CO2 flow in and out of a specific plot of land, roughly within a square kilometer.LiNeBrEaK  In January, the next frontier of atmospheric CO2 measuring instruments will begin when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launches the first carbon-scanning satellite, called the Orbiting Carbon Observatory. LiNeBrEaK  Each day, the satellite will orbit Earth 15 times, taking nearly 500,000 measurements of the ''fingerprint'' that CO2 leaves in the air between the satellite and Earth's surface. The data will be used to create a map of CO2 concentrations that will help scientists determine precisely where the sources and sinks are -- showing differences in trace gases down to a 1 part per million precision against a background of 380 parts per million CO2 equivalent. LiNeBrEaK  Ultimately, many scientists hope their discoveries will inform climate policies, like mandatory limits on emissions that many expect Congress will eventually impose. LiNeBrEaK  ''It's a national priority to understand the carbon budget so people can make smart, good policy,'' said Dr. Gurney of Purdue, adding that many scientists feel pressured to push the boundaries of knowledge in this field in their effort to slow global warming. ''It's what motivates us to wake up in the morning.''

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   All Editions	Got the power;  Cogeneration plant back on track 		OPINION; Pg. A12  	447 words  	DEVELOPING NEW energy sources require a specific type of fuel: cash. In a bad economy that's about as scarce as new oil deposits. Luckily, Wayne's ambitious alternative energy plan, which includes cogeneration, has managed to survive the current credit crunch. LiNeBrEaKThe bank that was going to provide financing to Pepco Energy Services ? the cogeneration plant's first builder ? pulled out of the deal. Putting together another financial plan was tricky because it happened during the sub-prime mortgage troubles. Then Atlantic Energy Solutions stepped up. They said they could build the plant for $3 million less and finance the whole project themselves if need be.LiNeBrEaKThat means that by the end of next year an array of energy sources will heat, cool and light Wayne's municipal buildings and two schools. The township and school district could save more than $20 million in energy costs over 20 years, after they pay back construction costs. And the environment will absorb 2,000 tons a year less in carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKWayne's persistence and foresight are to be commended. The idea may have begun back in 2001, but it could not have been realized at a better time. Energy costs and global warming continue to rise. Budgets are being slashed.LiNeBrEaKWe don't know if the project will be successful. But we do know that this kind of creative thinking should be an example to other municipalities.LiNeBrEaKIn February, solar panels will be affixed to Wayne Valley High School and James Fallon Elementary School. Next year a geothermal system, providing heating and cooling, will be installed in the Police Department. And then the cogeneration plant will be built and used to supply electricity to Town Hall and the library.LiNeBrEaKCogeneration means that the heat created during the production of electricity is saved and used to warm or cool buildings. It is a way of making use of something that usually is wasted. It is thrift at its best. Rutgers University, Princeton University, Rowan University and Montclair State University all have cogeneration plants.LiNeBrEaKIf the project does not work as planned, the township and school district are protected because the Wayne Energy Corp. will serve as middle man. The non-profit organization will lease the cogeneration plant from Atlantic Energy Solutions for 16 years, after which it will own the plant. The town and school district will pay their energy bills to the corporation. The corporation will use that money to pay the lease.LiNeBrEaKNot every municipality lends itself to this kind of solution. But if Wayne's plan is a success, it could mean great savings to the town and to the environment. Other municipalities should at least start to investigate their energy options.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   Metro Edition	CHALLENGES PRESENT A TURNING POINT  	W. Lee Wilhelm III  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B9  	665 words  	Future historians will look back at the year 2008 as a turning point in American history, but where this turn will take us is still to be determined. The election of Barack Obama as America's first African-American president is a watershed moment in our history. But his election will be viewed against a backdrop of economic turmoil and uncertainty unseen since the days of the Great Depression, environmental challenges that threaten our very way of life and a country that is at odds with many of its allies and at war with the forces of extremism.LiNeBrEaKAs Albert Einstein observed, "in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity," which is what we need to keep in mind as we tackle the problems we face today. American history is testament to a people who rise to the challenge and conquer adversity with creativity, innovation and determination. LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming and our growing dependence on foreign sources of oil are two problems that are linked together by a solution. Each year we spend more than $700 billion to import oil, much of it coming from countries that are not our friends. Nearly 60 percent of the oil we use comes from overseas, and most of the world's oil reserves are in the Middle East. While there are steps that we can take to increase domestic production, the effect will be marginal and temporary. The fact remains that our addiction to oil is the problem, a point that both President-elect Obama and President Bush agree on.LiNeBrEaKThere is widespread consensus in the scientific community that human activity is the major contributor to the increase in greenhouse gases, such as CO2 in our atmosphere, which is causing global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. must commit to reducing the pollution that causes global warming. We can do this by evolving from a carbon-based energy economy to a clean-energy economy. In addition to reducing our dependence on oil and reducing global warming, the move to a clean-energy economy will create new industries, businesses and jobs, providing a needed boost to our economy. In fact, going green is already creating a sense of community among several large employers in the Roanoke region. These businesses have joined together to be part of a Green Business Coalition and are setting an example that other communities can follow.LiNeBrEaKNationally, incentives may be needed to encourage even small businesses to do their part in reducing greenhouse gases. Whether driving less, changing one's fleet to hybrids or making sure that construction and renovation projects incorporate greener elements that reduce energy, there's a role for every business and every business person. There are already smart choices being made through the help of state programs. Yet, national incentive programs could help generate new efforts to increase energy efficiency by retrofitting buildings, improving the electrical grid, expanding and enhancing mass transit and freight rail, and developing solar, wind and biomass projects. A national policy on global warming that includes a complementary market trading program could generate significant resources that could be redirected toward these pragmatic solutions.LiNeBrEaKWithout a doubt, there are opportunities ahead for leaders and educators at all levels to change direction and chart a new, more energy efficient, green recovery-related course. Future jobs that could be created in the green jobs field would include a wide array of industries, including construction, engineering, manufacturing and transportation -- all areas that are now suffering from the economic recession.LiNeBrEaKIf we seize the challenges of today as opportunities to invest and grow in a new and better direction, we will help our economy and our environment. The resources that we need to make the turn in the right direction are vision, determination, creativity and faith. I believe we have those resources in abundance, and it is now the time to put them to work.LiNeBrEaKW.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Capital growth plan: Focus on existing neighborhoods  	Mary Lynne Vellinga, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	622 words  	Dec. 2--Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson is taking office just in time to consider a new general plan that aims to make Sacramento much more like a city and less like a giant suburb by the year 2030.LiNeBrEaKFour years in the making, the general plan will go before the City Council for a public hearing tonight. A final vote is scheduled for late January. LiNeBrEaKIf the plan is carried out as written, about two-thirds of Sacramento's growth would be accommodated in existing neighborhoods.LiNeBrEaKNew satellite downtowns would spring up around Arden Fair mall, 65th Street in back of California State University, Sacramento, and the Florin light-rail station.LiNeBrEaKThe plan seeks to reverse the city's historic growth pattern, which has consisted mostly of building suburban-style neighborhoods on farm fields.LiNeBrEaK"This general plan represents a dramatic change for the city of Sacramento," said Tom Pace, the city's long-range planning manager.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, however, Pace acknowledged the limitations of general plans, which specify in sweeping terms where growth will and won't occur, and what types of growth will be permitted.LiNeBrEaKThe plan also contains a series of policies the city says it will pursue to create walkable, bike-friendly neighborhoods, attract good jobs and keep skilled workers.LiNeBrEaKThe plan won't become reality without the cooperation of developers willing to build more urban products and people willing to live and work in them.LiNeBrEaKThen there's the matter of the people who already live in neighborhoods targeted for growth. Their objections could kill projects.LiNeBrEaKThe city hasn't completely closed the door on traditional suburban growth. For instance, farm fields north of the existing city limits and former quarries east of the city boundary are designated as "future study areas" in the general plan, meaning the council could open them up for building.LiNeBrEaK"The city wants to keep its options open," Pace said. "What we're trying to do is balance our desire to be a leader in the green and clean movement, and also be realistic about the economics of development, and what the market wants."LiNeBrEaKDespite the plan's urban emphasis, California Attorney General Jerry Brown has complained it doesn't contain enough enforceable provisions to reduce driving and the emission of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Brown has recently taken to prodding cities to do more to address the climate change issue.LiNeBrEaKCorrespondence from Brown's office has raised fears at City Hall that his department will challenge the general plan in court.LiNeBrEaKCity staff members continued to negotiate with Brown's office this week over how the language on global warming could be strengthened. In one concession, the city agreed to formally acknowledge that the 40 percent population and job growth anticipated in the plan would have a "significant" negative impact on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"We're happy about that," Deputy Attorney General Lisa Trankley said.LiNeBrEaKAcknowledging that the plan will cause a significant increase in greenhouse gases means the city will be required to adopt specific measures to reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaKTrankley said she has pushed the city staff to adopt as many such mitigation measures as possible but isn't sure if they've done enough to satisfy her department.LiNeBrEaK"I'm still looking at those," she said.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Mary Lynne Vellinga, (916) 321-1094.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Vacaville fruit packer has sunny outlook with solar project  	Chris Bowman, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	832 words  	Dec. 2--Starting today, Mark Mariani will begin powering the packing lines of one of the world's largest dried fruit plants with the same energy source his grandfather tapped at the start of the century-old family business.LiNeBrEaK"What better resource can you use but the sun that dries our fruit?" said Mariani, 56, chairman and chief executive officer of Mariani Packing Co. in Vacaville. LiNeBrEaKMore than 5,800 skyward-tilted solar panels aligned like orchard trees next to the Mariani plant in Vacaville will generate up to 1. 1 megawatts of electricity a year for the next 20 years.LiNeBrEaKThat's nearly one-fourth of the power Pacific Gas and Electric Co. currently supplies the company to process more than 100 million pounds of dried fruit a year.LiNeBrEaKThe Mariani installation stands out as an exception even in California's fast-growing solar energy market. While open-sun drying of fruits, vegetables and meats has been practiced for eons, the modern application of solar power to run the machinery on major farms has lagged, renewable energy experts said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's $50 billion food processing industry is the third-largest electricity user in the state, following oil refining and high-tech manufacturing.LiNeBrEaKEnergy accounts for up to 60 percent of the cost of producing dried fruit in the Central Valley, with most of the power going to operate the 3,000 driers and dehydrators in the region, according to a 2006 state Energy Commission study by University of California, Davis, researchers. Yet, the report said, "the hydration process is often inefficient, employing outdated technologies."LiNeBrEaKThe Marianis, however, have a history of being pioneers of conservation and efficiency.LiNeBrEaKIn the 1960s, while irrigated farming mushroomed in the Central Valley, Mariani's father, Paul, installed the first micro-irrigation system in the state, cutting water use 70 percent in the company's Santa Clara Valley orchards, Mariani said.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, Mariani family members and senior managers switched to driving hybrid vehicles.LiNeBrEaK"It speaks to commitment across the board to reduce carbon dioxide and global warming," Mariani said. "It sends a message to my whole company that this is the way we will be doing things in the future."LiNeBrEaKBy relying on solar panels for about one-quarter of its energy needs, the company expects to reduce global-warming emissions of carbon dioxide by about 30 million pounds in the next 20 years -- the equivalent of taking 3,000 cars off the road for one year.LiNeBrEaKThe move to solar energy is in keeping with the company's decades-old core values, listed on the backs of their business cards: "We embrace change."LiNeBrEaKThe food processor won't see much change in its electric bills in the near future.LiNeBrEaKUnder its solar purchase agreement, SunEdison of Beltsville, Md., will charge no more than current retail price for the electricity supplied by the 7 acres of photovoltaic panels it financed and installed at the plant. Mariani, however, is lured by a provision that locks those rates for the life of the contract.LiNeBrEaKThe venture into solar is a hedge against what company officials believe will be volatility and price inflation in the energy market, as they experienced in the California energy crisis of 2001.LiNeBrEaKMuch of the prospective savings would accrue in the heat of the summer days. In those high-demand hours, as PGandE's peak rates kick in, Mariani will be drawing heavily from its lower-priced solar energy supply.LiNeBrEaKAlso, on weekends when the plant is usually closed, Mariani can sell electricity from the solar farm to PGandE's power grid.LiNeBrEaK"On Day One, we won't save any money," Mariani said. "But years from now we will look back and say that was a good decision. Our sights are decade by decade rather than quarter by quarter."LiNeBrEaKSunEdison is hedging its bets that more companies will see the same light.LiNeBrEaK"Rates are going to go up, and the cost of sunshine is pretty predictable," said Mark Culpepper, the firm's chief technology officer in San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKSince its start in 2004, SunEdison has installed 170 similar solar power generators around the country, most of them in California. The sites include the roofs of Kohl's department stores and the grounds of the sun-drenched Chuckawalla Valley and Ironwood state prisons on the outskirts of the Riverside County desert town of Blythe.LiNeBrEaKIn October, SunEdison signed a 20-year agreement with the state to deliver 8 megawatts of electricity to 15 California State University campuses, including the Sacramento campus. The solar panels will be installed on roofs, atop parking garages and on campus grounds.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Chris Bowman, (916) 321-1069.

San Marcos Daily Record (Texas)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Hatchery gets grant  	San Marcos Daily Record, Texas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	616 words  	Dec. 2--SAN MARCOS -- It lacks the glitz and draw of the new Embassy Suites and San Marcos Conference Center just across IH-35, but over at the low-slung cluster of buildings that make up the San Marcos National Fish Hatchery, important research is underway.LiNeBrEaKIn November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced grants to the San Marcos facility and nine others that are looking into the effects of climate change on plants or animals as well as ways to decrease carbon footprints. LiNeBrEaKThe San Marcos hatchery will receive $5,000 to study the effects of increased temperature on the growth and reproduction of the Devils River Minnow.LiNeBrEaK"The Service has already determined the critical maximum temperature related to the survival of the threatened Devils River minnow. The next step is to evaluate the effects of increased water temperature (such as might occur due to climate change) on growth and reproduction in this species," the USFS said in a press release. "Any detrimental effects on growth and reproduction will help the Service design management strategies to maintain healthy spring flows, especially during the summer months."LiNeBrEaKOther Texas projects receiving funding:LiNeBrEaK--Conversion to Solar Powered Electrical System -- $5,000 -- Submitted by the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge Complex.LiNeBrEaKThe Aransas National Wildlife Refuge Complex hopes to ultimately convert its entire electric system to solar power. As a first step in achieving this goal, the Complex will install a passive solar water heater system. This system is expected to meet at least half of the Complex's hot water needs, and will significantly reduce its carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaK--Carbon Sequestration by Woody Plants in South Texas -- $5,000 -- Submitted by the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming has caused increasing levels of carbon in the atmosphere.  Trees can help alleviate global warming by binding carbon in above- and below-ground plant biomass. The Lower Rio Grande National Wildlife Refuge will conduct a study to investigate the carbon sequestration capacities of several native woody plant species from south Texas and northern Mexico. The results will be used to promote carbon sequestration markets, and support primary brushlands restoration projects benefiting migratory birds, endangered species, and other native wildlife.LiNeBrEaK--Identify Potential Energy and Water Savings on Uvalde National Fish Hatchery -- $5,000 -- Submitted by the Uvalde National Fish Hatchery.LiNeBrEaKAquaculture (fish breeding) depends upon both water and energy -- two pricey resources. Uvalde National Fish Hatchery will conduct a short-term study on their water supply wells, as well as two individual ponds, to measure energy use and water efficiency. The results will be used to develop strategies for decreasing energy use and improving water efficiency in fish hatcheries.LiNeBrEaKIn all, the USFS says it will provide $48,500 in "seed money" to fund the 10 projects, all of which were employee-initiated.LiNeBrEaK"We must be leaders in the climate change arena," said Dr. Benjamin Tuggle, USFS Southwest Regional director.LiNeBrEaK"By taking incremental steps such as these, we will begin to make progress towards our goal of adjusting to climactic changes."LiNeBrEaKFor more on USFS hatcheries, visit fws.gov/fisheries.

Santa Cruz Sentinel (California)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	County residents using less water, generating less trash  	Kurtis Alexander, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	729 words  	Dec. 2--Santa Cruz County residents are using less water and generating less trash, helping ease pressure on the region's limited water and land resources, a recent United Way report shows.LiNeBrEaKStill, ensuring adequate drinking water and finding ways to dispose of waste beyond the county's fast-filling landfills remain challenges for local communities.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the 2008 Community Assessment Project, county water districts saw non-agricultural water use fall 2. 9 percent cumulatively over the past decade, despite an increase in service connections. LiNeBrEaKDuring the same period, the amount of trash countywide fell 8 percent, the report revealed.LiNeBrEaK"More people are conserving particularly water," said Gary Griggs, a UC Santa Cruz geologist who helped sort the findings of this year's United Way report. "That's good news because if climate trends continue and it gets warmer, we might not have the water we have today."LiNeBrEaKThe county's seven largest residential water districts rely on various sources of groundwater and surface water, from the San Lorenzo River to South County aquifers, to nourish residents, and the health of each source varies.LiNeBrEaKWhatever condition, though, most sources have benefitted from substantial rainfall over the past decade or so, at least until recent years, as well as from increased conservation, said Bill Kocher, water director for the city of Santa Cruz.LiNeBrEaK"What we'reLiNeBrEaKseeing now is that water demands are less," said Kocher, who is in the process of re-evaluating his city's need and supply. "Maybe we've overestimated water demand. Maybe we'll need less than what we're projecting."LiNeBrEaKHowever, Kocher warns that ensuring adequate long-term water supplies goes beyond looking at short-term trends and suggests policy makers err on the side of caution. Supplies can drop unexpectedly, he said, particularly with weather, and already more water is needed in rivers and creeks to support local fish populations.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of water produced by the county's water districts over the past decade, compared to the nearly 3 percent drop in consumption, decreased 1 percent, according to the Community Assessment Project.LiNeBrEaK"We're not in that bad of shape throughout the county," Kocher said. "But if each of the individual agencies continues to stress its supply, it's not going to be good."LiNeBrEaKThe Community Assessment Project showed 85. 7 percent of county residents taking steps to reduce water consumption.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, residents in the cities of Santa Cruz, Watsonville and Scotts Valley also made efforts to reduce the amount of trash they generate, as per capital levels of waste fell between 1997 and 2006, the last year reported. Residents in Capitola and the unincorporated communities threw out roughly the same amount of trash during that time.LiNeBrEaKTom Bolich, head of the county's Public Works Department, speculates that trash disposal has dropped even more in the past two years as additional recycling opportunities have become available and garbage rates have increased.LiNeBrEaK"People are realizing that it's not only a good thing to do, but it's economical," he said.LiNeBrEaKAs landfills near capacity, particularly the ones run by the county and the city of Watsonville, public works officials have turned to recycling programs to extend the life of these facilities. In the meantime, alternative strategies, like exporting trash and employing new ways to break down waste, are being explored.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, 221,011 tons of trash were generated countywide, according to the Community Assessment Project. The county began with more than double that amount; about half was recycled.LiNeBrEaKThe Community Assessment Project, which is sponsored by the United Way of Santa Cruz County and compiled by Applied Survey Research of Watsonville, is published annually and derives its data from a number of sources including local governments, water districts, waste agencies and independent surveys.LiNeBrEaKContact Kurtis Alexander at 706-3267 or kalexander@santacruzsentinel.com	COUNTIES (91%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (90%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (89%); WATER QUALITY (89%); TRENDS (89%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (78%); WASTE REDUCTION (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); LANDFILLS (73%)  				General  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (84%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 2, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081202-QC-County-residents-using-less-water-generating-less-trash-1202  	QC

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 02, 2008 Tuesday 	MARINE HIGHWAY WOULD RIDE WAVE OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS  	STAS MARGARONIS GUEST COLUMNIST  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B7  	569 words  	Currently, the United States is experiencing low levels of investment in transportation, clean air, manufacturing, fuel-efficiency and family-wage jobs. Instead of spending billions of dollars bailing out financial institutions, the United States needs to invest in those specific areas to jumpstart the economy. LiNeBrEaKA "U.S. Marine Highway" achieves those objectives as new, fuel-efficient U.S.-built ships can take thousands of trucks off U.S. roads and reduce truck carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, while also generating cargo-handling jobs at U.S. ports and jobs on U.S. ships.LiNeBrEaKThis green marine highway can be built using Maritime Administration Title XI loan guarantees rather than outright grants. Using Title XI, taxpayers would spend only $165 million to guarantee $3. 3 billion in bank loans for construction. That equates to $50 million for a ship that will carry 300 53-foot truckloads of cargo. With those funds, 66 fuel-efficient ships can be built to carry the cargo of 20,000 truckloads along the East and West Coast corridors, creating thousands of new, high-paying jobs for welders, fitters and crane operators at shipyards.LiNeBrEaKThanks to the Title XI loan guarantee program, banks can finance the construction of ships backed by a 5 percent taxpayer-financed loan loss reserve, which amounts to 5 cents for every dollar of bank loans. The loan guarantee lowers the risks to financial institutions and the ship owner pays a premium for the guarantee to defray the cost to taxpayers.LiNeBrEaKAnother taxpayer savings can be seen in the proposed $5. 5-billion widening of one highway, the 710 freeway in Southern California that connects the ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach. That $5. 5 billion is a great deal more than the $165 million in taxpayer guarantees for 66 new ships. In addition, the 710 road widening may not be necessary if a majority of the daily truckloads traveling on that road were shifted onto ships.LiNeBrEaKThe risk is further reduced because U.S. law, the Jones Act, requires that all coastal ships be built in the United States and manned by U.S. crews so the work cannot be outsourced to foreign competitors. A proposal to add default insurance to the program further reduces risk.LiNeBrEaKOne heavy truck carrying 25 tons of freight consumes 370 percent more fuel per ton than a tug and barge carrying 1,750 tons of freight. A similar size truck consumes 400 percent to 500 percent more fuel than a ship. Using ultra-low sulfur diesel, ships can reduce carbon emissions by 75 percent or more compared with a truck traveling the same distance.LiNeBrEaKFunding ships that consume only 25 percent of the fuel required to transport a truckload of freight would generate a national economic stimulus by lowering transportation costs for shippers and consumers. From an environmental standpoint, ships can be powered by ultra-low sulfur diesel, just like new, cleaner trucks. Further, batteries from solar or wind sources can soon power these ships and create zero carbon freight corridors. Truckers can then focus on short-haul harbor pick-ups and deliveries rather than wasting time and fuel in long-haul traffic.LiNeBrEaKThe marine highway will provide a more integrated transport system that can remove 20,000 truckloads of cargo from the East and West Coast corridors and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. That would generate a national economic stimulus by lowering transportation costs for shippers and consumers.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Energy companies, Wash. U. team up to study 'clean' coal  	Jeffrey Tomich, St. Louis Post-Dispatch  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	305 words  	Dec. 2--The nation's two largest coal producers and one of the largest coal-burning utilities agreed to give $12 million over five years to Washington University to help make St. Louis a national hub for clean coal research. LiNeBrEaKPeabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. will contribute $5 million apiece and Ameren Corp. will provide $2 million to help establish the Consortium for Clean Coal Utilization, Washington University Chancellor Mark S. Wrighton announced at a news conference this morning.LiNeBrEaK"The knowledge and technology we will be able to create together will over time mean lower costs to customers and global environmental improvement," Wrighton said.LiNeBrEaKCoal is used to produce half of the nation's electricity and provides fuel for 85 percent of Ameren's electric generation. However, burning coal is also a major source of carbon dioxide, the primary heat-trapping gas associated with global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe use of coal is expected to grow significantly in coming years. At the same time, scientists are urging steep cuts in carbon emissions to avoid dire environmental consequences.LiNeBrEaKWrighton and executives from the St. Louis area energy companies said the dual challenges of keeping the world energized and halting or reversing climate change necessitates research to help commercialize technologies that will help the United States and other nations meet those goals.LiNeBrEaKjtomich@post-dispatch.com -- 314-340-8320	COAL FIRED PLANTS (91%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); RESEARCH (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (90%); COAL MINING (90%); ENERGY RESEARCH (78%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (77%); SCIENCE NEWS (77%); RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (74%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (72%); PRESS CONFERENCES (71%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%)  	PEABODY ENERGY CORP (91%); AMEREN CORP (85%); ARCH COAL INC (72%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (66%)  		BTU (NYSE) (91%); AEE (NYSE) (85%); ACI (NYSE) (72%) NYSE:BTU, NYSE:ACI, NYSE:AEE  	NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (85%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (85%); NAICS212111 BITUMINOUS COAL and LIGNITE SURFACE MINING (72%); SIC1221 BITUMINOUS COAL and LIGNITE SURFACE MINING (72%) General  		SAINT LOUIS, MO, USA (92%) MISSOURI, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 3, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 St. Louis Post-Dispatch   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081202-SL-Energy-companies-Wash-U-team-up-to-study-clean-coal-1202  	SL

Tampa Tribune (Florida)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Florida Should Demand Clean, Efficient Vehicles  	Tampa Tribune, Fla.  	COMMENTARY  	624 words  	Dec. 2--Automobile lobbyists argue proposed tough state emissions standards for cars and trucks will cripple the beleaguered industry and prove costly for consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut Americans have heard such Chicken Little claims from the industry many times before.LiNeBrEaKWhat's best for the people of Florida should be obvious to the state Environmental Regulation Commission, the rule-making board that will decide today whether to endorse the emissions and fuel-efficiency standards. LiNeBrEaKMaking cars cleaner and more efficient will protect the public health, cut energy costs and improve the environment, including reducing the greenhouse emissions that contribute to climate change, which threatens Florida's coastal communities.LiNeBrEaKEven those who dismiss climate change's dangers should recognize the payoff from cleaning the air and making vehicles more economical.LiNeBrEaKThe industry claims the proposed tighter emission standards endorsed by Gov. Charlie Crist would increase the cost of a car by as much as $4,000.LiNeBrEaKBut studies have found that the price increase would be far less -- somewhere from $92 to $670 a car -- and consumers would more than recover those costs in fuel savings of from $1,000 to $2,300.LiNeBrEaKAnd the tougher standards would apply to the average vehicle emissions for the state, not to individual cars. There would be plenty of flexibility in applying the rules.LiNeBrEaKNot every type of vehicle would have to meet the standards, which are hardly unreasonable.LiNeBrEaKSome cars, including Hondas and Toyotas, already meet them. And manufacturers would have about a decade before facing any penalties. Emergency and military vehicles would be exempt from the fuel-efficiency requirements.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the proposed standards, similar to those that have been approved in California and 12 other states, would encourage the use of clean-burning ethanol. This, in turn, would give a major boost to the state's agricultural industry's plans to produce ethanol, creating jobs and making the state more energy independent.LiNeBrEaKNo one wants to add to the American automobile industry's woes, but it's in trouble precisely because it has resisted evolving to meet the needs of today's market, which demands reliable, fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKThe industry also made doom-and-gloom claims about seat belts, anti-pollution devices, air bags and other developments that ended up making vehicles safer and cleaner without the high costs that had been predicted.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, the ERC vote is not the final word. State lawmakers must approve the standards, so there will be additional time to scrutinize the likely impacts.LiNeBrEaKA year ago in a speech to homebuilders, Crist aptly explained the importance of taking a strong stand on clean air: "We have a duty to lead. It means a partnership for government with the people. We have a duty to serve them and part of that service is to protect Florida. I doubt that very many object to the fact that we're going to keep Florida clean.LiNeBrEaK"We're all in the same planet. We need to work together to make sure the environment is an issue at the forefront. It shouldn't be a political issue. It's a global issue. It's not bipartisan. It's nonpartisan."LiNeBrEaKMembers of the Environmental Regulation Commission should, as Crist says, act as leaders. They should give the go-ahead to pollution-cutting standards that will benefit the environment, consumers and the economy.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	From foe to secretary of state  	Casey Seiler, Times Union, Albany, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1001 words  	Dec. 2--Weeks of speculation and behind-the-scenes intrigue ended Monday morning as President-elect Barack Obama nominated New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to serve as his secretary of state, making his one-time chief rival for the Democratic nomination his principal foreign policy operative.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement was the first item of business at a Chicago news conference in which Obama named his national security team, which will include current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. LiNeBrEaKClinton, the first to speak after Obama introduced the new Cabinet nominees, began by thanking him for the opportunity. "I would also like to thank my fellow New Yorkers," she added, noting that her eight years representing the state have prepared her to be the nation's top diplomat.LiNeBrEaK"New Yorkers aren't afraid to speak their minds, and do so in every language," said the former first lady, who endured charges of carpetbagging during her initial campaign to emerge as a forceful advocate for the state in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.LiNeBrEaKClinton cited a long list of global challenges facing the nation, from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to global warming and the ongoing threat of terrorism. "The fate of our nation and the future of our children will be forged in the crucible of these crises," Clinton said.LiNeBrEaKThe solution, she added, would require "more partners, fewer adversaries," and an acknowledgement that global issues will be solved neither by force alone nor Americans alone.LiNeBrEaKThe question of Clinton's replacement in the Senate now falls on Gov. David Paterson, who was holding his own Cabinet meeting during Obama's announcement.LiNeBrEaK"New York will lose a powerful voice in the Senate," Paterson said in a statement released a few hours later. "But the nation will gain a powerful voice in the world."LiNeBrEaKDuring a Monday afternoon news conference at the Capitol, the governor asked the media to take a day to set aside speculation about Clinton's possible successor in order to honor her service to the state and the remarkable new turn in her career.LiNeBrEaKThe media failed to cooperate, peppering Paterson with questions about his timeline for making the decision and the criteria he'll use to assess the contenders. Asked point-blank for his opinion of Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand's fitness for the post, the governor paused.LiNeBrEaK"When you asked that question, did you think I was going to answer it?" he said.LiNeBrEaKPaterson reiterated that he would wait until after Clinton had completed confirmation hearings before naming her replacement; Clinton's office said she will not officially step down until she has been confirmed.LiNeBrEaKPossible contenders for the post include state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo as well as several current members of Congress, among them Gillibrand, Carolyn Maloney, Nydia Velazquez, Louise Slaughter and Brian Higgins. One prominent potential replacement, downstate Rep. Nita Lowey, said Monday she's not interested in the job.LiNeBrEaKClinton's replacement would face a special election in 2010 -- when Paterson's name also will appear on the ballot as he seeks his first elected term as governor -- and again in the regular Senate cycle in 2012.LiNeBrEaKA speedy decision would not send Clinton's successor to the Senate with an added margin of seniority over other freshman lawmakers: Senate Democratic Secretary Lula Davis said that even if a replacement was picked and sworn in next week, that person would be considered no more senior than any of the newly elected senators coming to Congress in January.LiNeBrEaKAn early selection would, however, have given the replacement seniority in picking office space.LiNeBrEaKThe state's senior senator, Chuck Schumer, called Clinton "a superb public servant for the people of New York, a terrific partner to work with in the Senate, and a great friend." Former President Bill Clinton posted his reaction on his wife's campaign site, commending Obama "for asking her to be a part of a great national security team. America will be well-served."LiNeBrEaKThe rest of Obama's security team includes Washington lawyer Eric Holder as attorney general and Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as homeland security secretary.LiNeBrEaKGates, who replaced Donald Rumsfeld in 2006 as President Bush's secretary of defense, will stay on the job after Obama is sworn in on Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't check his voter registration," Obama said of Gates in response to a reporter's question about whether his decision to keep the current defense secretary would be the beginning or the end of his commitment to include Republicans in his administration.LiNeBrEaKObama also named two senior foreign policy positions outside the Cabinet: campaign foreign policy adviser Susan Rice as U.N. ambassador and retired Marine Gen. James L. Jones as national security adviser.LiNeBrEaKDuring their extended primary battle, Obama and Clinton frequently traded charges of inexperience and bad judgment on issues ranging from Clinton's Senate vote in favor of the war in Iraq to Obama's professed willingness to sit down with new Cuban President Raul Castro.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Obama said Clinton's forceful intellect will help prevent his administration from falling into "groupthink."LiNeBrEaKAsked how he came to see Sen. Clinton as the best person to represent his administration around the world, Obama told reporters "It was not a light-bulb moment."LiNeBrEaK"I have always believed that she was tough and smart and disciplined, and shares my core values and the values of the American people," he said of Clinton, whose endorsement of Obama's candidacy provided one of the dramatic high points of August's Democratic National Convention.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this story.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday   Final Edition	Obama's hard choice the economy  	ROBERT J. SAMUELSON Washington Post Writers Group  	Syndicated; Pg. A14  	820 words  	WASHINGTON As he assembles his economic team, Barack Obama faces a central strategic decision that only he can make. Starting with his "economic stimulus" plan, will he focus mainly on reviving the economy and relieving the financial crisis? Or will he use the economic crisis as a vehicle to advance a more ambitious social and economic agenda? The two approaches are at odds.  LiNeBrEaKThe first aims at building political consensus and economic confidence; the second would intensify political conflict and economic uncertainty. The decision ought to be easy. Every new president is assaulted by his own supporters, who want him to put their particular agendas atop his "to do" list. That's already happening, as Obama allies clamor for speedy action to provide universal health insurance, combat global warming and support trade unions. But Obama and the nation would be better served if he concentrated for his first year on stabilizing the economy while patiently laying the groundwork for more far-reaching proposals. The hallmark of this economic crisis has been its capacity to surprise: the desperate plight of the Big Three U.S. automakers is the latest reminder. We can expect more surprises, because the U.S. and global economies continue to weaken at a worrying pace. Consumer confidence has plunged. In October, U.S. factory orders for durable goods (machinery, autos, appliances) dropped 6. 2 percent. Abroad, signs are no better. Worldwide manufacturing production is declining at an 8 percent rate. Germany is in recession; China's growth has slowed sharply. Against this backdrop, the parallel pursuit of crisis management and sweeping domestic reform is at best distracting. In practice, it may be politically poisonous. Superficially, the two objectives can be made to seem compatible. Obama can plug "green" investments as a way to restore job growth; he can tout a more efficient health-care system as a way to control health costs. But these rhetorical debating points obscure as much as they reveal. Any program to refashion the energy and health-care sectors to take these obvious candidates would be complicated and contentious. Some producers and consumers would win; others would lose. Proposals would create massive uncertainties for businesses and raise the probability of higher costs. To succeed in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, for example, any "cap and trade" program must involve higher energy prices. The notion that "green" investments would be large, permanent net creators of jobs is mostly a mirage. Somehow these investments must be paid for. If that happens through higher prices, higher taxes or cuts in other government programs, then "green" jobs will mainly substitute for other types of jobs. As for curbing health-care costs, that's desirable. The trouble is that the first effect of Obama's health-care program would probably be the opposite. Expanding insurance coverage would initially raise health spending, as greater demand for medical care met a (relatively) fixed supply of doctors, hospitals and clinics. Obama won the election, and in normal times, his campaign agenda ought to be front and center. But these are not normal times, and what's most important now as he repeatedly emphasizes is to prevent the recession from feeding on itself. This is a clear danger. Consumer spending (70 percent of the economy) has declined for five consecutive months. Eroding tax revenues may result in state budget deficits between $200 billion and $250 billion through mid-2011, estimates the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal advocacy group. Required to balance their budgets, states face increased taxes or large spending cuts. The compelling case for a big "economic stimulus" package is that it would cushion these and other spending declines. The odds are that any package will include the following: some direct payments to states; a renewed extension of unemployment benefits; tax cuts reflecting Obama's campaign pledge of $500 for most single workers and $1,000 for most two-earner families; spending for infrastructure (roads, bridges, schools and, perhaps, windmills). Obama wants Congress to pass a stimulus package soon after his inauguration. Assuming he gets his wish, it's then that he must make his crucial choice. The temptation will be to press ahead with a "bold" legislative agenda to ape the New Deal. This would be a mistake. The psychology of bruising legislative battles will not bolster confidence. The country does need to face its health and energy problems as well as deficit-ridden federal budgets. But trying to do too much too soon risks doing none of it well. We and he are caught up in a web of contradictions. In the long run, we need to discipline our appetite for health care and energy; we need to reconcile our desire for government benefits and our willingness to be taxed. But Obama's first job is to avert an economic freefall.

The Washington Times 	December 2, 2008 Tuesday 	Money being made from warming scare  	By Larry Thornberry, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PLUGGED IN - POLITICS; POLITICAL BOOKS; B01  	575 words  	Christopher C. Horner has deconstructed global-warming alarmism before, but in "Red Hot Lies," he focuses on how the global-warming industry, with huge money and power on the line, defends itself and perpetuates its beliefs.LiNeBrEaKThe senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute shows readers scientists, bureaucrats, journal editors and government agency administrators acting more like con men and mob enforcers than objective seekers of truth. LiNeBrEaKIn the current global-warming lobby, Mr. Horner points out that leftists who want ever bigger government with hypertaxation and microregulation of every aspect of our lives find common cause with large companies that stand to make a bundle if alternative energy forms are mandated and/or one of the carbon-fuel-rationing schemes is adopted.LiNeBrEaK(With billions in government research grants, there's more money in alarmism than on the skeptical side, worth remembering when a skeptic is accused of being in the pocket of "Big Oil" - no alarmist is ever accused of being in the pocket of Big Research Grants.) These two groups are enabled by a compliant press that relishes sensational scare stories and by politicians ever eager for ways to show their virtue and ways to appear to be saving their constituents.LiNeBrEaKIn his first book, "The Politically Incorrect Guide to Global Warming (and Environmentalism)" (Regnery, 2007) Mr. Horner parsed the fanciful claims of the global warmers. He built the case, infrequently encountered by the public, that the warming our planet has undergone over the past century is almost certainly nothing outside of the normal temperature variations the Earth has been undergoing since there's been an Earth. Man's activities may have played a part in this small temperature increase, but almost certainly a trifling part compared to variations in solar activity.LiNeBrEaKThere remain plenty of honest scientists who go to work every day with no other objective than to look for the truth, wherever it leads. But the saddest casualties of the sorry global-warming story are the many scientists who have been corrupted by the oceans of grant money they and their universities are awash in and that will remain available only if the heat is kept up (so to speak) on the global-warming threat to mankind.LiNeBrEaKMr. Horner shows how these folks will do just about anything to keep this gravy train going. This includes playing with the data to keep the horrendous story of global catastrophe before the public. It also includes denying jobs, publications and promotions as well as sullying the reputations of "heretics" who dare to question the warming-catastrophe orthodoxy. Alarmists have succeeded in characterizing disagreement with them as either, in Mr. Horner's words, "daft or venal."LiNeBrEaKReaders will see how ruthlessly Big Environment plays the political game in Washington. Mr. Horner shows these folks are not the philanthropic, self-sacrificing lovers of trees and birds they paint themselves to be, a picture the media allows them to perpetuate.LiNeBrEaKMr. Horner tells this ugly story in detail and with wit and verve. How Americans deal with the global-warming hustle and with the industry that has built up to promote and defend it may determine the future of self-government.

Billings Gazette (Billings, Montana)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Billings, Mont., to make $20 million from landfill gas  	Matt Hagengruber, Billings Gazette, Mont.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1874 words  	Dec. 1--The city of Billings stands to make at least $20 million over 40 years after signing a deal with Montana-Dakota Utilities to sell methane from the city landfill. With the deal, the city turns a liability into an asset.LiNeBrEaKBut some are disappointed that the city gave away what could be millions of dollars in energy credits to MDU -- credits that may be worth more than the gas itself.LiNeBrEaK"It's as if you're selling a house without knowing the value of house, and you didn't know how many bedrooms the house had," said Jeff Griffin, a Billings environmental consultant who tried, beginning in April, to persuade the city to change the deal.LiNeBrEaKGriffin has worked for the United Nations and is certified as a carbon auditor for a company based in Germany. He runs a consulting business in Billings and is finding more work in energy credits. LiNeBrEaKBut city officials and others in the waste business are quick to point out that the carbon market is speculative and untested, and few outside that business truly understand what's going on.LiNeBrEaK"It is a commodity market, and I simply don't have the staff to do that," City Administrator Tina Volek said. "We have a project that will bring us an estimated $500,000 a year. We're expecting revenue from that, and we're not investing anything."LiNeBrEaKCarbon credits and renewable energy credits, also called RECs, are a market-based method to combat global warming. Energy credit buyers are companies that are emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Credit sellers are those that are voluntarily doing things to prevent greenhouse gas emissions. The system works like any market in which buyers and sellers agree on price.LiNeBrEaKIn the future, the thinking goes, the government may require companies to buy and spend energy credits if they emit greenhouse gases, so many companies are stockpiling credits before that happens. Landfills across the country are selling their energy credits now because they're preventing the emissions voluntarily. Once landfills and others are forced to stop emissions, their credits become worthless.LiNeBrEaKIn early versions of the landfill contract, written by MDU more than a year ago, the utility company received 100 percent of any energy credits generated by the project. That worried Councilwoman Jani McCall, who asked in early August to meet with Volek and Public Works Director Dave Mumford. She brought Griffin to the meeting.LiNeBrEaKGriffin said he told Volek and Mumford that the energy credits could be worth at least $300,000 a year and that there was no reason to give all of them to MDU. Griffin now thinks that the credits could be worth closer to $800,000 a year and that they belong to the city because it owns the landfill and the methane. MDU is simply the company that has agreed to extract the methane from the landfill, Griffin said.LiNeBrEaK"City staff people were getting calls weekly from people who wanted to get these carbon credits," Griffin said. "There are companies out there that have lists of these old landfills, and they're calling every week. The city was just giving them to MDU."LiNeBrEaKA recent Wall Street Journal article cited several landfills across the country that were selling carbon credits, including one in New Jersey that sold credits for almost $430,000 in nine months. The credits can be sold every year because the methane keeps flowing.LiNeBrEaKIn Fargo, N.D., solid-waste manager Terry Ludlum said his landfill earns credits by burning off some methane, piping some to a nearby sunflower seed plant and burning the rest for electricity generation. Ludlum said Fargo earlier this year was one of just seven cities considered full members of the Chicago Climate Exchange. Because of its work since 2001, the exchange awarded the landfill about 170,000 credits retroactively.LiNeBrEaKFor several months, city officials in Fargo watched the price of carbon credits climb on the Chicago exchange before pulling the trigger on a sale. In March, they sold the credits for $712,000.LiNeBrEaKNow Ludlum said the landfill hopes to earn close to 100,000 credits a year. He said the city expects to make about $500,000 annually on the gas sales and at least another $500,000 on energy credits. The city also has an innovative wastewater project that brings in about $1 million a year.LiNeBrEaK"That was the difference between raising taxes or not in Fargo," he said. "The mayor recommended no mill levy increase due to the renewable energy projects."LiNeBrEaKBut Ludlum said he understands Volek's concerns about jumping into the energy credit market. He said he had to spend about 20 hours a week for several years to figure out the process, and minor errors in capturing methane cost the landfill about half its credits last year.LiNeBrEaK"I basically did the work myself," Ludlum said. "It was about 18 months of my life I'll never get back, but it's worth it in the long run."LiNeBrEaKIn Montana's Flathead County, Public Works Director Dave Prunty said his landfill had teamed up with a local electric cooperative to generate electricity using landfill methane. The county and the co-op agreed to split any energy credits evenly.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of gas and credits to be generated in Flathead County is tiny compared with Billings. The Billings landfill is projected to give off 1,480 cubic feet of landfill gas per minute, compared with 250 to 450 cubic feet per minute in Flathead County. But Prunty said word got out quickly that his landfill would someday have credits it could sell.LiNeBrEaK"When our story got out, my phone started ringing, and my counterpart at the co-op, his phone started ringing," Prunty said. "It's amazing how quickly word travels. They jumped us like flies to the gut pile."LiNeBrEaKOne carbon credit equals one metric ton of carbon dioxide that isn't released into the air. Because methane is about 20 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide, capturing 1 ton of methane generates 20 times as many credits as a ton of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThe amount of credits to be generated by the Billings landfill is still unknown, but Griffin's calculations put the figure at about 118,000 credits per year.LiNeBrEaKBillings could sell its credits for about $7 each now, according to Jeff Liebert, co-founder of the Verdeo Group, a Washington, D.C.-based company that deals in carbon offsets. Liebert, who has worked with Griffin, said he expects prices to climb to about $15 over the next few years. At $7 a credit, Billings' credits are worth about $825,000 a year.LiNeBrEaKAfter the August meeting with McCall and Griffin, the city staff renegotiated with MDU to break the 40-year contract into four 10-year segments. MDU also agreed to give the city 15 percent of the energy credits, which means an annual windfall for the city of about $124,000. MDU's credits could be worth about $700,000 a year, if the company decided to sell them.LiNeBrEaKMumford said that 15 percent of the credits is better than none and that the deal can be changed later.LiNeBrEaK"We get pure profit for doing nothing more than owning land," Mumford said. "MDU wanted all of the credits, but what we got is 15 percent, and all of that is renegotiated at the 10-year mark. They drove somewhat of a hard bargain on that because we don't have the resources to build this and go in there with all those people.LiNeBrEaK"We have a good arrangement. Was it one that swung all in our favor? Probably not, but I feel comfortable with it."LiNeBrEaKLiebert also said the deal wasn't too skewed, as MDU is making all the capital investment.LiNeBrEaK"I'm quite impressed that a utility is willing to put up the capital. That's pretty progressive," he said. "But 100,000 credits is a lot of credits to get your hands on in Montana. If a utility wants credits from a landfill, that means they're high-quality credits."LiNeBrEaKMcCall said MDU would still have 100 percent of the credits had she and Griffin not intervened. She said MDU threatened to pull out of the deal if the negotiations became too bogged down.LiNeBrEaK"I think the city had gone so far down the path that they didn't want to have to back up," McCall said. "The only reason we got 15 percent is because I pushed the issue. My sense was that there wasn't a lot of knowledge of these credits and their value."LiNeBrEaKOthers wondered why the city didn't seek proposals from other companies. Mumford said that working with MDU was the best arrangement, because it is the only gas supplier in the area and MDU would be buying 100 percent of the gas. Trying to work with another company didn't guarantee that all the gas could be sold, Mumford said.LiNeBrEaK"MDU is only one that sells natural gas by pipeline here. Anyone else would be a third party selling it to MDU," he said. "Our contract says that they're required to buy our gas if it's produced at the landfill."LiNeBrEaKGriffin said other companies would have jumped at the project given the chance, and they probably would have offered better terms to the city. Griffin said the problem lies with city staff members who don't understand energy credits.LiNeBrEaK"Even at that meeting, Mumford didn't understand that his own contract was giving all the carbon credits and RECs to MDU," Griffin said. "It wasn't a priority. Dave just wanted it off his desk. I can see that, but my point in the meeting with him was, 'Think of it as an asset, not a liability." "LiNeBrEaKRick Reid, the regional head of MDU, dismissed Griffin's concerns and said energy credits don't mean as much now because the demand for them is purely speculative.LiNeBrEaK"We felt that 15 percent was fair and equitable," he said. "If, in 10 years, they are of more value than we think they're going to be, it can be renegotiated. It's easy to sit back and take pot shots at what somebody has done, but the entire City Council voted for it."LiNeBrEaKCity officials may also have seen Griffin as angling for business. He admitted as much, telling Mumford that he would be willing to help out the city if it wanted to renegotiate the contract.LiNeBrEaK"For some reason, I got tagged as the greedy consultant," Griffin said.LiNeBrEaKMcCall wishes that the city had received more energy credits.LiNeBrEaK"If these credits have no value, why were 100 percent of the credits going to go MDU?" McCall said.LiNeBrEaKWhen the contract came before the City Council on Aug. 25, McCall, while still thinking the city deserved more of the energy credits, voted for it along with all her colleagues. She hopes that the city will renegotiate for more energy credits in 10 years.LiNeBrEaKOthers, like Councilman Ed Ulledalen, agreed with the city staff that a risk-free investment with such a large return was worth it for the cash-strapped city. A financial adviser, Ulledalen said the city's cut of 15 percent of the gas sales is similar to what a rancher might receive for selling the rights to underground natural gas.LiNeBrEaK"It was more favorable to get the cash flow," he said. "Should we take the risk and bid this out or take the $500,000 in revenue starting next year? If you get too creative, you might end up with nothing. It's like trying to catch a knife."

The Boston Globe 	December 1, 2008 Monday   THIRD EDITION	DNA gleaned from ancient coral unlocks clues about warming  	Bina Venkataraman GLOBE CORRESPONDENT  	HEALTHSCIENCE; Pg. A11  	925 words  	The skeletons in the Earth's closet reveal not only a dark past. They also cast a light on its future.LiNeBrEaKThat is what Tim Shank discovered when he sent an underwater robot to sweep up a basket full of broccoli-like fossils from volcanoes under the sea. Shank, a researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found skeletons of 35,000- to 40,000-year-old corals littered on the New England Seamounts in the North Atlantic. He took them back to his laboratory, extracted what he could of their remaining DNA fragments, and started to piece together their past.LiNeBrEaKTheir story - and similar ones gleaned from the DNA of ancient spiders entombed in ice cores, and the bones of dodos and woolly mammoths - tells us how ancient creatures survived or disappeared as a result of dramatic climate changes. That, in turn, provides a preview of how today's flora and fauna might react to global warming. LiNeBrEaKThese kind of "ancient DNA" studies have become possible in the past few years, and from them researchers have been able to piece together not just when and where long-gone plants and animals lived, but how species adapted, migrated, or perished during periods of melting glaciers and warming temperatures. When scientists recently announced that they had decoded most of the woolly mammoth's genome, it was another sign of dramatic progress in sequencing the DNA of extinct and dead organisms.LiNeBrEaK"Ten or 12 years ago, maybe even five years ago, this would have been science fiction," said Ross MacPhee, curator of vertebrate zoology at New York's American Museum of Natural History. "This is a totally brave new world that's been actualized by modern genomic sequences."LiNeBrEaKIt was three years ago that Shank began his coral project. Since then, he and his team have found that the cold-water corals, many as vibrant as their tropical counterparts, did not do as well when ocean temperatures rose and currents changed during warmer periods in the planet's past. "In some cases, they went deeper; in others they had massive die-offs," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe deep-sea corals represent the fate of a wealth of marine life. Commercial fish species cluster around them and shift their populations as the corals do. As the Atlantic Ocean heats up as a result of the current global warming trend, Shank worries that fish populations will decline or migrate. Some species, he said, may even go extinct.LiNeBrEaKThe stories revealed by ancient DNA are not all dismal. Genetic study of polar bear fossils predicts a better fate for the endangered species.LiNeBrEaKBefore 2007, it was thought that polar bears evolved from the brown bear fairly recently in the planet's history. But three years ago, a DNA study of polar bear fossils showed that the polar bear originated nearly 130,000 years ago. That means the species survived the last interglacial period of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery gives MacPhee hope about the polar bear's fate in the coming decades. "It's possible they will survive, even though they will suffer," he said.LiNeBrEaKOther studies have revealed that climate played a bigger role in past extinctions than once thought. Ancient DNA showed that bison populations, for example, lost nearly all their genetic diversity about 37,000 years ago - well before humans were hunting their tracks.LiNeBrEaK"It tells us that the environment has a significant impact," said Beth Shapiro, one of the authors of the bison study and a leading researcher in the field. "Humans may not have started the extinction, but they may have ultimately caused it."LiNeBrEaKThe first recognized ancient DNA study was done in the early 1980s, when scientists pulled a short segment of DNA from the preserved skin and teeth of a quagga, an extinct zebra from southern Africa. "It showed that it was possible to extract DNA from dead stuff, which people were excited about," said Shapiro, also an evolutionary biology professor at Pennsylvania State University. Only in the past three years or so, however, have scientists been able to study how entire populations of extinct and dead animals changed genetically in the past.LiNeBrEaK"All of this is really in its early stages," Shapiro said, noting that technical and statistical methods had to catch up to the fervor to decode the DNA of extinct animals.LiNeBrEaKAncient DNA is, for obvious reasons, not easy to come by, and researchers are under increasing pressure to prove the authenticity of their specimens. One reason is that it is painstaking work to keep ancient DNA samples free of contamination by human hair and skin cells while studying it.LiNeBrEaKAnother is that some scientists have not shown proper caution. In the mid-1990s, after the release of the dystopic novel and movie "Jurassic Park" in which fictional scientists used DNA preserved in amber-encased mosquitoes to create dinosaurs, some researchers said they isolated dinosaur DNA. The assertion was discredited when the DNA was discovered to be human.LiNeBrEaKResearchers have yet to find well-preserved DNA fragments for specimen older than a few hundred thousand years. And even if they could find a few DNA fragments for a Tyrannosaurus Rex, it is highly unlikely that they could decode the entire genome or replicate genes that govern the growth process from egg to adult.LiNeBrEaKEven without such a showstopper, ancient DNA study is illuminating our understanding of the past - and holds tremendous promise for helping us understand the impact of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We can turn the page back in history," said Shank, at Woods Hole. "But the real goal is to say: `What's going to happen the next time?"'

The Boston Globe 	December 1, 2008 Monday   THIRD EDITION	10 firms join panel on green business Environmental efficiency is key  	Stephanie Ebbert Globe Staff  	METRO; Pg. B3  	589 words  	Meet Beacon Hill's newest environmental advocates: Legal Sea Foods, Genzyme, and Millipore. LiNeBrEaKTen leading Boston-area companies have joined a corporate council of the Environmental League of Massachusetts to advocate for environmental policies, help develop new regulations, and provide a counterpoint to the loud business lobbies that protest environmental regulations claiming they will quash economic growth.  LiNeBrEaK"The purpose is to make clear that a healthy environment and a healthy economy are not in conflict," said George Bachrach, the former state senator and congressional candidate who took over as head of the Environmental League last year.LiNeBrEaKThe council includes Cape Wind Associates, which wants to build a wind farm in Nantucket Sound; and Triumvirate Environmental, which handles environmental and hazardous waste; as well as companies with missions far beyond the environment - Millipore, a Billerica life sciences company that has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions; Genzyme, whose Cambridge headquarters features LEED-certified green architecture; Stop and Shop; Grossman Marketing; NStar; Legal Sea Foods; Shawmut Design and Construction; and Saunders Hotel Group.LiNeBrEaK"When you're talking about groups like Genzyme and Millipore - these are major businesses that I think any politician who is trying to get a good understanding of an issue is going to want to listen to such major players," said Tedd Saunders, chief environmental officer for Saunders Hotel Group, a council member and a leader in greening hotels.LiNeBrEaKThe group is being formed after a string of environmental victories on Beacon Hill. One of the missions of the council will be to help advise the state on how it can satisfy the new Global Warming Solutions Act, which calls for dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"There is a belief that we are at a tipping point in terms of the commitment to alternative energy and that to accomplish that will require a whole new set of technology companies and that can become a whole new economic engine," said Bachrach. "A separate piece is how do we get existing companies to establish energy efficiencies and do the right thing? That is where these guys are the leaders."LiNeBrEaKWhile the Environmental League views its corporate council members as leaders in their industries, it is not suggesting that their environmental practices are completely unblemished or that they will agree on every policy issue, Bachrach said.LiNeBrEaKBut they hope to provide a corporate counterpoint to powerful business lobbies like Associated Industries of Massachusetts, which often fights additional regulation by arguing that it will suppress the business climate.LiNeBrEaKRobert A. Rio, senior vice president for Associated Industries, said his association prefers that other firms do not turn their social concern into mandates.LiNeBrEaK"To the extent that some of these programs increase costs even marginally, some companies may not be in the same position to pass those costs along," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe argued that his group is not anti-environment, and that it also represents corporate leaders in environmental stewardship.LiNeBrEaKRio noted that he will be working, along with Genzyme, on an Energy Efficiency Advisory Council to update the state's energy efficiency programs under the new Green Communities Act.LiNeBrEaKRick Heller, senior vice president and general counsel for Legal Sea Foods, said, "A lot of times environmental groups don't speak with businesses and frankly, businesses and environmental groups have more in common than sometimes they think they do."

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Prepping for a nuclear rebound  	Dave Flessner, Chattanooga Times/Free Press, Tenn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1090 words  	Dec. 1--Laid off from the Dorsey Corp. after five years on the job, Paul Talbott wanted a more stable career.LiNeBrEaKThe 44-year-old Highland Park resident thinks he has found it in the nuclear power industry.LiNeBrEaKMr. Talbott is enrolled this fall in a new program at Chattanooga State Technical Community College that could put nearly 40 radiation protection technicians in the field by 2010, each with the potential to earn more than $50,000 a year. LiNeBrEaK"Nuclear power looks like an industry that is going to be recessionproof, and it's a well-paying industry with a bright future," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe prospect of a revival of nuclear power construction across the South is enticing more students such as Mr. Talbott to pursue careers in the nuclear industry. The Tennessee Valley Authority projects it will need to hire about 250 workers a year to replace retiring workers in its nuclear power division. The federal utility and others may hire thousands more workers if they move ahead with pending applications to build the next generation of nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaK"This industry is growing, and we know there will be a demand for more workers," said Tim McGhee, head of the engineering technology department at Chattanooga State, which recently reinstated its radiation protection technology program at the request of TVA.LiNeBrEaKDireaka Brown, a 33-year-old licensed practical nurse at Erlanger hospital, is studying in Chattanooga State's new program to join the burgeoning industry.LiNeBrEaK"It was a real calling for me, and I feel like I can help protect people in this job," the East Brainerd resident said.LiNeBrEaKNo new nuclear plants have been started in the United States in more than three decades. But in the past year, TVA, Southern Co. and four other utilities in the South have begun preparing plans for new nuclear plants.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities have asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for one of the new streamlined, combined operating licenses to build a Westinghouse AP-1000 reactor, which is designed to be simpler, safer and less expensive than the current generation of plants.LiNeBrEaKCritics of nuclear power question the wisdom of investing more in a technology that still hasn't found a permanent repository for its radioactive wastes.LiNeBrEaK"The massive costs of building nuclear plants just isn't worth it," said Sandy Kurtz, a Chattanooga environmental activist for the anti-nuclear group Bellefonte Efficiency and Sustainability Team. "We would create more jobs investing in efficiency and renewable power than we will investing in nuclear power."LiNeBrEaKBut supporters of nuclear power insist more reactors are needed to meet the growing demand for electricity without the greenhouse gases from coal- or gas-fired power plants that add to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"As the Obama administration prepares to take office, a central question is whether or not we are going to advance nuclear power," said U.S. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn. "I'll tell you, if we do advance nuclear, it will dramatically help our region become more resilient during a down economic time."LiNeBrEaKTo supply parts for such plants, Westinghouse and Alstom Power Co. are expanding their Chattanooga facilities and Chicago Bridge and Iron Co. has bought 60 acres on the Tennessee River in Marion County for a fabrication plant. Collectively, the nuclear supply companies could hire nearly 800 more local workers in the next couple of years.LiNeBrEaKThe nuclear component makers in metropolitan Chattanooga, combined with planned startups of new nuclear reactors in Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama, make Chattanooga a hub for the growing revival of nuclear power, Chattanooga Mayor Ron Littlefield said.LiNeBrEaK"We have a rich heritage in nuclear power here, and I think that will be even bigger in the future," he said.LiNeBrEaKJ. Wayne Cropp, chief executive of Chattanooga's Enterprise Center, which promotes local technology-related growth plans, said his group is working with the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce to recruit more nuclear power suppliers to the area.LiNeBrEaK"We're trying to figure out how best to position Chattanooga for the nuclear renaissance that we anticipate in this country," Mr. Cropp said. "We are a great manufacturing city with rail and river access and a developing engineering and science base, so we have a lot to offer this industry."LiNeBrEaKNuclear power was birthed in East Tennessee from research done in Oak Ridge, where the Oak Ridge National Laboratory still spends nearly $100 million a year on research related to nuclear power technologies.LiNeBrEaKTVA is spending $2. 5 billion to finish a second reactor at its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant near Spring City that could be the last reactor of its kind to be completed in America. TVA also is the reference applicant for the AP-1000 reactors proposed to be built at TVA's Bellefonte Nuclear Plant in Hollywood, Ala.LiNeBrEaKSouthern Co. may move ahead of TVA with its plans for two AP-1000 reactors at its Plant Vogtle nuclear site near Waynesboro, Ga. Dalton Utilities plans to invest about $190 million in the new Vogtle reactors, utility President Don Cope said.LiNeBrEaKSuch investments, combined with the retirement of baby boomer workers who have staffed nuclear plants since the 1970s, are creating a renewed demand for nuclear plant workers.LiNeBrEaKDonna Curry, recruiting program manager for TVA's nuclear program, said TVA needs to hire 440 workers in the next three years just for its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. If new reactors are built at the Bellefonte site as proposed, TVA officials say another 1,000 workers will be needed, in addition to the thousands of construction workers needed to build the new plants.LiNeBrEaKThe nuclear renaissance in the South helped attract Andrea Sterdis to TVA in Chattanooga from her previous job with Westinghouse in Pittsburgh.LiNeBrEaK"The potential of being a part of this nuclear renaissance was reason enough to attract me to Chattanooga far from my home and family," she said. "It's a new environment down here. When we had meetings down in North Alabama (about building new units at Bellefonte), we were received so openly for the work we are doing down there that I just want to make sure we continue that and keep this excitement moving ahead."

The Lima News (Ohio)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: A sharp left turn  	The Lima News, Ohio  	COMMENTARY  	705 words  	Dec. 1--Change is all the rage these days in Washington. While relative newcomer President-elect Barack Obama popularized the idea, it may be an old hand who demonstrates it most forcefully.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Rep. Henry Waxman reportedly surprised even many insiders when he was elected Nov. 20 by secret ballot of Democrats to head the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, ousting Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, the longest-serving member in the House. This was no mere changing of the guard. More moderate, more pragmatic and a defender of Detroit's auto industry (which, by extension, means a defender of numerous Ohio jobs), Dingell often has warred with Waxman, one of the House's farthest left liberals who has served since 1974.LiNeBrEaKThe leadership change should bring quick and dramatic action in areas under Waxman's purview, such as global warming, alternative fuels and health care, which is to say vastly more government interference, mandates and imposed costs. If Waxman gets his way, the short-term effect will be felt here in Ohio and other parts of the Midwest, as his camp would cripple an already weakened domestic auto industry. The long-term effects would be bad news for the entire nation. LiNeBrEaKA contributor to an online forum of the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Press offered a precise synopsis: "Dingell was a liberal Democrat but he is somewhat sane on energy issues and the 2nd amendment. Waxman is a rabid barking moonbat on those issues."LiNeBrEaKPerhaps for fear of worsening the economy, Presidentelect Obama already has sent signals that he might not move quite as quickly or as far left as the left end of his party might have been expecting. He could be tested soon by zealous Waxman, who will be in a position to push his government-interventionist preferences more aggressively. Waxman worked to create the Environmental Protection Agency and advanced auto emission and anti-pollution regulations while expanding Medicare.LiNeBrEaK"This should provide a loud wake-up call to American business leaders that the 111th Congress is not going to play nicely with them on energy rationing policies," warned Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy with the Competitive Enterprise Institute free market think tank.LiNeBrEaKThat's going to frustrate those of us who want some measure of common sense in government. The free market is dead on energy and commerce in the House for now. More frightening, a Democratic Senate and White House following Waxman's lead would leave small-government advocates like Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana, and Bob Latta, R-Bowling Green, powerless to even slow them. The Democratic majority in the Senate is large enough that even the smallest number of Republicans wavering on a filibuster would give Democrats the 60 votes to end one. The hope, then, is that Obama will be the force keeping the likes of Waxman in check.LiNeBrEaKCongress toyed last year with cap-and-trade global warming legislation, a proposal that allows companies to meet emissions targets through "trade," but which is estimated to produce a cumulative gross domestic product loss of $4. 8 trillion by 2030, says a Heritage Foundation analysis. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Ebell says Waxman's cap-and-trade bill introduced last month is much worse, and it "would send us back to the stone age."LiNeBrEaKThere may be dispute over how much damage such government interference can do, and even whether global warming poses a threat. But there's no dispute about Waxman's intentions. As the San Francisco Chronicle noted, Waxman's committee leadership --in his own words -- amounts to "an opportunity that maybe only comes once in a generation."LiNeBrEaKWill the new president, who has conspicuously and surprisingly appointed many centrists so far in his administration, be willing to rush as far leftward as quickly as Waxman may desire? Let's hope not.

The Marin Independent Journal (Novato, California)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: How far 'out there' is Marin's new ad slogan?  	The Marin Independent Journal, Novato, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	358 words  	Dec. 1--THE NEW PITCH: "Marin, just a little out there," may be a little too out there for many locals.LiNeBrEaKThe slogan, the brainstorm of the Marin Tourism Bureau, will be used to lure tourists -- and their cash -- to the county. LiNeBrEaKWe prefer "Only in Marin," a well-worn slogan that San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen leaned on to introduce the latest quirky items generated by residents on this side of the Golden Gate.LiNeBrEaKHe never seemed to run short of such gems.LiNeBrEaKThe phrase sort of says it all, naming the geography and illustrating a uniqueness, which always seems to help attract visitors.LiNeBrEaKIt's not "a little out there;" it's right here -- only here.LiNeBrEaKA Google search of the phrase "Only in Marin" comes up with 31,600 entries, from real estate listing to a blogger bashing locals for driving SUVs to hear Al Gore preach about global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut the tourist bureau wants a new pitch.LiNeBrEaKWhat do you think?LiNeBrEaKIJ readers reacted quickly to Tuesday's story about the new Marin "brand."LiNeBrEaK"This is the stupidest, most absurd and insulting thing I have heard in a long time," one online reader wrote in Web site comments following the story.LiNeBrEaKOther reactions: "An embarrassment," "totally bogus," "indefensible," "pathetic" and "completely regressive."LiNeBrEaKObviously, they feel there is room for improvement.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the slogan is not trying to sell us on Marin. We're already here.LiNeBrEaKAnother response -- likely tongue in cheek -- suggested: "Come one ... come all."LiNeBrEaK"I gotLiNeBrEaKone: 'Go away,'" added another.LiNeBrEaKWhat do you think?LiNeBrEaKLet us you know what you think about Marin's new tourism slogan.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Climate change increases problems for Florida reefs: DESPITE NEW FEDERAL PROTECTIONS, ELKHORN CORAL MAY DISAPPEAR FROM THE WATERS OFF THE COAST OF S. FLORIDA  	Curtis Morgan, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1105 words  	Dec. 1--The last, largest stands of ancient elkhorn coral survive in shallow waters off North Key Largo, where rough seas sometimes expose thick golden branches reaching toward the sunlit surface.LiNeBrEaKForty years ago, elkhorn grew in dense forests that would cover parking lots. Now, the biggest clump would barely fill one space.LiNeBrEaKIn another 40 years, elkhorn could disappear altogether -- along with just about every other hard coral forming South Florida's once-vibrant barrier reefs. LiNeBrEaKFederal regulators last week designated a 1,329-square-mile strip of sea bottom stretching from southern Palm Beach County to the Dry Tortugas as critical habitat for elkhorn and staghorn corals, two species that have long formed the foundation of barrier reefs off Florida and in the Caribbean.LiNeBrEaKBut a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund and co-authored by two University of Miami scientists argues localized protections will do little to address the biggest threat to reefs.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is not only accelerating problems that already have sickened and shrunken coral reefs, it has created a new, potentially more lethal threat: Increasingly acidic ocean waters that can reduce living coral to dead rubble.LiNeBrEaKThe report, "Corals and Climate Change: Florida's Natural Treasures at Risk," concludes that 5,000-year-old reefs, which support an array of marine life, will be among the first ecosystems to collapse if greenhouse gas levels continue to rise in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK"All of the forecasts show that at the rate we're going that somewhere at the middle or the end of the century, it's going to be very challenging for corals," said Harold Wanless, UM's chairman of geological sciences.LiNeBrEaKWanless, who has studied rising sea levels in South Florida for decades, is one of the report's six co-authors, along with department colleague James Klaus, a UM assistant professor. The others: Terry Gibson, longtime environmental journalist in Florida; Patricia Foster-Turley, wildlife biologist based in Fernandina Beach; and Karen Florini and Thomas Olson, attorneys with the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKGREENHOUSE EMISSIONSLiNeBrEaKJerry Karnas, director of Environmental Defense's Florida climate project, said the report bolsters the case for dramatic state, federal and international steps to reduce greenhouse emissions -- particularly of carbon dioxide -- largely produced by cars and power plants burning fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK"We're ground zero for impacts," said Karnas, who served on Gov. Charlie Crist's climate action team.LiNeBrEaKThe report doesn't break new ground but it does compile the latest studies of reef decline, threats and ripple effects on both the environment and economy.LiNeBrEaKIt estimates the loss of reefs, which are a magnet for tourists, divers and anglers, would cost 70,000 jobs and $5. 5 billion in sales annually in five southeast counties alone: Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe, Palm Beach and Martin.LiNeBrEaKStaghorn and elkhorn corals, the first coral species to be listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act in May 2006, came under new federal protection issued last week.LiNeBrEaKOnce the major reef builders in South Florida's shallow barrier reefs, the large corals, whose stalks resemble the horns of their animal namesakes, have declined by as much as 97 percent off the Florida Keys and the Caribbean. Scattered colonies also have been found off Broward and Palm Beach counties.LiNeBrEaKLast month, the National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations focused on direct human damage from anchoring, groundings, fishing, pollution and collection -- similar to protections already in place in the Florida Keys National Marine Keys sanctuary.LiNeBrEaKThe agency followed up last week by designating waters less than 30 feet deep off the Southeast coast -- from Boynton Beach to the Dry Tortugas -- as critical habitat for the corals. It's only about a third the size originally proposed, eliminating sections of Florida Bay and northern waters where the agency ruled the corals have not been historically found.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and many scientists argue the new protections don't address broader and increasing assaults on reefs, including assorted diseases and bouts of coral bleaching -- a whitening that can weaken corals.LiNeBrEaKBleaching, linked to warming ocean temperatures, is just one of threat posed by climate change. Another one call ocean "acidification" is a potentially far more damaging, said Chris Langdon, a professor at UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.LiNeBrEaKA NEW STRESSORLiNeBrEaK"This is a new stressor over and on top of everything you have heard about already," said Langdon, whose is among several UM scientists who have chronicled rising acidity in oceans.LiNeBrEaKSimply put, oceans absorb much of the atmosphere's excess carbon dioxide, where it dissolves. The resulting rise in the acidity of sea water -- it's jumped 30 percent over the last century -- can cripple corals, which are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, light and chemistry.LiNeBrEaKIt hinders polyps -- the tiny living animals inside coral -- from processing calcium, an essential component to building the hard coral skeleton that shelter them and build reefs. As ocean acidity increases, Langdon said, the rates of coral growth and reproduction slow and the swaths of the ocean where they can survive shrink.LiNeBrEaKThe coral itself also becomes thinner, more brittle and vulnerable to disease, hurricanes, human damage and natural parasites. Wanless likened what can happened to weakened or damaged reefs to "termites going at a complex of wood." Corals can literally dissolve into calcified sediment.LiNeBrEaKIf carbon dioxide emissions aren't curtailed, the threats add up to what Langdon called a "perfect storm" that could destroy much of the world's reefs -- perhaps within four to five decades.LiNeBrEaKWanless considers a four- to six-foot rise in sea level almost unavoidable over the next 50 to 100 years, an increase that would inundate the Everglades and hundreds of millions worth of coastal real estate. But he believes there is still time to prevent far more catastrophic damage -- if people and policymakers will only pay closer attention to what already is happening just a few miles offshore.LiNeBrEaK"People just can't imagine the world changing as it may this century," he said.

Pioneer Press (St. Paul, Minnesota)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Strike.TV Mac grad/local theater alum helps launch alternative online network  	Amy Carlson Gustafson, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn.  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	716 words  	Dec. 1--A year ago, writer Ken LaZebnik was one of hundreds of striking members of the Writers Guild of America. It was then he co-founded Strike.TV, an online "network" now home to several original Web series. With a mix of TV and film writers whose specialties run the gamut from horror to comedy to soap operas, the folks behind Strike.TV say it will eventually host nearly 50 Web series.LiNeBrEaK"A part of what we were picketing for during the strike was to get a foothold in online original content," says LaZebnik, a Macalester grad and Mixed Blood Theatre alum who co-wrote the screenplay for the "Prairie Home Companion" movie. "It occurred to a bunch of us that we could write and create our own Web series and put them up online as a sort of alternative online network." LiNeBrEaKLaZebnik, who also wrote for "Touched by an Angel," "Star Trek Enterprise" and "Providence," says Strike.TV, which started Webcasting this fall, allows writers to own their work and have control over their creations.LiNeBrEaK"We really try to stress that we don't view this as a writer's revenge but an opening for new opportunities for everybody," says LaZebnik. "Nothing will please us more than if one of these shows gets sold to a television network."LiNeBrEaKLaZebnik says it will take at least 18 months for Strike.TV to turn a profit. For its first few months, proceeds are being donated to the Actors Fund, a nonprofit group that helps entertainment industry workers.LiNeBrEaKOne of the most fulfilling parts of thisLiNeBrEaKnew venture, according to LaZebnik, is connecting with fellow writers. And there's the added bonus of being your own boss.LiNeBrEaK"It all feels much like what I assume Hollywood felt like back in the day," he says. "When you got a bunch of people together and you did it -- it happened quickly and there was this feeling of spontaneity about it. I do think it reconnects people with the basic joy of filmmaking because you have that freedom and latitude to do what you want to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. There's not that huge investment of money -- no huge budget you have to answer to or be responsible for."LiNeBrEaKWith most of Strike.TV's Web series installments clocking in under five minutes, there is plenty of opportunity to check out a variety of the site's content. Here are eight series to get you started.LiNeBrEaK"Confessional": Inspired by a real-life business, LaZebnik's new-agey "Confessional" is a place where people can go get things off their chests.LiNeBrEaK"Global Warming": This sweet and humorous tale about finding love halfway across the world via your computer features endearing performances by "Saturday Night Live's" Kristen Wiig and "Daily Show's" Aasif Mandvi.LiNeBrEaK"House Poor": In this smart comedy from Mindy Kaling and Lester Lewis (both writers on "The Office"), Kaling has just spent all her money on a new home. How is she going to furnish her pad? A baby shower. Only problem? She's not pregnant.LiNeBrEaK"5 or Die": From Tom Holland ("Child's Play" and "Fright Night"), this gory horror story is about people who get a chain e-mail and must forward it in five minutes or die at the hands of a mysterious killer.LiNeBrEaK"The Challenge": With his understated wit, Bob Newhart makes his attempt to break his existing two-minute DVD opening record a hoot.LiNeBrEaK"Unknown Sender": Suspense with a twist from Steven de Souza ("Die Hard" and "Tomb Raider").LiNeBrEaK"Life in General": Soap opera writer Karen Harris' funny look at the behind-the-scenes workings at the fictional second-longest running daytime drama, "Greenville General." Watch for some familiar characters -- Dillon, Georgie and Edward -- from the real ABC soap "General Hospital."LiNeBrEaK"With the Angels": Taffy Simpson is a small-town Arkansas girl whose life changes when she moves to Venice, Calif. From writer Mary Feuer (Lonelygirl15), "With the Angels" has proven to be one of Strike.TV's most popular shows.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	December 1, 2008 Monday 	On U.S. campuses, every day is Earth Day  	JOHN BRADY  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	717 words  	NEWBURYPORT, Mass.LiNeBrEaKIF I MIGHT BORROW an oft-borrowed lyric from the late, great Joe Raposo, one of New England s finest songwriters, and from vocalist Kermit the Frog, it isn t easy being green. Kermit sings about how challenging it can be to have skin of a color different from those around you. My reference, of course, is to the difficulty of going green in a society consumed by over-consumption.LiNeBrEaKColleges and universities, where I have taught for most of the last decade, are joining the green movement. Indeed, the academic community is part of a growing national urge to build green. In 2000 there were just 573 projects registered with the U.S. Green Building Council as intending to go for a LEED (environmentaly friendly) certification, whereas today there are more than 16,000 projects underway nationally. LiNeBrEaKOf course, the movement is not without onlookers who are seeing green in a whole different way. Even Earth Day has its critics. Since 1970, when April 22 was established as a day to highlight concern over pollution of the soil, air and water, it has been an enormous PR success, observed in 140 nations with outdoor performances, street fairs and TV programs that focus on environmental issues   but it s questionable whether the movement has had an effect on the overdevelopment, global warming and overpopulation that afflict planet Earth.LiNeBrEaK The biggest problem with Earth Day is that it has become a ritual of sympathy for the idea of environmental sanity,  say Alex Steffen and Sarah Rich on WorldChanging.Com.  Small steps, we re told, ignoring the fact that most of the steps most frequently promoted (returning your bottles, bringing your own bag, turning off the water while you brush your teeth) are of such minor impact (compared to our ecological footprints) that they are essentially meaningless without larger, systemic action as well. LiNeBrEaKThe strategy of starting small (with recycling) and moving on to harder things has failed, they suggest.  It is, essentially, the politics of gesture, little different than wearing a rubber wrist band or a pink ribbon, and, such a politics is primarily a means of raising money for large non-government organizations while making regular folks feel a little better about their relationship to a terribly flawed system. It s a broken model, and we can do better. LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, as politicians campaign on the need to drill offshore for oil, voters seem indifferent to the fact that there is no comprehensive U.S. energy policy. We have a drug czar in Washington. Why not an environment czar? Perhaps Obama will change all that.LiNeBrEaK So much of it has to do with leadership,  Thomas Friedman, author of Hot, Flat, and Crowded, recently told Time magazine.  For the last eight years we ve had a president and vice president who have basically said our use of oil is a God-given right. Imagine if our president said tomorrow, I m going to get rid of my armor-plated limousine and I m going to have an armor-plated Ford Escape hybrid.  (Politicians, please note that Ford recently announced developing  sturdy yet quickly biodegradable soy bean seats  that are  one of many examples of Ford s commitment to environmentally sustainable materials. )LiNeBrEaKOn campuses across the land, every day is Earth Day, and doing better means looking for the green in all things great and small. According to the Associated Press, some 500 colleges and universities are considering removing trays from dining halls, for instance. At the university where I teach, there are roughly 8,000 students on a meal plan. No trays in the dining halls could mean a reduction in wasted food - as students only carry food they intend to eat, not sample or discard   and a reduction in wasted food and less water used for cleaning.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Disconnect;  GOP needs a fix to connect again with voters 		OPINION ; Pg. B-6  	493 words  	On Nov. 4 the Republican Party didn't just lose the White House. It lost its way. It seems Republican officials don't know what to be, what to stand for, which group of voters to appeal to, or where to look for future leaders. Once secure in its beliefs and principles, the GOP now appears to be adrift. LiNeBrEaKOf course, no one likes to lose. But it does seem that many of the Republican Party elders are enjoying the experience less than most. It doesn't help that many of them can't believe they lost to someone as untested as Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKThat's part of the problem. They underestimated Obama, not unlike the way Democrats underestimated George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, and so they met the same fate. Instead of dwelling on what it sees as the flaws and shortcomings of its opponents, and wondering why more Americans don't see them, the Republican Party should spend more time examining its own flaws and shortcomings and coming up with ways to address them. It is not enough to tell voters what Republicans are against; they have to tell voters what Republicans support.LiNeBrEaKIt is not surprising that there is an intense conversation raging within the Republican Party. Actually, it is more like a feud. There are accusations, finger-pointing, back-stabbing. Too many people are giving into that human instinct of refusing their share of blame, prefering to shove off to others as much of it as possible.LiNeBrEaKSome Republicans are blaming John McCain, who ran a creditable campaign in what was a very tough year for Republicans. But don't tell that to Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., who recently blasted McCain as out of touch with the GOP base on the bailout, campaign finance, global warming, immigration and other issues. Americans prefer a "traditional conservative government," DeMint said. And they didn't think McCain would give them one.LiNeBrEaKThat is amazing. DeMint has it exactly backward. He seems to think McCain's problem was not securing the base. It wasn't. It was not expanding the base. The GOP has become too much the party of Southern white males like Jim DeMint. McCain lost most other demographic groups -- Hispanics, young voters, high-income Americans, etc.LiNeBrEaKThe party needs to shed its image as a private club, and start thinking about how it can reach and recruit new voters. It has the right ideals and some strong policies. But it needs to find better ways to market what it believes and present itself as inclusive and welcoming. This doesn't mean abandoning what the party stands for, but rather coming up with ways to sell that vision to others.LiNeBrEaKThe Republican Party is clearly in chaos. But in the world of politics as in the world of business, chaos brings opportunity. It is up to Republicans to use the opportunity they have been given to re-invent the party and reconnect with Americans. Republicans have much to offer, but first they have to get elected. Doing that means fixing what is broken, strengthening what works -- and knowing the difference.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 1, 2008 Monday   FINAL Edition	Treaties seen as key to improving U.S. standing;  THE PRESIDENCY IN TRANSITION 	Bob Egelko, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1547 words  	President-elect Barack Obama's pledge to restore the United States' international standing extends far beyond front-page topics such as closing Guantanamo and banning torture, into areas as diverse as nuclear testing, the rights of women and people with disabilities, and military and commercial activities in the world's oceans.LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, Obama promised to seek Senate ratification of long-stalled treaties on a nuclear test ban, women's equality and the law of the sea, and to sign a U.N. convention on disability rights. He also vowed to reverse President Bush's policies on global warming and to join negotiations toward a long-term treaty on greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe global warming talks, which face a deadline of December 2009, are a rare example of an international accord that has captured public attention, largely because of Bush's opposition to mandatory emissions limits. Most treaties stay below the political radar, with often-complex subject matter, nebulous constituencies and a two-thirds majority requirement that can leave them languishing in the Senate for years. LiNeBrEaKThe American Society of International Law, an association of academics, officials and business leaders, sent questions on treaties to Obama and other presidential candidates during the primaries. Scholars from the organization differed about Obama's prospects for getting treaties ratified, but said they liked his attitude.LiNeBrEaKContrast with BushLiNeBrEaK"The Obama campaign talked about the international rule of law and human rights, working with our allies, suggesting it will take the treaty process quite a bit more seriously than the Bush administration did," said David Kaye, who heads a human rights program at UCLA Law School and was a State Department attorney for a decade.LiNeBrEaKBush has actually won Senate approval of scores of treaties, mostly small-scale agreements on subjects like extradition. He has been more prominent, however, in opposing pacts he sees as overly restrictive of U.S. prerogatives.LiNeBrEaKBush opposed the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which former President Bill Clinton signed but never submitted to the Senate. And Bush took the unprecedented step of withdrawing Clinton's presidential signature from the treaty forming the International Criminal Court for war crimes and human rights prosecutions.LiNeBrEaKBush has also declared that the Geneva Convention rules on interrogations and trials didn't apply to prisoners at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and secret CIA sites.LiNeBrEaKObama promised a different approach.LiNeBrEaK"Promoting strong international norms helps us advance many interests, including nuclear nonproliferation, free and fair trade, a clean environment, and protecting our troops in wartime," he told the international law society. "Because the Bush administration cast aside international norms that reflect American values, such as the Geneva Conventions, we are less able to promote those values abroad."LiNeBrEaKPrimary focusLiNeBrEaKObama cited three treaties he would concentrate on ratifying: the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the Convention on the Law of the Sea.LiNeBrEaKLast December, Obama cited a fourth treaty that he said he would sign and ask the Senate to ratify, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. LiNeBrEaKMissing from his to-do list, at least so far, are the International Criminal Court - which could subject U.S. officials and military personnel to prosecution - and treaties banning land mines and cluster bombs. All three would face Defense Department resistance, and Obama has said he would consult with military commanders before deciding whether to ask the Senate to ratify the International Criminal Court.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the treaties Obama has endorsed may be less controversial, "I don't see any really easy wins on the list," said K. Russell Lamotte, a former State Department attorney now in private practice in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKClimate pact toughestLiNeBrEaKMost difficult of all, he said, may be the negotiation and ratification of a post-Kyoto climate change agreement.LiNeBrEaKNow that a U.S. administration is willing to take part in the talks, Lamotte said, Obama must decide what emissions limits to accept, how to pay for them during a period of economic convulsion, and how to bring key players such as China and India on board - and then present the final product to most of the same senators who killed a modest global-warming bill earlier this year. LiNeBrEaK"It's a very daunting process," Lamotte said.LiNeBrEaKOf the unratified treaties on Obama's list, the nuclear test ban agreement is the most substantial and probably the least likely to win ratification. The accord, passed by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996, was defeated by a Republican-controlled Senate in 1999.LiNeBrEaKThe test ban treaty has never taken effect - it requires ratification by the 44 "nuclear-capable" nations - but the United States and most other countries observe voluntary moratoriums on nuclear explosive testing.LiNeBrEaKThe Law of the Sea treaty may face an easier road. The treaty, adopted by the United Nations in 1982, includes protections for nations' coastal waters and guidelines for commercial use of international waters. Military and business leaders, environmental groups and the Bush administration support it, but a bloc of conservative Republicans, citing concerns over U.S. sovereignty, has kept if off the Senate floor.LiNeBrEaK"This is the one that may be the highest priority," said Duncan Hollis, a Temple University law professor and former State Department treaty lawyer. "It's not often that industry and environmental groups are in favor" of the same treaty.LiNeBrEaKWomen's treatyLiNeBrEaKThe women's-rights treaty is even older - it won U.N. approval in 1979 and was signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, but has never reached the Senate floor. Every other industrialized nation has ratified it.LiNeBrEaKThe treaty proclaims a woman's right to equality in all areas of society, including employment and family relations. It does not explicitly address abortion, but says women should have access to "information, counseling and services in family planning," and equal rights to determine "the number and spacing of their children."LiNeBrEaK That alarms anti-abortion groups. Other conservative opponents have cited pronouncements by the treaty's oversight committee - such as a report that said Mothers' Day in Belarus fostered sex-role stereotypes - as evidence of a radical feminist agenda.LiNeBrEaKAmerican Society of International Law commentators said such opposition will make Senate passage of the treaty difficult - though they say the accord would have little effect on U.S. law because it requires only that nations take "all appropriate measures" to protect women's rights.LiNeBrEaKU.S. interpretationsLiNeBrEaKThe United States has interpreted other human rights accords to make them consistent with its laws, said Allen Weiner, a former State Department attorney who now teaches international law at Stanford.LiNeBrEaK"As a domestic law matter, it's utterly symbolic" but nevertheless important, Weiner said of the women's rights treaty. "It's a commitment we're making to an international human rights regime."LiNeBrEaKRatification "makes us somewhat more credible" to the rest of the world, Weiner said. As long as the United States is unwilling to join a widely accepted agreement on women's rights, he said, "it's difficult to demand that fundamentalist Islamic societies change their treatment of women."LiNeBrEaKNational security: The team that Obama is introducing today has embraced a shift in resources.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 01, 2008 Monday 	TOO CLOSE TO HOME  		EDITORIAL; Pg. B5  	270 words  	Which is scarier - the economy or global warming? Climate change gets our vote, in part because it will be with us for decades to come. LiNeBrEaKThat's even more our thought in the wake of the findings of scientists studying the Pacific Ocean waters off Washington's Tatoosh Island. They found that global warming is apparently causing the water to become acidic 10 to 20 times faster than the rate predicted by climate-change models.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, led by the University of Chicago's Timothy Wootton, fear the changes will have a dramatic impact on ocean life. Already, they report the island's mussels, which dominated the water's edge, have declined rapidly. Acid in the water can weaken their shells.LiNeBrEaKScientists had expected the oceans to be able to absorb with relatively little change the increasing levels of carbon dioxide that we pump into the atmosphere through industry, transportation and the like. Although other scientists caution that changes may not be occurring at the same pace in open waters, the Tatoosh evidence will throw that assumption into question.LiNeBrEaKThe study would seem to add one more reason to hasten to control greenhouse gas emissions much more rapidly than politicians are inclined to do. But there are indications (hailed with bizarre glee in the sparsely populated corridors of global warming skeptics) that the troubled economy will cause politicians in many countries to pull back from job-creating investments in alternative energy, smarter transportation and carbon sequestration. There's a real nightmare: letting the economy lead us into operating as if business as usual will solve climate change.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 1, 2008 Monday   FIRST EDITION	Manageable disaster  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A18  	576 words  	As if the nation weren't facing enough crises: a deepening recession, a dysfunctional health care system, global climate change, military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, to name but a few. Now comes a warning that the nation needs to plan better for "plausible national disasters."LiNeBrEaKIn the St. Louis region, that includes earthquakes. Last week, the Mid-America Earthquake Center at the University of Illinois published a detailed assessment of the earthquake hazard. It's part of a larger Federal Emergency Management Agency study into what FEMA calls "catastrophic event response planning." LiNeBrEaKThe planning process focuses on "plausible natural disasters that could impact the nation." In FEMA's view, an earthquake in the New Madrid Seismic Zone of a magnitude of 7. 7 on the Richter scale would be a disaster comparable to "a significant earthquake in Los Angeles" and "a Category V hurricane in Miami."LiNeBrEaKThe University of Illinois study estimates that a 7. 7-magnitude earthquake could kill nearly 800 people in Missouri and displace more than 120,000. Illinois could suffer 276 fatalities, $31 billion in economic losses, 51,000 displaced residents and 48,000 damaged buildings.LiNeBrEaKOf Missouri's 1. 47 million single-family homes, about 23,000 would be destroyed. More than 55,000 homes would suffer moderate to severe damage. Most at risk: mobile homes and unreinforced masonry homes.LiNeBrEaKThe good news is that the chances of an earthquake that severe are relatively small. But a quake of magnitude 6 or 7 is a near certainty, estimated at 90 percent at some point in the next 50 years.LiNeBrEaKThe metro area lies 150 miles from the New Madrid Seismic Zone's epicenter, but that's small comfort - especially in areas close to the Mississippi River. That includes much of the city of St. Louis. Soils near rivers are more prone to "liquefy" during seismic events, experts say, and there's a higher concentration of unreinforced masonry structures.LiNeBrEaKSt. Louis University geophysicist Robert Herrmann summarized things this way:LiNeBrEaK"If there was an earthquake of a magnitude of 6. 6 or so, St. Louis City (and) County would feel it; a lot of damage would be minor and not many collapses. If there was an earthquake of magnitude 8, there would be a good bit of damage, but the region would not be leveled."LiNeBrEaKWell, that's good news. So is the fact that "mitigation" efforts, many of which already are underway, could greatly limit losses that otherwise might be catastrophic.LiNeBrEaKMuch of this involves smart development and land use. Crucial infrastructure elements such as roads, bridges, hospitals, power utilities, water-production facilities and sewage treatment plants must be located in areas less susceptible to quake damage; they should be engineered and retrofitted to be earthquake resistant.LiNeBrEaKEmergency response, of course, also is crucial. That requires mapping where the biggest problems are more likely to arise and developing detailed plans to provide power, shelter, food, potable water, transportation and medical care. Homeowners should: secure objects such as water heaters and heavy bookshelves that pose special hazards, develop a family communication plan, put aside emergency supplies of food and water and learn that in an earthquake, the safest refuge usually is inside a building under a sturdy piece of furniture.LiNeBrEaKAll of these warnings are familiar, but the nation and FEMA learned the hard way during Hurricane Katrina what can happen if preparation is left to chance.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 	December 1, 2008 Monday   Metro Edition	Readers Write  		NEWS; Pg. 8A  	1133 words  	LETTER OF THE DAY: The number of teens who are homeless is a moral outrageLiNeBrEaKA Nov. 19 Star Tribune story tells us there are at least 191 homeless teenagers who have no place to spend their nights -- and those nights are getting a lot colder, aren't they?LiNeBrEaKHow can we permit this to continue? Our churches and service organizations must band together and create warm, safe overnight shelters for these youngsters. Can we not organize and cooperate to achieve this?LiNeBrEaKDid not Jesus tell us, "In so much as you have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto me"? LiNeBrEaKGRACE K. WIGGEN, COLUMBIA HEIGHTSLiNeBrEaKTHE GREENING OF AMERICALiNeBrEaKWill the new president deliver on his promises?LiNeBrEaKOur country faces serious problems. If we remain on our present course, the challenges facing the United States will only grow in magnitude. The depletion of fossil energy reserves, increased demand for energy, aging energy infrastructure and the acceleration of global warming will continue to pose immediate problems and threaten our nation's long-term economic and environmental sustainability.LiNeBrEaKPart of President-elect Barack Obama's electoral success came as he won many Midwest states with the promise of a clean energy economy. Now voters are looking to new leadership to deliver on the promise of millions of new green jobs, greater national security as we move away from our dependence on foreign oil and real reductions in global warming pollution.LiNeBrEaKWe have the resources to power America several times over with clean energy like wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and biomass. Large concentrating solar plants covering an area in the Southwest equivalent to the area in this country that has been strip-mined for coal (approximately 10,000 square miles) could power the entire country. We must move toward 100 percent clean, renewable power, cut our dependence on oil in half and invest in clean energy, energy efficiency and public transportation.LiNeBrEaKMinnesota stands to benefit greatly from clean energy development if we can turn the trickle of green jobs we have now into a torrent of new economic opportunities across the country.LiNeBrEaKSAMANTHA CHADWICK, Minneapolis;LiNeBrEaKclean energy associate,LiNeBrEaKEnvironment MinnesotaLiNeBrEaKBRUININKS' SALARYLiNeBrEaKIt reflects Minnesota's proper prioritiesLiNeBrEaKThe Nov. 21 Star Tribune included a front-page article detailing the compensation package of University of Minnesota President Robert Bruininks and comparing Bruininks to other leaders of higher education institutionsLiNeBrEaKPresident Bruininks made the top 10 in the country with salary plus benefits in the range of $750,000. Forty percent is deferred compensation, part of a retention-incentive laden retirement plan ($350,000 of the $750,000).LiNeBrEaKAs any first-year business school student understands, the time-value of money says a dollar paid in the future is not as valuable as a dollar paid today. I believe a more accurate depiction of Bruininks' salary ranking would include a "present-value" calculation rather than a simple salary plus benefits figure.LiNeBrEaKOf course, President Bruininks landing in the top 10 is a "feather in the cap" of the University's Board of Regents. It shows the commitment the state of Minnesota has for quality education, especially the person charged with educating and retaining Minnesota's "best and brightest."LiNeBrEaKThe person with the skill set needed to lead a great institution like the University of Minnesota certainly deserves to be rewarded and retained. Bruininks is one of this state's "assets."LiNeBrEaKTIM MCDevitt, MinneapolisLiNeBrEaKABSENTEE VOTINGLiNeBrEaKCounty relies on Postal Service to deliver ballotLiNeBrEaKA Nov. 22 letter from a Hennepin County resident serving in the military in the Persian Gulf expressed concerns about Hennepin County's "poor absentee ballot delivery."LiNeBrEaKThe Hennepin County Elections Division has investigated the letter writer's complaint and determined that his absentee ballot was mailed to him in September, well within the required timeline. We mailed it to the Golden Valley address he specified in his absentee ballot application.LiNeBrEaKOnce we have mailed out a ballot, we have no way of knowing if it reaches its destination -- that is in the hands of the U.S. Postal Service. We also have no way of knowing if the ballot arrived at his Golden Valley address, but somehow was not forwarded from that address to his location in the Persian Gulf.LiNeBrEaKWe will be communicating with the author directly and understand his frustration that he was unable to vote for local races or referendums.LiNeBrEaKJILL L.

Dave Durenberger and columnist Nick Coleman in support of IRV.LiNeBrEaKWhat is striking about their support is that, although the two represent different sides of the political spectrum, they both agree that IRV does not favor any one political party -- it is simply a better, fairer and, ultimately, more democratic method for choosing our political leaders.LiNeBrEaKJACK ULDRICH, MINNEAPOLIS;LiNeBrEaKFORMER CHAIRMAN,LiNeBrEaKMINNESOTA INDEPENDENCE PARTYLiNeBrEaKBack in the `90s, I was state issues chair for Common Cause Minnesota, a nonpartisan organization that promotes good government.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Clinton to face 'crucible' of challenges at State Dept.: Obama calls her 'an American of tremendous stature'  	Casey Seiler, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	659 words  	Dec. 1--Weeks of speculation and behind-the-scenes talks came to an end this morning as President-elect Barack Obama named New York Sen. Hillary Clinton to serve as his Secretary of State, making his onetime chief rival for the Democratic nomination his principal foreign policy operative.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement was the first order of business at a Chicago press conference in which Obama named his national security team, including current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. LiNeBrEaKClinton, the first to speak after Obama introduced the new cabinet members, began by thanking him for the opportunity. "I would also like to thank my fellow New Yorkers," she added, noting that her eight years representing the state have prepared her for her next job in diverse ways.LiNeBrEaK"New Yorkers aren't afraid to speak their minds, and do so in every language," she said.LiNeBrEaKClinton cited a long list of global challenges facing the nation, from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to global warming and the threat of terrorism. "The fate of our nation and the future of our children will be forged in the crucible of these crises," Clinton said.LiNeBrEaKThe solution, she added, would require "more partners, fewer adversaries," and an acknowledgement that global issues will be solved neither by force alone or Americans alone.LiNeBrEaKThe question of Clinton's replacement in the Senate now falls on Gov. David Paterson, who was holding his own cabinet meeting as Obama was naming his national security team. Last week, Paterson told reporters that he would move deliberately in making his selection, and was not likely to make his announcement until after Clinton has completed confirmation hearings.LiNeBrEaKThe rest of Obama's national security team will include Washington lawyer Eric Holder as attorney general and Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as homeland security secretary. And following through on a campaign promise that his cabinet would include Republicans, Obama said that Robert Gates, who has served two years as President George W. Bush's secretary of defense, will stay on the job after Obama is sworn in on Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't check his voter registration," Obama said of Gates in answer to a reporter's question about whether his decision to keep Gates at the Pentagon would be the beginning or the end of his commitment to include Republicans in his administration.LiNeBrEaKObama also named two senior foreign policy positions outside the Cabinet: campaign foreign policy adviser Susan Rice as U.N. ambassador and retired Marine Gen. James L. Jones as national security adviser.LiNeBrEaKObama began his announcement by noting that the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, demonstrate the continuing dangers facing nations around the world.LiNeBrEaKAnswering a reporter's question about how he came to see Sen. Clinton as his best option to represent his administration around the world, Obama said "It was not a light-bulb moment."LiNeBrEaK"I have always believed that she was tough and smart and disciplined, and share my core values and the values of the American people," Obama said of Clinton, who challenged him for the Democratic nomination through the spring, and whose eventual endorsement of his candidacy provided one of the dramatic high points of August's Democratic National Convention.LiNeBrEaKFormer President Bill Clinton released a statement on his wife's campaign site commending Obama "for asking her to be a part of a great national security team. America will be well-served."LiNeBrEaKFor more on this story as it develops through the day, visit the Capitol Confidential blog at http://blogs.timesunion.com.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 1, 2008 Monday   Final Edition	Liberals to pressure Obama for results  	BEN FELLER Associated Press  	News; Pg. A10  	757 words  	WASHINGTON Barack Obama promises to steer the nation straight again. He better be ready for a strong force pulling left. The president-elect drew plenty of support from moderates, but the liberal side of the Democratic Party followed him most resoundingly: labor unions, influential Internet blogs and legions of grassroots volunteers. He won almost 90 percent of the liberal vote, more than the previous two Democratic presidential nominees, John Kerry or Al Gore.  LiNeBrEaKNow the same millions of left-leaning voters who worked relentlessly to get Obama elected want results. That means ending the war in Iraq, ushering in universal health care, halting harsh interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists, making it easier to form unions and aggressively tackling global warming. "We'll see," said Eli Pariser, executive director of the liberal powerhouse Moveon.org, about what Obama will deliver. "If they turn out to be all disappointments, we'll have a good three years to storm the gates at the White House." Already, the liberal blogosphere is showing its influence. John Brennan, Obama's top pick to head the CIA, suddenly withdrew his name from consideration under pressure this past week. His potential appointment had raised a firestorm among liberal blogs that associate him with the Bush administration's interrogation, detention and rendition policies. Within hours, blogs that raised concerns about Brennan's career claimed victory about their successful exercise in free speech. The debt is starting to come due on Obama's promise of "change we can believe in." Except he meant "we" in a broader sense. He promised to lead with a bipartisan spirit, the kind that could unify a country and allow him to get deals through Congress. From the moment he won, he implored people: "Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship." And then he set out to take his own advice. Obama's courting of Republicans for ideas, legislative support, and potential roles in his Cabinet is drawing cautious attention from the liberal base of his Democratic Party. The concern, to the degree that it exists this soon, is that Obama's emphasis on governing from the center may undermine the left. He still pledges to wind down the war in Iraq, but everything comes second to fixing the staggering economy right now. He has stood up in defense for Sen. Joe Lieberman, a virtual Democratic outcast these days, and sought help from his Republican presidential foe, Sen. John McCain. Obama is building a government with several Clinton administration faces, a move that has underwhelmed some liberal voices who are eager for a more dramatic sense of change. In one posting that seemed to echo in the Internet community, liberal blogger Chris Bowers wrote, "I feel incredibly frustrated. ... Isn't there ever a point when we can get an actual Democratic administration? Why isn't there a single member of Obama's Cabinet who will be advising him from the left?" Christopher Hayes, the Washington-based editor of The Nation, offered his own lament about a lack of progressive candidates for prominent leadership spots. He said the left has been right about Iraq, financial deregulation and global warming, and yet "no one who comes from the part of American political and intellectual life that has given birth to all of these ideas is anywhere to be found within miles of the Obama Cabinet so far." Obama pushed back a bit this past week, saying his advisers will blend "experience with fresh thinking." Of course, he is not done picking his Cabinet, let alone occupying the Oval Office yet. Any rumblings of discontent at this point show that expectations for Obama are enormous within his party. Labor unions and liberal groups spent big money and knocked on countless doors to help get Obama elected. The undercurrent of concern is not that Obama, granted the title of most liberal senator in one prominent ranking, will suddenly abandon the people who helped elect him or change course on core causes. Rather, it is that liberal side of his party may have to wait longer for victories, and accept smaller ones. That is the reality of governance right now. "I think he's moving center-left, rather than left-center. It's fair to call him pragmatic," said Paul Light, a public policy professor and presidential historian at New York University. "I think labor is going to get a lot from him. I think his liberal supporters are going to get a lot from him. But they're going to be disappointed if they want all liberal all the time."

USA TODAY 	December 1, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Clinton's biggest test: How she'll work with Obama;  She's a defense hawk with a focus on rights 	Susan Page  	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	2327 words  	WASHINGTON -- She'll bring global star power, a long-standing commitment to improving the status of women and children around the world and muscular promises of military action when U.S. interests are crossed.LiNeBrEaKThe question for Hillary Rodham Clinton, slated to be named secretary of State today by President-elect Barack Obama, is whether she can forge the sort of close relationship with a former rival that is crucial to giving the nation's top diplomat the credibility to get things done.LiNeBrEaK"What matters most are two things," says James Lindsay, director of the Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas-Austin. "One, the secretary of State has to have the president's ear. Two, the president has to have the secretary of State's back."LiNeBrEaKObama is choosing for his most prestigious Cabinet post an independent-minded policymaker whose world view has been shaped by eight years as a globe-trotting first lady and eight years as a senator with time on the Armed Services Committee. She combines a focus on "soft" issues such as maternal health with rhetoric more hawkish than Obama's on containing Iran's nuclear program and protecting Israel. LiNeBrEaKShe will be taking the lead on a crushing set of global challenges, including repercussions from last week's terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, which threaten a conflagration on the nuclear-armed subcontinent.LiNeBrEaKIn collaboration with other administration officials, the incoming secretary of State will deal with the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, efforts to turn around the war in Afghanistan, nuclear programs in such rogue nations as North Korea and Iran, the challenge from a resurgent Russia and growing concerns about global climate change.LiNeBrEaKObama's pick is non-traditional on several fronts. Not since James Garfield appointed James Blaine to head the State Department in 1881 has a president chosen a major political rival for the job. What's more, Clinton's grounding in women's rights contrasts with her predecessors, most of whom had pursued careers in academia, the military or law steeped in U.S. relations with major world powers.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama transition office said Sunday that he would unveil his national security team today.  Two Democratic sources with firsthand knowledge of the decision confirmed Clinton would be among those named. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the record.LiNeBrEaKClinton is "a tough pragmatist who understands it's a dangerous world out there, who understands it can be necessary at times to use force and at other times to be able to back your diplomacy with the threat of force," says Martin Indyk, a former assistant secretary of State and ambassador to Israel who is close to Clinton.LiNeBrEaK"On the other hand, she has shown a very deep commitment to the causes of human rights, women's rights in particular, and the pursuit of peace and resolution of conflict."LiNeBrEaKWhen Clinton decided to run for the Senate in 2000, she launched her campaign with a "listening tour" to hear from New York voters. When she began her presidential campaign in 2007, she announced a similar "listening tour" through states with early primaries and caucuses.LiNeBrEaKIt would be no surprise, then, if she chose to begin her tenure as secretary of State with a "listening tour" around the globe, especially to hear from allies in Europe and elsewhere who have complained about what they see as a penchant for unilateral action by the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKShe also has other ideas in her pocket.LiNeBrEaKDuring a trip last year to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Clinton met separately with then-Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, each of whom expressed suspicions of the other. She asked each if it would be helpful for the United States to appoint a special envoy to work with leaders of the two countries. They said yes.LiNeBrEaKOn her return to Washington, she called White House national security adviser Stephen Hadley to pitch the idea but to no avail. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe says the White House did look into her suggestion but decided it wasn't feasible because the administration, while also working on tensions between Musharraf and Karzai, was focused on a governmental transition in Pakistan and the need to name a new U.N. representative for Afghanistan.LiNeBrEaKAs secretary of State, Clinton would be in a position to put her ideas into action.LiNeBrEaKFrom bellicose to 'brilliant'LiNeBrEaKAs they competed for the Democratic nomination, Clinton portrayed Obama as naive in his approach to rogue leaders around the world.LiNeBrEaKObama, meanwhile, questioned her judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war and cast her as unnecessarily bellicose toward Iran. He and his top aides -- including Susan Rice, set to be named United Nations ambassador -- mocked the idea that Clinton's work as first lady amounted to substantive experience.LiNeBrEaKNow, associates of both describe their differences on foreign policy as overblown in the heat of battle. They say Clinton's public campaigning for Obama during the general election and their private conversations in the four weeks since he won have helped mend fences and begin a budding partnership. Obama strategist David Axelrod now calls Clinton "able, tough, brilliant."LiNeBrEaKEven so, no appointment Obama has considered has generated as much chatter as the choice of the New York senator.LiNeBrEaKSome leaders of anti-war groups are dismayed that Obama, whose national ambitions were launched by his opposition to the invasion of Iraq, would give such a key role to someone who supported it.LiNeBrEaK"One of the ways in which he separated himself from Hillary Clinton during the primary season was to remind people that early on he was opposed to the war in Iraq, was opposed to her position, which was always quite supportive of war," says Leslie Cagan, national coordinator of United for Peace and Justice, a coalition of anti-war groups.LiNeBrEaKShe calls the prospective nomination of Clinton "quite disappointing" but says the "real question" will be the policies Obama himself sets.LiNeBrEaKThen there are the potential complications of choosing the spouse of a former president who continues to pursue his own initiatives on AIDS and other issues around the world. Will foreign leaders assume Bill Clinton speaks for the White House? And what happens if he disagrees with a step the president and secretary of State decide to take?LiNeBrEaKThe former president has agreed to take steps to minimize conflicts or the appearance of them, including submitting future speaking engagements and business dealings to the State Department or White House for approval. Under the arrangement, reported by The New York Times on Sunday, Clinton will release the names of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe former president could prove to be an asset for the new administration. In an interview in October with Joe Klein of Time magazine, Obama said he had talked with Bill Clinton about the possibility of serving as a special envoy to ease tensions between India and Pakistan -- a task that takes on special importance now.LiNeBrEaKBill Clinton has been "foursquare" in favor of his wife's appointment, says Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of State who has been a friend since they were Rhodes Scholars together. "I know his initial reaction to the idea was, 'She'd be great; (Obama's) smart to offer it.' ...LiNeBrEaK"She obviously had to make some pretty basic decisions" whether to accept the job, Talbott says. "It's a major career change."LiNeBrEaKShe has made those before.LiNeBrEaKClinton was a Little Rock lawyer and activist on children's issues when her husband was governor of Arkansas. After he was elected president in 1992, she headed the task force charged with his signature domestic initiative, on health care.LiNeBrEaKThe proposal she helped draft failed spectacularly, never coming to a vote on Capitol Hill and contributing to devastating Democratic setbacks in the congressional elections in 1994. Hillary Clinton, a political lightning rod in the United States, became increasingly engaged in global travels and programs.LiNeBrEaK"She was very interested in a combination of things that led her to get more active on foreign issues," recalls Madeleine Albright, who was U.N. ambassador in President Clinton's first term and secretary of State in his second. She and Hillary Clinton regularly met for lunch in Albright's private dining room at the State Department.LiNeBrEaK"She could see what her voice meant when she got involved in a particular issue," Albright says. "There were specific areas she got interested in -- human rights and women's issues and international health issues -- and then more and more that gave her the capability of understanding developments in those countries."LiNeBrEaKEight years, 82 countriesLiNeBrEaKDuring eight years in the White House, Hillary Clinton visited 82 countries. She met with dozens of foreign leaders including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, president Ion Iliescu of Romania and prime minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. (In her 2003 memoir, Living History, Clinton says Bhutto commiserated on their mutual challenges. "Women who take on tough issues and stake out new territory are often on the receiving end of ignorance," Bhutto told her.)LiNeBrEaKOne of Clinton's most embarrassing missteps during this year's presidential campaign came when she exaggerated her experiences as first lady, giving audiences a vivid account of landing in Bosnia in 1996 under sniper fire. CBS footage of the trip -- posted on YouTube this spring and viewed more than 2 million times since then -- shows her and daughter Chelsea at a placid welcome ceremony on the airport tarmac, greeted by a young girl with a long braid.LiNeBrEaKClinton's schedule abroad included hundreds of photo ops and sightseeing expeditions, but she also routinely held meetings on such substantive issues as the political empowerment of women, equal opportunities for girls and the availability of health care.LiNeBrEaKAfter a 1995 trip to India, Pakistan and other countries in South Asia, she delivered a presentation at the State Department of what she found that Talbott calls "stunning" in its analysis of the region's importance and its challenges. He says it laid the groundwork for President Clinton to visit India, Pakistan and Bangladesh  in 2000.LiNeBrEaKOn that trip and others, Hillary Clinton spotlighted the emergence of "microcredit" programs that offered small, unsecured loans to give the impoverished a path to self-sufficiency.LiNeBrEaK"When Hillary Clinton says something, the whole world listens," Mohammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank, told reporters after she sat down in the remote village of Moishahati with a group of Bangladeshi women who had benefited from the bank's microcredit loans.LiNeBrEaKAfter she was elected to the Senate in 2000, Clinton sought a seat on the Armed Services Committee, a step that would bolster her credentials as a potential commander-in-chief. Since then, she has regularly traveled abroad, making three trips each to Iraq and Afghanistan and two to Israel as well as visits to Pakistan, Kuwait, Canada and Europe.LiNeBrEaKClinton remains determined to focus on such issues as maternal health and the education of girls. She argues there is a direct link between those "soft" issues and the stability of governments, and with that U.S. security interests.LiNeBrEaK"Typically, governments (including that of the U.S.) limit their foreign policies to diplomatic, military and trade issues, the staple of most treaties, pacts and negotiations," Clinton wrote in her memoir. "Yet it was clear to me that in the new global economy, individual countries and regions would find it difficult to make economic or social progress if a disproportionate percentage of their female population remained poor, uneducated, unhealthy and disenfranchised. ...LiNeBrEaK"Issues affecting women and girls should not be dismissed as 'soft' or marginal but should be integrated fully into domestic and foreign policy decisions."LiNeBrEaKStill, it is on such traditional "hard" issues as authorizing the U.S. invasion of Iraq and dealing with the nuclear program in Iran that Clinton has clashed most with Obama. Those questions and others -- including the perilous situation between India and Pakistan -- will be among the new secretary of State's most pressing challenges.LiNeBrEaK"For the Obama administration, foreign policy is not going to be easy," says Lindsay, a former National Security Council aide. "Their inbox is filled with lots of intractable problems." LiNeBrEaKHillary Clinton and the worldLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's expected choice for secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been involved in global issues during eight years as first lady and eight years as a New York senator.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 	December 1, 2008 Monday 	Another question  		LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	270 words  	Overwhelming feelings of curiosity have me wondering if my letter to the Times-Herald Editor ("The Bullet Train fiasco," Nov. 17) addressed the question that haunts me. I often read of the monetary awards received by lawyers representing environmental groups, foundations, etc., to help curb global warming. I would love to actually read or hear of an accounting of how these millions of dollars are used to improve or resolve the global warming problem. My guess is that most of it is spent on legal fees. LiNeBrEaKI haven't heard that they do much except to receive exorbitant awards from us. Wow, think how much could be saved by the consumers, you and I, by using this money to just fix that leaking pipe or whatever is causing the problem!LiNeBrEaKI just know when I questioned one of the groups after they had received a $10 million award because a pipe had leaked, the answer they gave me was, "Well, we bought paint and had volunteers paint 'Drains to Bay' on some drain covers." Maybe the cost of paint was at an all-time high? I still have a hard time accepting this, but what do I know? I'm just an average consumer who has to pay more for products because of the added on costs due to these huge awards. It would be nice to actually witness these groups fighting fires or even helping clean the forests and countryside of what turns into fuel for these fires. I really love the advertisement asking us to help the polar bears. What a tear jerker! Polar bears have reproduced in record numbers for the past 50-60 years. Keep up the good work and remember, spotted owls will only inhabit old growth timber, right?LiNeBrEaKAl AldredLiNeBrEaKVallejo	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); MARINE MAMMALS (77%); COSTS and ATTORNEY FEES (77%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (77%); WITNESSES (77%); LAWYERS (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (72%)  						CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 1, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Times-Herald All Rights Reserved  																
The Washington Post 	December 1, 2008 Monday   Regional Edition	Obama's Economic Choice  	Robert J. Samuelson  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A17  	814 words  	As he assembles his economic team, Barack Obama faces a central strategic decision that only he can make. Starting with his "economic stimulus" plan, will he focus mainly on reviving the economy and relieving the financial crisis? Or will he use the economic crisis as a vehicle to advance a more ambitious social and economic agenda? The two approaches are at odds. The first aims at building political consensus and economic confidence; the second would intensify political conflict and economic uncertainty.LiNeBrEaKThe decision ought to be easy. Every new president is assaulted by his own supporters, who want him to put their particular agendas atop his "to do" list. That's happening, as Obama allies clamor for speedy action to provide universal health insurance, combat global warming and support trade unions. But Obama -- and the nation -- would be better served if he concentrated for his first year on stabilizing the economy while patiently laying the groundwork for more far-reaching proposals. LiNeBrEaKThe hallmark of this economic crisis has been its capacity to surprise: The desperate plight of the Big Three automakers is the latest reminder. We can expect more surprises, because the U.S. and global economies continue to weaken at a worrying pace. Consumer confidence has plunged. In October, U.S. factory orders for durable goods (machinery, autos, appliances) dropped 6. 2 percent. Abroad, signs are no better. Worldwide manufacturing production is declining at an 8 percent rate. Germany is in recession; China's growth has slowed sharply.LiNeBrEaKAgainst this backdrop, the parallel pursuit of crisis management and sweeping domestic reform is at best distracting. In practice, it may be politically poisonous. Superficially, the two objectives can be made to seem compatible. Obama can plug "green" investments as a way to restore job growth; he can tout a more efficient health-care system as a way to control health costs. But these rhetorical debating points obscure as much as they reveal.LiNeBrEaKAny program to refashion the energy and health-care sectors -- to take two obvious candidates -- would be complicated and contentious. Some producers and consumers would win; others would lose. Proposals would create massive uncertainties for businesses and raise the probability of higher costs. To succeed in curbing greenhouse gas emissions, for example, any cap-and-trade program must involve higher energy prices.LiNeBrEaKThe notion that green investments would be large, permanent net creators of jobs is mostly a mirage. Somehow these investments must be paid for. If that happens through higher prices, higher taxes or cuts in other government programs, then most  green jobs will substitute for other types of jobs. As for curbing health-care costs, that's desirable. The trouble is that the first effect of Obama's health-care program would probably be the opposite. Expanding insurance coverage would initially raise health spending as greater demand for medical care met a (relatively) fixed supply of doctors, hospitals and clinics.LiNeBrEaKObama won the election, and in normal times, his campaign agenda ought to be front and center. But these are not normal times, and what's most important now -- as he repeatedly emphasizes -- is to prevent the recession from feeding on itself. This is a clear danger. Consumer spending (70 percent of the economy) has declined for five consecutive months. Eroding tax revenue may result in state budget deficits of $200 billion to $250 billion through mid-2011, estimates the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal advocacy group. Required to balance their budgets, states face increased taxes or large spending cuts.LiNeBrEaKThe compelling case for a big economic stimulus package is that it would cushion these and other spending declines. The odds are that any package will include  some direct payments to states; a renewed extension of unemployment benefits; tax cuts -- reflecting Obama's campaign pledge -- of $500 for most single workers and $1,000 for most two-earner families; spending for infrastructure (roads, bridges, schools and, perhaps, windmills). Obama wants Congress to pass a stimulus package soon after his inauguration. Assuming he gets his wish, it's then that he must make his crucial choice.LiNeBrEaKThe temptation will be to press ahead with a "bold" legislative agenda -- to ape the New Deal. This would be a mistake. The psychology of bruising legislative battles will not bolster confidence. The country does need to face its health and energy problems as well as deficit-ridden federal budgets. But trying to do too much too soon risks doing none of it well. We -- and he -- are caught up in a web of contradictions. In the long run, we need to discipline our appetite for health care and energy; we need to reconcile our desire for government benefits and our willingness to be taxed. Obama's first job is to avert an economic freefall.

The Washington Post 	December 1, 2008 Monday   Regional Edition	Leadership Gap in China  	Elizabeth Economy  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A17  	865 words  	This should be China's time to shine. The country is sitting on almost $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and may post a 9 percent growth rate this year, probably the highest of any nation. In the midst of a global financial crisis, the world has come to China's doorstep seeking leadership. Yet China's leaders have largely kept the door shut, arguing that Beijing can do the most good for the world by putting its own house in order. China wants to be a responsible partner, not a global leader.LiNeBrEaKMany in the United States have assumed that China wants to ascend to LiNeBrEaKsuperpower status; and what better time for Beijing to step up? China matters more to the world every day -- not just on trade and finance but on climate change, food safety, nonproliferation and other global challenges. Yet China's leaders are right: They need to focus on the home front before they extend themselves globally, for their own sake and for ours.LiNeBrEaKAbove all, China's leaders need to sort out where they are going politically. It is hard to lead globally when your domestic political system is in massive transition -- or, worse, turmoil. Beijing faces more than 90,000 protests annually as a result of endemic corruption and ongoing crises in public health and the environment. Exports, the lifeblood of the Chinese economy, are falling; layoffs are already in the tens of thousands, and China's stock market has lost two-thirds of its value over the past year. Chinese media report daily on a stream of new regulations -- to limit the ability of factories to fire workers, to manage state-run reporting or to restructure the public health bureaucracy. Yet all this tinkering at the margins has failed to reassure the Chinese people, or many outside the country, that the government has a clear plan for its political and economic future.LiNeBrEaKAnd until China's leaders address their domestic issues, we don't want them playing a larger role abroad. Their political system is in desperate need of transparency, official accountability and the rule of law. Before China's political institutions are in good shape, Chinese leadership abroad would probably introduce as many problems as it solves. The global financial crisis, for example, has sparked calls for Beijing to take a greater stake in the International Monetary Fund. On its face, given China's impressive balance sheet, this makes sense. Yet Premier Wen Jiabao's calls for IMF reform may signal a challenge to the fund's efforts to promote transparency and accountability in the countries to which it lends; China has routinely resisted calls for its foreign assistance to be managed in a transparent manner.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to developing the political capacity for leadership, the time Beijing spends getting its house in order would allow China to develop the economic wherewithal to lead. Leadership means setting an example and often entails political or economic sacrifice at home for the greater good abroad. China has demonstrated little inclination toward such sacrifice, partly because it does not believe it has the economic capacity to do so.LiNeBrEaKPut another way, it needs time to expand its economy. On the issue of global climate change, for example, China is a strong supporter of -- and major beneficiary of -- the current international climate framework, and it is committed to the next round of negotiations. It has launched a domestic initiative to reduce the amount of energy it uses per unit of GDP and increase the role of renewables in its energy mix. Yet China avoids the tough economic choices embodied in adopting hard targets and timetables to reduce emissions, and it has sought free access to clean technology through a global fund supported by the developed world. Responsible player, yes; global leader, no.LiNeBrEaKAcknowledging China's reluctance to lead doesn't mean the world should do nothing but wait. China's path to good governance at home and leadership abroad will be fundamentally of its own making, yet our nation and others can help the process through cooperation where possible and pressure where necessary. Institutions such as the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue provide a framework for bilateral cooperation on economic, environmental and energy issues. The dialogue  is young but has the potential to make significant advances on these critical issues. Meanwhile, on time-sensitive topics such as food safety, climate change or Darfur, the United States has to be prepared to work with the rest of the world to press China more rather than less aggressively to rethink or reform its policies.LiNeBrEaKAbove all, the United States can do the most good by getting its own house in order. We have been free-riding alongside China on global efforts to combat climate change. Our lack of good governance domestically has increased our vulnerability to food and product safety crises and precipitated a global financial crisis. Our political institutions and financial bearings are not broken, but they have been seriously weakened. We and the world will pay a steep price until this country resumes a position from which it too can lead.LiNeBrEaKThe writer is a senior fellow and director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   Main Edition	Guiding natural recovery;  The Chattahoochee Nature Center, now set to open a new facility, almost had to close when Ann Bergstrom took over. 	CAROLINE WILBERT; For the Journal-Constitution  	BUSINESS; Pg. 3B  	862 words  	Ann Bergstrom, an Atlanta native, practically grew up in the woods of the Southeast, she says. Her father was in the U.S. Forest Service and taught her to love the outdoors.LiNeBrEaKThat passion for the natural world continued through her adult life, though she kept it separate from her career for decades.LiNeBrEaKMonday through Friday, she worked in retail marketing, including 25 years at Rich's and Federated department stores. She and her husband spent their weekends canoeing and camping. LiNeBrEaKThen, in December 1999, she took on what she considers the hardest challenge of her life. She became director of the Chattahoochee Nature Center, which was struggling and in danger of shutting down, she said.LiNeBrEaKShe has been able to stabilize the financial health of the nonprofit and raise nearly $10 million for a new facility that is under construction. LiNeBrEaKThe 10,000-square-foot Discovery Center, scheduled to open in June, will focus on education about the Chattahoochee River. It will house interactive exhibits, a high-definition theater and a rooftop garden terrace for community activities.LiNeBrEaKQ: Why did you take this job when you knew the center was struggling?LiNeBrEaKA: It was a call to the heart. I gave it a lot of thought. I came down here and walked the trails. I went in and out of the place a number of times anonymously without anyone knowing who I was. I could see visibly that the center was needy in a lot of ways. I thought about it, prayed about it. . . . I am the only director who has stayed more than five years in the center's 32 years of existence. It is a very difficult challenge and has been since the initial launching of the center.LiNeBrEaKQ: Why is it such a difficult challenge?LiNeBrEaKA: It is an environmental nonprofit. Put that at the top of the list. There are almost no environmental nonprofits in the state of Georgia. There is no critical mass for the work we do. There is no official structure in state or local government to work with and support nonprofits that work in the environmental field, or, for that matter, in the science field.LiNeBrEaKEducation is sort of the overlooked part of the environmental continuum. I think the general public thinks environmental education is taught in schools and it is something we should all just sort of understand and know, that the real issues that deserve support in the environmental arena are the crises --- saving a piece of land that is going to be lost to development or saving a habitat in which animals are in danger. Those are compelling causes that attract people. Education is not sexy.LiNeBrEaKA little bit of that is changing now, however, with the awareness that we are going to have to face the issue of global warming and climate change. ... At the same time, the pressure of the community on the Chattahoochee Nature Center to deliver environmental education was enormous. The people kept coming, they kept coming, they kept coming. More than 100,000 people a year come to the center.LiNeBrEaKQ: So when the center was in so much trouble, it wasn't from a lack of interest on the part of visitors?LiNeBrEaKA: Absolutely. It was finding the operating dollars to deliver and create the programs. We are an educational institution. We are not a park. Even though we are a place of 127 acres where you can walk, that is not what the public wants from us. What they want from us is programs, and programs are created by people, and people take money. My payroll is 80 percent of my operating budget.LiNeBrEaKQ: So what did you do?LiNeBrEaKA: We got some help from Fulton County. . . . Fulton County has been our partner from the inception of the center in the '70s. They own about two-thirds of the land that we operate our programs on. We have a long-term, 50-year lease with the county. They had become mostly an absentee partner, not really at the table and not really funding us at the level that was helpful. We were able to get additional funding from the county to stabilize the center and allow me to hire some people at a pretty close to market-competitive rate. The board stepped up and put another $150,000 to $200,000 of operating income on the table through their own fund-raising efforts, which had never happened before. We took apart every program at the center and asked: Can we afford to do this?LiNeBrEaKQ: You have worked hard to raise the funding for a new Discovery Center. When it opens, will this be a highlight for you professionally?LiNeBrEaKA: I think so. The center is unique. The Discovery Center is unique because it is focused entirely on the Chattahoochee River watershed. It is local learning within the context of environmental education. Because it is place-based and local, we hope it will help people understand environmental education in a new way and understand their role in it. You are a part of this. Your actions are a part of this. Everything you do contributes in a positive way, or in a not-positive way, to the health and well-being of the community in which you live.LiNeBrEaKTHE ANN BERGSTROM FILELiNeBrEaK* Age: 69LiNeBrEaK* Home: Cherokee CountyLiNeBrEaK* Family: Married with two children and five grandchildren.LiNeBrEaK* Education: English degree from Georgia State University.LiNeBrEaK* Currently reading: "Collapse" by Jared DiamondLiNeBrEaK* Hobbies: Spending time with family, canoeing, walking in the woods.

The Bellingham Herald (Washington)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	New, clean technology will help local economy turn around  	Dave Gallagher, The Bellingham Herald, Wash.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	595 words  	Nov. 30--New technology has been the way out of many recessions and economic downturns, and this area is well-positioned to do just that.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this month The 2008 State New Economy Index was released, analyzing which states are most embracing new technology and innovation. Washington ranked second overall, trailing only Massachusetts. In recent years Washington had ranked fourth. The study, put together by The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, looked at 29 different indicators and Washington ranked in the top five in 10 of them. This state ranked No. 1 in online agriculture, alternative energy use and value-added manufacturing. A link to the report can be found at watechcenter.org.LiNeBrEaKThe fact this state is ranked so highly in alternative energy use hit home for me at a Nov. 21 TAG -- Technology Alliance Group -- meeting. Graham Evans, director of Washington Clean Technology Alliance, hit on a variety of topics about the continued need for new, energy-efficient technology and what businesses can do to develop opportunities. What was striking to me was the number of local businesses in attendance, companies that were already moving ahead with interesting ideas, including Andgar Corporation, which is making anaerobic digesters and geo-thermal installations, as well as Whole Energy Fuels Corp., a biodiesel company. LiNeBrEaKEvans' focus of the presentation was that we're at a point where significant change is need in order to tackle global warming issues and cut energy consumption (thus saving money). What's great is that Washington state is at the point where it can talk about cutting-edge and big-picture technology, whether it's nanophotonics, smart-grid infrastructure, zero-carbon buildings or wind mills on the ocean. It's stuff that not only would make a difference, but also provides state businesses the opportunity to develop this work, creating jobs and adding to our own economy.LiNeBrEaKOne of the best ways for businesses to take advantage of the opportunities in the growing clean-tech industry, according to Evans, is to identify niches. Staying focused and developing that specific segment can make a company a leader in that area, leading to growth and further development.LiNeBrEaKStaying on track in the clean-tech industry will also foster growth in other industries in the New Economy that The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation refers to in its study. The study noted that in the past, states that were heavily invested in the New Economy tend to see less severe economic slowdowns and play a bigger role in the robust growth when things turned around.LiNeBrEaK"This next wave of information technology revolution not only will transform states, it will lead to significant new economic opportunities as (information technology) companies seek out new business opportunities to create this new digital world.," the authors of the study noted in its report.LiNeBrEaKSo while the current national state of affairs has many dealing with the economic doldrums, it seems as though Washington state's high ranking in the new economy can get us out of it more quickly, creating new jobs in industries we don't even know about yet.

The Boston Globe 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Crystal ball for world affairs  		EDITORIAL; Pg. D8  	791 words  	YOGI BERRA once observed that "it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future." And to their credit, the analysts at the National Intelligence Council have taken his insight to heart in producing a new report called "Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World." They are properly cautious about extrapolating current trends into the future.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, the intelligence council's report offers at least one major, sweeping prediction: It foresees an accelerated "diffusion of authority and power" on the world stage in coming years. In 2025, the international system will be more fragmented and multipolar. Ascending powers such as China, India, Russia, and Brazil are projected to enjoy ever-greater influence. LiNeBrEaKFor all the report's prudent weighing of differing possible developments, this is one key general conclusion that is not hedged - and that President-elect Barack Obama and his foreign policy team would do well to make the guiding beacon of their relations with the rest of the world.LiNeBrEaKIf ever there was a need for a president to be guided by a sound preview of future developments, now is that time.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush refused, for most of his two terms, to accept evident realities in the international arena. His propensity for unilateral action, preventive war, and a division of the world into good and evil nations reflected the prevalence of wish-fulfillment over reality-based statecraft. He decided America had no need to rely on the international institutions and treaties earlier administrations created after World War II. Instead, Vice President Dick Cheney and fellow neo-conservatives who helped shape Bush policies propounded the fanciful notion of a unipolar world order.LiNeBrEaKBy contrast, "Global Trends 2025" forecasts a much more fluid world system. In this environment, there will be an enhanced role for "shifting coalitions" of countries and for "international organizations, social movements, NGOs, philanthropic foundations and companies." Consequently, the United Nations, particularly with an expanded Security Council, is likely to be less and less able to resolve problems through "effective multilateral actions."LiNeBrEaKLeadership in a fluid worldLiNeBrEaKA successful president will be one who enlists other nations to solve international problems. Obama has wisely intimated that he will not try to go it alone when confronting challenges that have no unilateral solutions. In the words of the report: "Most of the pressing transnational problems - including climate change, regulation of global financial markets, migration, failing states, crime networks, etc. - are unlikely to be effectively resolved by the actions of individual nation-states."LiNeBrEaKThe purpose of the report is to help policy makers understand where events are headed. The authors disavow any intention to prescribe any specific responses. Nevertheless, the major international developments they anticipate often seem to point toward the general contours of a suitable foreign policy for the incoming Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKTo adapt America to the international order that is coming into being, the next administration will need to build alliances and cooperative initiatives with diverse groups of countries. As the intelligence forecast observes repeatedly, rising powers China, India, Brazil, and Russia will have to gain a share in decision-making commensurate with their mounting financial clout.LiNeBrEaKNew groupings for new timesLiNeBrEaKCreating such new groupings to cope with common threats and challenges will require the give-and-take bargaining that Bush abhorred. This approach will also call for a 21st-century version of power-balancing among nations. In this sense, the future envisioned by the National Intelligence Council resembles a long-receded, pre-Cold-War past.LiNeBrEaKOn two current threats that have preoccupied Washington of late, Al Qaeda terrorism and Iran's nuclear program, the intelligence forecast offers a refreshingly even-keeled, less-than-hawkish assessment: It suggests that Al Qaeda could fade away "sooner than people think" because of "its harsh ideology, unachievable strategic objectives and inability to become a mass movement." Obama ought to heed this evaluation.LiNeBrEaKThe danger foreseen should Iran develop a nuclear weapons capability is that some of its neighbors are almost certain to follow suit. There would then be an increased risk of "theft or diversion of nuclear weapons, materials, and technology - and the potential for unauthorized nuclear use." The best way to counter this threat is to assemble the sort of cooperative grouping of countries to apply economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran - a coalition that would need to include Russia, India, and China.LiNeBrEaKIn this respect, as in many others, the future has already arrived.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Dave Newhouse: Oaklander's quilt for Obama  	By Dave Newhouse Oakland Tribune columnist  	MY TOWN; Alameda; News; Local  	905 words  	Ulla Nilsen is waiting for a phone call from Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect has more urgent priorities right now than to phone a quiltmaker from Oakland. However, she did fly to Washington, D.C., hoping to see him, and he didn't show up.LiNeBrEaKShe did vote for him, and she believes in change. So if Obama can't speak with her directly, certainly someone from his transition team should give her a courtesy call. LiNeBrEaKShe isn't looking for anything. In fact, her main motivation in attempting to make contact with Obama is to present him with a gift that he might hang on an office wall somewhere.LiNeBrEaKIt would take a big office wall because the quilt is 8 feet by 14 feet   a quilt that would light up any room with its brilliance and its message.LiNeBrEaKThe message is that Nilsen, 36, wants a safer climate for her children. She has a 21-month-old son, with a second child due Feb. 6. She was nearly seven months pregnant when she traveled to the nation's capital to offer her quilt to Obama or his team.LiNeBrEaKSuch commitment deserves some response from the man who will be our 44th president, or perhaps his wife, who might interrupt her shopping for a Christmas puppy to make a call.LiNeBrEaKThough the quilt is Nilsen's idea, it's not entirely her work. It's a community quilt made right here in Oakland, by Oakland residents. The quilt has exactly 350 pieces for a reason: The number represents the 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide that scientists deem safe for the Earth.LiNeBrEaKNilsen named her quilt Solutions to Climate Change. It's all about the environment and global warming   and Obama's campaign promise of a better America.LiNeBrEaKHe's an intelligent man, with an apparent sense of humor, so he might enjoy the thought-out names on the individual patches that Nilson assembled   "renewable energy," "no nuclear," "plant trees," "ration carbon," "leave coal in the ground," and the clever patch submitted by Nilsen's father, Erik: "You can't have your Earth and heat it too."LiNeBrEaKUlla Nilsen, who speaks Spanish, Portuguese and a little Norwegian, works as an interpreter at Children's Hospital Oakland. Her husband, Jeff Alexander, is an electrician.LiNeBrEaK"I'm actually not a quilter," she said. "I knew about global warming, but when I became pregnant a second time, I felt I needed to be talking with people about climate change. But I didn't want to go around and say, 'The sky's falling.'"[0/00]"LiNeBrEaKShe decided on a quilt instead. She picked out a Dimond District park and printed a banner that read, "Help Make a Quilt to Stop Global Warming." People stopped by to get more information, then started supplying their own patches.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of the adults were scared to express themselves artistically," she said. "But a lot of teenagers, they were the ones who got it, because of how much this (environmental scare) will affect their future."LiNeBrEaKMost patches were made right there at the park as Nilsen brought along her crafts box. It took five trips to the park, beginning in June and ending in November, for her to acquire enough material to assemble the quilt. She chose about 150 patches and filled in the rest of the quilt with colorful, nonverbal fabric.LiNeBrEaKNilsen is a UC Berkeley graduate who has participated in political causes before. She has marched in anti-war and affirmative action protests. Reducing carbon emissions, however, took on greater importance for her with motherhood.LiNeBrEaK"Scientists are saying we have 10 years to fix global warming," she said. "If we don't turn this around now, my kids   all our kids   face a catastrophic future."LiNeBrEaKSo, she is appealing to Obama to follow the lead of former Vice President Al Gore and prevent just such a future. She hasn't seen any significant movement from the Bush administration toward that end.LiNeBrEaK"We're already seeing a pretty significant temperature increase," she said, "that could go up higher, which means that plants and animals are in danger. So mass extinction already has started to happen."LiNeBrEaKWhere did Nilsen get the idea to take her cause to the nation's highest office?LiNeBrEaK"Somehow it seemed like the natural trajectory," she said. "A new president is a hopeful idea, and I know he cares about the climate. But a couple things he said he's going to do are not actually the right course."LiNeBrEaKShe referred to the European Union's cap-and-trade program, in which companies are issued tradable carbon credits that lead to a cap on carbon dioxide, a plan that she said is failing. She added that there's such a program in the Northeastern United States that isn't working either, and she thinks Obama is contemplating a similar national program.LiNeBrEaKSo she wants to reach him to express her concerns, and to present him with her gift.LiNeBrEaKThat's why she attended the National Day of Action, regarding climate change, on Nov. 18 in Washington. She took along her quilt in a duffel bag after organizers of the event told her they were in contact with Obama's transition team. Only they were all out of their offices that day and, after displaying her quilt at a rally, she took it back with her to Oakland.LiNeBrEaKBefore returning home, she left behind a letter she had written to Obama, that a national organization named 350.org promised to deliver in her behalf.LiNeBrEaKThe Obamas have two young girls; therefore, global warming concerns them, too.LiNeBrEaKSo Nilsen waits by the phone, hopefully.LiNeBrEaKDave Newhouse's columns appear Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays, usually on the Metro page.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   Home Final Edition	GREEN CHRISTMAS;  Keeping Earth healthy at holidays helps wallets, too 	Spencer Hunt, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	NEWS; Pg. 01A  	769 words  	Celebrating a "green" Christmas is supposed to help save the planet, but it also can help you save cash.LiNeBrEaKThe goal of an environmentally conscious holiday is to change spending habits and traditions in ways that cut pollution without dimming the Christmas spirit.LiNeBrEaKConsider this: LiNeBrEaK* Every year between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, people throw away 25 percent more trash than normal: about 1 million extra tons a week.LiNeBrEaK* The number of greeting cards mailed each year in the United States could fill a 10-story football stadium, according to waste-reduction advocate Use Less Stuff.LiNeBrEaK* Powering decorative lights strung on homes will result in power plants producing more than 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide, the lead ingredient in global warming, and cost homeowners more than $250 million.LiNeBrEaKSo it's no stretch that going green also can save money, said Peter Sander, a co-author of Green Christmas: How to Have a Joyous, Eco-Friendly Holiday Season.LiNeBrEaK"Saving money has become more of a point now than when we wrote it" this year, Sander said. "It turns out, it's easy to do both."LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest bangs for the buck comes from putting up strands of LED lights.LiNeBrEaKShort for light-emitting diodes, LED lights are unattractive to many consumers because they cost about three times as much as standard incandescent lights. But LEDs can last 10 times as long and consume one-tenth the electricity.LiNeBrEaKTwenty strings of outdoor LED mini-lights kept on from dusk to dawn for a month would cost a Columbus homeowner about $2. 30. The same number of cheaper incandescent strings would cost about $31. 70.LiNeBrEaKIn terms of carbon dioxide, power plants will emit about 57 pounds to make those LED lights glow, and more than 560 pounds for the standard strands.LiNeBrEaKAnother way to save money and cut pollution: Turn the lights off at bedtime. Unplugging your lights each night can cut your electricity costs in half.LiNeBrEaK"You don't need the lights glowing at 2 or 3 in the morning," said Ryan Lippe, spokesman for the Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel.LiNeBrEaKOther recommendations include sending holiday e-mails instead of paper greeting cards. The switch will save trees and reduce carbon-dioxide emissions from the trucks and planes that would deliver the paper cards.LiNeBrEaKPeople also can save money by using newspapers instead of wrapping paper to wrap the gifts that go under the tree. Newspapers also are easier to recycle than store-bought wrappings.LiNeBrEaKChristmas trees themselves are a thornier issue.LiNeBrEaKFake trees don't deplete forests and can be used over and over. Their use also cuts down on emissions from chain saws and delivery trucks. LiNeBrEaKHowever, many environmental groups, including Treehugger.com, recommend real trees. That's because most are grown on farms and take carbon dioxide out of the air while they are growing. And 90 percent of them are recycled into mulch after the holidays.LiNeBrEaK"(Real trees) are grown locally by your friends and neighborhood farmers," said Dave Reese, the Ohio Christmas Tree Association president and owner of Kaleidoscope Farms in Hancock County.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists have found a different solution to the Christmas-tree issue: They use neither fake nor real.LiNeBrEaK"I don't actually get a tree," said Brandi Whetstone, Clean Water Campaign coordinator with the Ohio Sierra Club. "I have a big plant that I use, and I just decorate it."LiNeBrEaKshunt@dispatch.com LiNeBrEaKBox Story: Christmas considerationsLiNeBrEaK\ LED LIGHTINGLiNeBrEaKProsLiNeBrEaK* Cuts electricity costs by up to 90 percent compared with standard incandescent strands.LiNeBrEaK* Lasts 10 times longer than standard incandescent strands.LiNeBrEaKConLiNeBrEaK* Is two or three times more expensive. \LiNeBrEaKFAKE TREESLiNeBrEaKProLiNeBrEaK* Can be stored and reused year after year.LiNeBrEaKConLiNeBrEaK* Often made from vinyl plastics and shipped from foreign countries. \LiNeBrEaKREAL TREESLiNeBrEaKProsLiNeBrEaK* Store carbon.LiNeBrEaK* Provide habitat.LiNeBrEaK* Most are grown locally, and 90 percent are recycled as compost and mulch.LiNeBrEaKConLiNeBrEaK* Must be bought new every year. \LiNeBrEaKOTHER TIPSLiNeBrEaK* Let nature decorate your tree.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram (Texas)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	PoliTex: Change is likely at U.S. attorney's office  	Maria Recio, Anna M. Tinsley, Dave Montgomery and Aman Batheja, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Texas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	694 words  	Nov. 30--While it might not be on the top of President-elect Barack Obama's agenda, the question of who will be the next U.S. attorney in North Texas is on the mind of the local legal community.LiNeBrEaKObama could choose to keep Richard Roper, who was appointed by President George W. Bush after Jane Boyle was tapped to be a U.S. district judge. But Obama will probably want to appoint someone with a strong Democratic pedigree. LiNeBrEaKOne name commonly mentioned is that of Terri Moore, second in command of the Dallas County district attorney's office. Moore is a former federal prosecutor and assistant Tarrant County district attorney.LiNeBrEaKGreen bows outLiNeBrEaKRep. Gene Green, D-Houston, the acting chairman of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, is only too happy to end his tenure on the ethics panel.LiNeBrEaKGreen became acting chairman after the death of Chairman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, this summer and presided over a number of investigations. The long-serving Green met with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., after the election to make sure that his time on the committee was up with the end of the 110th Congress.LiNeBrEaKWhen the 111th Congress convenes in January, Green says, he will no longer be on the ethics committee. So who will be chairman?LiNeBrEaK"I don't care who the name is, as long as it's not mine," he said.LiNeBrEaKGoodbye tourLiNeBrEaKWhile many travelers head south on winter vacations, Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, and his wife, Carol Roark, headed to Manitoba, Canada, where temperatures consistently hang below zero.LiNeBrEaKBurnam, a leader of environmental causes in the Legislature, described the five-day trip to the Churchill Northern Studies Center as a working vacation to study polar bears and the effects of global warming. In one section, polar bears have vanished entirely. In another, the population has fallen from 1,200 to 900 over 10 years.LiNeBrEaK"I had a feeling this was a goodbye tour," Burnam said. "We wanted to see the polar bears in the wild before man makes them extinct."LiNeBrEaKThe Nov. 13-18 trip strengthened the lawmaker's resolve to confront global warming, said Burnam, who is planning a package of conservation and environmental bills for next year's session of the Legislature.LiNeBrEaKA new addition to Congress?LiNeBrEaKFormer Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Marshall, didn't totally leave Congress when he was defeated for re-election after the 2004 redistricting.LiNeBrEaKHe married Rep. Stephanie Herseth, D-S.D., and became a congressional spouse.LiNeBrEaKAnd now those two legislative lovebirds -- Stephanie added Sandlin to her name -- are having a baby in December.LiNeBrEaKPrimary concernsLiNeBrEaKBack in 2007, lawmakers in Austin tried to move up the Texas primary in time for the 2008 election. When it didn't happen, nearly everyone predicted that Texas would spend another election season mired in irrelevance.LiNeBrEaKIt didn't quite turn out that way, as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton battled fiercely across the state, making for the most exciting Texas primary in years.LiNeBrEaKMany would like to see that kind of excitement more often. State Rep. Robert Alonzo, D-Dallas, has filed a bill to move the Texas primary to the first Tuesday in February, better known this year as Super Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKAlonzo's bill doesn't address the problem that sank such efforts during the past session.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	Polpourri  		CITY and REGION; Pg. B1  	499 words  	HUCKSTER HUCKABEELiNeBrEaKFormer candidate hawks new bookLiNeBrEaKHave any doubt former Gov. Mike Huckabee will make another presidential bid? Ask him yourself. Huckabee returns to Grand Rapids this week as part of a 56-city tour to promote his seventh book, "Do the Right Thing: Inside the Movement That's Bringing Common Sense Back to America." This one takes pokes at Mitt Romney and other party rivals. Get your copy signed at 7: 30 p.m. Wednesday at Schuler Books and Music, 2660 28th St. SE. The highly quotable bass-playing pastor, who shed 100 pounds and shocked the GOP by winning eight states in the primary, still sounds a lot like a candidate. Huckabee didn't win the Michigan primary but he scored well with Christian conservatives and blue-collar voters, a base he likely could fight over in 2012 with another governor from a state that begins with A. LiNeBrEaKA GREENER FARM BUREAULiNeBrEaKClimate change addressedLiNeBrEaKThough farmers are among the nation's first conservationists, the Michigan Farm Bureau has steered away from the thorny issue of climate change. Until now. A resolution addressing the issue will be among about 140 before the bureau when it convenes its annual meeting Tuesday in Grand Rapids. Does that mean bureau members are global warming converts? Not exactly. "... the intention is to acknowledge that, in spite of conflicting scientific evidence regarding climate change, there is a movement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and agriculture needs to be at the table," said bureau spokeswoman Jill Corrin, adding the resolution supports a "practical, voluntary, market-based carbon credit trading system."LiNeBrEaKCAUSE AND EFFECTLiNeBrEaKDo donations buy clout?LiNeBrEaKDo the chances of getting a bailout rise with campaign contributions? You might draw that conclusion from a post-election analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The center ranks the auto industry 34th among special-interest contributors to congressional campaigns. Wall Street investment banks and insurance firms ranked 15th. In Michigan, Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, tops the Michigan delegation, receiving $625,000 from auto manufacturers since 1990. Rep. Vern Ehlers, R-Grand Rapids, on the other hand, received $8,890 in the same period, while Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Holland, got $20,000. Perhaps it's just a coincidence automakers scaled back on campaign donations and lost clout on Capitol Hill. Auto executives will find out Tuesday when they get a second interview with Congress on their loan application.LiNeBrEaKIT'S FOR THE KIDSLiNeBrEaKHardiman is 'legacy hero'LiNeBrEaKCelebrating what they call "exemplary community, legislative and judicial accomplishment on behalf of children," Michigan's Children will honor several people, including state Sen. Bill Hardiman. The Kentwood Republican is among four legislators -- and the only one from the Grand Rapids area -- being honored as a "legacy hero" at the ninth annual "Much Ado About Something Wonderful" event in Lansing on Dec. 9. Honorees include Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Rep. Candice Miller.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	Winter: white or wrong?;  Local experts predict more snow than usual 		FRONT PAGE; Pg. A1  	233 words  	With all this global warming, it seems a logical question: Shouldn't West Michigan get less snow?LiNeBrEaKDon't count on it, says National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Marino. LiNeBrEaKMarino notes Grand Rapids averaged 88 inches of snow the past 10 winters, 16 inches above the long-term average. But temperatures were nearly 4 degrees warmer than in the 1970s.LiNeBrEaKMarino foresees more snow than usual this winter. So do three local TV weather experts -- Peter Chan of WXMI, George Lessens of WZZM and Bill Steffen of WOOD.LiNeBrEaKThat follows last winter's near-record 107 inches. Already, some Lakeshore areas have had close to 20 inches. And it's still November. That's bad news for those who hate winter.LiNeBrEaKIt's good news at places like Dickinson True Value in Fennville, where heaters, shovels and snowblowers are suddenly popular.LiNeBrEaK"It does spur it along," salesman Kyle Coffindaffer said.LiNeBrEaKStill, he said, "It has to be expected from time to time, living by the lake."LiNeBrEaKNo one knows for sure why rising temperatures might mean more snow.LiNeBrEaK"There are theories," Marino notes.LiNeBrEaKOne says a warmer climate means the atmosphere holds more water. That could equal more snow.LiNeBrEaKFor West Michigan, Marino said, it could be because the jet stream is pushing storms farther north. Either way, Steffen thinks it could add up to a strong case of cabin fever by spring.LiNeBrEaK"I imagine there will be a few people in April looking to get out of here."

Gulf Daily News (Manama, Bahrain)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Gulf students tackle key challenges in debate...  	Noor Toorani and Carmen Lai, Gulf Daily News, Manama, Bahrain  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	551 words  	Nov. 30--MORE than 200 students took part in lively debates and discussions at the opening of the fourth BUMUN conference yesterday.LiNeBrEaKThe annual event is organised by the General Organisation for Youth and Sports under the patronage of president Shaikh Fawaz bin Mohammed Al Khalifa. LiNeBrEaKStudents from across the Gulf gathered to participate in a mock trial of the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).LiNeBrEaKThe "diplomats" came from 16 local universities, along with three from the GCC and tackled the challenges facing the international community.LiNeBrEaKNine global issues are under discussion at the two-day event where delegates will find a solution and pass a UN resolution at the end of the conference today.LiNeBrEaKDelegates at the General Assembly tackled a range of issues such as child soldiers, trade and labour standards as well as Millennium Villages -- a UN initiative to meet the needs of villages through practical and affordable interventions, in the process moving a step closer to achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals.LiNeBrEaKThe impact of climate change and the economic and social integration of refugees was the focus of the Economic and Social Committee and the situation in Somalia and global terrorism were discussed in the Security Council.LiNeBrEaKPeaceful nuclear energy and the consequences of nuclear energy were also debated by the IAEA.LiNeBrEaKEach group focused on three issues and delegates practised the skills of writing, public speaking, critical and analytical thinking, lobbying, negotiation, co-operation, teamwork, compromise and reaching concrete results and decisions.LiNeBrEaKThe programme simulates the process of negotiations, discussion, diplomacy and lively debate, which is the cornerstone of the UN. Each student represents a specific country or organisation within the group and delivers an opening speech on their country or organisation's policies.LiNeBrEaKThey then take part in lobbying, debating and voting.LiNeBrEaKStudent administrative staff also take part in the event, distributing forms, resolutions and diplomatic correspondence for delegates and security staff, ensuring that order is kept.LiNeBrEaKThere is also an Arabic and English student Press team that reports on all aspects of delegate's activities, such as lobbying, merging and formal and informal debate.LiNeBrEaKAmong those taking part in the event for the first time was Royal University for Women student Sara Marjan.LiNeBrEaK"I joined MUN because it indirectly helps my studies and increases my confidence as well as helping me to have a broadened perspective of current events," she said.LiNeBrEaKMs Marjan represented Mexico in the General Assembly and spoke of her excitement and concern at taking to the stage in front of a large audience for the first time.LiNeBrEaK"I am so anxious and nervous because this is the first time I am participating in such an event," she said.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Perry's jabs at feds may have second target as well: From bailouts to Ike aid, some see positioning against Hutchison in 2010 governor race  	Janet Elliott, Houston Chronicle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1240 words  	Nov. 30--AUSTIN -- From the Wall Street bailout bill to helping the Gulf Coast recover from Hurricane Ike, it seems the federal government can do nothing right in the eyes of Gov. Rick Perry.LiNeBrEaKThe latest shot came Tuesday, when Perry accused federal environmental protection officials of "actively working to do more economic harm" to the state through potential regulation of carbon emissions linked to climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Washington has Texas in its sights," he said.LiNeBrEaKMany political observers believe Perry's harsh rhetoric is designed to position the governor in his bid for an unprecedented, third four-year term in 2010. The target is his likely challenger in the Republican primary, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is more popular than Perry in some polls. LiNeBrEaKHutchison in late September told her Senate colleagues that she wouldn't seek re-election to a leadership post and is planning to form an exploratory committee for the governor's race.LiNeBrEaK"I guess it's a pretty good shot to take on the federal government if you're running against someone who is an agent of the federal government," said Greg Thielemann, director of the Center for the Study of Texas Politics at the University of Texas at Dallas.LiNeBrEaK"I think his criticisms are his attempt to raise his profile, and if it slows down Sen. Hutchison, that's a good thing," said Bill Miller, an Austin political consultant.LiNeBrEaKMiller also said that he thinks Perry's comments reflect the "passing of the torch up in Washington" and that he now feels more free to criticize the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKPerry said in an interview that he has a long pattern of blasting federal government policies dating to his time as agriculture commissioner in the 1990s. Perry was lieutenant governor when George W. Bush became president in January 2000, and automatically became governor. He won elections in 2002 and 2006.LiNeBrEaKPerry has not been shy about speaking out against federal immigration policies, and most recently engaged in a back-and-forth with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff over federal failures to deport illegal immigrants booked into the Harris County Jail.LiNeBrEaKThe governor acknowledges he has stepped-up his critiques in recent weeks, but said the reason has nothing to do with politics.LiNeBrEaK"We have more at stake right now than we've ever had before," Perry said. "We have been hit by the largest storm that's hit Texas in a century. We have counties in Texas that are suffering greatly."LiNeBrEaKSparring over bailoutLiNeBrEaKThe initial sally, however, was not about hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time the U.S. Senate was debating a $700 billion bailout of the financial industry, Perry, who at the time was the head of the Republican Governor's Association, joined the Democratic governor of West Virginia in a bipartisan plea to Congress to "pass an economic recovery package."LiNeBrEaKLater that October day, Perry issued a written statement opposing the use of tax dollars to finance a bailout, putting himself at odds with the only piece of legislation being discussed, the plan to spend $700 billion to buy mortgage-backed securities that Hutchison and fellow Republican Sen. John Cornyn voted to pass under heavy lobbying from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.LiNeBrEaKPerry's press secretary, Mark Miner, referred to Hutchison as "Kay Bailout" in an Oct. 25 story about a poll done for the Houston Chronicle that showed Harris County voters favored Hutchison over Perry 46 percent to 30 percent. (The same poll showed Houston Mayor Bill White beating both Hutchison and Perry.)LiNeBrEaKMarc Short, a spokesman for Hutchison, said Perry flip-flopped on the bailout bill.LiNeBrEaK"Being for the bill before being against the bill is how you get 39 percent of the vote after six years in office," Short said, referring to Perry's share of the vote in 2006 when a Democrat and two independent candidates were on the ballot.LiNeBrEaKA liberal interest group jumped on Perry's statements as evidence he was kicking off his 2010 re-election campaign. Texans for Public Justice, in an Oct. 13 report, said Perry had awarded $35 million in taxpayer funds to two companies involved in the financial meltdown -- mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and failed bank Washington Mutual, which was seized by federal regulators and sold to JPMorgan Chase.LiNeBrEaKJob creation claimedLiNeBrEaKBoth companies met their requirements to create a specific number of jobs after receiving the Texas Enterprise Fund grants in 2004 and 2005, Perry said. The fund, which Perry asked the Legislature to create in 2003, has awarded $365 million to 48 projects, and created 52,099 new jobs and nearly $14 billion in capital investment, the governor's office said.LiNeBrEaK"The fact is if the federal government had that type of track record I wouldn't have a problem in the world," Perry said. "The fact is we've thrown $700 billion at mismanaged companies, at greedy Wall Streeters, and the result has been a stock market that has continued to go down."LiNeBrEaKTension between Hutchison and Perry has been evident since right after Hurricane Ike ripped through Galveston and southeast Texas in the early morning hours of Saturday, Sept. 13. The following day, the two made separate tours of the devastation and spoke to reporters in separate briefings.LiNeBrEaKState lawmakers initially lashed out at Federal Emergency Management Agency officials about a month after the storm, saying they were failing to get mobile homes to people, and were instead handing out motel vouchers when no rooms were available in the hardest-hit communities such as Bridge City.LiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 20, Perry held a news conference in Houston and called the federal government's efforts "pretty underwhelming."LiNeBrEaKHe questioned how Washington could "shower $700 billion on mismanaged Wall Street firms but can't spare the funds to help Broadway Street in Galveston."LiNeBrEaK"Thanks to congressional inactivity, if you will, Texans are unlikely to receive assistance until next summer," he said at the event.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Perry said his jabs at Congress were not aimed at the Texas delegation as much as the Democratic-controlled Congress.LiNeBrEaKHowever, he also has been highly critical of Chertoff, a Bush appointee, for saying Texas should use more of its own funds to help with debris removal. He said it is "incomprehensible" that federal officials would treat Texas differently than it did Louisiana after 2005's Hurricane Katrina.LiNeBrEaK"I will fight back vigorously to that type of discrimination," Perry said.LiNeBrEaKBlock grants deliveredLiNeBrEaKHutchison helped secure $6. 1 billion in community development block grant funding for weather-related disasters in an emergency supplemental spending bill passed about one week after Ike came ashore. She and Cornyn announced Wednesday that Texas would receive $1. 3 billion for repairs to homes and businesses in the first round of funding.LiNeBrEaK"Being part of the solution by employing state resources would be more helpful than flailing criticism of the federal delegation which continues to secure billions of dollars in aid for hurricane victims," Short said.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	New power broker Barbara Boxer works to avoid a knockout by Republicans  	By Rob Hotakainen, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1384 words  	WASHINGTON _ With new clout on Capitol Hill and nearly $4 million in her campaign bank, California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer says she's ready for whatever Republicans throw her way.LiNeBrEaK"If I have an opponent that's slashing and burning me, I fight back, because I always fight back," said Boxer, who's gearing up to run for a fourth term. "My name is Boxer, but I'm not a punching bag."LiNeBrEaKAt 68, California's junior senator is feisty as ever and at the pinnacle of her political power _ and she has no plans to give it up. Her next two years will be intensely busy. She's one of the most aggressive fundraisers among the 34 senators whose terms expire in 2010. And she's preparing for a high-profile role in the new Congress, where she intends to lead the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaKAs she looks ahead, Boxer's life in Washington has taken a dramatic turn. After spending the first 14 years of her Senate career as a backbencher with a reputation for talking more than legislating, she has emerged as an unlikely power broker and the only Democrat to lead two influential committees, the Senate's environmental and ethics panels. LiNeBrEaKRepublicans would like nothing more than to knock off Boxer, who ranks as one of the Senate's most liberal members.LiNeBrEaK"California Republicans view Barbara Boxer the way that national Republicans view Hillary Clinton," said Thad Kousser, associate professor of political science at the University of California-San Diego. "To many hardcore California Republicans, she is the political equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. ... This is the Senate seat that they always think is winnable, but they can never beat her."LiNeBrEaKBoxer got her start in politics in 1976, when she was elected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors. Six years later, she won a House seat and served 10 years before running for the Senate in 1992. She defeated Bruce Herschensohn, a conservative Los Angeles media commentator who survived a primary against Rep. Tom Campbell and singer Sonny Bono.LiNeBrEaKPolitical observers say Boxer has been lucky, never having to face a top-tier candidate. Now she's gunning hard to keep her seat, mindful that raising lots of money is a good way to play defense.LiNeBrEaK"You can't beat somebody with nobody. ... And one of the things Boxer has figured out is it's a great disincentive for challengers if they know they're already starting $4 million behind," said Jennifer Duffy, Senate analyst with the Cook Political Report.LiNeBrEaKCook, one of the leading political prognosticators in Washington, predicts easy sailing for Boxer, with the California race going "likely Democratic."LiNeBrEaKBut Duffy estimated that Boxer will need to raise $30 million to win, and she's watching one potential opponent who could change everything: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger: "If he gets in, that'd be a great race." If he doesn't, Duffy said, "There's not a great Republican bench in California."LiNeBrEaKMark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, said that any Republican hoping to oust Boxer starts at a big disadvantage, because it's so costly to build a statewide image. In the last Field Poll, released in June, Boxer had a 48 percent approval rating. She has always had lower ratings than Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the state's senior senator, partly because she's more liberal and has a more partisan image.LiNeBrEaKBoxer also has plenty of big-name friends. Former Vice President Al Gore attended one of her fundraisers. And last year, a junior senator named Barack Obama showed up at a San Francisco event, where he called Boxer "a fire, a meteor, a charmer and a cutie."LiNeBrEaKBoxer said she has developed a close relationship with the president-elect, even though she was skeptical that he could get elected to the Senate in 2004. She recalled a conversation with Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, who predicted that Obama would win.LiNeBrEaK"'I said, 'How can he possibly win with that name? People are going to confuse him _ Osama, Obama,'" Boxer recalled.LiNeBrEaKAnd she told the story of when Obama pulled her aside outside the Senate chamber one day to say he was pondering a run for president. She told him he could never beat Hillary Clinton.LiNeBrEaK"Shows you what I know," said Boxer. She said she couldn't decide whether to support Clinton or Obama during the 2008 primaries. "She's like a sister, and he's like a son. I just couldn't choose."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKAfter battling President George W. Bush on a host of environmental issues, Boxer says the difference between Bush and Obama could not be more stark. She cited Obama's remarks earlier this month, when he said that "few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent" than global warming.LiNeBrEaKAt a recent standing-room-only news conference, Boxer said that Obama's words were "music to my ears." Nothing short of "a sea change," she said, has struck Washington.LiNeBrEaK"We are being challenged to do this legislation where before we were told, 'Don't you dare do this legislation,'" Boxer said.LiNeBrEaKBoxer has a long wish list. She wants the new Congress to raise the profile of the Environmental Protection Agency by making its head a member of Obama's cabinet, saying morale at the agency "has been driven down to the ground."LiNeBrEaKShe's confident that Obama, unlike Bush, will back California's request for a waiver that would allow the state to act on its own to curb global warming.LiNeBrEaKShe remains opposed to offshore drilling and is hopeful that Congress will reinstate a ban against it next year.LiNeBrEaKBut her main job will be to argue the case that fighting global warming would be good for the economy and create millions of "green jobs."LiNeBrEaKLooking back, Boxer said, one of the hardest parts of joining the Senate was waiting "to get your wings." But in an institution that rewards longevity, she has steadily moved up the ladder, and next year will be the 19th most senior Democratic senator. (Feinstein will rank 17th.) Boxer has been patient, noting that inexperienced senators must first be students before they can think about being teachers.LiNeBrEaK"If you really want to get your arms around an issue and be a leader in the Senate, it takes time," said Boxer, adding: "I want to stay in the Senate and I want to work with this president. I've been fighting for change all of my life. We're on the doorstep of getting it."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKKousser said Boxer is enjoying both the fruits of seniority and being in the majority. And he said her views have not changed.LiNeBrEaK"The country's come a lot closer to Barbara Boxer on her signature issue, the environment and global warming especially," Kousser said. "She was ahead of public opinion on this but it's caught up with her to the point that Arnold Schwarzenegger resurrected his career in California politics in part by backing a global warming bill. ... So her positions are now the mainstream."LiNeBrEaKDuffy said there's one potential downside: Boxer's work on global warming could become "a double-edged sword" and give her opponents political ammunition, especially if Congress passes a tough bill that Republicans oppose and is perceived as being too onerous to industry.LiNeBrEaKFor now, Capitol Hill's environmental sheriff is clearly relishing her role. Boxer said she is often asked if she wants to run for governor and that her answer is no, because she's right where she has always wanted to be.LiNeBrEaK"My dream was to get the gavel, and I never thought I would, just because there were so many people in front of me when I started," Boxer said. "But it's all about fate in many ways."LiNeBrEaKBoxer wasted no time in laying down the law. She invited Gore to one of her first committee hearings. And when her predecessor and longtime nemesis, Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe, asked the former vice president to answer his questions in writing, Boxer would have none of it.LiNeBrEaK"You're not making the rules," she told a surprised Inhofe, holding up the gavel. "You used to. ... Elections have consequences, so I make the rules."

LiNeBrEaK  Traditional holiday lights generate as much global warming pollution as about 250,000 cars annually, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass. The group suggests LED (light-emitting diode) holiday lights, which use semiconductor technology to convert electricity into light directly, resulting in significant energy savings.

Going to the woods was part of what it meant to be an American.LiNeBrEaKToday, however, visitsLiNeBrEaKto the national forests are off 13 percent in recent years.LiNeBrEaKTop officials at the U.S. Forest Service blame it on circumstances outside their control - rising gas prices, the popularity of video games and the Internet, and an increasingly urban and aging population less inclined to camp out.LiNeBrEaKCritics focus on fees charged for hiking trails and visitor centers, a proliferation of noisy off-road vehicles and the declining proportion of the Forest Service budget dedicated to recreation.LiNeBrEaKJames Johnston, a policy analyst with Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics in Eugene, spent the past year camping out in 67 national forests and talking to 400 people. He concluded that while fewer people may be using the woods, fewer trails and campgrounds are open and there are more people riding noisy off-road vehicles.LiNeBrEaKCoupled with the decline in visits to national parks, the trend makes nature lovers nervous at a time when the growing global population and climate change pose huge threats to wild places.LiNeBrEaK"We only value what we know and what we love," said Richard Louv, author of "The Last Child in the Woods." "Where is the political constituency going to come from if all those trends continue - disinvestment in facilities, lack of diversity, the disconnect between children and nature?"LiNeBrEaKIf young people and the growing Hispanic population don't fill in for the aging white Baby Boomers who have long made up the vast majority of national forest visitors, what will that mean for the future?LiNeBrEaK"That is the big question," said Thomas More, a research forester with the U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt. "Is it going to be a future of hiking, or is it fancy cafes and city kinds of things? That's what we're trying to evaluate right now. And the information is mixed, frankly."

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Gang green's demands: Route to ruination  	The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	COMMENTARY  	283 words  	Nov. 30--A 391-page "wish list" from environmental groups to President-elect Barack Obama presses for a U-turn on White House policies. It's being hailed as a road map. LiNeBrEaKIndeed it is -- straight to a dead end.LiNeBrEaKThe "Transition to Green" report endorsed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife, among others, would be more appropriately titled the "Route to Ruination." That's where these recommendations will inevitably lead an economy in good times let alone bad.LiNeBrEaKHow in the vast wilderness of eco-extremists' minds will these demands refuel America when they would cut funding for safe and secure nuclear power, reinstate coastal drilling prohibitions and stifle oil and gas leases in some parts of Alaska? And you thought $4-a-gallon gasoline was bad.LiNeBrEaKThat's in addition to commerce-killing caps and taxes on greenhouse gases to contain the increasingly less-credible bogeyman of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe prospect of these eco-whacko yahoos getting their way would usher in an economic ice age. Many of Gang Green's priorities dovetail with Mr. Obama's campaign stands. And Congress, we remind, will be a much deeper shade of blue in the next session.LiNeBrEaKHow sad. How frightening.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: Memories of a neocon  	Bill Steigerwald, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	COMMENTARY  	2759 words  	Nov. 30--The more you know about Ben Wattenberg, the more you understand why Ronald Reagan called him his favorite Democrat. Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, is a tough 1960s Democrat -- a neoconservative on foreign and domestic matters who suspects Al Gore is on a religious crusade when it comes to global warming and who thinks his good friend Joe Lieberman is too far left on some domestic issues.LiNeBrEaKWattenberg, 75, is the host of PBS' show "Think Tank with Ben Wattenberg." He has written a handful of works built on socioeconomic and demographic statistics -- "data journalism," he calls it -- like "The Real America" (1974) that have analyzed American society and its politics.LiNeBrEaKHis 1987 book, "The Birth Dearth," debunked fears of the global population explosion everyone was worrying about and showed that the real long-term problem is falling fertility rates, especially in Western Europe. LiNeBrEaK"Fighting Words: A Tale of How Liberals Created Neo-Conservatism," is a mix of autobiography, stories about the famous men Wattenberg's worked with in Washington and a history of the neoconservative movement, which he played an important part in fostering. I talked to him Nov. 21 by phone from his home near Washington.LiNeBrEaKQ: What's your 60-second sound-bite description of your book?LiNeBrEaKA: It's the first book I've written that is a story, a narrative, rather than a thesis book. It's the story of a moderately Jewish boy who grows up in the Bronx -- where everybody was liberal to far left -- in a very intelligent household who through a series of events got to work for President Lyndon Johnson and who got to know the great and near-great in Washington and gradually saw that liberalism had gone, by my lights, far left. Ronald Reagan -- who was once a Democrat -- said, "I didn't change. My party did." I liked Reagan, and that's what I feel happened to the Democratic Party.LiNeBrEaKI wish Barack Obama well. I think he's done a lot of good for the country. Just having a black man on the covers of all the magazines and everything sends the world a message. But he has a very tough row to hoe, with the economy and everything. Since he's been elected the markets have gone down 13 or 14 percent. In my judgment he comes from really a radical background and he was in some very liberal organization, but he pivoted into center -- at least verbally -- with the speed of light. That's one of the theses of the book "Fighting Words." A lot of it is based on a book that Dick Scammon and I wrote in 1970 called "The Real Majority," which says that the center is the power position.LiNeBrEaKQ: What is your definition of "neoconservative"?LiNeBrEaKA: It's moderate government spending to protect the population; it's reasonable programs to help the poor and underprivileged; and it's an effort to help move the world to our democratic views and values. That's about as simply as I can put it.LiNeBrEaKQ: What is the biggest misconception about neoconservatism?LiNeBrEaKA: That neoconservatives want to impose American views and values on people who don't want them.LiNeBrEaKQ: I.e., the Iraq war?LiNeBrEaKA: Yeah, but the Iraq war was U.N.-sponsored. There were weapons of mass destruction -- poison gas is officially a weapon of mass destruction. There were lots of factors. People say they went to war for oil. ... It's like getting married. You get married for a lot of different reasons. I don't know how the war in Iraq is going to turn out. It's looking a lot better now than it did. The Arab world is beginning to loosen up a little bit. But right now, it's the most dangerous movement in the world. A guy at one of the think tanks here has called it World War IV. The idea is that neocons are just about foreign policy and just about idealism, but the most commonsensical thing we can do is to try to establish democratic views. That's what makes for a stable world.LiNeBrEaKQ: Why did you think it was time to write this book?LiNeBrEaKA: Look, if you call "neoconservatism" "potato" and you called liberalism "cantaloupe," potato would win by about 70-30, or 2-1. But this word has -- to its enemies -- got a terrible connotation cast on it. They say it is a bunch of hawks who want to impose American views and values on the world. But in point of fact, it's saying some very elementary things.LiNeBrEaKFirst of all, neoconservatism started not as a foreign policy movement but as a domestic movement, mostly in reaction to the terrible crime wave of the 1960s. My mother was mugged, my father was mugged twice, my son was mugged twice and my sister-in-law was murdered in an unsolved crime in Philadelphia. Now maybe that's extreme for any family, but there was the fear that people couldn't go out in the street at night.LiNeBrEaKWhat neoconservatives said was, let's look at the evidence. They were people like Daniel Moynihan, James Q. Wilson and Seymour Martin Lipset. They said let's forget all the shibboleths and all the cliches and let's say what it's all about. Wilson worked for 15 years on doing research and came up with this theory of "broken windows," which said that you can't let a neighborhood deteriorate even a little bit before the whole thing goes under.LiNeBrEaKQ: That "broken windows" theory of policing was a neoconservative idea?LiNeBrEaKA: "Neoconservative" has become such a tarnished word, but it's such common sense. There was a small group of people in America, the radicals, who said "law and order" is a code word for racism. It's not a code war for racism; it's a code word for civilization. We've cut the crime rate because we've gotten tough.LiNeBrEaKQ: Who do you want to read "Fighting Words"?LiNeBrEaKA: Everybody. There was a very good review in the American Spectator magazine. It's a good read. It's not a book about neoconservatism, the way Norman Podhoretz or Jim Wilson or Jeane Kirkpatrick -- people I admire -- might write one. It's a book about how I came to understand things; it's a story. There are a lot of interesting anecdotes in it.LiNeBrEaKOn the foreign policy side, Geopolitics 101 says that democracies don't go to war against one another. Parents don't want to send their kids to war to be killed. All the great massacres came about from totalitarianists -- Stalin and Hitler and the Imperial Japanese and Cuba. I think there was one little soccer war between two democracies in Central America.LiNeBrEaKSo when we went into Iraq to try to establish a democracy in the most dangerous region of the world -- under a U.N. mandate, by the way, with 20 allies -- it wasn't just saying we want everyone to be like America. We were trying to ensure some stability in the world.LiNeBrEaKQ: Of all the Washington stories you tell in the book, what's your favorite?LiNeBrEaKA: Well, when I came to work for President Johnson, Bill Moyers, who was then his chief of staff, and I had lunch in the White House mess. The vice president (Hubert Humphrey) came up and said, "I loved your book." I had written this book with Dick Scammon, "This USA," which was very optimistic. And then Moyers said, "Come on, there's someone I want you to meet."LiNeBrEaKWe go through this labyrinth of the White House and he takes me into LBJ's bedroom. LBJ is meeting there with Henry Ford II, having a late lunch. Johnson was in his pajamas. He used to take a nap in the afternoon; he'd work eight hours, then take a nap for three hours and work another eight hours. I was not used to talking to presidents, but I had told Bill Moyers what I was thinking about -- that everything was gloom and doom coming out of the White House and it shouldn't be because we were making great progress. Johnson went on and on and on, and then Bill said, "Why don't you tell the president what you were telling me?" I did. And Bill hired me on the spot and I stayed for just about the end of the Johnson presidency.LiNeBrEaKQ: Of all the smart and powerful people you met in Washington, who do you think is the most underrated or underappreciated today?LiNeBrEaKA: Well, I think Scoop Jackson (Sen. Henry Jackson, anti-Communist Democrat from Washington who died in 1983). He never got to be president. He ran twice. But even today if you talk to the people who run foreign policy, they break out into two groups -- they say they are pro-Scoop or anti-Scoop. Now he was one representative out of 535 in Congress. But he really left an imprint. What it was that (he thought) the United States can be both idealistic and realistic. Those are the two poles. He sort of blended the two. He said we have to have a strong defense but we have to do things like Radio Free Europe and the National Endowment for Democracy and Radio Free Asia and spread the word to the peoples of the world that democracy is OK.LiNeBrEaKQ: Scoop Jackson's ideas -- that blend of idealism and realism -- is that the definition of neoconservative foreign policy?LiNeBrEaKA: I think so. But you can't call it "neoconservative." You have to call it "cantaloupe" or "banana."LiNeBrEaKPaging Bill BennettLiNeBrEaK"The American Patriot's Almanac: Daily Readings on America by William J. Bennett and John Cribb" (Thomas Nelson)LiNeBrEaKQ: Please describe your book and tell us why you compiled it.LiNeBrEaKA: It's a patriot's devotional. It's a day-by-day compilation of what happened in American history on each day. Earlier this week (Nov. 10) we saluted the U.S. Marine Corps, which celebrated its 233rd birthday. And then we have what we call "The Parade of History" -- five or six other things that happened on that day. Each day is basically a page. It's obviously to contribute to this lifelong enterprise of mine, which is the education of Americans about their legacy and their history and their heritage. I remind people that American history is still our worst subject in the American school. It's an embarrassment. We don't know this stuff and we should. It's to correct that.LiNeBrEaKQ: Do you have to be a conservative or a Republican to like it?LiNeBrEaKA: No, no (laughs) -- like "The Book of Virtues." No. You have to have someone who at least believes that America is a proposition worth considering and indeed even worth embracing. I take it Barack Obama agrees with that.LiNeBrEaKCLASSIC EXCERPT: MR. HOOVER'S WRECK:LiNeBrEaKMr. Hoover met the challenge of the Great Depression by acting quickly and decisively, indeed almost continuously throughout his term of office, putting into effect "the greatest program of offense and defense" against depression ever attempted in America. Bravely he used every modern economic "tool," every device of progressive and "enlightened" economics, every facet of government planning, to combat the depression. For the first time, laissez-faire was boldly thrown overboard and every governmental weapon thrown into the breach. America had awakened, and was now ready to use the state to the hilt, unhampered by the supposed shibboleths of laissez-faire. President Hoover was a bold and audacious leader in this awakening. By every "progressive" tenet of our day he should have ended his term a conquering hero; instead he left America in utter and complete ruin; a ruin unprecedented in length and intensity.LiNeBrEaKWhat was the trouble? Economic theory demonstrates that only governmental inflation can generate a boom-and-bust cycle, and that the depression will be prolonged and aggravated by inflationist and other interventionary measures. In contrast to the myth of laissez-faire, we have shown in this book how government intervention generated the unsound boom of the 1920s, and how Hoover's new departure aggravated the Great Depression by massive measures of interference. The guilt for the Great Depression must, at long last, be lifted from the shoulders of the free-market economy, and placed where it properly belongs: at the door of the politicians, bureaucrats and the mass of "enlightened" economists. And in any other depression, past or future, the story will be the same.LiNeBrEaK--from "America's Great Depression" by Murray Rothbard (1963)LiNeBrEaKBOX OF BOOKS:LiNeBrEaK--"The Power of Place: Geography, Destiny and Globalization's Rough Landscape" (Oxford University Press) -- geography prof Harm De Blij's 30th book -- proves two things: Geography is never boring in his hands and the world is, pace Tom Friedman, not even close to being flat, literally or figuratively. Nor are the globe's diverse peoples as similar, interconnected or mobile as is often claimed: Fewer than 3 percent of us live in countries other than the ones in which we were born. Bill Moyers says Blij and his many maps do for geography what Carl Sagan did for cosmology, while Jeffrey Sachs says it is "a fascinating and deeply knowledgeable" account of the crucial ways in which "place" continues to shape economies, politics, languages, cultures and national power.LiNeBrEaK--"We Who Dared to Say No to War: American Antiwar Writing from 1812 to Now" (Basic Books) reminds us that our anti-war streak is a lot wider, deeper and more all-American than today's flag-waving proponents of the Iraq war think. Edited by lefty Murray Polner and libertarian Thomas Woods Jr., this anthology includes forgotten or often neglected essays, speeches, articles and poems from the likes of John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Randolph Bourne, Robert Taft, Russell Kirk, Robert McNamara, Murray Rothbard, George McGovern, Pat Buchanan and professional peaceniks Howard Zinn and Country Joe and the Fish. Whether for religious or secular reasons, these conservative and liberal patriots protested wisely, eloquently and often bravely against the wars our leaders have accidentally or deliberately dragged us into, from the War of 1812 to Iraq and the war on terror.LiNeBrEaK--"American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House" (Random House) is Jon Meacham's readable retelling of the familiar story of America's controversial seventh president and first populist chief executive. New York Times reviewer Andrew Cayton felt Meacham was too soft on the pro-slavery president's "darker qualities" -- which included a lust for political revenge, a dangerous habit of pandering to populist resentments and a near-genocidal mistreatment of American Indians. But overall, history professor Cayton calls "American Lion" "enormously entertaining, especially in the deft descriptions of Jackson's personality and domestic life in his White House." Historian Michael Beschloss praised it as a "spellbinding, brilliant and irresistible journey into the heart of Andrew Jackson and his unforgettable circle of friends and enemies."LiNeBrEaK--"Hamilton's Curse: How Jefferson's Archenemy Betrayed the American Revolution -- and What It Means for Americans Today" (Crown Forum) does to Alexander Hamilton what its iconoclastic author Thomas J. DiLorenzo did previously to Abe Lincoln in his "The Real Lincoln": It throws sharp libertarian rocks at Hamilton's shining reputation. DiLorenzo argues that Hamilton, the country's first treasury secretary, was -- like his soulmate Lincoln -- a huge fan of big government who helped create a country that Jefferson and other Founders would not only not recognize, but hate and fear. Hamilton's legacy, as carried on by his political heirs, includes a weakened Constitution; a bloated, centralized, interventionist federal government (at home and abroad); an imperial presidency and a government system built on graft, spoils and patronage. No wonder Congressman Ron Paul recommends the book "to my fellow Jeffersonians."LiNeBrEaK--"New Deal or Raw Deal? How FDR's Economic Legacy Has Damaged America" (Simon and Schuster) is Burton Folsom's contribution to the now-popular but long-overdue demythologizing of the New Deal. Liberals, schoolchildren and anyone yet to read Amity Shlaes' "The Forgotten Man" still believe FDR's policies saved us from the Great Depression -- and that we need more FDR-like solutions today. But Folsom shows that it was foolish or harmful government interventions, not private enterprise, that brought us the Great Depression, prolonged it until World War II and left us with a crippling legacy of high taxes, unnecessary regulations and fiscal time bombs like Social Security. Plugging the book, The Wall Street Journal's Stephen Moore says the New Deal's agenda "caused more human suffering and deprivation in America than any other set of ideas in the twentieth century."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   TWO STAR EDITION	VISITS TO NATIONAL FORESTS DOWN 13 PERCENT  	Jeff Barnard, The Associated Press  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-7  	686 words  	GRANTS PASS, Ore. -- In the years after World War II, Americans packed up their young families and Army surplus camping gear and headed into the national forests to hunt, fish, and hike. Going to the woods was part of what it meant to be an American.LiNeBrEaKToday, however, visits to the national forests are off 13 percent. LiNeBrEaKTop officials at the U.S. Forest Service blame it on circumstances outside their control -- rising gas prices, the popularity of video games and the Internet, and an increasingly urban and aging population less inclined to camp out.LiNeBrEaKCritics focus on fees charged for hiking trails and visitor centers, a proliferation of noisy off-road vehicles and the declining proportion of the Forest Service budget dedicated to recreation.LiNeBrEaKJames Johnston, a policy analyst with Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics in Eugene, spent the last year camping out in 67 national forests and talking to 400 people. He concluded that while fewer people may be using the woods, fewer trails and campgrounds are open and there are more people riding noisy off-road vehicles.LiNeBrEaK"They think that it's harder to find solitude," he said of the people he talked to.LiNeBrEaKCoupled with the decline in visits to national parks, the trend makes nature lovers nervous at a time when the growing global population and climate change pose huge threats to wild places.LiNeBrEaKIf young people and the growing Hispanic population don't fill in for the aging white Baby Boomers, who have long made up the vast majority of national forest visitors, what will that mean for the future?LiNeBrEaK"That is the big question," said Thomas More, a research forester with the U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt. "Is it going to be a future of hiking or is it fancy cafes and city kinds of things? That's what we're trying to evaluate right now. And the information is mixed, frankly."LiNeBrEaKThe national forests date to 1891, when Congress authorized reserves to protect forests from cut-and-run logging. The system has grown to 155 national forests covering 190 million acres.LiNeBrEaKThough they were always used for recreation, there was no legal recognition of that role until the Multiple Use Act of 1960, said James G. Lewis, historian for the Forest History Society in Durham, N.C.LiNeBrEaKThe Forest Service didn't conduct a statistically rigorous survey of visitation until 2000. That National Visitor Use Monitoring program found 204. 8 million visitors annually in the period 2000-2003 and 178. 6 million for 2003-2007 -- a decline of 13 percent. When compared to the rising population, the proportion of Americans visiting national forests is falling even faster.LiNeBrEaKMr. More said the decline appears to have started in the 1980s, during the Reagan administration, when the Forest Service became much more interested in logging than recreation.LiNeBrEaK"Remember Reagan's famous quote about if you've seen one redwood you've seen them all?" Mr. More said.LiNeBrEaKThe Endangered Species Act slowed logging in the 1990s, demanding more habitat for the northern spotted owl and other wildlife. Without the revenue from timber, the Forest Service got Congress in 1996 to allow fees for trails and other amenities.LiNeBrEaKScott Silver, executive director of Wild Wilderness in Bend, Ore., sees a strong correlation between the imposition of fees and declining visits.LiNeBrEaK"They raised the fees, and people stopped coming," Mr. Silver said. "The theory of supply and demand, price and elasticity was proven."LiNeBrEaKTop Forest Service officials reject Mr. Silver's assertion about fees. Although their surveys don't address the question, they attribute the decline primarily to the older and more urbanized population, and increasing popularity of electronic entertainment and to rising gas prices.LiNeBrEaK"For families of modest means with large vehicles who have got to travel large distances, even the prices of two and three years ago were starting to cut into the recreation opportunity," said Mark Rey, undersecretary of agriculture in charge of the Forest Service.LiNeBrEaK"We are seeing less participation in overnight camping than the quick day trips," said Forest Service recreation director Jim Bedwell.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	URI is working to make R.I. greener  	BY S. BRADLEY MORAN  	BUSINESS; Pg. 4  	776 words  	Rhode Island   and indeed our nation   has much to gain by fostering the green economy. A necessary first step is to continue to encourage the private sector and our elected leaders to work together to develop partnerships with higher education institutions that have a shared vision of green initiatives.LiNeBrEaKThe next steps include providing an attractive tax environment and financial incentives designed to grow green businesses and catalyze the economic recovery. But as with the state and national budget woes, rising energy costs add to the already difficult financial situation of most publicly funded institutions. LiNeBrEaKFor example, the University of Rhode Island has endured cuts in state appropriation to the point where taxpayers now contribute 11 percent of URI s annual operating cost of about $525 million.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, URI has long worked to develop a leaner and more efficient financial operation. Tuition and enrollment have increased, while URI maintains a competitive position in higher education.LiNeBrEaKInvestment has been made in a Division of Research and Economic Development and a new research park.LiNeBrEaKBut raising tuition and investing in research alone may not suffice in the face of rising energy costs. Furthermore, coupling rising tuition rates with a troubled economy may make college unattainable and prohibit development of the level of expertise we so desperately need to ensure our future.LiNeBrEaKBut all of this is not a doomsday scenario. Forbes magazine recently ranked Rhode Island the eighth greenest state, with the lowest per capita energy consumption and the third lowest carbon footprint of any state.LiNeBrEaKTherein lies at least part of the solution  the green economy. For the green economy is based squarely on finding creative and profitable ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy demand and costs.LiNeBrEaKA lesson for the state in how to further cut costs and make little Rhody a little greener is taking root at URI. Beginning more than a year ago, URI s energy future came under examination with an eye toward cutting costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is a win-win situation in that there is an opportunity to reduce costs in creative ways, develop innovative research and education programs and attract private investment.LiNeBrEaKA key step in this green direction came in 2007, when URI President Robert Carothers signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) that led to the creation of a Council on Sustainability, a committed group of faculty, staff and students.LiNeBrEaKThis contract requires URI to take measurable steps to reduce its emissions, including a comprehensive environmental audit. Included in this audit are potentially harmful factors such as carbon dioxide (CO{-2}) and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. Primary contributors to CO{-2} emissions are purchased electricity, transportation of faculty, staff and students, on-campus steam production and solid waste.LiNeBrEaKWhile these emissions have increased with the growth of the institution, URI s carbon footprint has held steady over the past decade. This may not resonate with average citizens, yet it is precisely this carbon benchmarking that is needed to design and evaluate ways to improve efficiency.LiNeBrEaKFor example, an energy performance contract is being conducted that it is estimated will result in a 10 percent to 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, while saving millions in projected energy costs through upgraded electrical systems, windows, insulation and related improvements in energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKURI is also working to increase material recycling, implement Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified green building practices, convert dining hall oil waste into biofuel and develop a clean transportation policy.LiNeBrEaKThere are also a number of new green research programs, including those on offshore renewable energy, development of switchgrass as a biofuel and advancement in battery technology. New education initiatives include the  Blue MBA  in ocean and climate sciences and an undergraduate minor in sustainability.LiNeBrEaKThe green initiatives being taken at URI and in partnership with other academic institutions and organizations will collectively prepare the next generation of skilled researchers and workers for the new green economy. Not only will this focus improve the state s operating efficiency, it will serve as a magnet to foster the new knowledge-based economy with Rhode Island in the lead.LiNeBrEaKS. Bradley Moran is the assistant vice president for research administration and professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island. He lives in Kingston.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Several groups offer ways to make holidays greener  		NEWS; Local; Pg. 4  	1268 words  	As the holiday season approaches, a growing array of groups are offering suggestions on how to make the holidays greener and more sustainable.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency is urging consumers to buy appliances that carry the Energy Star label. It says an average household fully equipped with Energy Star appliances could save $700 annually on energy costs.LiNeBrEaKFor example, Energy Star televisions use 30-percent less energy, Energy Star computers use up to 50-percent less, and LED decorative lights use 75-percent less energy than conventional incandescent bulbs.LiNeBrEaKNext month s issue of the Ladies Home Journal is filled with tips on how to save money and conserve energy during the holiday season, focusing on cutting costs in the kitchen, reducing heating and cleaning costs, and installing special energy-saving features at home. LiNeBrEaKThe Toxins Information Project, based in Providence, announced that its Healthy Holidays Handbook, containing safe holiday and gift ideas, is in print and available in state libraries as well as on TIP s Web site, www.toxicsinfo.org.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Kettle Pond Visitor Center will have a holiday open house Saturday that will include handmade birdhouses that children will be allowed to decorate. The houses were made by the late Victor Valentini, whose wife and daughter made them available for children. For details, call (401) 364-9124.LiNeBrEaKThe Audubon Society of Rhode Island is having its annual Christmas-tree sale from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at its headquarters, in Smithfield, and its Environmental Education Center, in Bristol. All trees are freshly cut and local. Proceeds support Audubon s educational programs.LiNeBrEaKFinally, several new environmental books might make good presents. 100 Ways to Save the World, 192 pages, $16. 95, by Johan Tell, offers simple, positive things people can do and they are presented with good graphics and clear writing that could be shared with children. Writer and activist Bill Mckibben writes the forward.LiNeBrEaKCool Cuisine: Taking the Bite Out of Global Warming, 244 pages, $24. 99, by Laure Stec with Eugene Cordero, offers a different approach on combating climate change. It describes how the world s agrochemical food system might affect global warming and offers an alternative for individuals: food lore, culinary tips and recipes on how to cook low carbon, high flavor meals.LiNeBrEaKInquiries into the Nature of Slow Money   Investing as if Food, Farms and Fertility Mattered, 200 pages, $21. 95, by Woody Tasch, describes a new economy based on small, local food producers.LiNeBrEaKURI lecture focuses on carbonLiNeBrEaKRobert Socolow, co-director of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative at Princeton University, will present the final lecture in the University of Rhode Island s 2008 Honors Colloquium on Tuesday at 7: 30 p.m.LiNeBrEaKHis presentation,  Solutions to the Global Carbon and Climate Problem,  will be held in Edwards Auditorium on URI s Kingston campus.LiNeBrEaKAn internationally recognized expert on energy and global carbon management, Socolow s research interests include carbon-dioxide capture from fossil fuels and storage in geological formations, nuclear power, energy efficiency in buildings, and the acceleration of deployment of advanced technologies in developing countries. He is a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the former director of Princeton s Center for Energy and Environmental Studies.LiNeBrEaKThe Carbon Mitigation Initiative, which Socolow co-directs, is a joint project of Princeton, British Petroleum and Ford Motor Co. to find solutions to the greenhouse-gas problem. It works to identify the most effective, safe and affordable methods of capturing and sequestering a large percentage of carbon emissions from fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKTime Magazine has described Socolow and co-director Stephen Pacala as strategists who  have come up with a remarkably straightforward way of approaching [global warming]. To stabilize the world s carbon emissions, they propose not chasing a single magic bullet but harnessing seven different categories of reduction, using available technology. Their goal is to draw a road map for reducing CO2 emissions that is both realistic and effective. Each of the strategies they have identified could prevent a total of 25 billion tons of emissions by 2056.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Sierra Nevada climate changes feed monster, forest-devouring fires  	Tom Knudson, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	737 words  	Nov. 30--Driving home from Lake Tahoe, Leah Wills watched the column of ash-gray smoke from the Moonlight fire grow and grow -- until finally she was under it.LiNeBrEaKOverhead, the sky that September afternoon in 2007 turned eerie pink. Orange-red flecks of burning bark streaked like missiles through the air. And the smoke -- eye-watering and acrid -- was inescapable.LiNeBrEaK"It was like a nuclear cloud," said Wills, 59, a policy analyst for the Plumas County Flood Control District who lives near the tiny hamlet of Genesee. "I've been to Denali and Kilimanjaro. I grew up with tornadoes. I've seen some big things. I never saw anything that big in my life." LiNeBrEaKWildfire has marched across the West for centuries. But no longer are major conflagrations fueled simply by heavy brush and timber. Now climate change is stoking the flames higher and hotter, too.LiNeBrEaKThat view, common among firefighters, is reflected in new studies that tie changing patterns of heat and moisture in the western United States to an unprecedented rash of costly and destructive wildfires.LiNeBrEaKAmong other things, researchers have found the frequency of wildfire increased fourfold -- and the terrain burned expanded sixfold -- as summers grew longer and hotter over the past two decades.LiNeBrEaKThe fire season now stretches out 78 days longer than it did during the 1970s and '80s. And, on average, large fires burn for more than a month, compared with just a week a generation ago.LiNeBrEaKScientists also have discovered that in many places, nothing signals a bad fire year like a short winter and an early snowmelt. Overall, 72 percent of the land scorched across the West from 1987 to 2003 burned in early snowmelt years.LiNeBrEaKAcross the Sierra, satellite imagery shows that today's wildfires are far more destructive than fires of the past, leaving larger portions of the burned landscape looking like nuclear blast zones. That searing intensity, in turn, is threatening water quality, wildlife habitat, rural and resort communities and firefighter lives.LiNeBrEaKAs the climate warms, the ability of the region's mixed conifer forest ecosystem to recover from these destructive fires is in danger.LiNeBrEaK"We're getting into a place where we are almost having a perfect storm" for wildfire, said Jay Miller, a U.S. Forest Service researcher and lead author of a recent paper published in the scientific journal Ecosystems linking climate change to the more severe fires in the Sierra.LiNeBrEaK"We have increased fuels, but this changing climate is adding an additional stress on the whole situation," Miller said. "When things get bad, things will get much worse."LiNeBrEaKLonger, more intense fire seasonsLiNeBrEaKThat future may already have arrived. This year, the fire season got off to an early June start in the north state and only recently came to a close. Statewide, 1. 4 million acres burned in 2008, just shy of last year's 1. 5 million acres, the highest total in at least four decades.LiNeBrEaK"When I started fighting fire, the normal fire season was from the beginning of June to the end of September," said Pete Duncan, a fuels management officer for the Plumas National Forest. "Now we are bringing crews on in the middle of April and they are working into November and December."LiNeBrEaK"And we're seeing fires now burning in areas that normally we wouldn't consider a high-intensity burn situation."LiNeBrEaKJust a few weeks ago, Duncan heard about one such incident: the Panther fire on the Klamath National Forest near the Oregon border.LiNeBrEaK"It made an eight-mile run one afternoon, in late October. It burned through an area of fairly high elevation old-growth timber and at very high severity," Duncan said.LiNeBrEaK"I was kind of amazed," he added, "that something would have burned to that scale. To make a 40,000-acre run in an afternoon is significant for any time of year -- but particularly for that time of year."LiNeBrEaKThe Moonlight fire, which burned across the Plumas National Forest and timber industry land north of Quincy, was one of the most environmentally destructive in recent memory.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Tom Knudson, (530) 582-5336.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Governor's legacy riding on budget fix  	John Marelius, STAFF WRITER  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	978 words  	Five years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger took over a state drowning in red ink, brimming with confidence that he and the Legislature would forge a bipartisan solution that would put California back on sound financial footing.LiNeBrEaK"I know there are some who say that the Legislature and I will never agree on solutions to our problems," the internationally famous bodybuilder and action-movie star said in his Nov. 17, 2003, inaugural address. "But I've found in my life that people often respond in remarkable ways to remarkable challenges."LiNeBrEaKFive years later, Schwarzenegger presides over a state drowning in red ink and last week made no effort to conceal his exasperation over the Legislature's failure once again to agree to a plan to cut into the state's $28 billion deficit. LiNeBrEaK"It was a total failure on the Legislature's part," the Republican governor said on Tuesday after the latest proposed compromise blew up. "You saw it's like a kindergarten down there, where they point fingers at each other."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger's colorful tenure after the historic recall election of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has had its successes: overhauling the workers' compensation system, wresting the power to redraw legislative district boundaries from the Legislature and enacting regulations to curb greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut his inability to slay the fiscal dragon raises questions about what kind of legacy Schwarzenegger will leave when his term is up in two years or whether he will even stick around that long.LiNeBrEaK"The lingering question would be this: Did Arnold conquer Sacramento or did Sacramento conquer Arnold?" said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. "In terms of style and political approach, he has done things that other governors have not. On the other hand, if you look at where the state is vis-&aacute;-vis 2003, there's an argument that we've gone full circle."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger's celebrity outsider status has been an asset in the public side of the job, but not when it comes to the gritty day-to-day work of governing.LiNeBrEaK"He is a political novice who came up against political forces that were just too strong," said Jack Pitney, a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College.LiNeBrEaK"In 2004, he made a push to elect Republicans to the Legislature, but gerrymandering prevented that. In 2005, he pushed his agenda through ballot measures and he ran up against the power of special interests. And now he's running up against the cruel arithmetic of the budget. There are some weights that even Arnold Schwarzenegger can't lift."LiNeBrEaKFormer Schwarzenegger economic adviser Joel Fox agreed.LiNeBrEaK"He had great intentions when he ran for office, but he obviously was a novice in the workings of Sacramento, so I believe that disrupted his plans," he said.LiNeBrEaKIf the budget mess continues on its intractable course, Schwarzenegger's best hope for a lasting legacy is probably in environmental policy.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he supported Republican John McCain for president, Schwarzenegger has ties to President-elect Barack Obama through his Kennedy in-laws.LiNeBrEaKHe has said publicly he would be open to a job in the Obama administration after he leaves office in 2011.LiNeBrEaK"I will help in every possible way the administration to be successful," Schwarzenegger said in a recent Fox News interview. "So whatever they need, I'm there."LiNeBrEaKObama's election "really saves Arnold's legacy," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California School of Policy, Planning and Development.LiNeBrEaK"He can now focus on the environmental issues that are so dear to him and he'll have a much better chance of a positive response from the feds," she said. "He's got a buddy in the White House who's not about to tell California to drop dead if they want to tighten their own standards."LiNeBrEaKJoe Mathews, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation who wrote a book about Schwarzenegger's 2003 campaign, envisions the governor becoming "climate change czar" in the Obama administration and does not rule out Schwarzenegger's leaving office early to accept it -- even if it means leaving the governorship in the hands of Democratic Lt. Gov. John Garamendi.LiNeBrEaK"If I were Governor Schwarzenegger, I would seek leverage in the current budget situation by reminding Republicans of this fact," Mathews wrote. " `I know you don't like me,' he might say, `but if you don't start playing ball, I might just take my ball and leave you with a Democratic governor.' "LiNeBrEaKConservative Republicans have always regarded Schwarzenegger with suspicion because of his liberal views on social issues and bipartisan approach to governing. But he held them in line during his 2006 re-election campaign by promising not to raise taxes.LiNeBrEaKWhile Schwarzenegger's no-new-taxes pledge has since given way to the enormity of the state's fiscal problems, it remains a line Republican legislators refuse to cross.LiNeBrEaK"The bigger-than-life superstar turned out to be just another politician who squandered the opportunity of the recall and embraced the status quo," grumbled Jon Fleischman, publisher of the widely read conservative blog FlashReport.LiNeBrEaKBy most analyses, Schwarzenegger has little choice but to find a solution to the budget crisis if he is to be viewed as a successful governor.LiNeBrEaK"I think what he really needs to do is what he was elected to do in the first place, which is to try to come to grips with the budget and fiscal problems of California," Fox said.LiNeBrEaKLarry Gerston, a political science professor at San Jose State University, agreed.LiNeBrEaK"Another governor might be viewed as the environmental governor.

San Antonio Express-News 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   STATEandMETRO Edition	YOUR TURN  		VIEWS; Pg. 10B  	515 words  	Back to the basicsLiNeBrEaKI love sports in school. But unless a student goes on to make a living playing sports, they need credits in the other basic subjects much more. Too many of our young people are graduating from high school without the knowledge needed to get good jobs. Sometimes it makes that first year of college rough, too. LiNeBrEaKIt's time to get back to basics and get credits for those subjects. Sports and band are fun and do help in other ways, but not if you want to be a doctor, lawyer or businessperson and need to support a family some day.LiNeBrEaK-- Carol JohnstonLiNeBrEaKWhat weaknesses?LiNeBrEaKRe: "Learn to think, "Your Turn, Nov. 22):LiNeBrEaKTrish Kimminau failed to identify the "weaknesses" that biology teachers should discuss with their students regarding evolution. The teaching of evolutionary facts is not "scary," as she implies. Does she also feel that teaching the facts of gravity is scary? Why waste students' valuable time teaching evolutionary weaknesses that do not exist?LiNeBrEaKStudents should develop critical thinking skills concerning the facts about evolution, such as: tadpoles evolving into frogs; caterpillars evolving into butterflies; a fertilized egg evolving into an embryo, then a fetus, then into a living, breathing person.LiNeBrEaKWhy is it so difficult for some people to understand the true concept of evolution? Evolution is a scientifically proven and accepted concept. Show me the weaknesses.LiNeBrEaK-- Gilbert WhitseyLiNeBrEaKTime for a second opinionLiNeBrEaKRe: Weston ("In the fight of his life," A Section, Monday):LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force gave Airman Basic Joseph Weston a physical examination before accepting him for training. He apparently passed.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Force should get a second medical opinion. If that opinion concurs that there was no way anyone could tell Weston had leukemia and does have it, then award him a medical discharge and send him home. He has not completed boot camp, so he has not qualified to be an airman. He has not done anything to earn retirement, so he shouldn't get any. Release him and wish him well.LiNeBrEaK-- Harold Siemens, SeguinLiNeBrEaKClean energy storageLiNeBrEaKRe: "Is costly nuclear energy too big a risk for San Antonio?" (Views, Nov. 23):LiNeBrEaKI am no fan of fossil fuels. I believe strongly that global warming is the most serious issue of our times. Period. But what amazes me is that although much is made of the capability of wind and solar energies and the massive power they can generate, I rarely see any reference to the only remaining issue restraining those technologies: storage.LiNeBrEaKI would only ask Jan Jarboe Russell to consider if we have time to develop sustainable and safe ways to store such energy on any day when it's windless and cloudy. This is not as stupid as it sounds.LiNeBrEaKAs of today, there are only fledgling battery ideas and some environmentally dangerous thoughts of underground storage.LiNeBrEaKThe timing for a technology coming to fruition is crucial here.LiNeBrEaKWith the population as large as it is, increasing as rapidly as it does, where are our huge "energy footprints" to go?LiNeBrEaKConservation, of course, would help.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   FINAL Edition	Warming Science and science fiction  	Debra J. Saunders  	Insight; DEBRA J. SAUNDERS; Pg. G6  	762 words  	Here's another reason why people don't trust newspapers. When science reporters write about, say, hormone therapy or drinking red wine, they report on studies that find that hormones or red wine can be good for you, as well as studies that suggest otherwise. Any science involving complex organisms is rarely black and white. LiNeBrEaKWhen it comes to global warming, newspapers play up stories that reinforce the prevalent the-sky-is-falling belief that global warming is human-caused and catastrophic. But if a study or scientist does not portend the end of the world as we know it, it rarely rates as news. LiNeBrEaKIn that spirit, many papers including The Chronicle have reported on a UC San Diego science historian who reviewed 928 abstracts of peer-reviewed articles on global warming published between 1993 and 2003, and concluded, "Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position."LiNeBrEaKOver 10 years, not one study challenged the orthodoxy - does that sound right to you? If that were true, it would strongly suggest that, despite conflicting evidence in this wide and changing world, no scientist dares challenge the politically correct position on the issue. LiNeBrEaKNo wonder David Bellamy - an Australian botanist who was involved in some 400 TV productions, only to see his TV career go south after he questioned global warming orthodoxy - wrote in the Australian last week, "It's not even science any more; it's anti-science." Bellamy notes that official data show that "in every year since 1998, world temperatures have been getting colder, and in 2002, Arctic ice actually increased." Exhibit B: MIT Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Sciences Richard S. Lindzen recently wrote, "There has been no warming since 1997 and no statistically significant warming since 1995." LiNeBrEaKSuch findings rarely are reported, even though - as Marc Morano, communications director for the Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told me - "Scientists keep coming out of the woodwork" to challenge the so-called consensus. "It's almost like a bandwagon effect."LiNeBrEaKThe Global Warming Petition Project urges Washington to reject the Kyoto international global warming pact because there is "no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. So far, the Politico reports, more than 31,000 scientists have signed it.LiNeBrEaKThe latest skirmish in the global warming war - barely reported in America - occurred after two bloggers found that the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies data wrongly cast October as the warmest in recorded history. It turns out that the mistake was due to an error that wrongly tapped September temperature records from Russia. Christopher Booker of the Sunday Telegraph of London found the mistake startling in light of other contrary climate statistics, including National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration findings of 63 local snowfall records and 115 lowest-ever temperatures for the month.LiNeBrEaKIn an e-mail, Goddard researcher Gavin Schmidt said, "The incorrect analysis was online for less than 24 hours." Thank bloggers Anthony Watts, an American meteorologist, and Steve McIntyre, a Canadian computer analyst, for catching the mistake. The error occurred because a report "had the wrong month label attached. There is quality control at NOAA and GISS but this particular problem had not been noticed before and the existing QC procedures didn't catch it. These have now been amended." LiNeBrEaK As for the snowfall records and low temperatures cited by Booker, Schmidt chalked them up to "cherry picking" data. He added, "Far more important are the long-term trends."LiNeBrEaKNow honest mistakes happen - even in high-powered, well-funded research facilities. Just last year, again thanks to the vigilance of Watts and McIntyre, Goddard had to reconfigure its findings and recognize 1934 - not 1998, as it had figured - as the hottest year on record in American history. LiNeBrEaKAlas, it is hard to see Goddard as objective when its director, James Hansen, testified in a London court in September in support of six eco-vandals. A jury then acquitted the six Greenpeace activists on charges of vandalizing a British coal-fired power plant based on the "lawful excuse" defense that their use of force would prevent greater damage to the environment after Hansen predicted the one Kingsnorth plant could push 400 species into extinction. LiNeBrEaKOf course, he could be wrong.

Seattle Times (Washington)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Canada's oil-sands boom creates vast riches and a dirty footprint  	Steve Ringman, Seattle Times  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	2431 words  	Nov. 30--FORT MCMURRAY, Alberta -- Energy security is not for the fainthearted.LiNeBrEaKIn the giant, open-pit mines north of this sub-Arctic boomtown, oil literally is carved out of the ground. Shovels the size of buildings scoop hundreds of tons of oil-soaked dirt into Caterpillar dump trucks as big as two-story houses. The trucks move to and from the pits in a perpetual storm of dust.LiNeBrEaKEverything in the Canadian oil sands -- from the machinery to the seemingly infinite oil reserves -- is extra large.LiNeBrEaK"This is mining to the max -- it's very extreme," said Brian Patey, who came from Newfoundland in eastern Canada and now runs the truck shop at the Albian Sands Energy mine, a joint venture by oil companies Shell, Chevron and Marathon. Patey said that when he first saw a mine truck, "I thought it was the biggest thing in the world." LiNeBrEaKOnce shunned by oil companies that preferred easier-to-exploit reservoirs of liquid crude, Alberta's oil sands now have made Canada the top foreign supplier of crude to the U.S. They contain the world's second-largest storehouse of crude -- surpassing U.S. reserves by a factor of eight.LiNeBrEaKIf the United States is to reduce its reliance on importing oil from countries that are unfriendly or unstable, Canada's oil sands are the place.LiNeBrEaKYet, no other source of oil better illustrates our society's Faustian dilemma between energy security and environmental responsibility.LiNeBrEaKExtracting the tarlike oil called bitumen and converting it into the light crude that refiners want is an energy-intensive process that annually produces as much carbon dioxide as 6 million cars.LiNeBrEaKPut another way, extracting oil from the sands creates about three times the greenhouse gases as conventional drilling.LiNeBrEaKCanada, which in 1997 signed the Kyoto treaty on reducing emissions, now struggles to reconcile its newfound role of energy superpower with its promise to cut greenhouse gases. Some say oil-sands profits have cooled the country's enthusiasm for the treaty.LiNeBrEaK"It's the one thing that is really dragging us in the opposite direction from Kyoto targets," said Simon Dyer, a fellow with the Pembina Institute, a Canadian environmental think tank.LiNeBrEaKSome U.S. policymakers question whether this country should continue to increase its reliance on the oil sands, due to their heavy environmental footprint.LiNeBrEaKAnd President-elect Obama could add pressure on the oil-sands industry to clean up its act, said Chris Sands, a senior fellow with the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaK"For Obama, fossil fuels are something we should be moving away from -- the dirtier, the worse," Sands said.LiNeBrEaKExtreme miningLiNeBrEaKNorthern Alberta reeks of oil. Over millions of years, vast quantities of petroleum were trapped in beachlike sand formations spanning an area roughly the size of Florida.LiNeBrEaKIn some places, oil lies so close to the surface that it seeps out of the earth, a black, viscous goop that sometimes naturally spills into lakes and the Athabasca River, which flows northward toward the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKShallow deposits of this very thick oil -- called bitumen -- are mined in open quarries, much like iron ore. Most of the oil, though, lies in deeper deposits commonly exploited by injecting steam into the ground to heat and liquefy the bitumen so that it can be pumped out.LiNeBrEaKThe smell of petroleum begins just a few miles north of Fort McMurray, where both sides of the highway are lined with mazes of tubes and tall cylinders called "upgraders." That's where the bitumen is processed into synthetic light crude, the type most valuable to refiners because it's easy to convert into gasoline.LiNeBrEaKWhen the highway reaches the Albian Sands mine, a 4. 5-square-mile trench carved out of the boreal forest, it's the landscape that smells. The mine's giant trucks can haul up to 380 tons of dirt, yielding about 190 barrels of oil, or about 3,600 gallons of gasoline -- enough to fuel the average Washington state car for nine years.LiNeBrEaKThe dug-up moonscape of the mine looks like an outlandish, 70-yard-deep sandbox for giants. Stand still too long, and your shoes will sink a little in the oily muck.LiNeBrEaK"We're a vast dirt-moving operation," Shell spokeswoman Janet Annesley said.LiNeBrEaKThis rich region is about 700 miles north of the U.S. border, but most of the 1. 2 million barrels of oil extracted here daily goes to the Midwest and even Texas, providing about 9 percent of U.S. crude imports. Washington state's refineries receive at least 10 percent of their oil from Alberta, a figure expected to increase as production wanes on Alaska's North Slope.LiNeBrEaKAlbian Sands, one of three active mines in the region, produces about 155,000 barrels of bitumen a day; an expansion under way will mean an additional 100,000.LiNeBrEaKTotal output from the oil sands is expected to triple by 2020 to 3. 5 million barrels of oil per day. Falling energy prices have made oil companies delay some projects, but most analysts still expect formidable growth in the long term.LiNeBrEaK"The oil sands have become a strategic resource for the whole world," said Don Thompson, head of the Oil Sands Developers Group. "All of a sudden, the spotlight is shining on us big time."LiNeBrEaKBoreal boomtownLiNeBrEaKThat spotlight has drawn thousands of workers to Fort McMurray, a former fur-trading post that has seen its population nearly double in a decade to 65,000. Thousands more live in temporary camps near the oil sands.LiNeBrEaKMost come from Canada's eastern provinces, but there are also Venezuelan petrochemists, Filipino hotel workers and South African doctors.LiNeBrEaKTheresa Ballard, a former hair stylist from Newfoundland who became a truck driver at Albian Sands, complains that the place has grown so rapidly that "there's no breathing space."LiNeBrEaKDemand for labor remains so high that a recent Craigslist ad seeking dishwashers at a pizza parlor promised $14. 20 an hour (Canadian), more than a starting mechanic at Boeing. Truck drivers and oil-sands workers earn well into the six figures.LiNeBrEaKEvery day, Shell flies a Boeing 727 into the company's private airstrip to rotate crews of workers from impoverished regions in Atlantic Canada.LiNeBrEaKTwo-lane Highway 63, which connects Fort McMurray's residential areas to the oil-sands developments, is jammed at rush hour with pickup trucks. Mobile homes can sell for $400,000, while fancier houses sell for more than $600,000, among the highest home prices in Canada.LiNeBrEaKMore than 2,000 residences are under construction.LiNeBrEaKThe runaway growth and profusion of highly paid single men have given Fort McMurray a Wild West reputation as a land of easy money, drug abuse and prostitution. The city also has one of Canada's highest homelessness rates.LiNeBrEaKIn their stark combination of opportunity and grit, "all oil towns are pretty similar," Pedro Mujica said.LiNeBrEaKHe and his wife, MarifeValderrama, worked for Venezuela's state oil company but fled for political reasons and now work at different oil-sands operations. Politically, it's a lot calmer in Fort McMurray and there's less crime.LiNeBrEaKLife here "is a lot better," Valderrama said.LiNeBrEaKOn weeknights, she gives dance lessons and leads salsa workouts at a fancy community center sponsored by oil money -- a way of sharing her family's Caribbean heritage with their new neighbors.LiNeBrEaKFort McMurray's good fortunes, however, have been accompanied by huge emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. In the long term, this could prove costly.LiNeBrEaKClimate concernsLiNeBrEaKAt Syncrude, Canada's largest single source of petroleum, the gleaming metallic skyline of the upgrader facility stands in harsh contrast to the brown and yellow autumn hues of the surrounding forest -- a small city of towering vats, pressure cookers and the largest tower crane in the world, crowned by an immense plume of white vapor.LiNeBrEaKThe plant also is Canada's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to the Pembina Institute.LiNeBrEaKMost of the emissions come from heating the bitumen oil to remove sulfur and from producing hydrogen that is later combined with bitumen to form light, so-called "sweet" crude.LiNeBrEaKAlong with the mining, there are drilling operations where oil producers extract bitumen after heating it underground. That method burns natural gas -- a relatively clean source of energy that could be used elsewhere.LiNeBrEaKThe potential climate impact of the greenhouse gases has some asking whether the oil-sands crude is a good environmental bargain.LiNeBrEaKOil sands "are delaying the inevitable shift that has to come," said Pembina's Dyer. "Do we want to get on this trajectory, or do we want to use this as a pretty clear signal that we've run out of easy oil and we need to start thinking about nonfossil-fuel alternatives?"LiNeBrEaKOil companies and Alberta energy authorities downplay the fact that producing oil here results in three times more emissions than conventional drilling elsewhere. They say the oil sands account for less than 4 percent of Canada's total emissions and about 0. 1 percent of global greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThey also say piping a barrel of oil to the U.S. from Alberta is cleaner than shipping it from the Persian Gulf. Traditional drilling also is becoming dirtier as the world runs out of light, easy-to-extract crude, so the carbon-footprint gap between conventional oil and oil-sands crude is narrowing.LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials pass the buck to consumers, too, saying no matter how much carbon is emitted in producing oil, it's vehicle exhaust pipes that pump out more than 70 percent of the greenhouse-gas emissions from petroleum fuels.LiNeBrEaKStill, oil-sands producers are scrambling to quell the greenhouse-gas concerns by investing heavily in experimental methods to capture the carbon-dioxide emissions and inject them deep underground.LiNeBrEaKGovernment and industry officials say oil reservoirs and rock formations in western Canada could retain several centuries' worth of carbon-dioxide emissions from the oil sands.LiNeBrEaK"We have some of the best geological repositories in the world to sequester CO2," said Chris Holly, an official with Alberta's energy department.LiNeBrEaKIn July, the Alberta government said it would put some $2 billion into the so-called carbon-sequestration technology. By capturing carbon, improving energy efficiency and forcing oil producers to buy offsets, Alberta officials say they expect annual emissions to decrease by 5 million tons, or one-eighth of the current total, by 2015.LiNeBrEaKThis month, Shell began drilling test wells to inject carbon dioxide into a porous rock and saltwater formation near its Scotford upgrader, which processes bitumen from the Albian Sands mine. The idea is to liquefy carbon dioxide from the upgrader and send it deep underground, where it would stay trapped in the rock's pores.LiNeBrEaKIf it works, Shell could capture about 40 percent of the upgrader's greenhouse-gas emissions by 2013 or 2014, said Rob Seeley, Shell Canada general manager of sustainable development.LiNeBrEaKCarbon sequestration has seldom been tested on a large scale, but the experience has been successful so far, according to a recent Rand report.LiNeBrEaKBiggest test projectLiNeBrEaKThe largest test is taking place in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, where carbon dioxide produced by a power plant in North Dakota is injected into a dying oil reservoir to help recover more oil.LiNeBrEaKIn Norway, oil giant StatoilHydro reinjects excess carbon dioxide produced in some offshore natural-gas fields back under the ocean floor.LiNeBrEaK"The technologies are known," Seeley said. "However, it's new for oil sands. In some ways, it's putting together in a new way different pieces that have been done and proven elsewhere."LiNeBrEaKSome wonder, however, whether the oil-sands industry is pursuing what Pembina's Dyer calls "phantom mitigation."LiNeBrEaKAlberta penalizes producers $15 per ton of carbon dioxide if they fail to meet the province's emissions-reduction goals.LiNeBrEaKBut David Hobbs, head of global research at consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, estimates that carbon sequestration may cost between $80 and $140 per ton. So unless the government makes carbon sequestration mandatory or puts a heavy price tag on carbon emissions, it will be cheaper for oil companies to release the emissions into the atmosphere and pay the penalty.LiNeBrEaK"It's just talk, basically, at this point," Dyer said.LiNeBrEaKBut many analysts think a carbon-emissions cap is likely, which would make sequestration economically attractive. "It's not yet cost-competitive, in the same way it was not cost-competitive to buy a new higher-fuel-efficiency car right up until the price of gasoline was going to hit $5 a gallon," Hobbs said.LiNeBrEaKGiant client to southLiNeBrEaKCanada's biggest customer, the United States, is growing increasingly restless with the oil-sands bargain as it awakens to the climate-change issue.LiNeBrEaKThe 2007 federal energy bill says U.S. government fleets can't buy fuel from the oil sands and other sources whose production emits more greenhouse gases than conventional oil. However, it's nearly impossible for buyers to determine the origin of their fuel, so that restriction is symbolic.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's low-carbon fuel standard, which goes into effect at the end of the year, also discourages buying such oil.LiNeBrEaKAnd in June, the U.S. Conference of Mayors singled out crude from the oil sands as an environmental bad boy. Addiction to Alberta's sludgy brew "slows the United States' transition to clean, renewable energy sources," the mayors declared.LiNeBrEaKCanadian officials and oil-sands producers are conscious of this image problem. "Canadians are nice people. If you say to them, 'We want you to meet the standards,' they're going to work to meet them," said the Hudson Institute's Sands.LiNeBrEaKBut in a world starving for energy, with no large-scale options to petroleum, Alberta's oil producers hold a lot of cards.LiNeBrEaKThe oil sands are destined to play a huge role in meeting energy needs "provided you deal with the environmental implications," said James Smith, Shell's country chairman for the United Kingdom, who recently toured the oil sands for the first time.LiNeBrEaK"We want something that's clean and cheap and always on," he said. "None of our current sources of energy fits the bill."LiNeBrEaKangel Gonzalez: 206-515-5644 or agonzalez@seattletimes.comLiNeBrEaKAlberta's oil sandsLiNeBrEaKPhoto galleryLiNeBrEaKCanada's Oil Sands RegionLiNeBrEaKInteractive graphicLiNeBrEaKExplore how oil is extracted from Alberta's oil sandsLiNeBrEaKVideoLiNeBrEaKA look at the production of oil in Alberta	OIL SANDS (94%); MINES and MINING (90%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (90%); OIL and GAS EXTRACTION (89%); SURFACE MINING (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); CRUDE OIL and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (86%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (77%); CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (73%); PETROLEUM REFINERIES (72%); MOTOR VEHICLES (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (67%)  			NYSE:CAT, NYSE:CVX, NYSE:BA, NYSE:STO  	General  	BARACK OBAMA (62%)  	SEATTLE, WA, USA (91%) ALBERTA, CANADA (94%); WASHINGTON, USA (91%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%); NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA (58%) CANADA (97%); UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 30, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Seattle Times   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081130-SE-Canada-s-oil-sands-boom-creates-vast-riches-and-a-dirty-footprint-1130  	SE  													
St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	Cusslers deliver plenty of peril, if you believe it  	By Dan Scheraga THE Associated Press  	AandE; Pg. F12  	506 words  	Everything you've heard about global warming is true, and it may already be too late to save humanity from mortal peril. The world is on a crash program to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions, driving gasoline prices through the roof. And Canada is about to declare war on the United States. LiNeBrEaKSuch is the premise behind "Arctic Drift," the new adventure thriller penned by best-selling author Clive Cussler and his son Dirk. It's the 20th novel starring Dirk Pitt, Cussler's globe-trotting hero recently portrayed by Matthew McConaughey in the eponymous movie based on Cussler's 1992 book "Sahara."LiNeBrEaKThe good news is a scientist has discovered a method that could reverse the slide toward ecological calamity. Unfortunately, the process depends on a very rare mineral. To obtain enough to save the world may depend on finding the remains of a doomed 19th-century sailing expedition to the Northwest Passage. The ships allegedly were loaded with the stuff.LiNeBrEaKAs director of the National Underwater and Marine Agency, the task falls to Pitt and his comrades, who include his two grown children Summer and Dirk. (Yes, there are two Dirk Pitts running around in this book, which becomes a little confusing at times.)LiNeBrEaKBut Pitt and company are up against more than the unforgiving elements of the Canadian arctic. Racing them to the source of the mineral is a sociopath assassin and his employer - a two-faced tycoon who publicly champions environmentalism while secretly wrecking the planet with his illegal business practices.LiNeBrEaKFans of Cussler have been here before and know what to expect: exotic locations, ruthless villains, and many narrow escapes and derring-do by Dirk Pitt, oceanography's answer to Indiana Jones.LiNeBrEaKFor the rest of us, "Arctic Drift" requires a certain suspension of disbelief. The threat of war between the United States and Canada - for reasons that are never fully explained - is so hard to take seriously that John Candy once starred in a comedy about it, "Canadian Bacon."LiNeBrEaKYou'll have to also resist questioning how the seas can be teeming with ship traffic when gasoline is up to $10 a gallon. And dry ice is used as a murder weapon in one scene that must be seen to be believed - or not.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, character development is treated as a formality that is easily skipped, and Cussler has a way of providing background in long blocks of expository dialogue that make it feel like the characters are addressing the reader and not each other. One early finger-wagging lecture in which the nation's president explains how the world got into this mess through government inaction is particularly cringe-inducing.LiNeBrEaKJack London, it isn't. But Cussler's fans come for swashbuckling, not word craft. That, he delivers.LiNeBrEaK'Arctic Drift' By Clive and Dirk Cussler Published by Putnam, 515 pages, $27. 95LiNeBrEaKClive and Dirk Cussler When: 3 p.m. Dec. 7 Where: Barnes and Noble, 721 Gravois Road, Fenton How much: Free More info: 636-326-4619 When: 7 p.m. Dec. 8 Where: Left Bank Books, 399 North Euclid Avenue How much: Free More info: 314-367-6731	EMISSIONS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ACTION and ADVENTURE FILMS (77%); OIL and GAS PRICES (77%); CELEBRITIES (76%); NOVELS and SHORT STORIES (76%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (74%); WAR and CONFLICT (72%); GASOLINE MARKETS (72%); GASOLINE PRICES (72%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (69%); MURDER (67%); FRAUD and FINANCIAL CRIME (67%); BESTSELLERS (71%) {DOC SEPARATOR}  					J P LONDON (50%)  	ARCTIC (94%); UNITED STATES (93%); CANADA (92%); NORTH AMERICA (79%)  	December 2, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

B3  	760 words  	WASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKIn perhaps the most shocking sign yet of the dire condition of the nation's economy, Santa Claus today appeared before the House Financial Services Committee pleading for a $25 billion bailout of his North Pole-based toy manufacturing industry.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers were shocked at the sudden appearance of the right jolly old elf, who reportedly evaded Capitol Police by entering the hearing room through a chimney boarded up during the Nixon administration. "I guess he had a case of the flue," joked committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass. LiNeBrEaKAppearing without counsel, Claus, dressed in his traditional red suit, told the committee that without the cash infusion, "Christmas will be very bleak."LiNeBrEaKHe said layoffs would be inevitable among his 300,000-elf work force and that "bankruptcy is not out of the picture."LiNeBrEaK"I hate to be the one to break the news to you, ladies and gentlemen," Claus said. "But Santa Claus is not Santa Claus, if you get my drift. For a thousand years, we've been hung out to dry with no federal or local tax support. Our labor costs are through the roof. Competition from China is very fierce. Environmental regulations are a huge added cost. And now we find that because of global climate change, we've had to retro-fit the entire North Pole manufacturing center on floats and pylons. We need help."LiNeBrEaKRep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the committee's ranking Republican, was sympathetic to Claus' complaints about the high cost of environmental compliance. "How many of your people have you lost to marauding polar bears?" Bachus asked.LiNeBrEaK"That's the good news," Claus said. "Technically, elves aren't 'people,' so the Bush administration recently reclassified them as a food source for the bears. If there's one bright spot to the layoffs, it's that the bears will be eating better, even though it takes two or three elves per bear to make a meal."LiNeBrEaKRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., objected, "Mr. Chairman, I find it reprehensible that Mr. Claus is threatening to feed his elves to polar bears unless we bail him out with $25 billion in taxpayer money."LiNeBrEaKClaus replied, "Madam, it's not like feeding elves to polar bears will save us any money. Over the years, the United Toyworkers Union has negotiated generous labor contracts with us. Even when they're laid off - or God forbid, even when they're eaten by polar bears - we're still stuck with the legacy costs of pension and retirement benefits to their families."LiNeBrEaK"If I could say a word in the witness's defense," said Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., "it would be that my children have long enjoyed the benefits of Mr. Claus' work. And it would be a shame - no, an outrage - if this Congress can provide help for the tycoons and bankers on Wall Street and not for the small children of America."LiNeBrEaKClay, noted throughout Congress for his softball questioning of celebrity witnesses such as baseball stars Mark McGwire and Roger Clemens, then presented Claus with a copy of his Christmas wish list - "just in case," Clay said.LiNeBrEaKRep. Peter King, R-N.Y., demanded to know "why the American taxpayer should bear the burden of bailing out Santa Claus" when Christmas is an "international celebration."LiNeBrEaK"Is it not true, sir, that you work in many nations under a variety of aliases: Weihnachtsmann, Kris Kringle, Pere Noel, Papa Noel, Sinter Claus, Julemanden among them?" King said. "Are you planning to hit up the governments of Denmark and France, too?"LiNeBrEaKClaus replied, "First of all, let me say that I object to the use of the term 'bailout.' In fact, all we're asking for is a loan so we can retool our operations to compete with foreign manufacturers. Secondly, our costs are high because of regulations imposed by this Congress.LiNeBrEaK"And finally, it was you Americans who started this whole Santa Claus cult with your 'Night Before Christmas' and 'Miracle on 34th Street.' Before that, I could get by with a few oranges and some candy canes. Now I have to run a full-tilt, 24-7 sweatshop. And everything's supposed to be free? What kind of business plan is that?"LiNeBrEaKThe hearing had adjourned amid chaos and without a vote when news broke that ABC News had reported that Santa Claus had traveled to Washington by private aircraft.LiNeBrEaK"I'm outraged," Chairman Frank said. "How can you ask the suffering taxpayers to bail you out the to tune of $25 billion when you're flying down here on a private plane?"LiNeBrEaK"I wish," Claus replied. "It's the same raggedy sleigh and eight flying reindeer I've been using for centuries. In fact, if you guys ever come up with some bucks, I'm buying a used Gulfstream-IV from a guy in Detroit."

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	The global warming crowd's on thin ice in this economic climate  	PAUL MULSHINE, STAR-LEDGER STAFF  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 018  	792 words  	I just got the skis down from the attic. I think it's going to be a cold winter. I can feel it in my bones.LiNeBrEaKBut what the heck do I know? I can't predict the weather. Neither can anyone else. Not Al Gore. Not even Phil Chapman.LiNeBrEaKChapman is a geophysicist who studies sunspots. He lives in California but was born in Australia. In the 1960s, he became the first Aussie to qualify as a U.S. astronaut. LiNeBrEaKChapman recently achieved some fame, or notoriety, when he authored an article for an Australian newspaper headlined "Sorry to Ruin the Fun, but an Ice Age Cometh." His thesis is that there has been an alarming absence of spots on the sun recently. A lack of sunspots has historically been accompanied by global cooling rather than warming. Ergo, we may face the threat of another ice age. The headline was a bit of an overstatement, Chapman said when I called him the other day. He's not sure that an ice age is coming. But he's not sure the planet is warming either.LiNeBrEaK"The uncertainties are enormous," Chapman said. "I would not claim cooling will happen or warming won't."LiNeBrEaKThe problem with many of the scare stories about the warming threat, said Chapman, is that they focus on one part of the planet, the Arctic, for example. But the only reliable measurement is from space, he said, and that showed the Earth's temperature dropped by 0. 7 degrees Celsius last year. That might be explained by the recent dearth of sunspots.LiNeBrEaKChapman is not alone in that view. A recent New York Times article, citing a number of respected scientists, noted that "Some wonder if this could be the start of an extended period of solar indolence that would more than offset the warming effect of human-made carbon dioxide emissions."LiNeBrEaKChapman states it more colorfully than the others, however. If you think skiing here in the Northeast is icy, for example, imagine a pack of ice a mile thick. That's the normal condition for this part of the world if you take the long-term view of the scientist. It's the relatively warm temperatures of recent millennia that are the exception, he says. But if temperatures were to drop .7 degrees annually for 20 years, another ice age would be upon us, he writes.LiNeBrEaK"By then, most of the advanced nations would have ceased to exist, vanishing under the ice, and the rest of the world would be faced with a catastrophe beyond imagining," he wrote.LiNeBrEaKAlarmist? Well, it's no more alarmist than much of what Gore cranks out. And unlike the former vice president, Chapman isn't hyping his threat. He puts the chances of a cooling trend at a mere "50-50." He remains open to the threat of global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut he proposes we deal with the potential threat realistically. If President-elect Barack Obama were to call him for advice, Chapman said, he'd suggest a "no regrets" approach. Solutions should be crafted so that "they won't make us sorry if they turn out wrong."LiNeBrEaKOne such solution would be the plug-in hybrid car now being developed by GM, among others. A switch to plug-in hybrids would cut oil imports significantly and also cut air pollution. We would have to increase electrical generation by only about 20 percent, he said, a goal achievable through nuclear power.LiNeBrEaKHowever, hard-core environmentalists deplore such "technical fixes," Chapman said.LiNeBrEaK"The major objection to technical fixes is that then we would not be doing anything to change the profligate American lifestyle," he said. "There's a large segment of environmentalists who think it's bad the way we live and want to use the environment to get societal changes."LiNeBrEaKThese people will be pressuring Obama to adopt such measures as a carbon tax. Such a tax would have a negative effect on the most important climate problem America faces at the moment, the problem with the economic climate.LiNeBrEaK"If he does that, he will make the recession worse," said Chapman. "So I don't think he will do anything along those lines in the near future."LiNeBrEaKNeither do I. Such a tax would hit not just gasoline, but home heating oil and natural gas. Imagine the effect that would have on the cost of heating houses and apartments in Obama's hometown of Chicago, which enters an ice age of its own every winter. And if a deep freeze hit the Northeast, many people in the so-called "blue" states really would be turning blue. At that point, they might start voting red.LiNeBrEaKMaybe I can't predict the weather, but I can predict the climate inside the Beltway. And I predict that now that the Democrats control both the presidency and Congress, they'll cool down their rhetoric on global warming. Otherwise they'll end up going downhill faster than I ever could.LiNeBrEaKPaul Mulshine may be reached at pmulshine@starledger.com To comment on his column, go to NJVoices.com.LiNeBrEaKNotes: Paul Mulshine appears regularly in The Star-Ledger.

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	South Carolina commission reconsiders nuclear power  	By Chuck Crumbo, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	1655 words  	COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Beginning Monday, state regulators will hold hearings that promise to be as combustible as the topic.LiNeBrEaKThat's when the Public Service Commission will listen to arguments on whether expanding nuclear power is the best way to meet South Carolina's energy needs.LiNeBrEaKSpecifically, the panel will consider a proposal from SCEandG and its partner Santee Cooper to build two new reactors costing $9. 8 billion at their nuclear plant in Jenkinsville, S.C., 25 miles northwest of Columbia.LiNeBrEaKThe new reactors each will generate 1,117 megawatts, combining to provide enough power for about 1. 9 million households, according to the electric industry. They'll be built next to the existing 966 megawatt nuclear plant, which went into operation in 1984.LiNeBrEaKThe fireworks started last week when environmental groups accused state officials of "selling out" to the power companies. LiNeBrEaKFriends of the Earth, an intervenor in the case, and the Sierra Club of South Carolina, charged that the Office of Regulatory Staff offered a proposed settlement that "trounces the public interest and caves in to virtually everything sought" by the utility.LiNeBrEaK"The proposal . . . is not only a clear sell-out of the public interest over the interests of SCEandG, but it also calls into question just who this agency represents," said Tom Clements with Friends of the Earth.LiNeBrEaKClements urged that the agency be investigated, claiming that it has been "captured by corporate interests."LiNeBrEaKDukes Scott, the agency's executive director, said "there is no agreement between ORS and SCEandG."LiNeBrEaKThe proposal, which state law requires his office to draft, was sent to all parties involved in the case to see if "there was any room for discussion," Scott added.LiNeBrEaKScott defended his agency, saying it does represent the public interest.LiNeBrEaKAnd, Scott added, it also must consider what's best for economic development as well as integrity of the utilities.LiNeBrEaKThe nuclear debate in the United States has been largely dormant since the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island, which caused no injuries or radiation leakage but shattered public confidence in commercial nuclear power.LiNeBrEaKTimes have changed, and the public's memory has faded. Also, environmental concerns over greenhouse gases _ the prime culprit of global warming _ and the nation's dependency on foreign oil have prompted utilities to reconsider the nuclear option.LiNeBrEaKSouth Carolina, which has seven reactors at four sites, has a long history with nuclear energy. In 1958, SCEandG along with three other utilities built a 17-megawatt test reactor at Parr Reservoir, near the site of the utility's V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in Fairfield County.LiNeBrEaKThe state's first commercial reactor at H.B. Robinson Power Station near Hartsville went into operation in March 1971, followed by nuclear plants in Oconee and York counties. The V.C. Summer reactor went online in 1984.LiNeBrEaKOverall, 52 percent of the electricity consumed by South Carolinians is generated by nuclear power. That's higher than the national average of about 20 percent, according to the federal government.LiNeBrEaKThe pro and con arguments over the merits of building more nuclear reactors will be complicated, and it will require testimony from a host of expert witnesses.LiNeBrEaKThe issue pits the utilities, which say they need the reactors to meet the state's future energy needs, against environmentalists and citizens groups, who say there are safer and more economical ways to do the same.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG, which has 646,000 electricity customers in South Carolina, expects to add 130,000 more customers in the next 10 years.LiNeBrEaKIts partner, state-operated Santee Cooper, projects a 16 percent increase in customers by 2020.LiNeBrEaKSantee Cooper has 155,000 customers in three coastal counties and provides power to 685,000 more customers through 20 electric cooperatives.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKSCEandG, which is the principal subsidiary of SCANA Corp., said nuclear is more reliable, economical and better for the environment than other power sources.LiNeBrEaK"Nuclear clearly winds up being the less expensive option," said Kevin Marsh, SCEandG president.LiNeBrEaKOpponents charge that the utility has not given enough consideration to using optional sources such as wind and solar power. And there's the inherent issue of safety.LiNeBrEaKOne drawback to solar and wind as far as generating power is that they are not available for around-the-clock use, Marsh said.LiNeBrEaK"A nuclear plant typically runs all the time," Marsh said.LiNeBrEaK"We are not opposed to alternative energy. We think there will be a place for alternative energy when it's more cost-effective."LiNeBrEaKClements said the utility should emphasize conservation instead of building big, expensive generating plants.LiNeBrEaK"It's much cheaper to save a kilowatt than to produce a kilowatt," Clements said.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG plans to build reactor units designed by Westinghouse, called the AP1000. While it's the only reactor design that has been certified by federal officials, it so far has gone through 15 revisions. Four AP1000 reactors are under construction in China, but none has been built in the United States.LiNeBrEaKWhen talk turns to safety, SCEandG executives point to their company's own experience over the past quarter century of running the V.C. Summer plant without incident.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKMoney _ where it will come from and how the project will be paid for _ will be another part of the hearing.LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, the state Legislature passed a law allowing utilities to increase electric rates to cover the cost of borrowing billions of dollars to pay for the new reactors.LiNeBrEaKMarsh said the pay-as-you-go approach should lower construction costs of the units by $1 billion.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG proposes to phase in a 37 percent rate increase over the life of the project, which will extend to 2019. The rate hikes, if approved, would start in March and be in increments ranging from less than a half percent to 4 percent.LiNeBrEaKThe rate hike, though, will not be granted all at once, state officials said. Instead, the utility will have to make its case each year to the commission.LiNeBrEaKBeing allowed to raise rates from the outset of the project will help the utility's case in attracting lenders, officials said.LiNeBrEaK"Our ability to borrow the money on Wall Street is made significantly easier when Wall Street gets the signal from the state that it is behind us," Marsh said.LiNeBrEaKOpponents, though, believe that the country's current financial crisis will make it more difficult and more expensive to find the money for the project.LiNeBrEaKThey also say the utilities have underestimated the cost of the project. They say SCEandG's projected costs are less than half of what federal officials say is the average price tag of a reactor _ $9 billion.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG's costs are lower because the reactors will be built on a site that it owns and much of the infrastructure needed to support expansion is in place, said Jimmy Addison, the utility's chief financial officer.LiNeBrEaKThe utility also has developed an evacuation plan and has installed a warning system to alert the surrounding community, Addison said. Those are costs that would have to be added if the utility was building the reactors at an undeveloped site.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKThe hearings by the seven-member panel of political appointees are scheduled to run through the week and possibly longer, said Charles Terreni, Public Service Commission spokesman.LiNeBrEaKAbout a dozen intervenors have entered the case.LiNeBrEaKSome of the intervenors are state agencies like the Department of Health and Environmental Control. Others are environmental groups and utility customers _ residential, commercial and industrial.LiNeBrEaKIntervenors can participate in the hearing as much they'd like, making opening statements, questioning witnesses and presenting their own experts to either rebut or back the utility's case.LiNeBrEaKIt's been the commission's practice to let everyone have their say, Terreni said.LiNeBrEaK"These folks stepped up and said they wanted to intervene in the hearing," Terreni said. "As long as they're willing to comply with the rule of procedure and meet their obligations, they can do it."LiNeBrEaKThe commission ruling, expected to be issued by late February, won't be the final word.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities still must get permission from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If the federal agency approves, construction on the first reactor could begin in 2012.LiNeBrEaKON THE LINELiNeBrEaK_Who: SCEandG and Santee CooperLiNeBrEaK_What: Two new 1,117-megawatt reactors costing $9. 8 billionLiNeBrEaK_When: If approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, construction could begin in 2012.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Protecting Boundary Waters wilderness -- challenges persist  	By Kevin Proescholdt  	COLUMNISTS  	781 words  	Thirty years ago this fall, President Jimmy Carter signed the 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) Act into law. While this law provided important protections for the BWCAW, it did not address all challenges in protecting the area for future generations.LiNeBrEaKThat's how it's been all along in the effort to protect the Boundary Waters wilderness -- progress is difficult, and it happens in stages. LiNeBrEaKA compromise provision in the 1964 Wilderness Act (the law that provided statutory protections for wilderness areas and established the National Wilderness Preservation System) singled out the Boundary Waters for continued logging and motorboat use, practices normally not allowed in areas so protected. This provision made the BWCA a wilderness in name but not necessarily in management.LiNeBrEaKAs a consequence, a series of controversies erupted in the late 1960s and early 1970s over mining, logging, snowmobiling and motorboating in the BWCA. By the mid-1970s, Congress again turned its attention to the canoe country to try to resolve the controversies. The resolution did not come quickly or easily.LiNeBrEaKAfter a very public three-year debate, Congress finally passed the 1978 law after a number of weakening compromises made in the House and Senate. Led by U.S. Reps. Donald Fraser and Bruce Vento from Minnesota and Philip Burton from California, this law ended logging in the BWCA (and protected the remaining 540,000 acres of unlogged forest), reduced (but did not eliminate) motorboat use, phased out snowmobiling (except for two short access routes to Canadian properties), tightly restricted mining within the Boundary Waters and established a BWCA Mining Protection Area outside the wilderness, officially added "Wilderness" to the area's name, and expanded the area by about 68,000 acres in key additions like the Hegman Lakes, Brule Lake and the Fowl Lakes.LiNeBrEaKThat helped, but threats to the area's wilderness character persist. Motorboats still run across about one-fifth of the BWCAW's water surface area. On two wilderness portages, jeeps and ATVs drive across along the trails hauling boats. Mining was not absolutely forbidden, and new proposed sulfide mining projects just outside the Boundary Waters pose major threats from acid mine drainage. Global climate change may significantly change the BWCAW's ecosystem. Ecosystem processes like fire are not always allowed to fully function without human manipulation. Excessive visitation at times threatens the area's solitude and wilderness character. Despite the law, illegal motorboat and snowmobile use still occurs. And the remaining roadless areas in the Superior National Forest, most of them along the periphery of the BWCAW, are threatened with road-building and logging.LiNeBrEaKIn 2001, the federal government finalized the Roadless Area Conservation Rule to protect 58 million acres of inventoried roadless areas in our National Forests nationwide, including about 61,000 acres in the Superior National Forest here in Minnesota. But the Bush administration threw out the roadless rule and instituted instead a state-by-state petition process. Various federal judges have ruled both for and against the original roadless rule and the Bush plan, leaving both approaches in legal limbo.LiNeBrEaKProtected roadless areas have great value in their own right. They provide some of the best fishing, hunting, hiking and remote camping areas. They harbor fish and wildlife and blocks of undisturbed forest often not found in logged areas and those with roads. They offer opportunities for scientific study and research, and they safeguard sources of clean drinking water.LiNeBrEaKIn the Superior National Forest, roadless areas provide additional benefits because of their proximity to the BWCAW. Roadless areas help preserve the BWCAW itself by blocking negative impacts like invasive species or traffic noise from reaching the wilderness; they provide wilderness-like recreation when the BWCAW is at visitor capacity, and they provide the primary source of lands that might one day be added to the BWCAW.LiNeBrEaKAs we celebrate 30 years of increased wilderness protections for the BWCAW, let's not forget the work that lies ahead if we are to pass down a truly protected wilderness legacy to future generations. Part of that vitally important unfinished work must be permanently protecting the remaining roadless areas in the Superior and across the nation.LiNeBrEaKKevin Proescholdt directs the Wilderness and Public Lands Program for the Izaak Walton League of America. A former BWCAW guide, he helped pass the 1978 law through Congress and co-authored the definitive book on that struggle, "Troubled Waters: The Fight for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness."

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Strike.TV Mac grad/local theater alum helps launch alternative online network  	By Amy Carlson Gustafson agustafson@pioneerpress.com  	ENTERTAINMENT  	645 words  	A year ago, writer Ken LaZebnik was one of hundreds of striking members of the Writers Guild of America. It was then he co-founded Strike.TV, an online "network" now home to several original Web series. With a mix of TV and film writers whose specialties run the gamut from horror to comedy to soap operas, the folks behind Strike.TV say it will eventually host nearly 50 Web series.LiNeBrEaK"A part of what we were picketing for during the strike was to get a foothold in online original content," says LaZebnik, a Macalester grad and Mixed Blood Theatre alum who co-wrote the screenplay for the "Prairie Home Companion" movie. "It occurred to a bunch of us that we could write and create our own Web series and put them up online as a sort of alternative online network." LiNeBrEaKLaZebnik, who also wrote for "Touched by an Angel," "Star Trek Enterprise" and "Providence," says Strike.TV, which started Webcasting this fall, allows writers to own their work and have control over their creations.LiNeBrEaK"We really try to stress that we don't view this as a writer's revenge but an opening for new opportunities for everybody," says LaZebnik. "Nothing will please us more than if one of these shows gets sold to a television network."LiNeBrEaKLaZebnik says it will take at least 18 months for Strike.TV to turn a profit. For its first few months, proceeds are being donated to the Actors Fund, a nonprofit group that helps entertainment industry workers. LiNeBrEaKOne of the most fulfilling parts of this new venture, according to LaZebnik, is connecting with fellow writers. And there's the added bonus of being your own boss.LiNeBrEaK"It all feels much like what I assume Hollywood felt like back in the day," he says. "When you got a bunch of people together and you did it -- it happened quickly and there was this feeling of spontaneity about it. I do think it reconnects people with the basic joy of filmmaking because you have that freedom and latitude to do what you want to do. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. There's not that huge investment of money -- no huge budget you have to answer to or be responsible for."LiNeBrEaKWith most of Strike.TV's Web series installments clocking in under five minutes, there is plenty of opportunity to check out a variety of the site's content. Here are eight series to get you started.LiNeBrEaK"Confessional": Inspired by a real-life business, LaZebnik's new-agey "Confessional" is a place where people can go get things off their chests.LiNeBrEaK"Global Warming": This sweet and humorous tale about finding love halfway across the world via your computer features endearing performances by "Saturday Night Live's" Kristen Wiig and "Daily Show's" Aasif Mandvi.LiNeBrEaK"House Poor": In this smart comedy from Mindy Kaling and Lester Lewis (both writers on "The Office"), Kaling has just spent all her money on a new home. How is she going to furnish her pad? A baby shower. Only problem?

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Nuclear plan faces scrutiny  	Chuck Crumbo, The State, Columbia, S.C.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1442 words  	Nov. 30--Beginning Monday, state regulators will hold hearings that promise to be as combustible as the topic.LiNeBrEaKThat's when the Public Service Commission will listen to arguments on whether expanding nuclear power is the best way to meet South Carolina's energy needs.LiNeBrEaKSpecifically, the panel will consider a proposal from SCEandG and its partner Santee Cooper to build two new reactors costing $9. 8 billion at their nuclear plant in Jenkinsville, 25 miles northwest of Columbia.LiNeBrEaKThe new reactors each will generate 1,117 megawatts, combining to provide enough power for about 1. 9 million households, according to the electric industry. They'll be built next to the existing 966 megawatt nuclear plant, which went into operation in 1984.LiNeBrEaKThe fireworks started last week when environmental groups accused state officials of "selling out" to the power companies. LiNeBrEaKFriends of the Earth, an intervenor in the case, and the Sierra Club of South Carolina, charged that the Office of Regulatory Staff offered a proposed settlement that "trounces the public interest and caves in to virtually everything sought" by the utility.LiNeBrEaK"The proposal ... is not only a clear sell-out of the public interest over the interests of SCEandG, but it also calls into question just who this agency represents," said Tom Clements with Friends of the Earth.LiNeBrEaKClements urged that the agency be investigated, claiming that it has been "captured by corporate interests."LiNeBrEaKDukes Scott, the agency's executive director, said "there is no agreement between ORS and SCEandG."LiNeBrEaKThe proposal, which state law requires his office to draft, was sent to all parties involved in the case to see if "there was any room for discussion," Scott added.LiNeBrEaKScott defended his agency, saying it does represent the public interest.LiNeBrEaKAnd, Scott added, it also must consider what's best for economic development as well as integrity of the utilities.LiNeBrEaKThe nuclear debate in the United States has been largely dormant since the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island, which caused no injuries or radiation leakage but shattered public confidence in commercial nuclear power.LiNeBrEaKTimes have changed, and the public's memory has faded. Also, environmental concerns over greenhouse gases -- the prime culprit of global warming -- and the nation's dependency on foreign oil have prompted utilities to reconsider the nuclear option.LiNeBrEaKSouth Carolina, which has seven reactors at four sites, has a long history with nuclear energy. In 1958, SCEandG along with three other utilities built a 17-megawatt test reactor at Parr Reservoir, near the site of the utility's V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in Fairfield County.LiNeBrEaKThe state's first commercial reactor at H.B. Robinson Power Station near Hartsville went into operation in March 1971, followed by nuclear plants in Oconee and York counties. The V.C. Summer reactor went online in 1984.LiNeBrEaKOverall, 52 percent of the electricity consumed by South Carolinians is generated by nuclear power. That ranks the state third-highest in nuclear power consumption compared to the national average of about 20 percent, according to the federal government.LiNeBrEaKThe pro and con arguments over the merits of building more nuclear reactors will be complicated, and it will require testimony from a host of expert witnesses.LiNeBrEaKThe issue pits the utilities, which say they need the reactors to meet the state's future energy needs, against environmentalists and citizens groups, who say there are safer and more economical ways to do the same.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG, which has 646,000 electricity customers in South Carolina, expects to add 130,000 more customers in the next 10 years.LiNeBrEaKIts partner, state-operated Santee Cooper of Moncks Corner, projects a 16 percent increase in customers by 2020.LiNeBrEaKSantee Cooper has 155,000 customers in three coastal counties and provides power to 685,000 more customers through 20 electric cooperatives.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG, which is the principal subsidiary of Columbia-based SCANA Corp., said nuclear is more reliable, economical and better for the environment than other power sources.LiNeBrEaK"Nuclear clearly winds up being the less expensive option," said Kevin Marsh, SCEandG president.LiNeBrEaKOpponents charge that the utility has not given enough consideration to using optional sources such as wind and solar power. And there's the inherent issue of safety.LiNeBrEaKOne drawback to solar and wind as far as generating power is that they are not available for around-the-clock use, Marsh said.LiNeBrEaK"A nuclear plant typically runs all the time," Marsh said.LiNeBrEaK"We are not opposed to alternative energy. We think there will be a place for alternative energy when it's more cost-effective."LiNeBrEaKClements said the utility should emphasize conservation instead of building big, expensive generating plants.LiNeBrEaK"It's much cheaper to save a kilowatt than to produce a kilowatt," Clements said.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG plans to build reactor units designed by Westinghouse, called the AP1000. While it's the only reactor design that has been certified by federal officials, it so far has gone through 15 revisions. Four AP1000 reactors are under construction in China, but none has been built in the United States.LiNeBrEaKWhen talk turns to safety, SCEandG executives point to their company's own experience over the past quarter century of running the V.C. Summer plant without incident.LiNeBrEaKMoney -- where it will come from and how the project will be paid for -- will be another part of the hearing.LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, the state Legislature passed a law allowing utilities to increase electric rates to cover the cost of borrowing billions of dollars to pay for the new reactors.LiNeBrEaKMarsh said the pay-as-you-go approach should lower construction costs of the units by $1 billion.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG proposes to phase in a 37 percent rate increase over the life of the project, which will extend to 2019. The rate hikes, if approved, would start in March and be in increments ranging from less than a half percent to 4 percent.LiNeBrEaKThe rate hike, though, will not be granted all at once, state officials said. Instead, the utility will have to make its case each year to the commission.LiNeBrEaKBeing allowed to raise rates from the outset of the project will help the utility's case in attracting lenders, officials said.LiNeBrEaK"Our ability to borrow the money on Wall Street is made significantly easier when Wall Street gets the signal from the state that it is behind us," Marsh said.LiNeBrEaKOpponents, though, believe that the country's current financial crisis will make it more difficult and more expensive to find the money for the project.LiNeBrEaKThey also say the utilities have underestimated the cost of the project. They say SCEandG's projected costs are less than half of what federal officials say is the average price tag of a reactor -- $9 billion.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG's costs are lower because the reactors will be built on a site that it owns and much of the infrastructure needed to support expansion is in place, said Jimmy Addison, the utility's chief financial officer.LiNeBrEaKThe utility also has developed an evacuation plan and has installed a warning system to alert the surrounding community, Addison said. Those are costs that would have to be added if the utility was building the reactors at an undeveloped site.LiNeBrEaKThe hearings by the seven-member panel of political appointees are scheduled to run through the week and possibly longer, said Charles Terreni, Public Service Commission spokesman.LiNeBrEaKAbout a dozen intervenors have entered the case.LiNeBrEaKSome of the intervenors are state agencies like the Department of Health and Environmental Control. Others are environmental groups and utility customers -- residential, commercial and industrial.LiNeBrEaKIntervenors can participate in the hearing as much they'd like, making opening statements, questioning witnesses and presenting their own experts to either rebut or back the utility's case.LiNeBrEaKIt's been the commission's practice to let everyone have their say, Terreni said.LiNeBrEaK"These folks stepped up and said they wanted to intervene in the hearing," Terreni said. "As long as they're willing to comply with the rule of procedure and meet their obligations, they can do it."LiNeBrEaKThe commission ruling, expected to be issued by late February, won't be the final word.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities still must get permission from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If the federal agency approves, construction on the first reactor could begin in 2012.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	St. Louis Post-Dispatch Kevin Horrigan column: bank, banking, loans, recovery  	Kevin Horrigan, St. Louis Post-Dispatch  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	833 words  	Nov. 30--WASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKIn perhaps the most shocking sign yet of the dire condition of the nation's economy, Santa Claus today appeared before the House Financial Services Committee pleading for a $25 billion bailout of his North Pole-based toy manufacturing industry.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers were shocked at the sudden appearance of the right jolly old elf, who reportedly evaded Capitol Police by entering the hearing room through a chimney boarded up during the Nixon administration. "I guess he had a case of the flue," joked committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Mass. LiNeBrEaKAppearing without counsel, Claus, dressed in his traditional red suit, told the committee that without the cash infusion, "Christmas will be very bleak."LiNeBrEaKHe said layoffs would be inevitable among his 300,000-elf work force and that "bankruptcy is not out of the picture."LiNeBrEaK"I hate to be the one to break the news to you, ladies and gentlemen," Claus said. "But Santa Claus is not Santa Claus, if you get my drift. For a thousand years, we've been hung out to dry with no federal or local tax support. Our labor costs are through the roof. Competition from China is very fierce. Environmental regulations are a huge added cost. And now we find that because of global climate change, we've had to retro-fit the entire North Pole manufacturing center on floats and pylons. We need help."LiNeBrEaKRep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama, the committee's ranking Republican, was sympathetic to Claus' complaints about the high cost of environmental compliance. "How many of your people have you lost to marauding polar bears?" Bachus asked.LiNeBrEaK"That's the good news," Claus said. "Technically, elves aren't 'people,' so the Bush administration recently reclassified them as a food source for the bears. If there's one bright spot to the layoffs, it's that the bears will be eating better, even though it takes two or three elves per bear to make a meal."LiNeBrEaKRep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., objected, "Mr. Chairman, I find it reprehensible that Mr. Claus is threatening to feed his elves to polar bears unless we bail him out with $25 billion in taxpayer money."LiNeBrEaKClaus replied, "Madam, it's not like feeding elves to polar bears will save us any money. Over the years, the United Toyworkers Union has negotiated generous labor contracts with us. Even when they're laid off -- or God forbid, even when they're eaten by polar bears -- we're still stuck with the legacy costs of pension and retirement benefits to their families."LiNeBrEaK"If I could say a word in the witness's defense," said Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., "it would be that my children have long enjoyed the benefits of Mr. Claus' work. And it would be a shame -- no, an outrage -- if this Congress can provide help for the tycoons and bankers on Wall Street and not for the small children of America."LiNeBrEaKClay, noted throughout Congress for his softball questioning of celebrity witnesses such as baseball stars Mark McGwire and Roger Clemens, then presented Claus with a copy of his Christmas wish list -- "just in case," Clay said.LiNeBrEaKRep. Peter King, R-N.Y., demanded to know "why the American taxpayer should bear the burden of bailing out Santa Claus" when Christmas is an "international celebration."LiNeBrEaK"Is it not true, sir, that you work in many nations under a variety of aliases: Weihnachtsmann, Kris Kringle, Pere Noel, Papa Noel, Sinter Claus, Julemanden among them?" King said. "Are you planning to hit up the governments of Denmark and France, too?"LiNeBrEaKClaus replied, "First of all, let me say that I object to the use of the term 'bailout.' In fact, all we're asking for is a loan so we can retool our operations to compete with foreign manufacturers. Secondly, our costs are high because of regulations imposed by this Congress.LiNeBrEaK"And finally, it was you Americans who started this whole Santa Claus cult with your 'Night Before Christmas' and 'Miracle on 34th Street.' Before that, I could get by with a few oranges and some candy canes. Now I have to run a full-tilt, 24-7 sweatshop. And everything's supposed to be free? What kind of business plan is that?"LiNeBrEaKThe hearing had adjourned amid chaos and without a vote when news broke that ABC News had reported that Santa Claus had traveled to Washington by private aircraft.LiNeBrEaK"I'm outraged," Chairman Frank said. "How can you ask the suffering taxpayers to bail you out the to tune of $25 billion when you're flying down here on a private plane?"LiNeBrEaK"I wish," Claus replied. "It's the same raggedy sleigh and eight flying reindeer I've been using for centuries. In fact, if you guys ever come up with some bucks, I'm buying a used Gulfstream-IV from a guy in Detroit."

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Cleaner Florida Cars Make Good Sense  	DAVID GUEST, Special to the Tribune  	VIEWS; Pg. 5  	659 words  	Crist's plan would push automakers to cut emissions.LiNeBrEaKBy DAVID GUESTLiNeBrEaKSpecial to the TribuneLiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, Florida has the chance to take a major step forward toward energy independence. That's the day the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission votes on Gov. Charlie Crist's common-sense proposal to make cars run cleaner.LiNeBrEaKMost people know that the pollution coming out of car tailpipes is one of the main culprits in global warming. And when it comes to global warming, Floridians are more vulnerable to both rising sea levels and more powerful hurricanes. LiNeBrEaKIt makes sense for us to do something about this sooner rather than later. The governor's proposal gets to the heart of the matter by creating incentives for more efficient cars. The new standards would require a 23 percent cut in heat-trapping emissions from new cars by 2012 and a 30 percent cut by 2016.LiNeBrEaKBecause 40 percent of Florida's carbon dioxide emissions come from passenger cars and light trucks, working to cut emissions from tailpipes is an important place to start. Under Crist's proposal, individual vehicles would not have to meet the standard. Instead, the standard is an average of all cars sold in the state. Some vehicles - such as those used for emergency services or for the military - would be exempt from efficiency requirements.LiNeBrEaKExpect Some WhiningLiNeBrEaKNo doubt, you will hear belly-aching from the high-priced Florida lobbyists for the automobile industry. We've heard it before, when they fought safety improvements such as seat belts and airbags. Instead of improving technology, they have clung to old models, and I think we can all see where it has gotten them.LiNeBrEaKIf the public demands cleaner cars, automobile manufacturers will build them, it's as simple as that.LiNeBrEaKCrist's proposal is modeled after California's clean-air standards. Twelve other states have adopted the standards, and six more, including Florida, are considering doing so.LiNeBrEaKAutomobile industry lobbyists have been trying to scare Florida consumers. They falsely claim that requiring cleaner cars will raise the price of a vehicle by $4,000. An economic analysis by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection estimates that cleaner technology will initially add $100 to $700 to the cost of a new car, depending on the make and model. That cost is offset, however, because cleaner cars run more efficiently and use less gas. Over the lifetime of their cars, drivers will see a net savings of $1,000 to $2,300 per vehicle, the agency estimates.LiNeBrEaKA New Era Is DawningLiNeBrEaKPulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has a new book out called "Hot, Flat and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution - And How it Can Renew America."LiNeBrEaKFriedman's premise is that our last Industrial Revolution was information technology - computers and the Internet. He says we are on the eve of the next step: the energy technology revolution.LiNeBrEaKThe country that dominates it will be the healthiest and most secure on the planet.LiNeBrEaKCrist is wisely positioning Florida as a leader in America's Energy Technology revolution.LiNeBrEaKFloridians are ready for more efficient and cleaner vehicles, and Crist has found a way to make that happen. After the Environmental Regulation Commission votes, the proposal will be considered by our representatives in the Legislature. Let's let our leaders know that we're ready for cleaner cars in Florida.LiNeBrEaK(CHART) GET INVOLVEDLiNeBrEaKFor the names and addresses of your lawmakers, visit www. leg.state.fl.us.LiNeBrEaKDavid Guest of Tallahassee is managing attorney for the Florida office of Earthjustice (Earthjustice.org), a nonprofit organization dedicated to enforcing and strengthening environmentalLiNeBrEaKWants to take lead in energy game	EMISSIONS (92%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (89%); LOBBYING (89%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY EQUIPMENT (89%); VEHICLE AIRBAGS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); INTERNET and WWW (77%); GOVERNORS (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); PRICE INCREASES (75%); PRICE CHANGES (73%); AIR QUALITY (73%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (73%); WEATHER (71%); COMPUTING and INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (69%); ENTERTAINMENT and ARTS AWARDS (60%)  					CHARLIE CRIST (73%); THOMAS L FRIEDMAN (50%)  	TAMPA, FL, USA (92%) FLORIDA, USA (96%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	December 2, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Tribune Co.

Do anything but play another season.LiNeBrEaKLeave school. LiNeBrEaKLove, your friends at Florida State.LiNeBrEaKThere are many fine college quarterbacks in the land, but Tebow proved again Saturday he is something different. He is a runner who passes, a passer who runs, and the leader of an offensive juggernaut who plays like he wants to be a linebacker.LiNeBrEaKHe is unselfish but still makes all the difference.LiNeBrEaKThe team he leads is blessed with so many ways to move the ball, that Tebow is the reigning Heisman Trophy winner could almost slip your mind.LiNeBrEaKNot this time, though.LiNeBrEaKFlorida would have beaten Florida State anyway Saturday, but Tebow was the difference between a nice, solid win and the 45-15 rout that unfolded on a dank and dreary day that was perfect for those whales Tebow could theoretically save.LiNeBrEaKIn a game in which bodies were hydroplaning all over Bobby Bowden Field after relentless rains turned it into, well, a swamp, Tebow frolicked around like someone enjoying some fun in the back yard with his pals.LiNeBrEaKThe Seminoles couldn't contain his running and couldn't stop his passing. He threw for three touchdowns and ran for one more, then just for fun made the option pitch to Jeff Demps that led to the Gators' final touchdown. He finished with 185 yards passing and 92 running, despite sitting out most of the fourth quarter.LiNeBrEaKThe bulk of Tebow's running yards came early in the game, too, when the Seminoles still thought they had a chance.LiNeBrEaK"He brings a Bronko Nagurski to the quarterback position," Bowden said. "That's what he looked like to me. He reminded me of one of those old-fashioned fullbacks back there playing quarterback."LiNeBrEaKBack In the Race?LiNeBrEaKDear Heisman Trophy voters:LiNeBrEaKYou know, this guy is pretty good, yet hardly anyone is talking about him. So why not Tebow?LiNeBrEaKWho knows if Tebow has done enough to impress voters into giving him a second consecutive Heisman. His name hasn't come up much when that award is mentioned, possibly because on this team of mass weaponry he has been happy to share the wealth.LiNeBrEaK"He deserves to be mentioned again for the Heisman," Bowden said. "I don't know if I've ever seen a better leader."LiNeBrEaKBowden said he was struck by the way Tebow stood up after the Gators lost 31-30 to Ole Miss and said it would never happen again. It hasn't. Indeed, Florida has routed every opponent since that day and Tebow is a major reason why.LiNeBrEaKHe admits to letting his mind drift just a bit to the idea of standing on the podium in New York again - "You've got to be honest and say that would be cool," he said - but he has higher goals at the moment.LiNeBrEaK"When I came to Florida, it was for championships," he said. "Winning the Heisman was great, it was a lot of fun, it was a great award, but it's nothing compared to championships."LiNeBrEaKNext up: Alabama in the Southeastern Conference Championship Game.LiNeBrEaKLet It Rain, Let It ReignLiNeBrEaKDear FSU fans:LiNeBrEaKNext time a Gator gets hurt the way Percy Harvin did, don't cheer. It only makes Tebow mad. He will make you pay.LiNeBrEaKAbout the only bad thing for Tebow on this day was how FSU fans cheered in the second quarter when Harvin hurt his ankle and had to leave the game.LiNeBrEaKYoung Tim rarely shows anger, but that one got him.LiNeBrEaK"I told Coach to give me the ball because I wanted to hit somebody extremely hard the next play," Tebow said.LiNeBrEaKHe had to wait. His number wasn't called until the second play after Harvin's injury. Tebow bulled up the middle 4 yards for a touchdown. He pushed the pile back. His face was caked with traces of the red paint that covered the end zone.LiNeBrEaKIt looked perfect.LiNeBrEaKWe haven't seen the likes of Tebow before. Who knows if we will again, since he'll have to decide whether to return for his senior season or jump to NFL riches. We know how the Seminoles feel about all this. Tebow has accounted for nine touchdowns against them in the past two meetings.LiNeBrEaK"He's a tremendous player and a tremendous leader," Bowden said. "He's something else."LiNeBrEaKThere was something else he didn't say, but he had to be thinking it. Save the whales. Save the country. Or at least show some mercy and save FSU from another beating next year. Enough is enough, already.

Tampa Tribune (Florida)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Tebow Once Again Has His Way With Seminoles  	Joe Henderson, Tampa Tribune, Fla.  	SPORTS  	779 words  	Nov. 30--UPDATED: 53 MIN. AGOLiNeBrEaKTALLAHASSEE -- Dear Tim Tebow:LiNeBrEaKPlease turn pro, or save the whales, solve global warming, or join President Obama's cabinet as the Minister of Goodness. Do anything but play another season.LiNeBrEaKLeave school. LiNeBrEaKLove, your friends at Florida State.LiNeBrEaKThere are many fine college quarterbacks in the land, but Tebow proved again Saturday he is something different. He is a runner who passes, a passer who runs, and the leader of an offensive juggernaut who plays like he wants to be a linebacker.LiNeBrEaKHe is unselfish but still makes all the difference.LiNeBrEaKThe team he leads is blessed with so many ways to move the ball, that Tebow is the reigning Heisman Trophy winner could almost slip your mind.LiNeBrEaKNot this time, though.LiNeBrEaKFlorida would have beaten Florida State anyway Saturday, but Tebow was the difference between a nice, solid win and the 45-15 rout that unfolded on a dank and dreary day that was perfect for those whales Tebow could theoretically save.LiNeBrEaKIn a game in which bodies were hydroplaning all over Bobby Bowden Field after relentless rains turned it into, well, a swamp, Tebow frolicked around like someone enjoying some fun in the back yard with his pals.LiNeBrEaKThe Seminoles couldn't contain his running and couldn't stop his passing. He threw for three touchdowns and ran for one more, then just for fun made the option pitch to Jeff Demps that led to the Gators' final touchdown. He finished with 185 yards passing and 92 running, despite sitting out most of the fourth quarter.LiNeBrEaKThe bulk of Tebow's running yards came early in the game, too, when the Seminoles still thought they had a chance.LiNeBrEaK"He brings a Bronko Nagurski to the quarterback position," Bowden said. "That's what he looked like to me. He reminded me of one of those old-fashioned fullbacks back there playing quarterback."LiNeBrEaKBack In the Race?LiNeBrEaKDear Heisman Trophy voters:LiNeBrEaKYou know, this guy is pretty good, yet hardly anyone is talking about him. So why not Tebow?LiNeBrEaKWho knows if Tebow has done enough to impress voters into giving him a second consecutive Heisman. His name hasn't come up much when that award is mentioned, possibly because on this team of mass weaponry he has been happy to share the wealth.LiNeBrEaK"He deserves to be mentioned again for the Heisman," Bowden said. "I don't know if I've ever seen a better leader."LiNeBrEaKBowden said he was struck by the way Tebow stood up after the Gators lost 31-30 to Ole Miss and said it would never happen again. It hasn't. Indeed, Florida has routed every opponent since that day and Tebow is a major reason why.LiNeBrEaKHe admits to letting his mind drift just a bit to the idea of standing on the podium in New York again -- "You've got to be honest and say that would be cool," he said -- but he has higher goals at the moment.LiNeBrEaK"When I came to Florida, it was for championships," he said. "Winning the Heisman was great, it was a lot of fun, it was a great award, but it's nothing compared to championships."LiNeBrEaKNext up: Alabama in the Southeastern Conference Championship Game.LiNeBrEaKLet It Rain, Let It ReignLiNeBrEaKDear FSU fans:LiNeBrEaKNext time a Gator gets hurt the way Percy Harvin did, don't cheer. It only makes Tebow mad. He will make you pay.LiNeBrEaKAbout the only bad thing for Tebow on this day was how FSU fans cheered in the second quarter when Harvin hurt his ankle and had to leave the game.LiNeBrEaKYoung Tim rarely shows anger, but that one got him.LiNeBrEaK"I told Coach to give me the ball because I wanted to hit somebody extremely hard the next play," Tebow said.LiNeBrEaKHe had to wait. His number wasn't called until the second play after Harvin's injury. Tebow bulled up the middle 4 yards for a touchdown. He pushed the pile back. His face was caked with traces of the red paint that covered the end zone.LiNeBrEaKIt looked perfect.LiNeBrEaKWe haven't seen the likes of Tebow before.

Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Washington)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Tracking network homes in on salmon secrets  	Les Blumenthal, Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	846 words  	Nov. 30--WASHINGTON -- They were two of the 1,000 juvenile salmon implanted with almond-sized transmitters as they headed out of the Rocky Mountains, down the Snake River bound for the sea.LiNeBrEaKTheir remarkable three-month, 1,500-mile journey of survival to the Gulf of Alaska was tracked by an underwater acoustic listening network that has wired the West Coast from just north of San Francisco to southeastern Alaska. The tracking network could provide a model for a global system.LiNeBrEaKA salmon's life in the ocean has always been one of nature's best kept mysteries. LiNeBrEaKHowever, scientists using the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking network have made some startling discoveries that challenge long-held beliefs about salmon survival and raise new cautions about how global warming may affect salmon and other marine species.LiNeBrEaK"I hope it will be a revolution in the way we do marine science," said David Welch, president of Kintama Research Corp. in Nanaimo, British Columbia, who was one of the founders of the tracking system. "I think we will make discoveries that are incredibly important and unexpected."LiNeBrEaKThe transmitters, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated, smaller and cheaper, have been implanted in a dozen species, including coho, sockeye and chinook salmon, along with green sturgeon, white sturgeon, sixgill shark, salmon shark, market squid, cutthroat trout, steelhead, dolly varden and black rockfish.LiNeBrEaKEventually, scientists think they'll be able to implant the transmitters in marine animals as big as whales and as small as herring.LiNeBrEaKSignals from the transmitters are picked up by nearly 300 receivers on the ocean floor as the fish swim by. The information is eventually retrieved from the listening devices by scientists who routinely visit the eight lines of acoustic receivers by ship. The receivers don't transmit the data by satellite.LiNeBrEaKListening lines are off Washington's Willapa Bay, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca between Vancouver Island and Washington's Olympic Peninsula, in British Columbia's Strait of Georgia, Queen Charlotte Strait, Howe Sound and off the northern tip of Vancouver Island, along with Point Reyes, north of San Francisco, and Graves Harbor in southeastern Alaska.LiNeBrEaKTwo major Northwest rivers, the Columbia and Fraser, also are wired with receivers that can keep track of salmon movements from the river mouth to hundreds of miles inland.LiNeBrEaK"This is a revolution in being able to study marine animals that travel vast distances," said Fred Goetz, a fish biologist with the Army Corps of Engineers who's been studying Puget Sound chinook, steelhead and bull trout. "This is a big breakthrough."LiNeBrEaKScientists are convinced the marine environment is changing because of global warming. However, no one yet understands how the changes are linked to such weather patterns as El Nio, La Nia and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a shift in the weather that occurs every 20 to 30 years in the northern oceans.LiNeBrEaKTracking marine life could help document these shifts and the effects they are having on the oceans.LiNeBrEaK"Now we are getting virtually real-time information," said Jim Bolger, the executive director of the tracking network. "We are answering questions we couldn't before."LiNeBrEaKAmong the findings:LiNeBrEaK-- Previously, it was thought that the highest mortality rates for salmon were in the freshwater streams and rivers as they headed to the saltwater ocean. But using the acoustic tracking system, researchers found that within the first few weeks of entering the ocean, 40 percent of the salmon died. Meanwhile, billions of dollars have been spent to increase in-river survival rates of salmon through projects such as habitat improvements in spawning areas and the modification of hydroelectric dams.LiNeBrEaK-- A study by Welch, which has touched off a major scientific debate, found dams may have less of an impact on salmon survival rates than previously thought. The study found juvenile salmon from the Columbia River, with its string of massive hydroelectric dams, survived their downstream migration equally or better than those migrating downstream in the dam-free Fraser River in British Columbia. Some environmentalists have insisted the only way to restore the Columbia River runs is by breaching four dams on the lower Snake River, a major tributary of the Columbia.LiNeBrEaK-- It's long been thought green sturgeon from the Sacramento and Klamath rivers in California migrated into the ocean but didn't go far. Now, using the acoustic tracking system, the green sturgeon have been found congregating off the north end of Vancouver Island at certain times of the year, then heading into the North Pacific. They've also been found in Puget Sound.

The Tribune-Democrat (Johnstown, Pennsylvania)  	November 30, 2008 Sunday 	Tribune-Democrat, Johnstown, Pa., Mike Mastovich column: ?Rocky' back for some hockey  	Mike Mastovich, Tribune-Democrat, Johnstown, Pa.  	SPORTS  	863 words  	Nov. 30--Rocky will return to Cambria County War Memorial Arena this evening.LiNeBrEaKGarrett Burnett, a fan favorite during his 34 mostly memorable and often colorful games with the Johnstown Chiefs, will traverse the halls he once roamed while wearing a black cape with his nickname scripted across the back. Burnett and Somerset County Olympian Sam Sacksen will participate in promotional appearances during the Chiefs' game against Florida.LiNeBrEaKAnyone still possessing a black T-shirt with Burnett's image and a blood-dripping No. 55 certainly remembers this tough guy. The Chiefs and former coach Nick Fotiu helped Burnett work his way to the NHL with the Anaheim Ducks for one season. Rocky was poised to stick in the show a bit longer after securing a one-way NHL deal, but the lockout and a changing climate when the game returned diminished the need for fighters. LiNeBrEaKBurnett remembers Johnstown and its fans. He'll appreciate this visit even more because of recent life-threatening events that left him in a coma and resulted in his having to relearn basics we take for granted -- walking, talking and eating.LiNeBrEaK"In my life, I never got to be successful in anything without having sacrifice," Burnett said Saturday, prior to attending the Pittsburgh Penguins game at Mellon Arena. "This is more adversity. It's kind of a huge speed bump I've got to try to overcome. I feel I can overcome it by being strong and having a strong family on my side.LiNeBrEaK"Mentally, I will try to live on and not get too caught up in it. Hopefully that will lead me to some better days ahead. The past two years have been pretty miserable to deal with."LiNeBrEaKBurnett allegedly was assaulted in the early hours of Dec. 26, 2006 outside of a night club in North Delta, British Columbia.LiNeBrEaKA group of people Burnett was with became involved in a dispute with another group. After the unfortunate episode, Burnett was left in a coma for 20 days and spent four months in a hospital. For two months he couldn't walk. Burnett said he continues to have some double vision, as well as nerve damage in his feet and left side of his face.LiNeBrEaK"I was in a wheel chair and I had to learn to walk again," Burnett said. "I couldn't see. Speaking, reading, writing, eating, walking. ... Everything, basically, I had to relearn."LiNeBrEaKA War Memorial visit certainly should be good therapy, even though the attendance probably will suffer with the Chiefs playing just as the Steelers game at New England should be winding down.LiNeBrEaK"I can't wait to see the city and the rink and to be at a game and see the whole environment," Burnett said. "With how good you guys treated me, I can't wait."LiNeBrEaKIn his 34 games with the Chiefs, Burnett made a smashing impact. He had 331 penalty minutes, a goal and two points. His toughness led to a mid-season call-up to Philadelphia in the AHL, and he stuck.LiNeBrEaK"I remember when I first got traded to Johnstown and I showed up when training camp was starting," Burnett said. "Somebody asked me, 'What should we expect from Garrett Burnett because we traded away our team captain for you?' I said, 'Have you guys seen the movie 'Slap Shot?' Expect to see three Hanson Brothers in one fight.' "LiNeBrEaKHis cape and T-shirts aside, Burnett was easy to spot on the ice because of the physical presence he developed under Fotiu's tutelage, first in Johnstown and later with Lexington, Ky., and Hartford, Conn., in the AHL.LiNeBrEaK"Nicky Fotiu was a huge part of me coming to Johnstown," Burnett said. "He made a deal to get me. I was really encouraged by the fact that he was somebody from the same school of hockey that I was from. He was basically the same kind of player as I am. I felt honored to be able to go out and play for him."LiNeBrEaKFotiu played 13 NHL seasons with five teams and was beloved by the tough-to-please New York Rangers fans. He collected 1,362 penalty minutes.LiNeBrEaK"He got me ready for the ECHL and for the AHL, and he got me ready to step to the NHL," Burnett said.LiNeBrEaKBurnett got his big break in 2003-04 when he appeared in 39 games with the Anaheim Ducks and spent the entire season in the NHL. Just like in Johnstown, the sun-tanned Southern California fans took a liking to Burnett.LiNeBrEaKRocky had a goal, three points and 184 penalty minutes during his NHL stay. Oh, yeah. He also participated in 22 fights.LiNeBrEaKHis minor league numbers include 2,562 penalty minutes with 13 different teams.LiNeBrEaKBurnett never pretended to be a finesse guy. He played his game with no regrets.LiNeBrEaKBut what about that black cape?LiNeBrEaKBurnett laughed:LiNeBrEaK"The players in Johnstown figured that they'd get me a cape like the one Killer Carlson wore in his scene in the movie. It had Rocky written on the back. I wasn't shy about playing it up."LiNeBrEaKWelcome back, Rocky, even if you don't bring the cape.LiNeBrEaKMike Mastovich is a sports writer for The Tribune-Democrat.

The Washington Post 	November 30, 2008 Sunday   Regional Edition	Beijing and Washington: The Case for a Really Long Engagement  	Thomas J. Christensen  	OUTLOOK; Pg. B05  	1282 words  	 Few diplomatic relationships are deeper or more complex than that between the United States and China. While the Pentagon draws up contingency plans for a potential conflict with China, U.S. businesses are investing billions there, and American consumers stock their wardrobes, toy chests, garages and kitchens with products "Made in China." How should the Obama administration handle these delicate ties? In the run-up to a Dec. 5 conference on "China and the Next Administration," sponsored by Outlook and CNA, a non-partisan think tank, we posed that question to four specialists.LiNeBrEaKOne area in which President-elect Obama should not push for change is China policy. Simply put, President Bush's strategy on U.S.-China relations has been a success.LiNeBrEaKOver the past eight years, Washington has tamped down rising tensions between Taiwan and mainland China by promoting a strong but moderate Taiwan, rejecting any unilateral changes in the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and demanding that the two sides settle their differences peacefully. Meanwhile, the market for U.S. products in China has improved markedly, in part because of ongoing U.S.-Chinese economic talks such as the Strategic Economic Dialogue led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. LiNeBrEaKEven more important, U.S.-China diplomacy has moved beyond managing problems between the two sides to focus on coordinating responses to problems around the world. That was an important and innovative step for both countries to take. The U.S.-China Senior Dialogue on political and security affairs, led by Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte, addresses such global issues. Our regional assistant secretaries of state and their Chinese counterparts also hold intensive discussions. Ten years ago, officials in these positions probably wouldn't even have known each other's names.LiNeBrEaKAs Amb. Christopher R. Hill, the lead U.S. negotiator in the six-party talks on Korean denuclearization, recently noted, solutions for many global problems -- from North Korea to Darfur -- will require coordination between Washington and Beijing. President-elect Obama should, therefore, build upon, not transform, these current trends.LiNeBrEaKThomas J. Christensen, a professor at Princeton University, served as deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2006-08. The views expressed here are his own.LiNeBrEaKAt the top of President-elect Obama's agenda should be a summit with President Hu Jintao to propose major collaboration between the United States and China. That could go a long way toward bringing the planet back from the brink of climate disaster.LiNeBrEaKAs the global economy has cooled into recession and the Earth's atmosphere has continued to heat up, some officials have, understandably, been tempted to delay confronting climate change and focus solely on the economy. But to do so would be irresponsible in the extreme.LiNeBrEaKBecause the United States and China are now the world's largest users of coal and together are responsible for almost 50 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions, there can be no solution to global warming without the active, joint leadership of Washington and Beijing.LiNeBrEaKAnd here's a bonus: by aggressively collaborating to develop, use and market sustainable energy technologies, the United States and China will also benefit from the new intellectual property, start-ups, industries and jobs that are destined to grow out of such a post-IT revolution. Moreover, if the United States and China forge a new partnership, they will also find their ties suddenly cushioned by a new common interest that could shape the future course of our relationship as much as the epic breakthrough following President Nixon and Henry Kissinger's trip to Beijing in 1972.LiNeBrEaK Orville Schell is the director of the Asia Society's Center on U.S.-China Relations.LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest impediments to building a strong relationship with China is that Americans know so little about the place, its history and its challenges.LiNeBrEaKFew realize that China has become our third-largest market for exports, or that U.S. sales to China have increased by more than 300 percent since 2000, a growth 10 times greater than that with any of our other large trading partners. Many Americans are unaware that the share of the U.S. global trade deficit with East Asia, including China, has declined from 75 percent to 49 percent over the past decade, or that most of the goods that U.S. firms manufacture in China are sold there, not exported to the United States.LiNeBrEaKMost Americans also fail to recognize how much U.S. and Chinese interests overlap in critical areas such as global growth, regional security, nuclear proliferation, energy security, food and product safety, environmental protection and climate change. Talking and listening to China is a way to advance our nation's vital interests.LiNeBrEaKThe Strategic Economic Dialogue started by the Bush administration proves that joint discussions work. In four sessions over the past two years, cabinet officials from both nations achieved important breakthroughs, such as the agreements to negotiate a bilateral investment treaty to protect investors in both countries, engage in joint efforts on food and safety investigations, and collaborate on converting biomass resources into fuel.LiNeBrEaKTime and again, we have seen the beneficial results of engagement -- and the damage done by belligerence. I hope that President-elect Obama will continue the conversation with China, strengthening habits of cooperation and building mutual trust and confidence.LiNeBrEaKCarla A. Hills served as U.S. Trade Representative from 1989-93 and is the chairman and chief executive of Hills and Company, a Washington-based international consulting firm.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration will inherit ties with China that are generally good and in some areas deepening. Of notable exception are military relations.LiNeBrEaKIn October, Beijing suspended military contacts with the United States after the Bush administration moved forward with portions of a Taiwan arms sales package in limbo since 2001. This is the fifth time since 1989 that either the United States or China has suspended or postponed military contacts.LiNeBrEaKSuch suspensions are regrettable. The two defense establishments had recently made progress on important initiatives such as establishing a defense "hotline" to avoid miscommunication during a crisis, but the latest turn of events underscores yet again the fragility of military relations.LiNeBrEaKIt serves neither Beijing's nor Washington's interests to halt military contacts at every diplomatic bump. The stakes are just too high. There are many areas where the two militaries could be cooperating, and there are significant areas of disagreement and tension between the two that demand management.LiNeBrEaKBeijing will probably end the current moratorium on military contacts some time after the Obama administration takes office. But doing so will not dispel the miasma of mutual distrust that serves as a backdrop to the military relationship, and dealing head on with this suspicion will be the key to all other possibilities. After next Jan. 20, Beijing will have a new opportunity to re-engage its U.S. military counterparts on critical issues such as strategic nuclear doctrine. President-elect Obama has promised to make engagement, dialogue and good old-fashioned listening central parts of his foreign-policy approach. In dealing with the Chinese military, that philosophy will be put to the test. Let's hope that both sides can soon get on with the important business at hand.LiNeBrEaKDavid M. Finkelstein is vice president of CNA, a non-profit research institute in Alexandria, and the director of its China studies program.

The Baltimore Sun (Maryland)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	If you rely on winter weather to kill pests, you may be left out in the cold  	Susan Reimer, The Baltimore Sun  	LIFESTYLE  	781 words  	Nov. 29--This month's cold snap was a welcome event in my garden. Finally, I thought, we are going to have a nice, harsh winter with temperatures in the teens every day and a crippling snowstorm or two.LiNeBrEaKBut the cold did not last, and moderate temperatures returned with a vengeance. LiNeBrEaKMy hope that Mother Nature would kill off the bugs and spores that overwinter in my garden appeared dashed.LiNeBrEaKDashed, and, it turns out, misplaced.LiNeBrEaKWe haven't had a really cold winter in Maryland since 2003, when temperatures averaged below freezing at 30. 9 degrees. Since then, temperatures have averaged well above freezing for December, January and February, as high as 37. 2 in 2006.LiNeBrEaKCertainly there were plenty of cold days during those winters, but the season has been, relatively speaking, warmer.LiNeBrEaK"We haven't had any sustained cold in five years," said Carrie Engel, greenhouse manager at Valley View Farms in Cockeysville. "My alocasia came back two years in a row, and my friend Nancy was just saying that her caladiums had come back in a pot! And that never happens."LiNeBrEaKEngel and her friend may have derived some benefit from this warm weather, but I blamed it for the vitality of the insects that chew my coral bells into lace doilies and for the fungi that have attacked my black-eyed Susans and for the rust on my hollyhocks.LiNeBrEaKAs it turns out, I'm wrong.LiNeBrEaK"These diseases have evolved to withstand pretty extreme conditions," said Jon Traunfeld of the Maryland Cooperative Extension's Home and Garden Information Center. "And any insects that are overwintering that can move will move deeper into the ground and others may be protected in egg sacks underneath the bark."LiNeBrEaKTraunfeld sees evidence of global warming everywhere. Growers are enjoying a longer season and can get an earlier start in the spring, he said.LiNeBrEaK"And I don't even protect my fig tree anymore, and I have been OK," he said.LiNeBrEaKKathy Purdy, who blogs on Cold Climate Gardening and lives north of Binghamton, N.Y., says temperatures are in the teens most days during her winters and the ground freezes to three feet. She hasn't found that to be much of an advantage when it comes to insects and disease.LiNeBrEaKShe thinks drought -- and that can include the lack of snow in the winter -- has made plants more vulnerable.LiNeBrEaK"You might not see it that year, but you will see it the next," she said.LiNeBrEaKGene Sumi, education coordinator at Homestead Gardens in Davidsonville, says the key to restraining insects and disease in the garden is "garden sanitation."LiNeBrEaKIt is up to me to remove the infected foliage and rake the beds clean and do some dormant spraying, he said.LiNeBrEaK"That won't take care of everything, but it will eliminate a major part of it," said Sumi.LiNeBrEaKSpores, he said, can encapsulate themselves and survive the toughest winter "only to explode in the spring and reinfect everything."LiNeBrEaKSpider mites can continue to do damage in the winter and are ready to do even more damage in the spring, he said.LiNeBrEaKHe recommends an old farm remedy -- lime sulfur spray. Farmers used to make it themselves; it is nontoxic and organic.LiNeBrEaK"It only has three problems," said Sumi. "It is a messy job, it looks bad and it smells bad."LiNeBrEaKThe spraying must be thorough -- "every nook and cranny," said Sumi. And the result is the foliage looks like it is covered with runny plaster, and, because of the sulfur, it smells like rotten eggs for a couple of days.LiNeBrEaKLime sulfur spray is one of the safest fungicides, according to advice from High Country Gardens' experts, and also works to control insects. It can be used against peach leaf curl, brown rot, leaf spot, powdery mildew, rust, black spot and blight, as well as mites, scale, borers and aphids.LiNeBrEaKDormant oil spray is another way to control pests, especially on roses and evergreens. (The two products should not be used at the same time.)LiNeBrEaKIt can control aphids, whiteflies, scale, mites, mealy bugs and some caterpillars by suffocating adults and smothering eggs. And again, thoroughness is important.

The Boston Globe 	November 29, 2008 Saturday   THIRD EDITION	This year, why not try something different?  	Derrick Z. Jackson  	OP-ED; Pg. A11  	650 words  	ONE THING I am thankful for on Thanksgiving weekend is having absolutely no desire to go to the mall. I cannot remember the last time I did so, which by extension leaves me utterly out of touch with the national impulse to waddle out of bed at 4 a.m., especially the morning after the biggest collective burp on the American calendar.LiNeBrEaKIt seems that it is not enough for Americans to watch football on turkey day. Obviously inspired by our beloved black-and-blue brutality, otherwise sane Americans treat Black Friday as their day in the NFL, blasting through the hole of the store opening to the 20-, the 30-, the 40-, the 50-percent-off sweater department! Then you chop-block the shopper ahead of you to advance from 53d to 52d in the checkout line. LiNeBrEaKAll this sweat, tears, and occasional blood for the argyle for dear old Dad that becomes moth bait.LiNeBrEaKThis year is, of course, different. Black Friday really turned tragic as a Wal-Mart employee was trampled to death in New York. This and the economy stinks. President-elect Obama has said for two years the planet is in peril. That originally only referred to global warming. But Americans keep thinking we can pilfer the planet at no peril. SUV sales are already picking up again now that gasoline is back under $2 a gallon, at the very same time we whine like the Wicked Witch of the West, shrinking to our knees screaming that our wallets are "melting! melting!"LiNeBrEaKThis would seem like a great time to reassess the difference between what we want and what we need, both for the wallet and the planet. The National Retail Federation estimates that 49 million Americans were sure to go shopping this weekend. That is one-sixth of America. Depending how deep the discounts go, up to 128 million Americans could clog the aisles, over a third of the nation. One shopping center in Wisconsin, which opened at midnight after Thanksgiving, offered free pajamas to shoppers who came in pajamas. Mattel is throwing $50 Visa cards at $100 Barbie shoppers. Department stores were offering toys at half off and bringing back layaway plans.LiNeBrEaKThe federation said this week, "For the first time since March 2005, the average price of self-serve, unleaded gasoline is $1. 91, leaving shoppers with a little extra padding in their wallets ... Shoppers who held off buying a DVD player or winter coat over the last few months will find that prices may literally be too good to pass up."LiNeBrEaKLike crack cocaine, I suppose. The Associated Press, in getting the reaction of motorists to the price of gasoline falling to an average of $1. 79 in Columbus, Ohio, quoted one woman as saying, "It's awesome. With this gas guzzler, there was no way I could afford to keep paying, the way we're going."LiNeBrEaKIt would be far more awesome to stop the addiction. A growing number of families have gone cold turkey on turkey day, banning the blizzard of boxes under the Christmas tree in lieu of charitable gifts to people really in need. Now, more than ever, with a planet disproportionately fouled by our pollution and waste (Americans waste 27 percent of food, according to the government), we need to ask: Does my kid really need that toy? Do I really need to upgrade my cellphone? Is happiness really wrapped up in the 50-percent-off sweater?LiNeBrEaKI have a suggestion for these holidays. The average American, according to the government, consumes six times more energy than the world average. Take whatever you spent on gifts last year, slash 5/6ths of it, and see what you can do with the rest - unless of course you make a charitable donation. You're broke anyway, right, so what's the harm? Chances are, your loved ones won't love you any less, someone in need will love you more, and your children might understand a bit more how the rest of the planet lives.LiNeBrEaKAnd the planet itself can give thanks for being a few pieces of plastic less in peril.

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	Chattanooga: Big business in buying local  	Kathy Gilbert, Chattanooga Times/Free Press, Tenn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	747 words  	Nov. 29--Buying vegetables at the farmers market may pay off for the regional economy.LiNeBrEaKIf Chattanoogans spent 5 percent of their food budgets at the farmers market or a grocery store's "local food" section, $100 million would be spent in the region, according to "A Preliminary Analysis of Food Production and Consumption in the Chattanooga Foodshed," released Tuesday by Chattanooga-based Crabtree Farms and the Ochs Center for Metropolitan Studies.LiNeBrEaKThat's enough to buy a supertanker of oil or 30 million additional pounds of beef. LiNeBrEaK"We see tremendous advantages to concentrating more of our local spending on locally produced food products," said J.Ed. Marston, spokesman for the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce, after reading the report.LiNeBrEaKRight now, area residents spend about 2 percent or less of their food budget on local products, Ochs Center policy analyst Lori Quillen said.LiNeBrEaKSince Chattanoogans spend about $2. 05 billion on home-cooked foods every year, pledging just 5 percent of the total would increase local spending by a total of $100 million, Ms. Quillen said.LiNeBrEaKThe report is part of the Chattanooga Buy Fresh Buy Local campaign launched in August, said Crabtree Farms Executive Director Vanessa Mercer.LiNeBrEaKBuy Fresh Buy Local Chattanooga also plans to publish a regional food directory in May. The public is invited to an advisory committee meeting to discuss ongoing Buy Fresh Buy Local business on Feb. 6, Ms. Mercer said.LiNeBrEaKLocal food buying has become more popular in recent years.LiNeBrEaKSome buyers want to know how their food is produced, others look for fresher foods, many look for shorter transport miles to reduce carbon emissions and therefore global warming, and a large group wish to keep their dollars circulating at home, said Jon Frady, a Tennessee state agricultural marketing specialist.LiNeBrEaKNationwide, the number of farmers markets rose from 1,755 in 1994 to 4,685 this year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.LiNeBrEaKCommunity Supported Agriculture, in which customers buy shares of a year's food production directly from a farmer, enjoys great popularity among organic customers in Georgia and Tennessee, Mr. Frady said.LiNeBrEaKGlobalization reorganized agriculture so that giant producers now typically contract with international companies to ship large quantities of food worldwide. Within 100 miles of Chattanooga, for example, 4,517 farms sold $1. 4 billion in poultry and eggs in 2002 -- 68 percent of total area food sales, Ms. Quillen said.LiNeBrEaKMr. Marston said the trend toward buying local foods won't leave the consumer benefits of mass-produced global food behind.LiNeBrEaK"We're not talking about 100 percent local buying," he said. "We're looking for a healthier proportion of local buying vs. food produced far away."LiNeBrEaKFood prices might come down as local production increases, he said.LiNeBrEaK"Right now we have a 'boutique' local food model," Mr. Marston said. "But if our local economy geared up and produced more food, it would probably be more affordable."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, successful local farms rely on direct farmer-to-consumer transactions. By taking the place of the corporate middleman, area farmers' incomes returned, Mr. Frady said.LiNeBrEaK"(Now) you can definitely make a living with a small farm," he said.LiNeBrEaKBuy Fresh Buy Local Chattanooga has identified 250 regional farms selling locally, Ms. Mercer said, and the number is rising. Still, some farmers said their production can't keep pace with demand.LiNeBrEaK"We see exponential opportunity to sell locally and make fair value for what we grow," said Denise Burns, co-owner of Burns Best Farm in Ringgold, Ga.LiNeBrEaKThe lack of infrastructure for local food production, such as grain mills or poultry processors for small farmers, limits their progress, she said.LiNeBrEaK"If some of that 5 percent (spending on local foods) floated our way, we'd be in a pretty good situation," she said. "I would have enough money to make investments in my farm and service a few more people. I don't want to be Con-Agra, but I'd like to meet the demand we have.LiNeBrEaK"We certainly wouldn't need a federal bailout," Mrs. Burns said.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 29, 2008 Saturday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Big changes expected on environment;  EPA, Interior are seen as epicenter, likely to see major transformation 	JULIET EILPERIN, Washington Post  	A; Pg. 8  	757 words  	WASHINGTON - Few federal agencies are expected to undergo as radical a transformation under President-elect Barack Obama as the Environmental Protection Agency and Interior Department, which were at the epicenter of many of the Bush administration's most intense scientific and environmental controversies.LiNeBrEaKThe agencies have different mandates - the EPA holds sway over air and water pollution, while Interior administers the nation's vast federal land holdings as well as the Endangered Species Act - but both deal with some of the country's most pressing environmental concerns, such as climate change. And over the past eight years, many career employees and rank-and-file scientists have clashed with Bush appointees over those issues. LiNeBrEaKIn June 2007, Obama told reporters in Reno, Nev., that he would not hesitate to reverse many of the environmental policies Bush has enacted by executive order.LiNeBrEaK"The slow chipping away against clean air and clean water has been deeply disturbing," he added. "Much of it hasn't gone through Congress. It was done by fiat. That is something that can be changed."LiNeBrEaKOn climate changeLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming policies are expected to mark one of the sharpest breaks between the Obama and the Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKEPA Administrator Stephen Johnson overruled his career advisers in deciding to deny California authority to control tailpipe emissions and rejecting their conclusion that global warming poses a threat to public welfare, and Obama is likely to reverse both of those policies shortly after taking office. This month, the president-elect told delegates to the Governors' Global Climate Summit that he would push for a federal cap-and-trade system designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and then to cut them an additional 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaK"Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response," Obama said in a videotaped message. "The stakes are too high."LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said Wednesday that the agency is focused on finalizing policies on coal-fired power plants and other matters, but he would not speculate on the task the next administration faces: "We'll let the next team decide what their priorities will be when they get here."LiNeBrEaKBudget challengesLiNeBrEaKWith escalating responsibilities, both agencies will need more resources after years when their budgets shrank, relatively speaking. The EPA received $7. 5 billion from Congress in 2008, down from $7. 8 billion in 2001. Interior has fared slightly better, getting $11. 1 billion compared with $10. 4 billion in 2001, but that represents more than a 10 percent cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has feuded with both Johnson and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne over global warming and other issues, said she has high expectations of the people who will take their places.LiNeBrEaK"I'm expecting President-elect Obama to select people who really care about the issues they're in charge of, someone who believes in their mission and not someone who's going to undermine their mission," she said. "That's a sea change."LiNeBrEaKRegardless of who takes over at the agencies, the new leaders will face impatient scrutiny from green groups eager to change the government's trajectory on the environment. Frank O'Donnell, who heads Clean Air Watch, ticked off 10 initiatives he expects the new EPA administrator to undertake, including changing rules on emissions from coal-fired power plants and monitoring airborne lead pollution more closely.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration has cut so many special deals for industry that it could be a Herculean effort reversing them all," O'Donnell said. "The new team is going to have to muck out the regulatory stables."LiNeBrEaKPOSSIBLE PICKSLiNeBrEaKThere is a long list of Democrats vying to take the helm of the EPA and Interior Department.LiNeBrEaKEPA administrator: The two leading contenders are Mary Nichols, who chairs the California Air Resources Board, and Lisa Jackson, who is in the midst of switching from heading New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection to serving as chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine. Other possible nominees include former Sierra Club president Lisa Renstrom; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman of the Waterkeeper Alliance, an advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKInterior secretary: Two House Democrats, Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Mike Thompson of California are contenders, but Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer and former Oregon governor John Kitzhaber have also been mentioned.

Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	Transy senior to join world environmental leaders in Poland  	Ryan Alessi, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	879 words  	Nov. 29--Next week, one of Kentucky's newest and most well-traveled young environmental activists will join world leaders and experts in Poznan, Poland, for the United Nations climate change conference.LiNeBrEaKMarcie Smith, a 21-year-old senior at Transylvania University, will lobby on behalf of the 20-something generation as part of a 20-member delegation from the grass-roots group SustainUS.LiNeBrEaKTheir goal: to share young peoples' perspectives as U.N. representatives draft the parameters of a global environmental treaty that will replace the Kyoto Protocol. A summit to agree to final terms of the agreement will be in Copenhagen next year. LiNeBrEaKBut during the Poznan conference between Dec. 1 and 12, world leaders will debate key topics, such as pollution controls and standards, that are aimed at curtailing climate change.LiNeBrEaKRight there with them will be Smith, whose area of interest is curbing deforestation.LiNeBrEaK"We want to see a treaty that is bold, that is courageous. It needs to be binding, and there needs to be accountability," Smith said. "And we want to see U.S. leadership, which has been lacking."LiNeBrEaKThe United States, for instance, did not agree to the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKTo describe Smith, who grew up in Richmond, as an advocacy-minded and active student is an understatement.LiNeBrEaKShe has founded a campus environmental group and has interned in Congress and for a think tank in The Hague, Netherlands. She has studied in Madagascar off the coast of Africa and hopes to spend next summer in France after graduating with a double major in international relations and French.LiNeBrEaKBut to call her a citizen of the world shortchanges her strong and deep Kentucky roots.LiNeBrEaK"I've just basically been given a very strong sense of family history and of place, and I can't divorce myself of that," said Smith, whose family dates back roughly two centuries in Kentucky.LiNeBrEaKSmith has a knack for balancing.LiNeBrEaKHer family and those she's worked with describe her as a rare blend of global ambition and parochial passion, theoretical "wonkishness" and practical application, realism and idealism.LiNeBrEaK"So many people in progressive politics are na&Atilde;&macr;ve optimists, na&Atilde;&macr;ve idealists. She is not. She really understands the constraints that doing good must confront," said Jeffrey Freyman, political science professor and Smith's adviser. "Despite being nobody's fool, she still is quite committed."LiNeBrEaKOne subject on which she remains passionate is Kentucky. And although her studies of natural resources, energy and the climate have taken her across the globe, they inevitably lead home.LiNeBrEaK"If you're looking at what region of the country is going to be laid at the altar of energy independence, it's going to be Appalachia," she said.LiNeBrEaKFinding a balance between coal mining and environmental protection is one of her interests.LiNeBrEaKThe oldest of three daughters of David and Dottie Smith, Marcie's curiosity about the world was stoked early on.LiNeBrEaKA Thanksgiving tradition is to debate hot issues in what Smith has dubbed "the War Room."LiNeBrEaK"She gets more of the political and current events from her dad's side and more of her environmental sensitivity from my side because we were so close to the land," said Smith's mother, Dottie, who grew up on a tobacco farm in Bald Knob in northwest Franklin County.LiNeBrEaKBut the two seminal events that widened her perspective, Marcie said, were in high school when she read New Yorker writer Philip Gourevitch's book about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and two summers ago when she attended a screening of former Vice President Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.LiNeBrEaKAt that showing of the movie in Lexington, she sat next to U.S. Rep. Ben Chandler, D-Versailles.LiNeBrEaKShe said the film prompted her to examine human consumption and question "the way I live my life."LiNeBrEaK"So after it, I was asking him, 'So what are you doing about this?' And 'What can I do?'" Smith recalled.LiNeBrEaKChandler suggested starting a campus environmental group.LiNeBrEaKBy the fall, she and several others established Transylvania Environmental Rights and Responsibilities Alliance, which has prodded the university to be energy efficient. It launched programs, such as the "Get Trashed Campaign" that required students to carry trash bags for two weeks to show them the amount of waste they generate, and "Hug a mug," which encourages use of travel mugs instead of disposable coffee cups.LiNeBrEaKSmith later interned for Chandler, where the congressman's chief of staff, Denis Fleming, said she quickly established herself as "a standout," researching foreign affairs and environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKAll her experience has prepared her for her latest adventure to Poland.LiNeBrEaK"What is neat for me is that I may not have much political capital," she said. "But we represent one of the truest examples of a grass-roots movement that the world has ever seen."LiNeBrEaKRyan Alessi covers higher education.

Manassa Journal Messenger (Virginia)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Pretend that gas prices aren't falling  	News and Messenger, Manassas, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	438 words  	Nov. 29--Gas prices continue to fall, fall, fall, and not a moment too soon.LiNeBrEaKJust as it seemed we could stand no more of the three-dollar and higher gas prices, they began to drop. LiNeBrEaKPrices were down as low as $1. 57 in the Woodbridge area early this past week, a more than 20-cent drop from the week before. In the Manassas area, average prices were a little higher -- $1. 67 perLiNeBrEaKgallon according to AAA. But still, that is a far cry from prices we were paying a few short months ago.LiNeBrEaKSo what does this mean?LiNeBrEaKDoes it mean that we need never worry about fuel prices again? Are prices going to stay low and continue to drop?LiNeBrEaKWe wouldn't count on it. Gas price fluctuations have become commonplace, and we have seen prices fall numerous times only to jump back up again at a later date.LiNeBrEaKThis isn't a time for complacency. It is good that prices are low and it costs less to fill our tanks and travel. But when gas prices were high, many of us had to adopt more frugal attitudes toward our gasLiNeBrEaKconsumption.LiNeBrEaKThere is no reason why we should abandon those new attitudes now.LiNeBrEaKThe fact is that there is a finite amount of oil in this world. Eventually -- and according to some experts, relatively soon -- we are going to begin to run out of oil. At that point, you can bet that gasolineLiNeBrEaKprices will be through the roof and the rush to find alternative energy sources will be in full swing.LiNeBrEaKBut even if this wasn't the case, much of the oil that we use comes from foreign countries. We must depend upon them and their whims for our automotive well being, and that is a precarious position toLiNeBrEaKbe in.LiNeBrEaKAnd, of course, cars pollute. The more we use our cars, the worse it is for the environment, plain and simple. Our frugal gasoline habits do not just translate into money in our pockets, they also meanLiNeBrEaKless pollution. We should all be looking for ways to pollute less, and conscious, careful use of gasoline is one of those ways.LiNeBrEaKGasoline prices are falling and we should all be happy. But we should not pretend that our consumption habits can go back to the reckless habits of a time when gasoline was limitless, "global warming"LiNeBrEaKwas meaningless and we did not worry about the oil dominance of foreign countries.LiNeBrEaKThose times have passed.

Northwest Florida Daily News (Fort Walton Beach, Florida)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Ignore the holiday soreheads  	Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach  	COMMENTARY  	460 words  	Nov. 29--The holidays are here, and some will say you're already guilty. You're guilty of being human, guilty of prosperity, guilty of consumption. You're guilty of having so much while others have so little. You're guilty of being happy while others are sad. You're guilty of having shaken consumer confidence. You're guilty of freedom. LiNeBrEaKDon't let the guilt-mongering soreheads get you down. Take a break from negative talk about the recession and the state of the family's 401(k).LiNeBrEaKWe're pretty sure you'll meet more than a few Debbie Downers this holiday season, including 1) soreheads who find one reason or another to take offense at the words "Merry Christmas," 2) soreheads who find one reason or another to take offense at the words "Happy holidays," 3) the "I'm depressed because the holidays stir stressful childhood memories" soreheads, 4) soreheads in general who decide that food, friends, gifts, music and cheer are reason for anger and despair, and 5) the "Christmas is too commercial" soreheads.LiNeBrEaKAnd this year, more than ever, you'll encounter purveyors of anti-holiday environmental guilt. This new variety of sorehead believes Americans can't enjoy the fruits of prosperity without harming Mother Earth. Assuage them by giving up plastic bags for reusable cloth bags. It's a simple concession that might save a sea turtle.LiNeBrEaKThis past week, guilt media told us how it's cruel to eat turkey. We learned how traveling over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house might contribute to the death of a bear. Here's a typical rant from a guilt Web site: "It's amazing how big a negative impact (Thanksgiving) has on our environment. ... Think about how far your food traveled to your table -- turkeys from the Northeast, corn from the Midwest and asparagus by air freight from South America. ... Consider the possible effects of continued global warming. Crops traditionally associated with Thanksgiving -- including wheat, cranberries, pumpkins and chestnuts -- may migrate north into Canada and no longer be viably grown in the United States at all." Etc.LiNeBrEaKIt's OK to eat, drink and be merry.LiNeBrEaKIt's OK to shop till you drop.LiNeBrEaKIt's OK to love and enjoy the holiday season -- to celebrate prosperity and freedom without apology. So have a good Thanksgiving holiday weekend. No soreheads allowed.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Debating global warming: New climate data  	The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	COMMENTARY  	320 words  	Nov. 29--Royal Navy logbooks dating to the 17th century might chart a new course from vague assumptions to verifiable reason in the stormy debate over global warming. LiNeBrEaKMariners' well-kept records detailing air pressure, wind speed and air and sea temperatures provide a snapshot of previous climate conditions. For a group of British academics and scientists examining historic climate changes, it's a "treasure trove" of information, they say.LiNeBrEaKIn a preliminary study of 6,000 logbooks, questions already are being raised that challenge the conclusions of global warming's Chicken Littles. For instance, Europe in the 1730s experienced a period of rapid warming -- not unlike that of recent years -- which clearly wasn't attributable to man-made influences.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, scientists linked Hurricane Vince, which developed in an area of low sea-surface temperatures, to climate change. Yet the old logbooks detail a similar hurricane in 1842 that followed the same trajectory. Mere coincidence?LiNeBrEaKWhat's revealed is the complexity of climate science, says Dr. Dennis Wheeler, a University of Sunderland scientist, "and that it's wrong to take particular events and link them to CO2 emissions."LiNeBrEaKAre the ship logs conclusive? Perhaps no more so than the claims of global warming alarmists. But it's data that should be carefully researched. Something we can't say of the data deceptively manipulated to argue that the debate has ended regarding man's role in planetary climate change.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 29, 2008 Saturday   SOONER EDITION	BIG CHANGES ON THE HORIZON;  OBAMA EXPECTED TO TRANSFORM EPA AND INTERIOR 	Juliet Eilperin, The Washington Post  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-5  	624 words  	WASHINGTON -- Few federal agencies are expected to undergo as radical a transformation under President-elect Barack Obama as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, which have been at the epicenter of many of the Bush administration's most intense scientific and environmental controversies.LiNeBrEaKThe agencies have different mandates -- the EPA holds sway over air and water pollution, while Interior administers the nation's vast federal land holdings as well as the Endangered Species Act -- but both deal with some of the country's most pressing environmental concerns, such as climate change. And over the past eight years, many career employees and rank-and-file scientists have clashed with Bush appointees over a number of those of issues, including whether the federal government should allow California to regulate tailpipe emissions from automobiles and how best to prevent imperiled species from disappearing altogether. LiNeBrEaKIn June 2007, Mr. Obama told reporters in Reno, Nev., that he would not hesitate to reverse many of the environmental policies Mr. Bush has enacted by executive order.LiNeBrEaK"I think the slow chipping away against clean air and clean water has been deeply disturbing," Mr. Obama added. "Much of it hasn't gone through Congress. It was done by fiat. That is something that can be changed by an administration, in part by reinvigorating the EPA, which has been demoralized."LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming policies are expected to mark one of the sharpest breaks between the Obama and the Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKEPA Administrator Stephen Johnson overruled his career advisers in deciding to deny California authority to control tailpipe emissions and rejecting their conclusion that global warming poses a threat to public welfare, and Mr. Obama is likely to reverse both of those policies shortly after taking office. This month, the president-elect told delegates to the Governors' Global Climate Summit that he would push for a federal cap-and-trade system designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and then to cut them an additional 80 percent by 2050, targets Mr. Bush has never embraced.LiNeBrEaK"Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response," Mr. Obama said in a videotaped message. "The stakes are too high, the consequences too serious."LiNeBrEaKJamie Rappaport Clark, executive vice president of the advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife, said that together, the two agencies will help shape the government's response to climate change.LiNeBrEaKMr. Clark, who headed the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Bill Clinton, is not a formal Obama adviser, but many of her former Clinton colleagues are helping the transition team, including David Hayes, a partner at Latham and Watkins; John Leshy, a professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law; and Robert Sussman, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.LiNeBrEaK"EPA will play the lead role in crafting a regulatory response," Mr. Clark said. "Interior has a huge role to play in adaptation" -- the effort to cope with climate changes that are already happening, such as drought and more frequent wildfires.LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said Wednesday that the agency is focused on finalizing policies on coal-fired power plants and other matters, but he would not speculate on the task the next administration faces.LiNeBrEaKWith escalating responsibilities, both agencies will need more resources after years when their budgets shrank, relatively speaking. The EPA received $7. 5 billion from Congress in 2008, down from $7. 8 billion in 2001. Interior has fared slightly better, getting $11. 1 billion compared with $10. 4 billion in 2001, but that represents more than a 10 percent cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) LiNeBrEaKCensus Bureau; National Center for Health Statistics; Bureau of Justice Statistics	November 29, 2008 Saturday   Final Edition	Election glow hides disparities;  Despite Obama's win, racial divisions within U.S. persist 		GENERAL; Pg. A-6  	1173 words  	The day after Barack Obama was elected president, Kari Fulton heard a white colleague proclaim that racism in America is dead.LiNeBrEaK She cringed, worrying it might be a sign of flagging interest in the fight against discrimination.LiNeBrEaK "In reality, racism is still very much alive and well," said Fulton, who graduated last year from Howard University, a historically black college in the nation's capital.LiNeBrEaK Obama's election has generated a euphoria among black Americans. For some, the weight of history finally has been eased after generations of struggling for equality.LiNeBrEaK But amid the postelection glow of racial harmony lurks a sobering fact: Racial disparities persist - in just about every measurable form - and they won't simply melt away because the nation has a black president. LiNeBrEaK Fulton, 23, was part of a group of young black activists from across the country who worked to register and turn out young black voters in the presidential election. The National Coalition on Black Civic Participation brought the group together shortly after the election to learn about converting their enthusiasm into ongoing political activism.LiNeBrEaK "Election Day was just the beginning," said Fulton, who lives in Washington and works as an organizer for the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative. "People don't expect President Obama to be a superhero. We have to solve our own problems."LiNeBrEaK Shawn O. Utsey, chairman of the Department of African American Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, said most Americans would like to move beyond the racism that has defined the country but that more work needs to be done.LiNeBrEaK He's concerned that in the minds of white America, Obama's election allows the country to move beyond the racial division without that work.LiNeBrEaK "It's always been my position this election will probably do more psychologically for white America than for black America," he said.LiNeBrEaK "We've not really dealt with our mistrust, but we've tried to have a truce most of the time," he said. "Obama speaks, in the minds of many, to cementing that truce without having to do that work. Without having to confront our demons, if you will."LiNeBrEaK The problems confronting Americans are significant.LiNeBrEaK About one-quarter of black Americans live in poverty - nearly three times the rate for whites - at a time when rising budget deficits and expensive corporate bailouts are going to leave little federal money for anti-poverty programs. The federal budget deficit is likely to hit a record $1 trillion next year.LiNeBrEaK Black adults are less likely than whites to have college degrees or health insurance and more likely to be in prison. Homicide is the leading cause of death among black males ages 15 to 34 - and it has been for years.LiNeBrEaK Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, knows the numbers well. Each year, the civil rights group publishes a book called "The State of Black America," which has chapters of data on disparities between whites and blacks.LiNeBrEaK "A mere election does not change the abject conditions for African-Americans or the 230-plus years of racial injustice," he said.LiNeBrEaK The foreword of the 2007 edition of the book was written by Obama, then the junior senator from Illinois.LiNeBrEaK "This sad story is a stark reminder that the long march toward true and meaningful equality in America isn't over," Obama wrote. "We have a long way to go."LiNeBrEaK In his election-night victory speech, Obama talked about the historic nature of his election. But he had spent much of the campaign soft-pedaling race; he acknowledged its role in society when asked, but he rarely brought it up on his own.LiNeBrEaK Nevertheless, many black Americans, who voted more than 9-to-1 for Obama, have embraced his victory as their own.LiNeBrEaK Utsey considers Obama's election a symbolic victory that suggests the burden of race has been weakened to some degree. But the disparities will continue.LiNeBrEaK "For some folks, the only positive is they can be proud that someone who perhaps looks like them can achieve the highest office in the land. In terms of how that translates to change in their every day life, that may not be coming."LiNeBrEaK The Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., president and CEO of the Hip Hop Caucus, compared Obama's election to Jackie Robinson breaking the Major League Baseball color barrier in 1947.LiNeBrEaK Robinson, who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers, was subjected to racial slurs and taunts at ballparks across the nation. It took years for other teams to integrate and even longer for them to hire black coaches and managers.LiNeBrEaK "When he broke the color barrier, what happened?" asked Yearwood, whose Washington-based organization promotes political activism. "The problems were still there, but it began to create changes."LiNeBrEaK Yearwood said Obama's election inspired a lot of young blacks to vote and get involved in the campaign. He now is encouraging young activists to use the same enthusiasm to lobby the government for more jobs in poor neighborhoods and better health care for those who can't afford it.LiNeBrEaK "People in the 'hood want to be involved in politics. They want to know what a filibuster is," he said, referring to a procedure used in the Senate to block votes on legislation, even when it is supported by a slim majority.LiNeBrEaK Utsey said he sees that there's much hope that comes with Obama's presidency.LiNeBrEaK "I think this is what the country needed to reshape our thinking about how the world is."LiNeBrEaK What the gap looks likeLiNeBrEaKDespite political, social and economic advances by black Americans, racial disparities between blacks and whites persist in just about every measurable form:LiNeBrEaKIncome: A typical black household makes 62 percent of the income of a typical white household - a gap that has changed little in 30 years. In 2007, the median household income was $33,900 for black households and $54,900 for white households.LiNeBrEaKPoverty: Blacks are nearly three times as likely as whites to live in poverty. In 2007, 24. 4 percent of blacks had incomes below the poverty line, compared with 8. 2 percent of whites.LiNeBrEaKLife expectancy: Among blacks it is, on average, about five years shorter than for whites. In 2005, life expectancy at birth was 76. 5 years for black women and 80. 8 years for white women. Life expectancy was 69. 5 years for black men and 75. 7 years for white men.LiNeBrEaKEducation: Whites are more likely to have college degrees than blacks. In 2007, 31. 8 percent of whites 25 and older had college degrees, compared with 18. 5 percent of blacks.LiNeBrEaKIncarceration: Blacks are more likely than whites to be sentenced to prison, though incarceration rates for blacks have dropped in recent years even as they increased for whites. In 2006, black men had an incarceration rate of 3,042 per 100,000 residents, compared with a rate of 487 for white men.LiNeBrEaKHealth insurance: Blacks are less likely to have insurance than whites. In 2007, 19. 2 percent of blacks did not have health insurance, compared with 10. 4 percent of whites.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Olympia Meola contributed to this report.

It would be one thing to forgive their history, but the Big Three's offenses continue. Along with other automakers, they are suing to keep California, Washington and more than a dozen other states from imposing controls on cars' greenhouse-gas emissions.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	November 29, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Oil Plays A Cheap Trick  	KEVIN WIATROWSKI, kwiatrowski@tampatrib.com  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 11  	950 words  	Biodiesel producers made a decent profit until diesel prices fell like a stone.LiNeBrEaKBy KEVIN WIATROWSKILiNeBrEaKkwiatrowski@tampatrib.comLiNeBrEaKDADE CITY - In a corner of what was once an orange juice plant, dozens of towering stainless steel tanks have found a new purpose: storing the raw materials and finished product of Florida's largest biodiesel factory.LiNeBrEaKSince it opened last fall, Pensacola-based Agri-Source Fuels has turned rendered chicken fat - the castoff of poultry processors across the Southeast - into a fuel that supporters hope will help wean the United States off foreign oil. LiNeBrEaKThose hopes rose with the price of oil earlier this year. During the summer, when diesel prices in the Tampa Bay area averaged nearly $5 a gallon, Agri-Source cranked out about 3 million gallons of the tea-colored, low-pollution fuel. A Georgia-based oil company blended Agri-Source's product with petroleum diesel to make B20 - a fuel that's 20 percent biodiesel - and sold it to bulk users.LiNeBrEaKAt the time, producers said they were limited only by how much $3-a-gallon chicken fat they could truck into the plant.LiNeBrEaKAgri-Source's investment earned it an Industry of the Year award from the Pasco Economic Development Council. Two months later, though, Agri-Source has slashed its production by half as plummeting oil prices and its fixed cost for raw materials have turned the company's bottom line from black to red.LiNeBrEaK"The profitability has really weakened," said Agri-Source president Rick Higdon. "We have the ability to ride it out, but it's no fun."LiNeBrEaKSuch is the state of biodiesel these days.LiNeBrEaKBiodiesel is part of an array of alternate energy sources environmentalists and others see as a way to curb global climate change and reduce the country's dependence on the Middle East and other oil-rich global hot spots. But high production costs and low commercial demand have become hurdles to making the fuels a viable alternative to oil. Manufacturers hope federal subsidies and mandates will bolster the industry in the coming years.LiNeBrEaKIn the overall mix of the U.S. fuel supply, however, , biodiesel has struggled to make headway compared with ethanol, which is made from crops, such as corn. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report, biodiesel production was about 7 percent of ethanol levels in 2007.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, biodiesel has won support from federal and state legislators in recent years. A federal $1-per-gallon tax credit was renewed last year to support biodiesel production. The same legislation sets a goal of blending 1 billion gallons of biodiesel into the nation's fuel supply by 2012. So far, the entire industry produces about 600 million gallons, according to the National Biodiesel Board.LiNeBrEaKThe competition for raw materials has become a major factor in the success or failure of biodiesel operations. The biodiesel industry used only 4 percent of the 173 million pounds of animal fats and greases produced in 2007; the rest went to other uses, from road paving to cosmetics.LiNeBrEaKThe key to the industry's future will be developing new sources of raw materials, said Robert McCormick, principle engineer in the fuel performance group at the National Renewable Fuels Laboratory in Colorado.LiNeBrEaK"If you could sell B20 for a nickel or 3 cents less than petroleum diesel, you could probably sell all you could make," McCormick said. "They haven't been able to do that."LiNeBrEaKThe escalating price of soybeans forced the owner of a Lakeland biodiesel plant to stop production last year. The factory has spent this year processing glycerin - a biodiesel byproduct - and retooling to use other raw materials, said John Kellogg, spokesman for plant owner World Energy Alternatives.LiNeBrEaK"Right now, [biodiesel] is not as competitive with petroleum because the cost of production is high," Kellogg said. "Even with that tax credit, it's challenging for people to produce biodiesel at a profit now."LiNeBrEaKKellogg and other biodiesel makers are pinning their hopes on last year's federal Energy and Security Act, which mandates that oil refineries mix an increasing amount of renewable fuels into the national supply in the coming years. The plan aims to reduce pollution and the amount of oil the United States imports.LiNeBrEaKThe mandate kicks in next year at 500 million gallons.LiNeBrEaK"It'll create a floor under the market that will support it going into next year," Kellogg said.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping a customer base is another issue. Even when a substantial customer, such as the state of Florida, comes along, a host of practical considerations can complicate matters.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Gov. Charlie Crist signed an executive order mandating the use of biodiesel and ethanol, whenever possible.LiNeBrEaKState officials say they use as much biodiesel as they can - mostly at the state's 46 fuel depots, which primarily supply Department of Transportation machinery. Those depots dispense B20 and E10, which is 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol and also available at commercial stations.LiNeBrEaKThe DOT used slightly more than 500,000 gallons of biodiesel in the first 10 months of 2008. Nearly half of that went into vehicles in DOT District 2, which encompasses Gainesville, Jacksonville and the rest of northeast Florida. Tampa-based District 7 used 17,137 gallons, starting in August.LiNeBrEaKMost state vehicles use gasoline, though - not diesel - and those are fueled at commercial stations, most of which don't carry biodiesel.LiNeBrEaKNationwide, 166 gas stations carry biodiesel, according to analysts with GasBuddy.com. Only three of those are in Florida.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	November 29, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Stiffer Emission Rules Proposed  	LINDSAY PETERSON, lpeterson@tampatrib.com  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 11  	659 words  	The auto industry opposes governor's proposal to adopt California's strict standards.LiNeBrEaKBy LINDSAY PETERSONLiNeBrEaKlpeterson@tampatrib.comLiNeBrEaKState officials return to the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission next week to argue that Florida should adopt California's tough emission standards for cars and light trucks.LiNeBrEaKIt's the first major test of Gov. Charlie Crist's multipronged effort to cut greenhouses gases across the state. The commission planned to vote at its meeting in October, but delayed the vote to gather more information. LiNeBrEaKUnder pressure from industry lobbyists, three of the seven commissioners are leaning against the change, three are leaning toward it and one is undecided, said Eric Draper of Audubon of Florida.LiNeBrEaKIf the measure passes at the next commission meeting in Tallahassee on Tuesday, it will also have to be approved by the state Legislature.LiNeBrEaKThe standards would allow the statewide sale of only vehicles that meet designated levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Those levels are 20 percent to 30 percent lower than current emissions from many vehicles, although many others, including Hondas and Toyotas, already meet the standard.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists say the rules would increase vehicle prices and make certain models of light trucks hard to find in Florida.LiNeBrEaKState Department of Environmental Protection officials counter that the rules would also increase fuel efficiency and the gas savings would more than make up for the price increases. Also, they say, the emissions are measured on a fleetwide average for the state. So if one type of car is over the limit, the excess could be offset by lower emissions in another type.LiNeBrEaK"The rule is extremely flexible," said Greg DeAngelo, state DEP project engineer. "It allows lots of ways [for manufacturers] to comply. In 2013, for example, if they have a debit, they have five years to make that up, so we wouldn't be looking at any penalties until 2018 or '19."LiNeBrEaKThese standards are important for Florida, DeAngelo said. Cars and trucks are responsible for more than one-fourth of the greenhouse gases created statewide.LiNeBrEaKFlorida is also at risk to the effect of greenhouse gases and global warming, Draper said. "With low coastlines, it's highly at risk. That is the reason Crist has advanced this idea."LiNeBrEaK"Florida is ground zero for global warming," said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America, which is helping with the lobbying effort in favor of the new standards. "We think Florida should be taking a lead on this."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to Florida, 14 other states have proposed adopting California's emissions standards. The proposals have not gone into effect because after California adopted its rules in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency under the Bush administration denied its request to diverge from federal fuel efficiency requirements. Draper said the Obama administration is expected to grant that waiver.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists fighting the change argue that it's confusing for states to have different vehicle efficiency rules from the federal government. They had asked the environmental commission to postpone its vote in October because they are expecting new, tighter rules from the Bush administration. As of Wednesday, no announcement was made.LiNeBrEaK"The federal standard would bring Florida the same emissions benefits without having to give up its authority to California," said Charles Territo, with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.LiNeBrEaKDraper said that over time, the federal standards won't limit greenhouse gases as much as California's will. The more important question, Cooper said, is whether Florida should adopt the standards it wants "versus letting the feds do it. ... You can't trust the feds to protect the environment."LiNeBrEaKIf adopted in 2009, the rules will apply to cars produced in 2011.

Those levels are 20 percent to 30 percent lower than current emissions from many vehicles, although many others, including Hondas and Toyotas, already meet the standard.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists say the rules would increase vehicle prices and make certain models of light trucks hard to find in Florida.LiNeBrEaKState Department of Environmental Protection officials counter that the rules would also increase fuel efficiency and the gas savings would more than make up for the price increases. Also, they say, the emissions are measured on a fleetwide average for the state. So if one type of car is over the limit, the excess could be offset by lower emissions in another type.LiNeBrEaK"The rule is extremely flexible," said Greg DeAngelo, state DEP project engineer. "It allows lots of ways for manufacturers to comply. In 2013, for example, if they have a debit, they have five years to make that up, so we wouldn't be looking at any penalties until 2018 or '19."LiNeBrEaKThese standards are important for Florida, DeAngelo said. Cars and trucks are responsible for more than one-fourth of the greenhouse gases created statewide.LiNeBrEaKFlorida is also at risk to the effect of greenhouse gases and global warming, Draper said. "With low coastlines, it's highly at risk. That is the reason Crist has advanced this idea."LiNeBrEaK"Florida is ground zero for global warming," said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America, which is helping with the lobbying effort in favor of the new standards. "We think Florida should be taking a lead on this."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to Florida, 14 other states have proposed adopting California's emissions standards. The proposals have not gone into effect because after California adopted its rules in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency under the Bush administration denied its request to diverge from federal fuel efficiency requirements. Draper said the Obama administration is expected to grant that waiver.LiNeBrEaKIndustry lobbyists fighting the change argue that it's confusing for states to have different vehicle efficiency rules from the federal government. They had asked the environmental commission to postpone its vote in October because they are expecting new, tighter rules from the Bush administration. As of Wednesday, no announcement was made.LiNeBrEaK"The federal standard would bring Florida the same emissions benefits without having to give up its authority to California," said Charles Territo, with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.LiNeBrEaKDraper said that over time, the federal standards won't limit greenhouse gases as much as California's will. The more important question, Cooper said, is whether Florida should adopt the standards it wants "versus letting the feds do it. ... You can't trust the feds to protect the environment."LiNeBrEaKIf adopted in 2009, the rules will apply to cars produced in 2011.

Tampa Tribune (Florida)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	Oil Plays A Cheap Trick On Biofuel Plans  	Kevin Wiatrowski, Tampa Tribune, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	968 words  	Nov. 29--DADE CITY -- In a corner of what was once an orange juice plant, dozens of towering stainless steel tanks have found a new purpose: storing the raw materials and finished product of Florida's largest biodiesel factory.LiNeBrEaKSince it opened last fall, Pensacola-based Agri-Source Fuels has turned rendered chicken fat -- the castoff of poultry processors across the Southeast -- into a fuel that supporters hope will help wean the United States off foreign oil. LiNeBrEaKThose hopes rose with the price of oil earlier this year. During the summer, when diesel prices in the Tampa Bay area averaged nearly $5 a gallon, Agri-Source cranked out about 3 million gallons of the tea-colored, low-pollution fuel. A Georgia-based oil company blended Agri-Source's product with petroleum diesel to make B20 -- a fuel that's 20 percent biodiesel -- and sold it to bulk users.LiNeBrEaKAt the time, producers said they were limited only by how much $3-a-gallon chicken fat they could truck into the plant.LiNeBrEaKAgri-Source's investment earned it an Industry of the Year award from the Pasco Economic Development Council. Two months later, though, Agri-Source has slashed its production by half as plummeting oil prices and its fixed cost for raw materials have turned the company's bottom line from black to red.LiNeBrEaK"The profitability has really weakened," said Agri-Source president Rick Higdon. "We have the ability to ride it out, but it's no fun."LiNeBrEaKSuch is the state of biodiesel these days.LiNeBrEaKBiodiesel is part of an array of alternate energy sources environmentalists and others see as a way to curb global climate change and reduce the country's dependence on the Middle East and other oil-rich global hot spots. But high production costs and low commercial demand have become hurdles to making the fuels a viable alternative to oil. Manufacturers hope federal subsidies and mandates will bolster the industry in the coming years.LiNeBrEaKIn the overall mix of the U.S. fuel supply, however, biodiesel has struggled to make headway compared with ethanol, which is made from crops, such as corn. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report, biodiesel production was about 7 percent of ethanol levels in 2007.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, biodiesel has won support from federal and state legislators in recent years. A federal $1-per-gallon tax credit was renewed last year to support biodiesel production. The same legislation sets a goal of blending 1 billion gallons of biodiesel into the nation's fuel supply by 2012. So far, the entire industry produces about 600 million gallons, according to the National Biodiesel Board.LiNeBrEaKThe competition for raw materials has become a major factor in the success or failure of biodiesel operations. The biodiesel industry used only 4 percent of the 173 million pounds of animal fats and greases produced in 2007; the rest went to other uses, from road paving to cosmetics.LiNeBrEaKThe key to the industry's future will be developing new sources of raw materials, said Robert McCormick, principle engineer in the fuel performance group at the National Renewable Fuels Laboratory in Colorado.LiNeBrEaK"If you could sell B20 for a nickel or 3 cents less than petroleum diesel, you could probably sell all you could make," McCormick said. "They haven't been able to do that."LiNeBrEaKThe escalating price of soybeans forced the owner of a Lakeland biodiesel plant to stop production last year. The factory has spent this year processing glycerin -- a biodiesel byproduct -- and retooling to use other raw materials, said John Kellogg, spokesman for plant owner World Energy Alternatives.LiNeBrEaK"Right now, biodiesel is not as competitive with petroleum because the cost of production is high," Kellogg said. "Even with that tax credit, it's challenging for people to produce biodiesel at a profit now."LiNeBrEaKKellogg and other biodiesel makers are pinning their hopes on last year's federal Energy and Security Act, which mandates that oil refineries mix an increasing amount of renewable fuels into the national supply in the coming years. The plan aims to reduce pollution and the amount of oil the United States imports.LiNeBrEaKThe mandate kicks in next year at 500 million gallons.LiNeBrEaK"It'll create a floor under the market that will support it going into next year," Kellogg said.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping a customer base is another issue. Even when a substantial customer, such as the state of Florida, comes along, a host of practical considerations can complicate matters.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Gov. Charlie Crist signed an executive order mandating the use of biodiesel and ethanol, whenever possible.LiNeBrEaKState officials say they use as much biodiesel as they can -- mostly at the state's 46 fuel depots, which primarily supply Department of Transportation machinery. Those depots dispense B20 and E10, which is 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol and also available at commercial stations.LiNeBrEaKThe DOT used slightly more than 500,000 gallons of biodiesel in the first 10 months of 2008. Nearly half of that went into vehicles in DOT District 2, which encompasses Gainesville, Jacksonville and the rest of northeast Florida. Tampa-based District 7 used 17,137 gallons, starting in August.LiNeBrEaKMost state vehicles use gasoline, though -- not diesel -- and those are fueled at commercial stations, most of which don't carry biodiesel.LiNeBrEaKNationwide, 166 gas stations carry biodiesel, according to analysts with GasBuddy.com. Only three of those are in Florida.

The Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	Builders opposing buffer regs: The proposal is to require at least 100-foot natural buffers on either side of waterways.  	Rory Sweeney, The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	584 words  	Nov. 29--"Beside every good stream," notes the Pennsylvania Campaign for Clean Water on its Web site, "is a good forest."LiNeBrEaKThe well-known adage regarding the importance of women in developing quality men was customized to support changing state regulations to require at least 100-foot natural buffers on either side of waterways.LiNeBrEaKThe Pennsylvania Builders Association adamantly opposes state-mandated buffers of any size, arguing they would strip power from local governments to regulate land use and from landowners to generate income from the land. LiNeBrEaK"I don't think there is anyone who is opposed to the goals enunciated by the Buffers 100 program," said Grant Gulibon, the association's regulatory specialist.LiNeBrEaK"We believe that the one-size-fits-all approach ... doesn't provide the flexibility that is needed on a given development site," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe program promotes buffers as a free way to clean water, mitigate flood damage, protect habitat and address climate change. It's found some support on the local level, campaign Chairman Bob Wendelgass noted, with several municipalities from around the state instituting buffer ordinances.LiNeBrEaK"What we learned in part is that unless everybody does it, you don't get the results you're looking for," said Wendelgass, who represents the national Clean Water Action group.LiNeBrEaKThe campaign wants to see the 100-year flood plain fully vegetated for every stream, or at least 100 feet on either side for all streams and 200 feet for the most important ones. The proposal exempts existing structures and properties where its majority would be within the buffer, Wendelgass said.LiNeBrEaKThe idea, which would affect Chapter 102 of the state code on erosion and sedimentation controls, has been well received in Harrisburg, he said.LiNeBrEaKAnchors weighing down projects are what the builders association doesn't want to see.LiNeBrEaK"It's not as if builders aren't already heavily regulated both in pre-construction and now in post-construction" with stormwater management and erosion and sediment control plans, Gulibon said. Buffers are "a portion of the person's property that's been taken from the landowner's benefit without compensation," he said.LiNeBrEaKTrapped in the middle are land-use consultants like Ken Klemow, a Wilkes University biology professor.LiNeBrEaKHe believes both sides should be cooperating instead of drawing battle lines.LiNeBrEaKThe buffer would be about the length of a football field with the waterway substituting for the mid-field line, Klemow said.LiNeBrEaK"It seems like overkill," he said, adding he would support a 50-foot buffer that can be reduced if it's proven a lesser buffer would maintain water quality.LiNeBrEaKIt's unlikely either side would support Klemow's compromise, however.LiNeBrEaKWendelgass said several scientific studies have shown the benefits drop so significantly for buffers under 100 feet that it's not really worth the effort.LiNeBrEaKGulibon said land use should remain exclusively a local decision and greater emphasis should be put on agriculture, where it's cheaper to rectify water-pollution sources.LiNeBrEaKRory Sweeney, a Times Leader staff writer, may be reached at 970-7418.

The Wisconsin State Journal  	November 29, 2008 Saturday 	Is state of Wisconsin's energy conservation spending paying off?  	Jason Stein, The Wisconsin State Journal  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	928 words  	Nov. 29--When night falls on the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Chamberlin Hall, administrators can't save energy by turning off the air units that heat, cool and ventilate the building -- they're afraid the aging units might not reliably switch back on in the morning.LiNeBrEaKBut a project now in planning will replace those units with more efficient models that will help cut energy use in the physics department hall by an estimated 67 percent -- saving a projected $900,000 a year in a single building. LiNeBrEaKIn the face of tight budgets and rising energy costs, the state is spending borrowed money now to seek long-term savings on gas and electricity used by its vast system of buildings around Wisconsin.LiNeBrEaKFor three years, the state has been working toward a target set by Gov. Jim Doyle to use 10 percent less energy per square foot in major state buildings. That effort has saved roughly $23 million over two years, state officials said.LiNeBrEaKBut the state has apparently not tracked how much it has spent on those efforts across all agencies, making it impossible to calculate whether taxpayers are getting their money's worth. Asked about that last week, a state administrator told the Wisconsin State Journal that the state would start tracking such costs.LiNeBrEaK"This has been a lesson in making sure we can get a decent 'return on investment' number in the future," said state facilities administrator David Helbach, who was hired in October 2007 -- midway through the energy effort. "Till this point (state employees) have focused almost entirely on energy savings only."LiNeBrEaKThe state's response to higher energy costs and climate change drew praise from an environmental advocate who urged even bolder steps. But one skeptic said the state must also do more to prove the big sums being spent on energy conservation are actually paying off.LiNeBrEaKThe state budget approved last year called for $30 million in borrowing over 10 years -- at what is now 4. 3 percent interest a year -- for projects that would be paid off within 10 years through savings in energy use, Helbach said.LiNeBrEaKOn the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus, the state is planning and designing more than $18 million in projects that officials estimate will save $3. 6 million a year through more efficient air conditioning, fluorescent light bulbs and other upgrades.LiNeBrEaKThe UW-Madison projects include $3. 7 million in improvements at Chamberlin Hall. In addition to the new air units, the projects include upgrading 1,000 light fixtures and installing 250 sensors that will turn lights off when rooms are not in use, said Faramarz Vakili, associate director of the UW-Madison physical plant department and program director of the campus We Conserve campaign.LiNeBrEaKAt the Walnut Street heating plant, an estimated $6. 8 million will be spent on work that includes replacing a steam-driven, 3,500-ton machine used to chill water to cool campus buildings with an even larger and more efficient electric model.LiNeBrEaKVakili said the university was on track to meet its "very aggressive" goal of cutting energy use by 20 percent per square foot by 2010. "We've been working really hard on this," he said.LiNeBrEaKDan Kohler, director of the advocacy group Wisconsin Environment, said the projects were a "step in the right direction." He said the state should seek to move even faster toward having campus buildings powered by solar panels, small wind turbines and geothermal energy.LiNeBrEaK"It's making a dent and it's important but it's not the transformative change that we should be striving for," Kohler said of the efforts to date.LiNeBrEaKThe state also is now buying 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources like wind turbines. That initiative, announced in July, will cost $900,000 more in its first year but is expected to save money over time as conventional energy prices rise, Helbach said.LiNeBrEaKSen. Rob Cowles, R-Green Bay, who helped craft the legislation that called for the renewable energy purchase, said the conservation programs are worthy efforts.LiNeBrEaKBut Cowles said that he was concerned that the state was borrowing money to carry out the latest $30 million in energy efficiency projects rather than paying cash. Cowles, a member of the Legislature's audit committee, also said he thought more independent oversight of initial spending and later savings from these efforts was needed to ensure investments are paying off.LiNeBrEaK"With the kind of (difficult) fiscal situation we're in, I think we've got to take that extra effort to justify not just this expenditure but every expenditure," Cowles said.LiNeBrEaKHelbach said the state's progress in reaching the 10 percent cut in energy use will be verified in the coming months by the Energy Center of Wisconsin, a private nonprofit. He said it was sometimes difficult to measure energy savings from a specific project, since many state buildings are heated and cooled by a single plant and those buildings may not have separate meters to track their individual energy use.LiNeBrEaKVakili said the university would install more individual meters to track the results of its projects and said he believed the university's detailed estimates would turn out to be "within 5 percent of reality."

The Daily Telegram (Superior, Wisconsin)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Explorer visits Four Corners  	Maria Lockwood, The Daily Telegram, Superior, Wis.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	559 words  	Nov. 28--Lonnie Dupre's pictures of seals, polar bears and sled dogs caught the imagination and interest of students at Four Corners school Monday.LiNeBrEaK"I liked the seal," said Savanna Williams, a fourth-grader from Lake Superior school who attended the program. "I didn't know seals lived in the North Pole."LiNeBrEaKBut students from both schools picked up on the importance of the work done by the explorer, who has traveled more than 14,000 miles through polar regions by dog team, ski and kayak in the past 20 years. LiNeBrEaK"I've always liked exploring things," said Dupre. "Especially in winter when the swamps and lakes froze over.LiNeBrEaK"It's kind of hard work but it's fun."LiNeBrEaKAlthough modern technology keeps today's explorers in touch with the rest of the world, in the end they have to rely on themselves and the lightweight, sturdy equipment they pack.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked by one students if he ever got "to his wit's end," Dupre said he had.LiNeBrEaK"I remember I got angry once because we ran out of coffee," the explorer said. He was grumpy for quite some time.LiNeBrEaKDupre and Australian John Hoelscher became the first to circumnavigate Greenland's 6,500 miles of coastline in 2001.LiNeBrEaKFifth graders from Four Corners school were impressed by Dupre's dedication. He braved winds of more than 100 mph, temperatures of less than minus 70 degrees and ice-crusted water.LiNeBrEaKJace Nindorf wondered how Dupre could survive such cold weather for such a long time.LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, Dupre and Eric Larsen completed the first summer expedition to the North Pole pulling and paddling 300-pound modified canoe/sleds over 600 miles of shifting sea ice.LiNeBrEaK"He had to pull the canoe," said fifth grader Bailey LaVallee. "He had to pull it the whole way."LiNeBrEaK"We felt like two little ants trying to cross a plowed field," Dupre told the students. "Every mile forward, we had to travel three (miles)."LiNeBrEaKFifth grader Brett Austin was surprised to see video of Dupre swimming through arctic water.LiNeBrEaK"Those suits he went swimming in would keep you drive for 45 minutes," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe 2006 expedition focused attention on global warming.LiNeBrEaK"My favorite thing was when he was talking about how everything changed, how everything started to melt," said Harrison Doane.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he knew global warming was affecting the climate and shrinking polar ice, the fifth grader said, "I didn't know it was doing it so fast."LiNeBrEaKMany scientists believe the northern polar ice cap will melt away in seven years, Dupre told the students, which would greatly effect the world climate and shrink the habitat of animals like polar bears.LiNeBrEaKHe offered tips kids could use to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Use less hot water; ride your bike more," Dupre said. "Just remember when leaving a room or the house, turn the lights off."LiNeBrEaK"Probably the best thing that happened for the environment is $5 gas," Dupre said.LiNeBrEaKThe Minnesota man is gearing up for another expedition.

The Denver Post 	November 28, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Letters To The Editor  		Pg. B-11  	684 words  	Investing in clean energy can help provide jobsLiNeBrEaKWith the economy crumbling, investments in clean energy and public transit can provide the structure and jobs we need to repower America.LiNeBrEaKIn our otherwise dismal economy, wind, solar and other clean energy industries have created well-paying, local jobs. To turn our current trickle of new jobs into a torrent of new economic opportunities, we need to act boldly - and fast. In rebuilding our economy, Congress should take advantage of the opportunity to begin the shift from a pollution-based economy to a 100 percent clean, new energy economy. According to the Center for American Progress, a nationwide investment of $100 billion in wind, solar, energy efficiency and public transit could create nearly 33,000 green jobs here in Colorado in two years.LiNeBrEaKOur new president and Congress have the chance to boost our economy with green jobs, make our nation more energy secure, and reduce global warming pollution. I am pleased with President-elect Barack Obama's focus on clean energy as a cornerstone of any economic recovery plan. LiNeBrEaKErin Coffman, DenverLiNeBrEaKThe writer is an environmental associate for Environment Colorado.LiNeBrEaKObama should let the private sector create jobsLiNeBrEaKRe: "Obama banks on job creation," Nov. 23 news story.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's plan is nothing new, just a revision of the New Deal projects of the 1930s, which failed. Understand this: These will be government subsidies - taxpayer-funded job creations.LiNeBrEaKWhere is the money coming from? We are already in deficit spending up to our necks. The only answer: Obama will raise taxes, the total opposite of what is needed in a recession.LiNeBrEaKWe should be lowering capital gains taxes and corporate taxes (which are the second-highest in the world) and let the private sector create lasting jobs. Investment capital will pour in.LiNeBrEaKPeter Bruno, Wheat RidgeLiNeBrEaKOil and gas industry shaking in its bootsLiNeBrEaKRe: "State's oil and gas firms cut back not long after scrambling to fill jobs," Nov. 25 business news story.LiNeBrEaKYour article reminded me that the end of an era is coming in America. The dangers of climate change are present in the minds of Americans, and now is the time to stop relying on archaic forms of energy and invest in a new clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaKClean energy and green jobs must be a priority in the next administration. Investing in renewable energy will help the economy by creating new green jobs and spurring innovation. While oil and gas companies shed jobs, we are seeing renewable energy industries flourish in Colorado.LiNeBrEaKOil and gas companies are shaking in their boots because they see how America is ready for a new direction, one that will help our economy and curb the effects of climate change.LiNeBrEaKEleanor Fort, DenverLiNeBrEaKHealth insurance isLiNeBrEaKsupposed to help usLiNeBrEaKRe: "Deductibles take bigger bite; $1,000 now a typical level in employees' health plans, double last year's median," Nov. 20 business news story.LiNeBrEaKYour article interests me because I am an insurance broker with some years in the health insurance business. I recently received a renewal for a small-group deductible - $1,000 in-network, $2,000 out-of-network - and the increase was 21. 58 percent. Why was this? One person had necessary surgery in 2008, plus related office visits and prescriptions in 2007 and 2008. This group is now rated substandard. Colorado allows insurers to rate even small groups on their experience, instead of pooling group claims, and this may be on top of already high renewals for some groups.LiNeBrEaKThere was a time when insurers considered claims of employee groups smaller than 100 to be not believable statistically, but not now, not in Colorado. It appears Colorado allows insurers to ignore the law of large numbers - i.e., write enough policies, and claims will average out favorably - and allows punishment of groups with claims.LiNeBrEaKI thought the purpose of health insurance was to help people with health care. Employers cope with high premiums and employees cope with high deductibles and neither is easy today.LiNeBrEaKRobert Gunnett, Morrison	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); WIND ENERGY (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); JOB CREATION (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (89%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (89%); BANKING and FINANCE (79%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); RECESSION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (78%); TAX LAW (76%); TAX INCREASES (73%); LAYOFFS (73%); PUBLIC FINANCE (72%); CLIMATE CHANGE (72%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS and SUBSIDIES (72%); TAXES and TAXATION (72%); AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); CAPITAL GAINS TAX (64%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  					BARACK OBAMA (95%); MICHAEL MCMAHON (83%)  	DENVER, CO, USA (79%) COLORADO, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  							Letter  									
Fort Worth Star-Telegram (Texas)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	What Wade Phillips said ... What Wade Phillips could have said  	David Thomas, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Texas  	SPORTS  	505 words  	Nov. 28--What Dallas Cowboys coach Wade Phillips had to say after the Cowboys' 34-9 win over the Seattle Seahawks, plus what he could have said:LiNeBrEaKGreeting the media:LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade said: "Happy Thanksgiving to everybody, first."LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade could have said: "Would you like to see my turkey dance before I start answering questions? The players have been working on it with me." LiNeBrEaKOn holding the Seahawks to three field goals:LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade said: "Red zone, we're getting better and better [defensively], obviously. It seems like when we get our back to the wall a little bit, we get after them."LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade could have said: "Now if we can just find a way to keep from letting teams get into our red zone. We're through playing the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks. We're about to start playing some good offensive teams that could knock us through that wall."LiNeBrEaKOn how the Cowboys' outlook has changed over the past three weeks:LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade said: "You can see how the climate can change quickly in this league. You've got to do what you need to do."LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade could have said: "And going up to Pittsburgh next week, the climate could really change in a big hurry. What I'm going to need to do is pack some warm clothes."LiNeBrEaKMeandering a little after being asked about the play of linebacker DeMarcus Ware:LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade said: "We stuffed the running game really well, which I think made them one-dimensional early in the game. You could tell they couldn't run the football on us."LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade could have said: "And you could tell why we started Marion Barber over Julius Jones in that playoff game last year."LiNeBrEaKWhen asked if the three-game winning streak is simply a matter of Tony Romo returning or whether there is a deeper reason:LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade said: "Well, yeah, winning the games, certainly. I think our defense is playing better. I've said it before. When we went through that down streak, I thought our defense had more mental toughness. You hate to lose, but I think it made them tougher. They had to play their game and not let the other team score and those kind of things. I think they learned something from that. I feel good about that."LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade could have said: "I know I was brought here to fix the defense and I really like answering questions about the defense after we win, but the answer to your question is, 'Of course.'"LiNeBrEaKOn the Cowboys not having had a winning record in December-January regular-season games since 1996:LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade said: "I think you can pull stats from anywhere and say this happened to this team. This is a different team in a different year."LiNeBrEaKWhat Wade could have said: "But the same general manager."

Jordan Times (Amman)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Aqaba power station to reduce 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases annually  	Hana Namrouqa, Jordan Times, Amman  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	452 words  	Nov. 28--AMMAN -- The Aqaba Thermal Power Station is the first Jordanian venture registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project, it was announced on Thursday. LiNeBrEaKThe plant is expected to reduce 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases annually by switching from fuel to natural gas.LiNeBrEaK"Although Jordan doesn't contribute much to the emission of greenhouse gases, it is directly impacted by climate change," Environment Minister Khalid Irani said on Thursday in a statement delivered on his behalf by the ministry's secretary general, Fares Juneidi.LiNeBrEaKClimate change is a concept referring to the variation in the Earth's global climate or in regional climates over time. It describes changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over timescales ranging from decades to millions of years.LiNeBrEaKSo far, climate change has caused a 30 per cent reduction in the country's surface water resources, as well as a decrease in the volume of rainfall and agricultural production, both of which the country and the Arab world heavily rely on.LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol allows a country with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment to implement emission-reduction projects in developing countries.LiNeBrEaKJordan has approved five programmes as part of the CDM to contribute to the reduction of around 3. 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually and generate 100 million euros over the next five years.LiNeBrEaK"Work is currently under way to register these projects under the CDM... the ventures, which will help reduce greenhouse emissions, are in different sectors, including power generation, treatment of solid and liquid waste and other industries," Irani said.LiNeBrEaKThe ministry recently finalised a draft report that identified the amount and sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.LiNeBrEaK"Based on this report, the ministry will set up new projects in cooperation with related authorities to reduce more emission of greenhouse gases, blamed for causing climate change," the minister added in his statement.LiNeBrEaKIn 1992, Jordan, along with 189 other countries, became party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which seeks to come up with plans to reduce global warming and cope with whatever temperature increases are inevitable.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Salmon-tracking network challenges conventional wisdom  	By Les Blumenthal, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1261 words  	WASHINGTON _ They were two of the 1,000 juvenile salmon implanted with almond-sized transmitters as they headed out of the Rocky Mountains, down the Snake River bound for the sea.LiNeBrEaKTheir remarkable three-month, 1,500-mile journey of survival to the Gulf of Alaska was tracked by an underwater acoustic listening network that has wired the West Coast from just north of San Francisco to southeastern Alaska. The tracking network could provide a model for a global system.LiNeBrEaKA salmon's life in the ocean has always been one of nature's best kept mysteries.LiNeBrEaKHowever, scientists using the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking network have made some startling discoveries that challenge long-held beliefs about salmon survival and raise new cautions about how global warming may affect salmon and other marine species. LiNeBrEaK"I hope it will be a revolution in the way we do marine science," said David Welch, the president of Kintama Research Corp. in Nanaimo, British Columbia, who was one of the founders of the tracking system. "I think we will make discoveries that are incredibly important and unexpected."LiNeBrEaKThe transmitters, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated, smaller and cheaper, have been implanted in a dozen species, including coho, sockeye and chinook salmon, along with green sturgeon, white sturgeon, sixgill shark, salmon shark, market squid, cutthroat trout, steelhead, dolly varden and black rockfish. Eventually, scientists think they'll be able to implant the transmitters in marine animals as big as whales and as small as herring.LiNeBrEaKSignals from the transmitters are picked up by nearly 300 receivers on the ocean floor as the fish swim by. The information is eventually retrieved from the listening devices by scientists who routinely visit the eight lines of acoustic receivers by ship. The receivers don't transmit the data by satellite.LiNeBrEaKListening lines are off Washington state's Willapa Bay, in the Strait of Juan de Fuca between Vancouver Island and Washington's Olympic Peninsula, in British Columbia's Strait of Georgia, Queen Charlotte Strait, Howe Sound and off the northern tip of Vancouver Island, along with Point Reyes, north of San Francisco, and Graves Harbor in southeastern Alaska.LiNeBrEaKTwo major Northwest rivers, the Columbia and Fraser, are also wired with receivers that can keep track of salmon movements from the river mouth to hundreds of miles inland.LiNeBrEaK"This is a revolution in being able to study marine animals that travel vast distances," said Fred Goetz, a fish biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who's been studying Puget Sound chinook, steelhead and bull trout. "This is a big breakthrough."LiNeBrEaKGoetz said an effort is under way to permanently establish an acoustic listening line in Puget Sound near Admiralty Inlet.LiNeBrEaKScientists are convinced the marine environment is changing because of global warming. However, no one yet understands how the changes are linked to such weather patterns as El Nino, La Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a shift in the weather that occurs every 20 to 30 years in the northern oceans.LiNeBrEaKTracking marine life could help document these shifts and the effects they are having on the oceans.LiNeBrEaK"Now we are getting virtually real-time information," said Jim Bolger, the executive director of the tracking network. "We are answering questions we couldn't before."LiNeBrEaKAmong the findings:LiNeBrEaK_Previously, it was thought that the highest mortality rates for salmon were in the freshwater streams and rivers as they headed to the saltwater ocean. But using the acoustic tracking system, researchers found that within the first few weeks of entering the ocean, 40 percent of the salmon died. Meanwhile, billions of dollars have been spent to increase in-river survival rates of salmon through projects such as habitat improvements in spawning areas and the modification of hydroelectric dams.LiNeBrEaK_A study by Welch, which has touched off a major scientific debate, found dams may have less of an impact on salmon survival rates than previously thought. The study found juvenile salmon from the Columbia River, with its string of massive hydroelectric dams, survived their downstream migration equally or better than those migrating downstream in the dam-free Fraser River in British Columbia. Some environmentalists have insisted the only way to restore the Columbia River runs is by breaching four dams on the lower Snake River, a major tributary of the Columbia.LiNeBrEaK_It's long been thought green sturgeon from the Sacramento and Klamath rivers in California migrated into the ocean but didn't go far. Now, using the acoustic tracking system, the green sturgeon have been found congregating off the north end of Vancouver Island at certain times of the year and then heading into the North Pacific. They've also been found in Puget Sound.LiNeBrEaK"We are taking a black box which is the ocean and trying to shed some light on it," said Jonathan Thar, the network's research coordinator.LiNeBrEaKThe tracking system has also helped researchers confirm the incredible speeds at which juvenile salmon can travel, said Cedar Chittenden, a doctoral student at the University of British Columbia.LiNeBrEaKJuvenile coho salmon, about 5 inches in length, can travel almost 20 miles a day in the ocean and nearly 40 miles in rivers, or about 200,000 body lengths a day, she said. An average-sized person swimming at the same rate would cover nearly 220 miles a day in the ocean and almost 435 miles in a river, Chittenden said.LiNeBrEaKUsing the tracking system, Chittenden said, researchers also found that wild juvenile salmon take less time to enter the ocean than hatchery fish, perhaps because the hatchery fish tend to be heavier and slower. And wild fish adapt faster to saltwater than hatchery ones.LiNeBrEaKThe tracking system may also help scientists determine whether salmon runs, because of rising ocean temperatures, may be relocating further north. Chittenden said there is some evidence thermal blocks, or areas of warm water, have hindered salmon as they seek to return to their home rivers to spawn, and instead the fish may head to different rivers.LiNeBrEaK"We can actually track individual fish," she said. "We couldn't do these things without POST," the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking network.LiNeBrEaKThe network, which has cost about $7 million, is run by a nonprofit organization hosted by the Vancouver Aquarium and funded by various foundations. It is also one of 14 field projects under the Census for Marine Life, a group of scientists and researchers from more than 60 universities and colleges around the world who are spending 10 years cataloging every marine species.LiNeBrEaKEventually, the Census for Marine Life hopes to establish a global Ocean Tracking Network, or OTN, that would cover 14 areas in the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Arctic oceans, along with the Mediterranean Sea.LiNeBrEaKEfforts to establish such networks are already under way in eastern Canada, South Africa and Australia. In Australia and South Africa, the networks could also be used to alert authorities when sharks are near swimming beaches.LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKTo see a video of how the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking system works: www.Postcom1.org	SCIENCE NEWS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); OCEANS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); BIOLOGY (89%); MARINE MAMMALS (77%); RIVERS (77%); OCEANOGRAPHY (77%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (75%); RESEARCH (75%); WEATHER (74%); ENGINEERING (70%); ARMIES (64%)  						SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (92%) WASHINGTON, USA (94%); ALASKA, USA (94%); PACIFIC OCEAN (93%); WEST USA (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); ROCKY MOUNTAINS (90%) UNITED STATES (94%); CANADA (78%)  	November 30, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	20081128-BC-ENV-SALMON-ADV30  	WA  	PHOTOS (from MCT Photo Service, 202-383-6099): ENV-SALMONLiNeBrEaKGRAPHIC (from MCT Graphics, 202-383-6064): 20081128 SALMON	WASHINGTON   											
Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Transy senior to join world environmental leaders in Poland  	Ryan Alessi, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	877 words  	Nov. 28--Next week, one of Kentucky's newest and most well-traveled young environmental activists will join world leaders and experts in Poznan, Poland, for the United Nations climate change conference.LiNeBrEaKMarcie Smith, a 21-year-old senior at Transylvania University, will lobby on behalf of the 20-something generation as part of a delegation from the grass-roots group SustainUS.LiNeBrEaKTheir goal: to share young peoples' perspectives as U.N. representatives draft the parameters of a global environmental treaty that will replace the Kyoto Protocol. A summit to agree to final terms of the agreement will be in Copenhagen next year. LiNeBrEaKBut during the Poznan conference between Dec. 1 and 12, world leaders will debate key topics, such as pollution controls and standards, that are aimed at curtailing climate change.LiNeBrEaKRight there with them will be Smith, whose area of interest is curbing deforestation.LiNeBrEaK"We want to see a treaty that is bold, that is courageous. It needs to be binding, and there needs to be accountability," Smith said. "And we want to see U.S. leadership, which has been lacking."LiNeBrEaKThe United States, for instance, did not agree to the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKTo describe Smith, who grew up in Richmond, as an advocacy-minded and active student is an understatement.LiNeBrEaKShe has founded a campus environmental group and has interned in Congress and for a think tank in The Hague, Netherlands. She has studied in Madagascar off the coast of Africa and hopes to spend next summer in France after graduating with a double major in international relations and French.LiNeBrEaKBut to call her a citizen of the world shortchanges her strong and deep Kentucky roots.LiNeBrEaK"I've just basically been given a very strong sense of family history and of place, and I can't divorce myself of that," said Smith, whose family dates back roughly two centuries in Kentucky.LiNeBrEaKSmith has a knack for balancing.LiNeBrEaKHer family and those she's worked with describe her as a rare blend of global ambition and parochial passion, theoretical "wonkishness" and practical application, and of realism and idealism.LiNeBrEaK"So many people in progressive politics are na&Atilde;&macr;ve optimists, na&Atilde;&macr;ve idealists. She is not. She really understands the constraints that doing good must confront," said Jeffrey Freyman, political science professor and Smith's adviser. "Despite being nobody's fool, she still is quite committed."LiNeBrEaKOne subject on which she remains passionate is Kentucky. And although her studies of natural resources, energy and the climate have taken her across the globe, they inevitably lead home.LiNeBrEaK"If you're looking at what region of the country is going to be laid at the altar of energy independence, it's going to be Appalachia," she said.LiNeBrEaKFinding a balance between coal mining and environmental protection is one of her interests.LiNeBrEaKThe oldest of three daughters of David and Dottie Smith, Marcie's curiosity about the world was stoked early on.LiNeBrEaKA Thanksgiving tradition is to debate hot issues in what Smith has dubbed "the War Room."LiNeBrEaK"She gets more of the political and current events from her dad's side and more of her environmental sensitivity from my side because we were so close to the land," said Smith's mother, Dottie, who grew up on a tobacco farm in Bald Knob in northwest Franklin County.LiNeBrEaKBut the two seminal events that widened her perspective, Marcie said, were in high school when she read New Yorker writer Philip Gourevitch's book about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and two summers ago when she attended a screening of former Vice President Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.LiNeBrEaKAt that showing of the movie in Lexington, she sat next to U.S. Rep. Ben Chandler, D-Versailles.LiNeBrEaKShe said the film prompted her to examine human consumption and question "the way I live my life."LiNeBrEaK"So after it, I was asking him, 'So what are you doing about this?' And 'What can I do,'" Smith recalled.LiNeBrEaKChandler suggested starting a campus environmental group.LiNeBrEaKBy the fall, she and several others established Transylvania Environmental Rights and Responsibilities Alliance, which has prodded the university to be energy efficient. It launched programs, such the "Get Trashed Campaign" that required students to carry trash bags for two weeks to show them the amount of waste they generate, and "Hug a mug," which encourages use of travel mugs instead of disposable coffee cups.LiNeBrEaKSmith later interned for Chandler, where the congressman's chief of staff Denis Fleming said she quickly established herself as "a standout," researching foreign affairs and environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKAll her experience has set the table for her latest adventure to Poland.LiNeBrEaK"What is neat for me is that I may not have much political capital," she said. "But we represent one of the truest examples of a grass-roots movement that the world has ever seen."LiNeBrEaKRyan Alessi covers higher education.

The Meridian Star (Mississippi)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Safaris, sundowners and smokes  	Otha Barham, The Meridian Star, Miss.  	LIFESTYLE  	840 words  	Nov. 28--I am not sure why it is 12-year-old boys must experiment with things they should leave alone but they always do. Sometimes this leads to big trouble, but back in the times of my youth there didn't seem to be that much "big trouble" around to get into. But there were scads of little troubles that fairly begged to be stirred up, and, like most of my contemporaries, I often stirred.LiNeBrEaKMost of my trouble stirring occurred under cover of the woods. I liked the outdoors and spent most of my spare time there as I still do, though the amount of spare time available for woods living has shrunk since my youth due to, I suppose, the Internet, global warming, daylight saving time, the ozone layer, receding coastlines, trade deficits and other abominations which are always messing up things. LiNeBrEaKBack then it was just the Devil we had to worry about. I am sure it was the Devil who was to blame for my first (and last) attempt at smoking. It happened this way.LiNeBrEaKI was slipping along a trail one day, stalking Cape buffalos, black maned lions and grizzly bears near a field in north Meridian. I was armed with my large bore rifle. The rifle was a special hand made one; that is, made by my own hands. The  barrel consisted of a long piece of water pipe, one end of which I had hammered shut tightly over an eight-penny nail centered in the opening so that when the nail was withdrawn  a small hole remained through which the fuse of a large "Zebra" firecracker would protrude nicely. Does anyone remember Zebra firecrackers? Only a cherry bomb was more powerful (read dangerous to experimenting 12-year-olds).The Zebra was dropped down the barrel, it took several tries, so that its fuse protruded.LiNeBrEaKThe LoadLiNeBrEaKThe rifle stock was hand carved from a pine 2 X 4. A light wadding of toilet tissue was rammed down the barrel to ensure the projectile stayed in front of the fat, blue and white firecracker. The bullet, either a roller bearing or ball bearing depending on current scavenging results, was dropped in and secured by another wad of tissue.LiNeBrEaKWhen confronted by a wild and dangerous animal, I quickly lit the fuse, aimed at the beast, closed my eyes (an aid to retaining eyesight) and fired. The explosion happened a good four inches from my nose. I killed many hickory Cape buffalos, oak grizzlies and pine lions. If I missed I could hear the speeding steel bearing clicking through the treetops as it exited Lauderdale County on its way to other time zones.LiNeBrEaKThe result of each firing was that the breech area had to be pounded shut again because the explosion always opened that end of the barrel up significantly. But that bit of maintenance was no bother to a 12-year-old with a hammer.LiNeBrEaKAnyway, about the smoking. As I had seen at the Saturday movies, respectable hunters on safari always had a smoke and a toddy around the campfire after a hard day's hunt. I will not discuss the toddy here, except to say that my clandestine attempt at creating my own involved theft and fermentation and ended in disaster, a complete story of its own that can wait until I have researched the statute of limitations.LiNeBrEaKThe smoking part came easier. There I was, slipping along eyeing the broom sage for crouching lions, when I saw it; a healthy stalk of rabbit tobacco. I had heard about this wild treat from my older and more worldly friends. (Scientists now call it Gnaphilium obtusifolium.)LiNeBrEaKRoll Your OwnLiNeBrEaKI stripped the curled brown and gray leaves from the stem, wrapped a wad of them in a strip of paper bag in which I carried my Zebras and prepared to salute the end of a good day on safari. To appropriately set the scene, I leaned my rifle against a nearby acacia tree, I sat cross-legged on the ground at dusk beside the campfire and, as lions roared in the distant darkness, I lighted up.LiNeBrEaKAs I was soon to learn, I had rolled the smoke with entirely too little compaction, and its end intermittently smoked and flamed. When I took a long draw, inhaling deeply as I had seen my heroes of the screen do so many times, what I drew deep into my lungs was not a sweet, narcotic smoke, but instead a virtual chest full of fire! Rather than smoking, my cigarette was just simply on fire, and I quickly exhaled with a series of raspy coughs.LiNeBrEaKThat day in camp ended without the proper urbane celebration, but I would soon learn to wrap the rabbit tobacco tightly and moisten any that was too dry. I progressed eventually to packing the leaves into a hollow weed cut long enough to give any flames time enough to subside. I was at last suave in my ceremonial day's end salutes; even though there was never anyone around camp to address me as Bwana.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	November 28, 2008 Friday   01 EDITION	Wind power is OK,    but it has its limits  		A; Pg. 10  	511 words  	Wind power is OK,LiNeBrEaKbut it has its limitsLiNeBrEaKBy mthrowerLiNeBrEaKFORMER VICE President Al Gore, Texas billionaire T. Boone Pickens and the mayor of a small city in south Alabama have something in common. LiNeBrEaKThey all believe in the power of wind.LiNeBrEaKThe former vice president, Mr. Pickens and Robertsdale Mayor Charles Murphy want the nation to generate more electricity with wind turbines. Mr. Gore and Mr. Pickens are highly visible advocates of this form of "green power," but Mr. Murphy and three other Alabama mayors also have taken a public stand on the issue.LiNeBrEaKHelena Mayor Charles Penhale, Oxford Mayor Leon Smith and Decatur Mayor Don Kyle joined Mr. Murphy in pledging their support for T. Boone Pickens' plan to massively increase wind power.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press reports that 168 mayors across the nation are backing the Pickens plan to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKMr. Gore, the world's leading scold on global warming, likes windmills because they're supposed to reduce reliance on power generated by pollution-emitting fossil fuels. Mr. Pickens loves windmills because, well, he's invested about $10 billion in building giant wind turbines on the Texas plains and he clearly would benefit financially from a nationwide push to harness wind power.LiNeBrEaKIn fairness, Mr. Pickens also appears quite devoted to the cause of freeing the United States from dependence on oil extracted from countries that do not wish Americans well. Presumably, the 168 mayors who signed Mr. Pickens' pledge share his belief that the wind can help free us from our dangerous dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKThe Pickens plan would shift 20 percent of the nation's electricity-generating capacity from natural gas to wind turbines, and then use the natural gas to power motor vehicles.LiNeBrEaKWe'd like to believe that both Mr. Gore and Mr. Pickens are right. But the Pickens plan is more than a bit quixotic, if we may invoke the name of the literary character, Don Quixote, who tilted at windmills.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, the nation gets about 1 percent of its electricity from wind. The federal government heavily subsidizes wind generation, which means it remains an economically impractical alternative to traditional energy sources.LiNeBrEaKEven in windy west Texas, where Mr. Pickens has built hundreds of wind turbines, the wind produces only about 3 percent of the electricity used by consumers.LiNeBrEaKThe wind is not a reliable source of electricity. It blows intermittently, forcing electric utilities to keep power plants on standby in case the giant rotors stop whirling.LiNeBrEaKTo achieve Mr. Pickens' goal, private companies and, inevitably, the taxpayers would have to invest tens of billions of dollars in new transmission lines. It's hard to justify that expense when the current wind technology can't do more than supplement the power-generating capacity of gas-and coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaKWe have a suggestion for Mr. Gore, Mr. Pickens and the 168 mayors: Support wind power, but recognize that its potential is limited. This recognition should lead you to throw your weight behind the one proven source of alternative energy: nuclear power.

The New York Times 	November 28, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Green Investments Come With a Watchdog Aspect  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 5  	1068 words  	Until recently, green investment funds were mostly a niche for individual investors. But now investing with the idea of improving the environmental actions of corporations, not just maximizing profit, is catching on among some big pension funds and foundations, particularly in Europe and even in the United States. LiNeBrEaK  These funds are redirecting investment toward companies that do the least environmental damage and those that try to limit their output of the emissions thought to contribute to global warming. LiNeBrEaK   Among the leaders are the Norwegian Government Pension Fund-Global; ABP, the huge Dutch government pension fund; and the pension fund of the British Environment Agency. In the United States, the California State Teachers' Retirement Fund, one of the largest pension funds in the United States, is one of the few American funds that has become a green investor.LiNeBrEaK  ''We decided that we should do this because our investment strategy was not linked to our mission,'' said Howard Pearce, director of the pension fund for the British Environment Agency. LiNeBrEaK  But most institutional investors, including a number of foundations already committed to environmental goals as part of their giving, have resisted the movement, or taken only small steps, out of fear that it will hurt earnings. These include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, universities like Harvard and Yale, and even the United Nations pension fund.LiNeBrEaK  ''From the environmental perspective, the great nonplayer is the investor community,'' said Matthew Kiernan, founder of Innovest, a global sustainable investing company. ''The attitude is, 'We don't cut down any trees.' But money is the oxygen for all the other sectors.'' LiNeBrEaK  Proponents of green investing say companies, foundations and governments can fight climate change through their investments even more effectively than through charities and other activities.LiNeBrEaK  Some big investors are even going out of their way to divest themselves publicly of stakes in companies deemed environmentally lax. More commonly, however, they try to put pressure on management through private meetings and shareholder resolutions to modify their effect on the environment.LiNeBrEaK  ''This can be the most important voice that they have -- the money talks,'' said Frederic Hauge, chief of the Bellona Foundation, the largest nongovernmental environment organization in Norway, which pushed the Norwegian pension fund to act. This pension fund is the largest state fund in the world. Pension funds hold an estimated one-third of equities in the world.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Hauge and others emphasize that they are not suggesting that investors avoid entirely companies engaged in necessary but polluting industries like mining and oil and cement production. They say investment funds can be directed to companies producing energy and engaging in other carbon-intensive activities in the most sustainable way possible.LiNeBrEaK  In Britain, the environment agency's pension managers last year shifted contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars away from United States fund companies like Capital International and State Street Global Advisors because they did not pursue what the agency considered adequate environmental standards.LiNeBrEaK  Last month, the Norwegian global pension fund, which introduced a new sustainability strategy at the end of 2004, divested itself of the mining company Rio Tinto over its practices in Indonesia. This was the latest of seven companies the fund has sold for environmental reasons. LiNeBrEaK  The California teachers' fund, known as Calsters, with a $169 billion portfolio, has declared climate change its signature issue and has pushed companies like Exxon Mobil and Southern, a giant utility in the Southeast, to fully disclose their climate-changing emissions. LiNeBrEaK  To encourage greater involvement on this front, three years ago the United Nations released Principles for Responsible Investing, a pact in which signatories pledged to integrate environmental issues with investments. Membership doubled to 381 in 2008, representing $14 trillion in management assets. But its effect has been limited.LiNeBrEaK  ''The momentum is really huge, with the number of signatories increasing year on year,'' said James Gifford of London, the executive director of Principles for Responsible Investing. But he added that ''many are, in fact, in early stages, doing things like looking for people with experience in green investing when they hire fund managers.'' LiNeBrEaK  Advocates of sustainable investing say they are disappointed that many organizations professing support for environmental goals have done so little.LiNeBrEaK  ''You'd think the first movers would be the universities and the foundations, but there's been little movement there,'' said Paul Hawken, a former owner of the Smith and Hawken garden retail chain and founder of the Natural Capital Institute, which tracks sustainable investing in the United States. ''You see solar panels on the libraries, but you don't see them in the portfolio.''LiNeBrEaK  There is no requirement for foundations or pension funds to publicly list investments. In the interest of focusing investment decisions on achieving the greatest return, many foundations and universities have erected a wall between their investing arms and their donations for good works. LiNeBrEaK  When asked about sustainable investing, Amy Fritsch of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said, ''We have a two-entity structure.'' The foundation, the richest in the world, distributes money and grants for projects separately from the management of its investment portfolio, which is run by a group called BGI, which did not return telephone calls. LiNeBrEaK  Josh Poupore, a spokesman for Harvard, said the university was ''doing so much across the board to promote sustainability on campus'' but ''unfortunately can't talk about what we're doing in investments.'' LiNeBrEaK  The United Nations pension fund did not return more than half a dozen calls seeking comment. LiNeBrEaK  Foundations and pension funds often have an obligation to maximize returns. They say they fear lower returns on green investments. LiNeBrEaK  But pension fund pioneers in the field say the two goals are not necessarily incompatible.LiNeBrEaK  ''We have the same return expectations as from our conventional investments,'' said Jack Ehnes, the chief executive of Calsters, which has a billion-dollar sustainability investment program. ''We are using our portfolio as leverage to tackle climate change.''

The News-Times (Danbury, Connecticut)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	States wait on power plant fate  	Robert Miller, The News-Times, Danbury, Conn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	709 words  	Nov. 28--The evidence is clear and has been growing for a decade, said Dr. Gregory Dworkin.LiNeBrEaKDoctors know the tiny particles of soot -- or fine particulate matter -- we breathe in from polluted air damages our lungs.LiNeBrEaK"There are particles that get past the filters we have in our nose and get into the lungs," Dworkin, chief of pediatric pulmonology at Danbury Hospital, said Tuesday. "Once they get in, they're hard to get out." LiNeBrEaKThe people most at risk from these particles are pregnant women, infants and young children. Fine particulate matter, he said, may be most harmful to developing lungs.LiNeBrEaKDworkin said one of the best places to learn about this issue is on a Web site post by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, www.epa.gov/particles/basic.html.LiNeBrEaKTherefore, he said, it's perplexing that the EPA, in the waning days of the Bush administration, is considering a move that would weaken EPA regulations and allow big power plants in the Midwest to emit even more pollution -- pollution that prevailing winds carry to Connecticut daily.LiNeBrEaK"It's so disappointing to see these kinds of back-door regulations being prepared," Dworkin said.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Gov. M. Jodi Rell joined the five other New England governors to protest the changes. Writing to EPA Administrator Steven Johnson, Rell and the other governors said the changes "threaten the quality of our states' air and the health of our citizens."LiNeBrEaKNew England, the letter said, is penalized by geography. No matter how hard the Northeastern states strive to clean sources of air pollution within their boundaries, they cannot control the vast clouds of smoke belched from the tall smoke stacks of coal-fired power plants in the Midwest. The upper-air winds, blowing west to east, carry the soot to New England.LiNeBrEaK"We depend heavily on federal leadership to address air pollution transport," the six governors said.LiNeBrEaKAt issue are changes in the federal Clean Air Act, under what is called New Source Review. Under those provisions, power plants due for major renovations must add modern pollution control devices if the renovation would increase the plant's annual emissions.LiNeBrEaKBecause such renovations usually increase the hours a plant operates, they mean the plants will emit more pollution over a year.LiNeBrEaKWhat the proposed change would do is exempt a plant from installing the new pollution controls as long as new emissions don't exceed the plant's existing hourly rate of emissions. Thus, the rule change would allow the plants to continue polluting at the same rate, but for more hours.LiNeBrEaKAlong with the fine particulate matter, this pollution also contributes to smog in the summer, to acid rain, and to climate change, the governors' letter said.LiNeBrEaKWhat's unclear right now is when -- or whether -- the EPA will put these regulations into effect by publishing them in the Federal Register.LiNeBrEaKThere was concern the EPA would publish them last week. That would put them outside a 60-day limit before Jan. 20 -- the day President George W. Bush leaves office and U.S. Sen. Barack Obama takes the oath of office as our next president.LiNeBrEaKIf the EPA had published the regulations outside the 60-day limit, they would go into effect. But if the Bush administration publishes regulations inside the 60-day limit, the incoming Obama administration can block them from going into effect.LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Jonathan Schrader said Tuesday there has been no date set for publishing the new regulations.LiNeBrEaK"There is a significant amount of work to do on them," Schrader said.LiNeBrEaKDennis Schain, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said Connecticut will monitor the EPA's decisions on the regulations carefully over the next 60 days.LiNeBrEaK"We will stay on top of it," he said. And if the EPA does publish them, "we will take appropriate action."LiNeBrEaKContact Robert MillerLiNeBrEaKat bmiller@newstimes.comLiNeBrEaKor at (203) 731-3345.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 28, 2008 Friday   Sunrise Edition	Western governors: Go green on energy  	BROCK VERGAKIS  	Regional News; Pg.

LiNeBrEaKThe bipartisan Western Governors' Association has delivered a four-page letter outlining what steps it believes Obama's administration should take in its first 100 days to address the issue.LiNeBrEaKAmong the recommendations are spending tens of billions of dollars annually to develop clean energy technology; establishing an aggressive reduction goal for greenhouse gas emissions to help stop global warming; and proposing a mandatory system for reducing such emissions through "market-based mechanisms."LiNeBrEaK"We must not repeat the mistakes of the past," said the letter signed by the association chairman, Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, and vice chairman, Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana. "The future of our nation depends on it."LiNeBrEaKHuntsman said Obama's administration should listen to the association because its 19 states, including California, Oregon and Washington, are responsible for 94 percent of the country's onshore oil reserves, 66 percent of its coal reserves and 100 percent of its installed solar generation.LiNeBrEaKThe association also is encouraging Obama to improve mass transportation, bring more fuel-efficient and near-zero emission vehicles to the market and develop renewable resources such as wind and solar energy.LiNeBrEaKOther proposals include establishing an oil import reduction goal, expanding the electric grid and creating technology to have nearly no greenhouse gas emissions from new coal-fired electric plants in 10 years and from existing generation by 2030.LiNeBrEaKThe letter likely will find a receptive audience in the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKObama has pledged support for an emissions cap-and-trade system and would establish annual targets to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them another 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKPresident George W. Bush has been criticized for failing to do enough to combat climate change, and Obama has promised quick action to address the issue.LiNeBrEaKIn recent weeks, Huntsman has said Republicans have been too unwilling to champion the environment as an important issue.LiNeBrEaK"The environment really isn't a red or a blue issue. It's an American issue. I'm trying my very best as just one Republican, and I know there are others, to remind people of that fact --and that it will take a bipartisan effort," Huntsman said.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 28, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	Land-use law sets tone for development;  Incentives encourage growth in urban areas, transit hubs 	James Temple, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1376 words  	Many California planning and environmental groups are heralding the passage of legislation designed to address global warming by curbing suburban sprawl as a watershed moment, perhaps the state's most important land-use law in more than 30 years.LiNeBrEaK"It's a sea change in the way we're planning and funding growth and development," said Stephanie Reyes, senior policy advocate with San Francisco's Greenbelt Alliance. "The winds are shifting, and this is the time to get on board."LiNeBrEaKBut she and other advocates acknowledge that the importance of SB375, signed into law by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in late September, lies as much in the tone it sets as in what it will accomplish, which remains unclear. LiNeBrEaKEssentially the law, which will take years to implement, uses incentives and requirements to encourage local governments and builders to concentrate growth in urban areas or close to public transportation hubs in an effort to reduce Californians' use of cars and lower their greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaK The ultimate impact will depend on how the legislation is put into effect, and whether its carrots and sticks will outweigh the cries from people who don't want big new buildings on their block.LiNeBrEaKWhatever the law's accomplishments, proponents hope it sends a clear message that will be reflected in future legislation and policies on the state and local levels: Dense, transit-oriented development is a critical goal for the collective good.LiNeBrEaK"A small step can be an important step if it's the step that turns the corner," said Tom Adams, board president of the California League of Conservation Voters, the principal drafter of the legislation. "I think it will change forever the way we look at land use in California."LiNeBrEaKWhat critics sayLiNeBrEaKCritics, however, argue the law wrests away too much local control over land use decisions, potentially eliminates funding for transportation projects already promised to voters, and creates new grounds for lawsuits.LiNeBrEaK"Our greatest concerns were that the bill dramatically increased the exposure to litigation for future regional transportation plans, particularly for highway projects or any other projects that might be deemed to not support infill development," said Bob McCleary, executive director of the Contra Costa Transportation Authority. LiNeBrEaKOther opponents include the Sonoma County Transportation Authority, the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Association of Realtors. Many developers supported the bill in its final form, after industry groups lobbied for changes. Key among them was a streamlining of the environmental approval process for projects that clearly meet the goals set forth in the law.LiNeBrEaKPaul Campos, attorney for the California Major Builders Council who worked on the bill, described the attitude toward the law among developers as cautious optimism. LiNeBrEaK"Our industry very much supports the goal of building more high-density projects in blighted areas, doing redevelopment and transit-oriented developments," he said. "There is a demand for this type of development, and it's not as if all the home builders in the U.S. and California are stupid."LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, he said, there is a firm industry conviction that not all of the projected growth in California can be accommodated in multifamily urban properties, nor do all consumers want to live in such homes. There are clear downsides for those builders pursuing projects that don't reflect the model envisioned in the law. Developments that significantly increase auto traffic will be more thoroughly scrutinized and may require more privately financed transportation infrastructure. LiNeBrEaKFor proponents, that is precisely the point: discouraging traffic to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a meaningful way.LiNeBrEaKTransportation accounts for one-third of all CO{-2} emissions in the state, so tackling it is critical to achieving the goals of AB32, the landmark global warming legislation approved in 2006 that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California by 30 percent by 2020. LiNeBrEaKIn the global warming context, land use is thought of as one leg of the three-legged transportation stool, along with vehicle fuel economy and low-carbon fuels like biodiesel. The metaphor may be apt, as studies have concluded the projected increases in driving, based on today's sprawling development patterns, would overwhelm any emission reductions achieved through better gas mileage and cleaner fuels in the next few decades. Without improved land use, the stool topples, the argument goes.LiNeBrEaKFor decades, Northern California's growth hasn't followed this model, with most building occurring outside the nine-county Bay Area, according to a report by the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association. LiNeBrEaKSuburban sprawlLiNeBrEaKBetween 1972 and 2004, only the outlying counties of Solano and Sonoma saw the number of people per square mile more than double, while that happened in every county in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, the group said.LiNeBrEaKSPUR and other planning groups attribute this to the reluctance of communities in the inner areas to add new housing on the scale of their suburban neighbors, which tends to drive up costs of existing stock. Those who want to own a home look farther and farther out, a pattern that necessitates ever longer drives to work, and car trips for most shopping and entertainment outings. LiNeBrEaK"The simple truth is we can not get there without land use as a fundamental framework," said Peter Calthorpe, founder of San Francisco planning group Congress for New Urbanism, at a recent industry conference on the impacts of the law. "What's exciting about California is we're about to lead the way again, instead of following and dragging our feet."LiNeBrEaKHow SB375 works LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAccording to analysis by California real estate lawyers with law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter and Hampton LLP, under the new legislation: LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- The Air Resources Board must create committees, which include local transportation agencies, planning organizations and the public, that recommend regional greenhouse gas reduction targets. The board must review the report and provide regional guidelines by June 30, 2010. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Metropolitan planning organizations, which include the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the Bay Area, must update their regional transportation plans with strategies that ensure future developments and the roads and public transportation that support them cut emissions by the goals set by the Air Resources Board. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Every eight years, local governments must submit housing elements - essentially plans identifying areas that can accommodate predicted residential growth in a given region - that are consistent with the strategies set forth by the planning organizations. Within the next three years, they must rezone land to reflect these plans. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKThis zoning requirement is one of the strongest incentives to build dense, transit-oriented development within the law, said Ted Droettboom, regional planning program director for the Joint Policy Committee, a consortium of local planning organizations that includes the MTC. Once new zoning is in place, it becomes more difficult for local governments or residents to block builders pursuing these sorts of projects. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Communities that approve projects inconsistent with these plans will have a more difficult time securing government financing for related transportation improvements - such as new roads and freeway interchanges. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- The environmental approval process will be streamlined for certain projects that achieve the goals of the law. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Developments that may boost auto traffic will be more thoroughly scrutinized, and may require more privately financed transportation infrastructure. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Projects with at least 49 percent of the units designated as affordable that meet local zoning requirements may qualify for a so called anti-NIMBY defense that allows the developments to move forward even if communities reject them. LiNeBrEaKHow SB375 works LiNeBrEaKWhat new law does LiNeBrEaKSB375 uses incentives and requirements to encourage local governments and developers to concentrate growth in urban areas or close to public transportation hubs in an effort to reduce Californians' use of cars and lower their greenhouse gas emissions. But it is a complicated law, and its ultimate impact remains unclear.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Biodiversity, ecosystems threatened by climate change  	The Salt Lake Tribune  	OPINION; Columnists  	669 words  	World financial systems took extreme risks that stunned us all. We will pay the consequences. We react with alarm to the collapse on Wall Street, but the collapse of our ecosystems often receives only passing consideration. We will all pay the consequences of this, too, now and in the future.LiNeBrEaKAccustomed to the availability of our natural resources, we think of them as free and take them for granted. But, a decade ago, the World Resources Institute estimated an annual global price tag of $33 trillion dollars for ecosystem services. LiNeBrEaKThese services would be expensive, difficult or impossible to obtain without functioning ecosystems. We rely upon them to provide clean water and air, cycle carbon and other nutrients, and decompose wastes.LiNeBrEaKWe have squandered these valuable resources. Between 40 and 50 percent of the Earth's ice-free land surface is damaged by human activity. Carbon dioxide emissions increased 3. 1 percent per year between 2000 and 2006, more than twice the growth rate of the 1990s, despite unambiguous evidence that it was causing climate change and disrupting ecosystems worldwide.LiNeBrEaKUtah can expect to warm faster than other parts of the world, a trend that would result in decreased snow pack and threatens us with severe and prolonged drought.LiNeBrEaKThe International Union for Conservation of Nature found 25-36 percent of mammal species on Earth are being pushed to extinction. Habitat loss and degradation affect 40 percent of the world's mammals, who play key roles in ecosystems and provide irreplaceable benefits to us.LiNeBrEaKThis loss is certainly not limited to charismatic mega fauna like bears or mountain-dwelling pikas. About 40 percent of North American freshwater fish are threatened. The Global Amphibian Assessment found 32. 3 percent endangered. At least 22 percent of reptile species are at risk of extinction.LiNeBrEaKPopulations of 20 common North American birds have decreased by more than half in the past four decades, including the evening grosbeak and northern pintail.LiNeBrEaKBecause four unique ecosystems intersect in Utah, we are ranked fifth in the nation for biodiversity. The Great Salt Lake may be one of the most vulnerable wetlands in the United States to be affected by climate change. The Utah sensitive species list includes 28 mollusk species, 22 fish species, five amphibian species, 13 reptile species, 22 bird species and 19 mammal species.LiNeBrEaKThe extinction rate is accelerating rapidly due to human activities. How many bricks can you take out of a wall and still have a wall?LiNeBrEaKClimate change and habitat loss are going to affect wildlife and fisheries. Utah forests could decline as much as 15-30 percent and be more susceptible to wildfire. In this arid landscape, streams and rivers are highly vulnerable to climate change and, coupled with increased human demands on water, the few wetland habitats that exist in Utah could be degraded or destroyed. This will impact hunting and fishing enthusiasts as well as those who just enjoy wildlife.LiNeBrEaKGenerally, habitats and animals are resilient and, given a chance, many can survive. We can provide that chance by engaging in a renewed conservation ethic, one learned when early Westerners depleted big game and fisheries resources.LiNeBrEaKA century ago, we preserved our wildlife and fisheries, thanks to the efforts of conservationists like Teddy Roosevelt and organizations like the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaKLessons learned then now teach us to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, conserve energy and develop renewable sources. We use these lessons when we buy locally produced food and reduce transportation costs, when we limit the pollutants we allow into the air, when we each recognize ourselves as agents of change.LiNeBrEaKMarion Klaus is a biologist who has researched at-risk mammals in the Western United States and Costa Rica. She has done genetic engineering research at the Moran Eye Center and works as a consultant for Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment and as a volunteer with Intermountain Therapy Animals.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Environmental rules erased at the midnight hour  	The Salt Lake Tribune  	OPINION; Columnists  	567 words  	The following editorial appeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Wednesday:LiNeBrEaKGeorge W. Bush may be the undisputed champion when it comes to presidential vacations, but his staff is working overtime. As the clock ticks down to Inauguration Day, the Bush administration is working feverishly to dismantle at least 10 major safeguards of the nation's air, water, endangered species and national parks. LiNeBrEaKMost of the damage took place before Nov. 15, 60 days before Inauguration Day. That's because most new federal rules take effect 60 days after being published in the Federal Register. Once in effect, they are more difficult and time-consuming to undo.LiNeBrEaKIn recent weeks, the Bush administration has:LiNeBrEaK--Opened up 2 million acres of Western land to the development of oil shale, one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet. Another 360,000 acres -- including large swaths of public land near Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park in Utah and Dinosaur National Monument on the border of Utah and Colorado -- were opened to oil drilling.LiNeBrEaK--Exempted large factory farms and mountaintop mining operations from parts of the Clean Water Act. The prohibition against dumping mining waste into rivers and streams dates back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who was not exactly an environmental radical.LiNeBrEaK--Loosened clean-air rules to make it easier to build power plants, refineries and chemical plants near national parks. It also changed rules to make it easier for coal-fired power plants to avoid installing pollution controls or clean up soot and smog emissions.LiNeBrEaK--Changed rules to prevent Congress from blocking uranium mining on claims filed near the Grand Canyon. Higher prices for uranium have prompted hundreds of new mining claims on federal land. In June, a House committee ordered that about 1 million acres of land near the Grand Canyon be exempt from mining. The rule change would block that.LiNeBrEaKAnd several days ago, the Washington Post reported that a new rule that is close to being finalized would prevent federal agencies from taking climate change into consideration when they make decisions about imperiled animals and plants. That's apparently being done because polar bears were added earlier this year to the list of species in jeopardy. The administration reportedly believes that the move could serve as a pretext for imposing a cap on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration previously had eliminated rules that require independent scientific reviews of federal agency decisions that could harm protected plants and animals. The effect of that change, for all intents and purposes, is to institutionalize conflict of interest by allowing agencies that propose new projects to avoid the complications that would ensue if other federal agencies asserted that those projects would harm endangered animals or plants.LiNeBrEaKMany of the proposed rules changes, such as the Clean Air Act rule on coal-fired power plants, would accomplish things the administration tried and failed to win in Congress.LiNeBrEaKBush seems determined to cement his place in history as the Great Deregulator.LiNeBrEaKGiven the amount of damage he's doing to popular environmental protections, it seems more likely he'll be remembered as the Great Despoiler.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Environmental rules erased at the midnight hour  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	603 words  	The following editorial appeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Wednesday, Nov. 26:LiNeBrEaKGeorge W. Bush may be the undisputed champion when it comes to presidential vacations, but his staff is working overtime. As the clock ticks down to Inauguration Day, the Bush administration is working feverishly to dismantle at least 10 major safeguards of the nation's air, water, endangered species and national parks.LiNeBrEaKMost of the damage took place before Nov. 15, 60 days before Inauguration Day. That's because most new federal rules take effect 60 days after being published in the Federal Register. Once in effect, they are more difficult and time-consuming to undo. LiNeBrEaKIn recent weeks, the Bush administration has:LiNeBrEaK_Opened up 2 million acres of Western land to the development of oil shale, one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet. Another 360,000 acres _ including large swaths of public land near Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park in Utah and Dinosaur National Monument on the border of Utah and Colorado _ were opened to oil drilling.LiNeBrEaK_Exempted large factory farms and mountaintop mining operations from parts of the Clean Water Act. The prohibition against dumping mining waste into rivers and streams dates back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who was not exactly an environmental radical.LiNeBrEaK_Loosened clean-air rules to make it easier to build power plants, refineries and chemical plants near national parks. It also changed rules to make it easier for coal-fired power plants to avoid installing pollution controls or clean up soot and smog emissions.LiNeBrEaK_Changed rules to prevent Congress from blocking uranium mining on claims filed near the Grand Canyon. Higher prices for uranium have prompted hundreds of new mining claims on federal land. In June, a House committee ordered that about 1 million acres of land near the Grand Canyon be exempt from mining. The rule change would block that.LiNeBrEaKAnd several days ago, the Washington Post reported that a new rule that is close to being finalized would prevent federal agencies from taking climate change into consideration when they make decisions about imperiled animals and plants. That's apparently being done because polar bears were added earlier this year to the list of species in jeopardy. The administration reportedly believes that the move could serve as a pretext for imposing a cap on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration previously had eliminated rules that require independent scientific reviews of federal agency decisions that could harm protected plants and animals. The effect of that change, for all intents and purposes, is to institutionalize conflict of interest by allowing agencies that propose new projects to avoid the complications that would ensue if other federal agencies asserted that those projects would harm endangered animals or plants.LiNeBrEaKMany of the proposed rules changes, such as the Clean Air Act rule on coal-fired power plants, would accomplish things the administration tried and failed to win in Congress.LiNeBrEaKBush seems determined to cement his place in history as the Great Deregulator.LiNeBrEaKGiven the amount of damage he's doing to popular environmental protections, it seems more likely he'll be remembered as the Great Despoiler.

The Times (Munster, Indiana)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Site team for $210 million plant to visit Munster, Ind., area  	Bill Dolan, The Times, Munster, Ind.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	473 words  	Nov. 28--Powers Energy One officials will scout as many as nine potential Lake County sites next week for a $210 million bio-fuel plant that could begin construction next year. LiNeBrEaKAnd given the plan is to be the first of its kind in the state, environmental regulators aren't quite sure what to expect.LiNeBrEaK"We don't have a definite site, but we have three we are looking at pretty hard," Powers Energy President and Chief Executive Officer Earl Powers said this week. "And we are going to try to finalize as early as (Dec. 5)."LiNeBrEaKThe visit comes less than two weeks after the county's solid waste board and Powers signed a contract to provide Powers with enough municipal trash over 15 years to generate millions of gallons of ethanol and create 160 jobs.LiNeBrEaKPicking a site could galvanize renewed opposition to the project by environmental critics who contend it will add a new layer to the region's toxic pall of industrial pollution.LiNeBrEaK"We will continue to be interested in the issues we believe have been glossed over," said Sandy O'Brien, of the Duneland Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club was among several groups that fought unsuccessfully to have the county pick the alternative of recycling and composting waste.LiNeBrEaKO'Brien contends Powers process of vaporizing garbage into a synthetic gas fermented into ethanol as well as the diesel fumes from garbage haulers could pump mercury, lead and greenhouse gases into the air in a similar manner to garbage incinerators.LiNeBrEaKWaste District Executive Director Jeff Langbehn said he toured Power's pilot plant in Arkansas and contends the process is clean.LiNeBrEaK"If they processed all of the waste in the county, the pollution would be 10 times less than the amount already coming out of semi trucks on the road," Langbehn said.LiNeBrEaKAnd Powers said, "We should not have any problem at all with the air permit at all -- or the water permit because we would be recirculating our water."LiNeBrEaKThose arguments will be tested by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management once Powers applies for a state permit, IDEM spokeswoman Amy Hartsock said.LiNeBrEaKShe said Powers garbage-to-ethanol plant appears to be the first of its kind in the state.LiNeBrEaK"If there are air emissions, there could be a requirement for an air permit," Hartsock said. "If they will be processing solid waste, they will likely be required to obtain a permit for that. And if they have some sort of discharge of wastewater, they may need a permit for that."

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	November 28, 2008 Friday 	Watershed year for warming fight: New Year's 2009 marks the debut of cap, trade system for greenhouse gas emissions  	Brian Nearing, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	699 words  	Nov. 28--ALBANY -- When New Yorkers throw on the lights to greet New Year's Day 2009, some of the bill will go toward a 10-state program to fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKIt is not yet known how much bills might rise: utilities warn of large spikes, while supporters of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative say increases will be minor, and could be more than offset by state energy-efficiency assistance.LiNeBrEaKRGGI is the nation's first "cap and trade" system meant to force down emissions of carbon dioxide, a known greenhouse gas that a growing international scientific consensus blames for global climate change. LiNeBrEaKThe states in the program set a cap on total CO2 emission from electrical power plants beginning in 2009 and each year will auction allowances on those emissions to the highest bidders. New York is set to join RGGI's second auction Dec. 17.LiNeBrEaKPlants that emit low levels of CO2 would need fewer allowances, while less-efficient operations would need more allowances. Allowances can be sold and traded like any other commodity among interested buyers.LiNeBrEaKIn 2015, the program will reduce available allowances by 10 percent to force down CO2. Power plants account for about a quarter of the state's emissions.LiNeBrEaKA clue to RGGI's impact on an average power bill came last month in New Hampshire, when the state's largest utility sought a 2009 rate increase, based partially on the cost of buying CO2 allowances.LiNeBrEaKPublic Service Company of New Hampshire, which supplies about three-quarters of state residents with electricity, wants to raise rates about $1 a month for an average residential customer to cover RGGI, according to a rate request filed with the state.LiNeBrEaKPeter Iwanowicz, director of the state Climate Change Office with the Department of Environmental Conservation, said that figure is close to earlier projections of an average 78 cents a month increase from RGGI.LiNeBrEaKAny rate increases from RGGI could be mitigated through state energy efficiency programs that would be paid for from cash raised at the RGGI auctions. Based on the $3. 07 a ton that RGGI allowances fetched in the inaugural September auction, that could mean more than $38 million for New York from next month's sale.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired power plants, which emit the most CO2 of any fossil fuel, would be hit hardest by RGGI.LiNeBrEaKThe state receives about 15 percent of its energy from coal, with the rest coming from natural gas, and nuclear and hydropower as well as small amounts of solar, wind and other alternative energies.LiNeBrEaKPower plant owners remain leery of RGGI and warn that the state cannot afford to raise electrical rates, already among the nation's highest, at the same time as a worsening economic downturn.LiNeBrEaKThe industry wants changes in the law, so plants can offset more pollution by supporting CO2-reduction efforts elsewhere, rather than by buying allowances, said Gavin Donohue, president of the Independent Power Producers of New York, which represents about 80 companies involved in generating electricity.LiNeBrEaKAlso, some money received from RGGI auctions should be earmarked by the state to develop carbon capture and sequestration, which could help coal plants by diverting CO2 emissions from the atmosphere and into long-term underground storage.LiNeBrEaKDonohue said plant owners recently voiced their concerns to Gov. David Paterson. "Our industry is still supporting the goals of the program. It just needs to work right," Donohue said.LiNeBrEaKSuch "clean coal" technology still is being developed and could be years away.LiNeBrEaKSteven Keller, an engineer with the state Public Service Commission, said studies show that while coal-fired plants could see profits drop by up to 50 percent by 2015, plants would still earn profits even after paying for credits.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 	November 28, 2008 Friday 	We're riding the 'green train' through Solano County  		OPINION  	620 words  	The recent downturns in financial institutions, manufacturing sectors, and service industries have presented challenges to revitalize our domestic economy and jobs growth. As mentioned by Bay Area "green guru" Van Jones, author of the book "The Green Collar Economy," the "green collar" economies have remained solvent and continue to expand while others collapse. With the new administration's priority to grow alternative energy resources along with a worldwide effort to mitigate global warming, the developments of alternative energy applications will see tremendous growth in the immediate future.LiNeBrEaKWe have a chance to "act locally" while continuing to "think globally." I believe the new frontier for alternative energy use and development can be right here in Solano County, especially Benicia/Vallejo. Everyone has sunlight for solar energy production, but our geographic location has some of the highest sustained winds in the Bay Area for wind driven technologies (vertical axis, "bird safe" wind technologies are now available). We also have the advantage of moving water in the Carquinez Strait to use in wave or current powered applications. LiNeBrEaKAssembly Bill 32 has set goals for reduced greenhouse gas emissions in our state by 2020 and the governor has initiated an even more aggressive schedule to achieve goals much sooner. Educational institutions across the state are getting on board the "green train." All California State University campuses, including California Maritime Academy in Vallejo, are expediting solar applications to help meet AB32 targets.LiNeBrEaKSolano County is already the "Cleantech Valley" of California, a new version of "Silicon Valley" with several megawatts of wind farms between Suisun and Rio Vista and solar power projects up and down the corridor (Dixon High School Solar Farm; Solano County solar school bus parking lot; Solano County Solar Government Center; Vacaville Solar Park and Ride with Electric Vehicle Charging Station; Vallejo Solar Roofs at JFK Library, City Hall and Police Station; and Vallejo Solar Water Pumping Station).LiNeBrEaKThe Benicia Business Park development is another opportunity to step up on the leading edge of alternative "clean tech" ventures for utility scale power generation, component fabrication, testing and certification, and developing the successor technology to the traditional lead-acid battery method of storing energy for off-peak uses. There is an untapped well of potential in using solar, wind, and water to create energy for use, storage, or resale as well as the hardware to do it.LiNeBrEaKI recently attended at presentation in the city of Richmond sponsored by Solar Richmond, a program that provides job training and solar installations throughout Richmond. They are building on their green collar economy components and putting citizens to work in the process. They were very proud of an article in a leading German magazine that highlighted their efforts and showed a map of California with Richmond highlighted as an green economy leader in the state along with the Silicon Valley. There is no reason why Benicia/Vallejo could not be held up to this level of global prominence with a committed embracing of clean technology uses and development.LiNeBrEaKThe time is now for us to leave a cleaner, greener world for our descendants. It is our responsibility to be dedicated environmental resource stewards and assure "green collar" jobs development consistent with clean tech curriculums in our educational institutions. The Bay Area is making the turn to sustainable energy uses and now is the time to take advantage of the greater potential for the Benicia Business Park by including clean tech components for sustained economic benefits.LiNeBrEaKStan GolovichLiNeBrEaKBenicia	ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); MANUFACTURING SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); WIND ENERGY (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (88%); BANKING and FINANCE (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (78%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (78%); CITY LIFE (78%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (78%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (77%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (77%); EMISSIONS (76%); LEGISLATION (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); EDUCATION (70%); SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION (69%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (66%); POLICE FORCES (62%); MOTOR VEHICLES (62%); PARKS and PLAYGROUNDS (62%)  					MICHAEL MCMAHON (74%); VAN JONES (84%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (98%) CALIFORNIA, USA (98%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	November 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Times-Herald All Rights Reserved

A7  	455 words  	By Ray LilleyLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKWELLINGTON, New ZealandLiNeBrEaKResearchers studying a rare and endangered species of penguin have uncovered a previously unknown species that disappeared about 500 years ago. LiNeBrEaKThe research suggests that the first humans in New Zealand hunted the newly found Waitaha penguin to extinction by 1500, about 250 years after their arrival on the islands. But the loss of the Waitaha allowed another kind of penguin to thrive - the yellow-eyed species that now also faces extinction, Philip Seddon of Otago University, a co-author of the study, said last week .LiNeBrEaKThe team was testing DNA from the bones of prehistoric modern yellow-eyed penguins for genetic changes associated with human settlement when it found some bones that were older - and had different DNA.LiNeBrEaKTests on the older bones "le d us to describe a new penguin species that became extinct only a few hundred years ago," the team reported in a paper in the biological research journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.LiNeBrEaKPolynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand around 1250 and are known to have hunted species such as the large, flightless moa bird to extinction.LiNeBrEaKSeddon said dating techniques used on bones pulled from old Maori trash pits revealed a gap in time between the disappearance of the Waitaha and the arrival of the yellow-eyed penguin.LiNeBrEaKThe gap indicates the extinction of the older bird created the opportunity for the newer to colonize New Zealand's main islands around 500 years ago, said Sanne Boessenkool, an Otago University doctoral student who led the team of researchers, including some from Australia's Adelaide University and New Zealand's Canterbury Museum.LiNeBrEaKCompetition between the two penguin species may have previously prevented the yellow-eyed penguin from expanding north, the researchers noted.LiNeBrEaKDavid Penny of New Zealand's Massey University, who was not involved in the research, said the Waitaha was an example of another native species that was unable to adapt to a human presence.LiNeBrEaK"In addition, it is vitally important to know how species such as the yellow-eyed penguin are able to respond to new opportunities," he said. "It is becoming apparent that some species can respond to things like climate change and others cannot. The more we know, the more we can help."LiNeBrEaKThe yellow-eyed penguin is considered one of the world's rarest. An estimated population of 7,000 in New Zealand is the focus of an extensive conservation effort.LiNeBrEaKnew speciesLiNeBrEaKDuring DNA testing of the bones of prehistoric modern yellow-eyed penguins, researchers found some bones that were older and had different DNA.LiNeBrEaKTests on the older bones, above, led to the discovery of a new penguin species that had become extinct about 500 years ago.

The Washington Times 	November 28, 2008 Friday 		By James Morrison, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	WORLD; EMBASSY ROW; A20  	623 words  	NEW REVOLUTIONLiNeBrEaKWhen he came to Washington as Romania's ambassador in 1996, Mircea Dan Geoana praised capitalism as the key to success for his country after decades of economic decline under communist rule.LiNeBrEaKNow he believes the free market failed Romania, as he calls for a socialist revolution to replace a conservative government that neglected to prepare the country for the current global financial crisis.LiNeBrEaK"We are speaking about a revolution into how the Romanian modern state should operate," he told the Associated Press in an interview at Social Democratic Party headquarters in the capital, Bucharest. LiNeBrEaKMr. Geoana, who served as foreign minister from 2000 to 2004 under a previous socialist government and now chairs the socialist party, advocates imposing higher taxes on the rich and spreading the wealth to poor Romanians in villages and small towns still trapped in 19th-century agricultural practices. He also predicted difficult economic times for Romania for the next year to 18 months.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be tough," he said. "If we use this crisis as an opportunity to get our act together, we might be seeing Romania stronger."LiNeBrEaKRomanians appear to be embracing Mr. Geoana's populist message. A new public opinion poll shows that 35. 4 percent of Romanians back the socialist, while 31. 5 percent support the ruling conservative party.LiNeBrEaKShortly after he arrived in Washington, Mr. Geoana promoted Romania as a country developing a free market and soliciting foreign investment. In a March 1996 interview with Embassy Row, he said Romania had privatized 45 percent of its economy and the remaining state-owned property was being quickly sold.LiNeBrEaK"We are at a point of no return," he said in the interview. "With a new stock exchange, we are re-entering the capital market after 60 years. Romania is looking for business opportunities. Doing business is the best way of healing wounds."LiNeBrEaKRomanians overthrew and executed communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a bloody revolution in 1989.LiNeBrEaKLOWER EXPECTATIONLiNeBrEaKThe European Union's ambassador in Washington is warning his EU colleagues against excessive optimism over what Barack Obama can achieve after he is inaugurated as president in January.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of Europeans don't understand that a president is not all-powerful in the American presidential system," Ambassador John Bruton told the Associated Press this week.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bruton is worried that the new administration will be unable to persuade Congress to adopt European-styled climate-change regulations, even though both the House and Senate will be controlled by Mr. Obama's own Democratic Party. Europeans are preparing for a summit in Copenhagen at the end of next year to adopt a new pact on global warming to replace the Kyoto treaty.LiNeBrEaKFormer President Bill Clinton approved the Kyoto treaty, but his allies on Capitol Hill warned him they did not have the necessary two-thirds vote to get Senate approval, even though the upper house of Congress was also controlled by Democrats at the time.LiNeBrEaKIn a speech earlier this month, Mr. Bruton predicted that Mr. Obama will be preoccupied with pressing domestic issues like the financial crisis to spend too much time on foreign policy.LiNeBrEaK"There are now, of course, high expectations in Europe of a major change in policy in the United States with the election of President Obama and of a Democratic majority in Congress," he said in a speech to the Bertelsmann Foundation.LiNeBrEaK"To those in Europe who expect big changes very quickly, I would refer to domestic constraints on the president's freedom to act internationally," he said. "What many are worried about is that the United States won't be ready for Copenhagen."LiNeBrEaK* Call Embassy Row at 202/636-3297, fax 202/832-7278 or e-mail jmorrison@washington times.com.

The Washington Post 	November 28, 2008 Friday   Regional Edition	EPA, Interior Dept. Chiefs Will Be Busy Erasing Bush's Mark  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	1036 words  	Few federal agencies are expected to undergo as radical a transformation under President-elect Barack Obama as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, which have been at the epicenter of many of the Bush administration's most intense scientific and environmental controversies.LiNeBrEaKThe agencies have different mandates -- the EPA holds sway over air and water pollution, while Interior administers the nation's vast federal land holdings as well as the Endangered Species Act -- but both deal with some of the country's most pressing environmental concerns, such as climate change. And over the past eight years, many career employees and rank-and-file scientists have clashed with Bush appointees over a number of those of issues, including whether the federal government should allow California to regulate tailpipe emissions from automobiles and how best to prevent imperiled species from disappearing altogether. LiNeBrEaKIn June 2007, Obama told reporters in Reno, Nev., that he would not hesitate to reverse many of the environmental policies Bush has enacted by executive order.LiNeBrEaK"I think the slow chipping away against clean air and clean water has been deeply disturbing," Obama added. "Much of it hasn't gone through Congress. It was done by fiat. That is something that can be changed by an administration, in part by reinvigorating the EPA, which has been demoralized."LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming policies are expected to mark one of the sharpest breaks between the Obama and the Bush administrations.LiNeBrEaKEPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson overruled his career advisers in deciding to deny California authority to control tailpipe emissions and rejecting their conclusion that global warming poses a threat to public welfare, and Obama is likely to reverse both of those policies shortly after taking office. This month, the president-elect told delegates to the Governors' Global Climate Summit that he would push for a federal cap-and-trade system designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and then to cut them an additional 80 percent by 2050, targets Bush has never embraced.LiNeBrEaK"Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response," Obama said in a videotaped message. "The stakes are too high, the consequences too serious."LiNeBrEaKJamie Rappaport Clark, executive vice president of the advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife, said that together, the two agencies will help shape the government's response to climate change.LiNeBrEaKClark, who headed the Fish and Wildlife Service under President Bill Clinton, is not a formal Obama adviser, but many of her former Clinton colleagues are helping the transition team, including David Hayes, a partner at Latham and Watkins; John Leshy, a professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law; and Robert Sussman, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.LiNeBrEaK"EPA will play the lead role in crafting a regulatory response," Clark said. "Interior has a huge role to play in adaptation" -- the effort to cope with climate changes that are already happening, such as drought and more frequent wildfires.LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar said Wednesday that the agency is focused on finalizing policies on coal-fired power plants and other matters, but he would not speculate on the task the next administration faces: "We'll let the next team decide what their priorities will be when they get here."LiNeBrEaKWith escalating responsibilities, both agencies will need more resources after years when their budgets shrank, relatively speaking. The EPA received $7. 5 billion from Congress in 2008, down from $7. 8 billion in 2001. Interior has fared slightly better, getting $11. 1 billion compared with $10. 4 billion in 2001, but that represents more than a 10 percent cut in inflation-adjusted dollars.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has feuded with both Johnson and Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne over global warming and other issues, said in an interview that she has high expectations of the people who will take their places.LiNeBrEaK"I'm expecting President-elect Obama to select people who really care about the issues they're in charge of, someone who believes in their mission and not someone who's going to undermine their mission," she said. "That's a sea change."LiNeBrEaKThere is a long list of Democrats vying to take the helm of both agencies. The two leading contenders for EPA administrator are Mary Nichols, a favorite of Boxer's who chairs the California Air Resources Board, and Lisa Jackson, who is in the midst of switching from heading New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection to serving as chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Jon S. Corzine. Other possible nominees include Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen McGinty; Massachusetts Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Ian Bowles; former Sierra Club president and environmental activist Lisa Renstrom; and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Pace University law professor and chairman of the Waterkeeper Alliance, another advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKThe list for Interior is almost as long. Two House Democrats, Raul M. Grijalva (Ariz.) and Mike Thompson (Calif.) are contenders, but Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, former Oregon governor John Kitzhaber, National Trust for Historic Preservation President Richard Moe, as well as three former Interior officials -- David Hayes, John Leshy and Clark at Defenders of Wildlife -- have all been mentioned.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of who takes over at the agencies, the new leaders will face impatient scrutiny from green groups eager to change the government's trajectory on the environment. Frank O'Donnell, who heads the advocacy group Clean Air Watch, ticked off 10 initiatives he expects the new EPA administrator to undertake, including changing rules on emissions from coal-fired power plants and monitoring airborne lead pollution more closely.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration has cut so many special deals for industry that it could be a Herculean effort reversing them all," O'Donnell said. "The new team is going to have to muck out the regulatory stables."LiNeBrEaK Staff researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 	November 28, 2008 Friday   Regional Edition	In Transition: EPA Administrator  		A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	663 words  	 Mary D. Nichols LiNeBrEaK  Current job: Chairwoman, California Air Resources BoardLiNeBrEaKCredentials: The 63-year-old was appointed to head the board by GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in July 2007. She served as assistant administrator for the EPA's air and radiation program in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1997.LiNeBrEaKWhat she offers: As the official in charge of the nation's first program capping greenhouse gas emissions, Nichols boasts a wealth of experience on the top issue facing the next EPA administrator. She also has plenty of Washington experience, as well as the added bonus of having been appointed by a Republican governor. LiNeBrEaKQuote: "I think he needs to pull a team together and get advice from them, and it's going to have to involve talking to leadership in Congress as well as to the new members of the administration, because he doesn't have a lot of time to put a package together. And I know he understands [the] need to make sure that all the bases are covered. You've got to include energy and economic development and the environment in one piece," she said Nov. 19, discussing the need for President-elect Barack Obama to act quickly on global warming.LiNeBrEaKLisa P. Jackson LiNeBrEaK  Current job: Chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Jon S. CorzineLiNeBrEaKCredentials: As chief of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Jackson worked on such issues as redeveloping environmentally blighted "brownfields" to open space preservation. She worked at the EPA  from 1987 to  2002, when she joined New Jersey's DEP as assistant commissioner. She earned a master's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University. A member of Obama's transition team on energy and natural resources, Jackson, 46, would add another African American to the president-elect's Cabinet lineup.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "It is so important that everyone takes part in recycling. Not only does recycling save natural resources and cut down on waste, it bolsters our economy as it reduces the greenhouse gases that cause climate change," she said at an Oct. 15 DEP news conference.LiNeBrEaK Raul M. Grijalva LiNeBrEaK  Current job: Representative, Arizona's 7th DistrictLiNeBrEaKCredentials: Grijalva, 60, chairs the House Natural Resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and public lands, and boasts a 95 percent lifetime score with the League of Conservation Voters. He oversaw a federal study that traced the loss of Western hunting habitat to oil and gas development on public land and has questioned the cheap grazing permits the Interior Department has leased to ranchers in the West. As a co-chairman for Latinos for Obama, Grijalva would be in a strong position to get a Cabinet post.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "Global warming is upon us. We need clean, renewable fuel, and we need it now. It will be a tough transition, but we have to start right now. We are ready for this challenge. We have the know-how and a highly skilled workforce, and we will create millions of new jobs in the process," he said during a  Jan. 18, 2007, House debate on energy legislation.LiNeBrEaKMike Thompson LiNeBrEaK  Current job: Representative, California's 1st DistrictLiNeBrEaKCredentials: A hunter and angler who grows chardonnay wine grapes on his property, Thompson, 51, has secured wilderness protection for more than 275,000 acres on the California coast. He has also pushed for more stringent handling of electronic waste and has tried to mediate conflicts over water use among farmers, fishermen and Indian tribe members in the Pacific Northwest. More than 30 hunting and angling groups sent a letter to Obama urging him to appoint Thompson, who also has  the support of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and California Reps. George Miller and Anna G. Eshoo.  Thompson co-chaired Sportsmen for Obama during the campaign.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "I'm not saying you've got to stop farming and let the water go wherever it wants to go," but "you don't want to kill off all the wildlife to promote farming," he said in January 2006, backing federal funding for conservation projects to ease the demand for water.

The Daily News of Newburyport (Massachusetts)  	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	'If those houses go, then we are next'  	Sabrina Cardin, The Daily News of Newburyport, Mass.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	354 words  	Nov. 27--PLUM ISLAND -- Upon moving to Plum Island in 2000, Tom Gurski began photographing the beach. Every day, he takes a run on the beach, firsthand watching the erosion deplete his favorite running spot. LiNeBrEaKThrough his series of photographs, Gurski believes most beach and property damage has occurred within the past two years.LiNeBrEaK"What's happening out here is global warming," Gurski said. "I think we should evacuate and let nature take its course."LiNeBrEaKNeighbors of the Buzzotta family, who lost their house to the erosion yesterday, empathized with their plight, while also wondering why action hasn't been taken sooner.LiNeBrEaKMitch Maslanka has beachfront property on 57th Street, about a mile and a half north of Plum Island Center. When he moved to Plum Island 20 years ago, he had a clear view of the beach and the waves were washing under his neighbor's deck. He now has a 20-foot dune covering his basement view.LiNeBrEaKWhile the beach near his home is growing, erosion is sapping the Center. Maslanka said officials have been too slow to react.LiNeBrEaK"I think they have moved very slowly and didn't take it seriously," Maslanka said. "Something should have been done a year ago."LiNeBrEaKKaren Cameron lives on 10th Street across the street from the Buzzotta home. Despite currently living a safe distance away, she questions her home's future.LiNeBrEaK"If those houses go, then we are next," Cameron said. "Of course I am scared. I think those houses are going in."LiNeBrEaKLinda McKeehan lives on 11th behind a home with beachfront property. Living on the island since 1994, she said no one talked about the erosion then. Now, the problem is on the minds of many islanders.LiNeBrEaK"I think due to red tape, it has dragged on for too long," she said.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	November 27, 2008 Thursday   ALL S EDITION	Brown clouds of pollution threaten health, crops;  Smog-like plumes newest threat to global environment, U.N. says 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. H12  	536 words  	BEIJING -- A dirty brown haze sometimes more than a mile thick is darkening skies not only over vast areas of Asia, but also over the Middle East, southern Africa and the Amazon Basin, changing weather patterns around the world and threatening health and food supplies, the U.N. recently reported. LiNeBrEaKThe huge smog-like plumes, caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels and firewood, are known as "atmospheric brown clouds."LiNeBrEaKWhen mixed with emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for warming the earth's atmosphere like a greenhouse, they are the newest threat to the global environment, according to a report commissioned by the U.N. Environment Program.LiNeBrEaK"All of this points to an even greater and urgent need to look at emissions across the planet," said Achim Steiner, head of Kenya-based UNEP, which funded the report with backing from Italy, Sweden and the United States.LiNeBrEaKBrown clouds are caused by an unhealthy mix of particles, ozone and other chemicals that come from cars, coal-fired power plants, burning fields and wood-burning stoves. First identified by the report's lead researcher in 1990, the clouds were depicted as being more widespread and causing more environmental damage than previously known.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps most widely recognized as the haze this past summer over Beijing's Olympics, the clouds have been found to be more than a mile thick around glaciers in the Himalaya and Hindu Kush mountain ranges. They hide the sun and absorb radiation, leading to new worries not only about global climate change but about extreme weather conditions.LiNeBrEaK"All these have led to negative effects on water resources and crop yields," the report says.LiNeBrEaKHealth problems associated with particulate pollution, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, are linked to nearly 350,000 premature deaths in China and India every year, said Henning Rohde, a University of Stockholm scientist who worked on the study.LiNeBrEaKSoot levels in the air were reported to have risen alarmingly in 13 megacities: Bangkok, Beijing, Cairo, Dhaka, Karachi, Kolkata, Lagos, Mumbai, New Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Tehran.LiNeBrEaKBrown clouds were also cited as dimming the light by as much as 25 percent in some places including Karachi, New Delhi, Shanghai and Beijing.LiNeBrEaKThe phenomenon complicates the climate-change scenario, because the brown clouds also help cool the earth's surface and mask the impact of global warming by an average of 40 percent, according to the report.LiNeBrEaKAlthough it has been studied closely in Asia, the latest findings, conducted by an international collaboration of scientists, reveal that the brown cloud phenomenon is not unique to Asia, with pollution hot spots seen in North America, Europe, South Africa and South America.LiNeBrEaKMore specifically, researchers found, brown clouds are forming over eastern China; northeastern Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar; Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam; sub-Saharan Africa southward into Angola, Zambia and Zimbabwe; and the Amazon Basin in South America.LiNeBrEaKThe enormous cloud masses can move across continents within three to four days.LiNeBrEaKAlthough they also form over the eastern U.S. and Europe, winter snow and rain tend to lessen the impact in those areas.

Gulf Daily News (Manama, Bahrain)  	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	Don't let credit crunch hit 'green' investments!  	Geoffrey Bew, Gulf Daily News, Manama, Bahrain  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	437 words  	Nov. 27--THE global credit crunch should not be used as an excuse to avoid investing in clean energies, a government official said yesterday. National Oil and Gas Affairs Minister and Bapco chairman Dr Abdulhussain Mirza said the worldwide financial meltdown had already led to fewer development projects within the industry. LiNeBrEaKHe said, however, a failure to invest in new technology to help reduce the impact of climate change could have disastrous consequences for Bahrain's future.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is something which affects the future generations and it is the responsibility of leaders everywhere to take care and make sure that CO2 emissions are reduced," said Dr Mirza.LiNeBrEaK"People should be careful in their usage of energy and businesses should use latest technology because when you apply new technology you reduce emissions and limit the affects on the environment.LiNeBrEaK"This, to me, is very important regardless of whether there is a financial crisis or not."LiNeBrEaKDr Mirza was speaking after the opening ceremony of the Energy and Climate Change: Challenges and Opportunities conference, at the Gulf Hotel's Gulf Convention Centre.LiNeBrEaKMore than 100 people attended the event, including diplomats and representatives from the Asia Co-operation Dialogue.LiNeBrEaKThe two-day conference has been organised by the ACD in conjunction with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, National Oil and Gas Authority and the Public Commission for the Protection of Marine Resources, Environment and Wildlife.LiNeBrEaKDr Mirza believes one positive factor for consumers is that energy prices could be set to fall as a result of the credit crunch.LiNeBrEaK"For us in the oil and gas sector if there is a lower rate of progress and development that means there is less demand for energy," he told the GDN.LiNeBrEaK"In the short and medium term the prices of energy will fall.LiNeBrEaK"But the projection is that prices will go up again in the long-term because everybody needs energy and the population is growing and China and India are developing."LiNeBrEaKThe conference continues today with discussions about exchanging expertise between ACD member countries and how they can benefit from the financial tools and mechanisms related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 27, 2008 Thursday   3 STAR EDITION	Atlantic storms `relentless,' record-setting in 2008  	SETH BORENSTEIN, Associated Press  	A; Pg. 25  	321 words  	WASHINGTON - The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, which ends Sunday, appears to have attained Olympian heights, setting at least five weather records in the United States and Cuba.LiNeBrEaK"It was pretty relentless in a large number of big strikes," said Georgia Tech atmospheric sciences professor Judith Curry. "We just didn't have the huge monster where a lot of people lost their lives, but we had a lot of damage, a lot of damage." LiNeBrEaKData on death and damage are still being calculated.LiNeBrEaKSix consecutive named storms - Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike - struck the U.S. mainland, something that had not been seen in recorded history. Bertha spun about for 17 days, making it the longest lived storm in July.LiNeBrEaKTwo records involve storms hitting the same places repeatedly. Rain-heavy Fay was the only storm to hit one state - Florida - four times, doving heavy flood damage. A record three major storms smacked Cuba: Gustav, Ike and Paloma.LiNeBrEaKUpper air currents helped storms get bigger and focused them into a few places - Cuba and the U.S. Gulf Coast - said Gerry Bell, the top hurricane forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center. Five of the six storms that hit the United States this season struck the Gulf Coast.LiNeBrEaKAn average season has 11 named storms, six of which become hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKThis year there were eight hurricanes, of which five - Bertha, Gustav, Ike, Omar and Paloma - became major hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKThree of those - Gustav, Ike and Paloma - made "extreme" Category 4, where winds have to be at least 131 mph. "That's a lot," Bell said. "But it's typical of a very active season such as what we saw."LiNeBrEaKCurry said this year's large number of Category 4 storms indicates a "signal" of global warming. But Bell said the science is not quite clear on that.LiNeBrEaKAt the National Hurricane Center one thing is clear. Meteorologist and spokesman Dennis Feltgen said: "We're glad it's over."

The New York Times 	November 27, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Save the Economy, and the Planet  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 38  	569 words  	Environment ministers preparing for next week's talks on global warming in Poznan, Poland, have been sounding decidedly downbeat. From Paris to Beijing, the refrain is the same: This is no time to pursue ambitious plans to stop global warming. We can't deal with a financial crisis and reduce emissions at the same time. LiNeBrEaK  There is a very different message coming from this country. President-elect Barack Obama is arguing that there is no better time than the present to invest heavily in clean energy technologies. Such investment, he says, would confront the threat of unchecked warming, reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil and help revive the American economy.LiNeBrEaK  Call it what you will: a climate policy wrapped inside an energy policy wrapped inside an economic policy. By any name, it is a radical shift from the defeatism and denial that marked President Bush's eight years in office. If Mr. Obama follows through on his commitments, this country will at last provide the global leadership that is essential for addressing the dangers of climate change. LiNeBrEaK  In his first six months in office, Mr. Bush reneged on a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide and walked away from the Kyoto Protocol, a modest first effort to control global greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaK  Still two months from the White House, Mr. Obama has convincingly reaffirmed his main climate related promises. LiNeBrEaK  One is to impose (Congress willing) a mandatory cap on emissions aimed at reducing America's output of greenhouses gas by 80 percent by midcentury. According to mainstream scientists, that is the minimum necessary to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and avoid the worst consequences of global warming.  Mr. Obama's second pledge is to invest $15 billion a year to build a clean economy that cuts fuel costs and creates thousands of green jobs. That includes investments in solar power, wind power, clean coal (plants capable of capturing and storing carbon emissions) and, as part of any bailout, helping Detroit retool assembly lines to build a new generation of more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama has surrounded himself with like-minded people who have spent years immersed in the complexities of energy policy.LiNeBrEaK  His transition chief, John Podesta, was an early advocate of assisting the automakers  and of finding low-carbon alternatives to gasoline. Peter Orszag, his choice to run the Office of Management and Budget (where environmental initiatives went to die during the Bush years) is an expert on cap-and-trade programs to limit industrial emissions of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK  Success is not guaranteed. Last year, a far more modest climate-change bill fell well short of a simple majority in the Senate. At least on the surface, it seems counterintuitive to impose new regulations (and, in the short term anyway, higher energy costs) on a struggling economy. Mr. Obama will need all his oratorical power to make the opposite case.LiNeBrEaK  The historical landscape from Richard Nixon onward is littered with bold and unfulfilled promises to wean the nation from fossil fuels, especially imported oil. What is different now is the need to deal with the clear and present threat of global warming. What is also different is that the country has elected a president who believes that meeting the challenge of climate change is essential to the health of the planet and to America's economic future.

It disturbs me that Duke Energy plans to build a $2. 4 billion addition to its Cliffside steam station when studies show coal-fired power plants are the largest emitter of global-warming pollution in our country, responsible for 40 percent of pollution in the atmosphere. The coal industry tries to give the impression it uses clean coal, but coal will never be clean.LiNeBrEaKExpectant mothers are warned by our doctors to limit our intake of fish because of the levels of mercury we could introduce to our unborn children. Duke churns out hundreds of pounds of mercury. LiNeBrEaKTons of small airborne particles, such as nitrogen oxide, can cause chronic bronchitis and cause one in 15 babies to be born with asthma. Nitrogen oxide inflames the lungs, burning through lung tissue, making our babies' delicate lungs susceptible to respiratory illness.LiNeBrEaKWhen our babies are born, we want to give them the world.

In catering to this shrinking, narrow-minded group of self-inclusive, self-righteous Christians, they shut themselves off from the mainstream.LiNeBrEaKThe values and principles of love and acceptance of all your fellow men are the tenets of Jesus Christ. True Christians know this and maybe in this election year asked themselves, "What would Jesus do?" and voted their answer.LiNeBrEaKDebbie CookLiNeBrEaKHigh PointLiNeBrEaKIf lawsuit had stood, facts would come outLiNeBrEaKI agree with Joan Hunt (letter, Nov. 18) that U.S. Sen.-elect Kay Hagan should have proceeded with her lawsuit. Then we would have found out the truth. She received contributions as a result of attending the meeting in Boston (News and Record) and she knew who was giving the party.LiNeBrEaKShe tried to hide from the camera but was caught anyway. Her Christian belief did not cost much unless she was there to try to convert people (which I doubt). She screams that she believes in God. Well, so does Satan. Does she believe in Jesus? Yes, I do wish it had gone to trial.LiNeBrEaKHagan is a tax-raising, money-spending liberal, and to think a lot of people voted for her just because she was born in Shelby. Just wait and see what she does for you and get back to me.LiNeBrEaKGeorge SmithLiNeBrEaKGreensboroLiNeBrEaKMost Godless act of all: killing innocent childrenLiNeBrEaKI have noticed the word "Godless" coming up in letters to the editor. I would like to define the word "Godless" with some examples.LiNeBrEaKThere is the biggest sin in this country: abortion. The Bible says, "He who sheds innocent blood, his blood shall be shed." It also says, "Anyone who harms these little ones, it is better that a millstone be around their neck."LiNeBrEaKSince Roe v. Wade, there have been more than 40 million innocent babies slaughtered in this country. The most dangerous place today for children is in the mother's womb. People who take part in this practice or laws making it legal should be tried just like someone who murders someone on the street.LiNeBrEaKThere is a big difference in people who call themselves Christians and people who truly are born-again Christians. Any church that advocates abortion is not a church but a social club or gathering place. The Sixth Commandment says, "Thou shalt not kill." I guess some people do not include innocent babies in this.LiNeBrEaKI am glad my daughter didn't choose to slaughter my grandchildren before they were born. It is ironic so many people today want to turn loose convicted murderers and kill innocent children. We say the world is getting better. This is sometimes hard to believe.LiNeBrEaKKenneth WilliamsLiNeBrEaKEdenLiNeBrEaKImpeach Bush, Cheney?

I agree that it is vitally important that these leaders be officially censured for the deceptive and destructive practices of their corrupt administration.LiNeBrEaKTheir record is eight years of immoral and shameful activities.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 27, 2008 Thursday   Sunrise Edition	Vast oil sands hide dirty environmental secret  	HOWARD WITT, Chicago Tribune News Service  	Wire News  	946 words  	SUMMARY: Resource   | The Canadian oil calls for ecological risky methods to extract it, advisers sayLiNeBrEaKVast oil sands hide dirty environmental secretLiNeBrEaKHOWARD WITTLiNeBrEaKFORT McMURRAY, Canada --From the far north of Canada through a web of transcontinental pipelines down to a network of refineries ringing the Chicago area, a new supply of precious oil has begun flowing into the gas tanks of more Americans.LiNeBrEaKThe oil is from a source so vast it could one day furnish close to half of U.S. oil needs for 50 years or more. LiNeBrEaKThe Canadian oil is stable and reliable. It promises to substantially reduce U.S. dependence on volatile Middle Eastern sources of oil. Much of it is profitable to produce, even with oil prices hovering around $50 per barrel. That explains why some of the world's largest oil conglomerates have invested billions of dollars in Canadian oil despite wild short-term swings in international oil prices.LiNeBrEaKBut few know the new petroleum bonanza is drawn from dense, tarry deposits known as oil sands and it ranks as the dirtiest oil on the planet, according to environmentalists. Extracting it causes widespread ecological damage and could accelerate global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn Canada, where pitched debate over expanded oil sands development is under way, critics say the oil is not worth the environmental costs of extracting it. Oil company officials, joined by Canadian government leaders, counter that they are investing in new technologies to reduce the ecological risks.LiNeBrEaK9 percent from CanadaLiNeBrEaKAlready, about 9 percent of the oil the U.S. imports comes from Canada's oil sands. As new pipelines are being planned to carry more of the heavy crude oil to Midwestern refineries, such as BP's expanding facility in Whiting, Ind., the oil sands debate is coming to the United States.LiNeBrEaK"The rush to develop these oil sands flies in the face of the international image of Canada as a steward of the environment," said Gary Stewart, senior adviser to International Boreal Conservation Campaign, based in Seattle. "Yes, the world can use this oil, but at what cost? I don't think Americans would want it if they knew how dirty it is."LiNeBrEaKThe oil does not gush freely when tapped with a traditional well. Instead, it's bound up in subterranean sand, as black and dense as a hockey puck and less viscous than peanut butter. It must either be clawed out of surface mines or steamed from deep underground.LiNeBrEaKTo access the oil sands deposits from strip mines requires churning up huge tracts of ancient boreal forest and polluting so much clean water with poisonous chemicals that the resulting waste ponds can be seen from outer space. Last spring, a flock of 500 migratory ducks perished after landing in one of the waste ponds.LiNeBrEaKIn situ miningLiNeBrEaKGetting at the deeper underground deposits, in a process known as "in situ" mining, requires huge amounts of steam to liquefy the oil so it can be pumped to the surface. Producing the steam requires burning enough natural gas each day to heat 3 million North American homes.LiNeBrEaKThe intensive burning of natural gas is particularly alarming to climatologists, because it sends three times more climate-changing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than drilling for conventional oil.LiNeBrEaKBy any measure, the oil sands deposits are massive. Some 173 billion barrels of oil lie beneath the province of Alberta across an area roughly the size of New York state, making up the second-largest proven oil reserve in the world behind Saudi Arabia.LiNeBrEaKAlthough oil companies are postponing some planned oil sands developments, most experts believe that's only temporary, given predictions that prices will increase once the global economic recession ends.LiNeBrEaK"It's difficult to come up with new sources of supply, and the oil sands represent a politically stable and massive resource that could help meet North America's demand for many decades to come," said Matt Fox, senior vice president for oil sands at ConocoPhillips Canada. "This is a major part of the future."LiNeBrEaKFederal and provincial officials in Canada, eager to reap royalties and thousands of new jobs, are aggressively promoting the oil sands boom. Fort McMurray, the frontier town of 80,000 that is the gateway to the oil sands fields, has seen such wild growth --and resulting housing shortages --that the average single-family home sells for nearly $600,000. Workers are so scarce that oil companies build airstrips next to new oil sands mines so they can fly them in on chartered 737s.LiNeBrEaK"A carbon-based economy is still going to be a very good business for a very long time," said Alberta Deputy Premier Ron Stevens.LiNeBrEaKNew rules set upLiNeBrEaKOfficials from government and the oil industry say they are working to mitigate the environmental effects of oil sands development.LiNeBrEaKThey note that new regulations require all industries in Alberta to immediately reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent.LiNeBrEaKThey also say the oil sands strip mines and wastewater ponds are required to be cleaned and reclaimed, although Stevens acknowledged that because the mines are active for up to 50 years, "it does take a long time and it's a work in progress as we speak."LiNeBrEaKLate last year, Democrats in the U.S. Congress proposed legislation to block the federal government from purchasing any foreign oil that results in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil --a definition squarely aimed at Canada's oil sands.LiNeBrEaKThe rule is currently under dispute by the oil industry.LiNeBrEaK"It's a warning shot," said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of the Canada program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This is a sign that the U.S. is starting to move toward caring about not spending taxpayer dollars on fuels that exacerbate global warming."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 27, 2008 Thursday   SOONER EDITION	FLORIDA'S CORAL GAINS PROTECTION STATUS  	David Fleshler, McClatchy Newspapers  	HEALTH, SCIENCE, MEDICINE and TECHNOLOGY; Pg. A-3  	300 words  	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- More than 1,300 square miles of ocean floor from Boynton Beach, Fla., to the farthest islands of the Keys yesterday were designated a federal protected area for coral, in a conservation action that could affect beach-widening, fishing, shipping and other activities along the coast. LiNeBrEaKElkhorn and staghorn corals, once among the most abundant reef-building corals, have declined by 90 percent in many areas because of global warming, ship groundings, storm damage and over-fishing, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. The service protected them as threatened species in 2006, the first corals given that designation, and as part of that process the government is required to designate habitat that is critical to their survival.LiNeBrEaKThe designation does not mean immediate limits on any activities or the establishment of no-fishing zones. But it adds a level of scrutiny to government actions, such as issuing permits for a beach widening project that could smother coral in sand; what types of fishing gear to allow or whether to ban fertilizers that could be washed into the ocean.LiNeBrEaK"It will lead to more forethought and awareness on the proposals that may affect these areas," said Sarah Heberling, natural resource specialist for the fisheries service. "I think this is another great step forward for these two species."LiNeBrEaKThe entire protected area designated yesterday encompasses 2,959 square miles on the coasts of southeast Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.LiNeBrEaKBut the Center for Biological Diversity, a San Francisco environmental group that had filed the original petition to have these species protected, said the designation of critical habitat falls short because it fails to call for steps to combat global warming, which threatens coral habitat.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	LAO to the rescue;  It shreds claims climate policy will spur boom 		OPINION; Pg. B-6  	471 words  	For more than two years, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, leading California Democrats and environmentalists have insisted that AB 32 -- a 2006 law requiring California businesses and residents to use cleaner but far more costly sources of energy by 2020 -- would actually prove to be an economic bonanza. They asserted it would position the state to lead the world in green technology and reduce societal costs stemming from air pollution. LiNeBrEaKThis claim falls apart under the slightest inspection. Sure, some well-positioned industries might thrive. But how could sharply increasing the operating costs of most businesses and reducing the disposable income of most individuals help the overall economy? Despite its illogic, Schwarzenegger's argument has largely gone unchallenged.LiNeBrEaKThankfully, that is no longer the case. Last week, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office released a study of the California Air Resources Board's "scoping plan" for implementing AB 32 and related measures. In low-key fashion, the study demolished the happy talk of the governor and his allies.LiNeBrEaKThe LAO said the air board's report showing the "purported net economic benefit" of emission-reduction laws used "inconsistent and incomplete" methodology in which researchers ignored or downplayed evidence that countered the economic bonanza thesis.LiNeBrEaKHere's the most egregious example: Any measure that reduced a company's greenhouse gases in any way was deemed "cost-effective." By this standard, it's cost-effective for a company to go out of business.LiNeBrEaKWe asked the governor's staff to respond. What we got was a boilerplate statement repeating Schwarzenegger's happy talk and ignoring the LAO's conclusions.LiNeBrEaKThis is unacceptable. In the governor's own words, the LAO has an "impeccable reputation" and has set a "high standard" with its analysis of state issues. When the LAO raises profound questions about the wisdom of a major state policy, state leaders are obligated to take these questions seriously.LiNeBrEaKWe have no doubt Schwarzenegger sincerely believes that it is essential for California, the nation and the world to tackle global warming. But the rhetoric the governor employs to push his cause is devoid of candor.LiNeBrEaKThis was underscored by recent news reports about the European Union, China and India -- three of America's biggest trade rivals. All are rethinking recent commitments to cleaner fuels because of the likelihood that the added cost could make it more difficult for their already-reeling economics to rebound. In Europe and Asia, you see, there is a matter-of-fact acceptance that a shift toward cleaner energy has a downside.LiNeBrEaKThe contrast with Schwarzenegger's pretend world could not be more striking. Perhaps we can import some honesty from Beijing, New Delhi or Brussels. On climate change, there's little to be found in Sacramento.

The Santa Fe New Mexican (New Mexico)  	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	Stars of the stage: Capital High School retains state title  	John Sena, The Santa Fe New Mexican  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	789 words  	Nov. 27--After winning a state championship in the one-act play competition last fall, Capital High School students wanted to make sure they did their best to defend their title this September.LiNeBrEaKThey thought carefully about what they'd perform, trying to pick something that would play to their strengths and stand out among the other competitors.LiNeBrEaKSo how and why did they pick Artistic Inspiration, a comedy by Don Zolidis about two writers trying to make it big by writing the worst play ever? LiNeBrEaK"One student said, 'I like it already. It sounds like the author's name is tonsillitis,' " laughed Bernadette Pena, the school's drama teacher.LiNeBrEaKWell, that wasn't the only reason the group chose the play.LiNeBrEaKThe play called for seven or eight roles -- most one-act plays at the competition had only two or three -- making it an ensemble piece, which the group excels at, Pena said.LiNeBrEaKAnd its outrageous plot concerning two writers trying to write plays -- ranging from a cautionary tale about the dangers of huffing to a global warming drama about Eskimos -- made the play one of the few comedies at the competition.LiNeBrEaK"It's a way to differentiate ourselves," said Anton Terrell, a junior at the school who played one of the writers, "a way to make people remember us."LiNeBrEaKThe plan worked. The group walked away with its second consecutive state championship. Various members of the group also won individual awards for acting and technical categories.LiNeBrEaK"State was awesome," said Sara Schwebke, a senior at Capital. "We actually got a standing ovation."LiNeBrEaKApparently the judges, who had seen nothing but dramas before Capital's performance, were ready for a laugh. "The judges were watching like 10 plays," Anton said. "That can get really boring."LiNeBrEaKStudents in the Capital Academy of Performing Arts are anything but boring, according to Pena.LiNeBrEaK"There's always messing around," said 17-year-old CharliRay Rael. "We do a lot of improvisation games, which is basically just joking around."LiNeBrEaKThat doesn't mean, though, that the actors take their job lightly. "We're always taught to be professional, no matter what," said Marcos Barela, a junior at the school.LiNeBrEaKAnd like many high-school groups, whether it's an athletic team or academic club, CAPA kids spend a lot of time together. "I think the reason that we're good at this is because we're all friends and we're like a family," Marcos said.LiNeBrEaKThe close-knit feel and past success of the group is what drew Anton to the school. "CAPA is one of the only reasons I chose to go to Capital," he said. "It's a home away from home."LiNeBrEaKPena, who is in her third year as director of the program, took over CAPA from Brad Fairbanks, who built a solid reputation before leaving to teach at Santa Fe Preparatory.LiNeBrEaKPena came from a dance and choreography background and knew she had big shoes to fill. This fall's results, she said, have reassured her that things are going well with the program.LiNeBrEaKAs for the rest of the year, CAPA has its annual Holiday Follies show scheduled for 2 and 7 p.m. on Dec. 6. Because it's the 20th anniversary of Capital High School, the shows will feature alumni of the program, Pena said.LiNeBrEaKThe group also will perform its usual spring musical. This year, CAPA is scheduled to perform Seussical on Feb. 25 at the Lensic Performing Arts Center.LiNeBrEaKContact John Sena at 986-3079 or jsena@sfnewmexican.comLiNeBrEaKON AND OFF THE STAGELiNeBrEaKList of Capital High School theater students who won top honors in statewide competition:LiNeBrEaKMonique Baca: First, set/propsLiNeBrEaKMarcos Barela: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKJaime Ferrer-Bringas: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKMiguel Chavez: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKLeonard Quintana: First, set/propsLiNeBrEaKKimberly Martinez: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKLaura Aguayo: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKCheyenne Parke: First, set/propsLiNeBrEaKAngel Lucero: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKAmber Barnes: First, set managementLiNeBrEaKJake Anderson: First, set/propsLiNeBrEaKDarvi Soto: First, set/propsLiNeBrEaKSarah Velez: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKShariz Cummings: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKAnais Gonzales: First, stage managementLiNeBrEaKCharliRay Rael: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKSara Schwebke: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKGabrielle Gonzales: First, props managementLiNeBrEaKCarrie Carr: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKKatrina Marin-Demers: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKGraciela Ruiz: First, serious monologueLiNeBrEaKAnton Terrell: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKAdriana Zamora: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKRaphael Aviles: First, one-act playLiNeBrEaKEveryone: Sweepstakes and first in state	THEATER and DRAMA (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (90%); THEATER (90%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (89%); VISUAL and PERFORMING ARTS (78%); EAR NOSE and THROAT DISORDERS (55%); GLOBAL WARMING (52%); HIGH SCHOOLS (90%)  				General  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (82%)  		November 27, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Santa Fe New Mexican   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081127-SF-Stars-of-the-stage-Capital-High-School-retains-state-title-1127  	SF  													
San Bernardino County Sun (California) 	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	County's future at risk  		OPINION  	498 words  	With all the controversy surrounding San Bernardino County Assessor Bill Postmus, why is he still employed?LiNeBrEaKAnyone else involved with similar accusations against them would have been terminated by now. Why isn't the Board of Supervisors doing anything about this, or why is it taking so long if they are? LiNeBrEaKWe pay an astronomical amount of property taxes, although our property value seems to be declining with the state of the economy.LiNeBrEaKThe more I read about Postmus and his allegations to his supposed drug addictions and his poor decisions in hiring and running the Assessor's Office, the more I'm concerned about future of the county.LiNeBrEaKD. PATELLiNeBrEaKSan BernardinoLiNeBrEaKDo as Japan doesLiNeBrEaKWe have an easy fix to the problem of the American government bailing out car manufactures and other businesses.LiNeBrEaKJapan taxes American cars up to 70 percent - wonder why they don't sell at $60,000. They also have many laws that back their home manufactures. For example, like in professional baseball, you are only allowed to use Japanese equipment, gloves, balls and bats.LiNeBrEaKWe need to start taxing Japan and China the same way they do us and it would start forcing Americans to buy and use American products again and start supporting the country that supports them.LiNeBrEaKThis is such a simple fix, and just putting America on the same playing field as Asian countries. For some reason, American people would rather buy foreign products and sit back and wonder why our economy is falling.LiNeBrEaKSTEVE PORTIASLiNeBrEaKSan BernardinoLiNeBrEaKWhat's importantLiNeBrEaKWith the election over we can get back to the important things that confront us daily: global warming, bailouts, handouts and more stimulus money coming in the mail.LiNeBrEaKThere is a flaw in government trying to make all of America rich. It buries our form of production. It's only a matter of time that all of us have our pockets full of money but the stores are empty.LiNeBrEaKThings must be produced or all the money we print is worthless. Government employees are mostly nonproductive people. Roadblocks are laid by government and we perish in a struggle to follow rules put down by government. The rules are printed in many different languages, though, so we are all confused.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming, the hoax of the present, is so misconstrued by media and those who profit from the created fear that folks don't stop and introduce a bit of "horse sense."LiNeBrEaKA very small collective gang of "scientists" reap their rewards for their collective nonsense. The true people of science know the real situation regarding "global warming." They are the silent majority who chose not to soil their field of duty and work.LiNeBrEaKIt is a known fact that those glaciers have gained extreme cold and growth from deep inside. The small melting on the outside has only been going on for eons and eons. It is a natural procedure, folks, so don't purchase your rubber boats or expect the Pacific Ocean to come sloshing across our western mountian ranges, OK?LiNeBrEaKGod bless all.

The Times Leader (Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania)  	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	Environmental advocacy the focus of new W-B office: Citizens for Pa.'s Future opens Dec. 4. Public education and awareness of state policy plans are on office head's agenda.  	Rory Sweeney, The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	363 words  	Nov. 27--With environmental issues surfacing more frequently and residents becoming increasingly conscious of their regional environmental legacy, a statewide environmental-advocacy group has decided to open an office in Wilkes-Barre. LiNeBrEaKThe one-person office for Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future will hold an open house from 5 to 7 p.m. Dec. 4 at the Bicentennial Building at 15 Public Square. The office is immediately on the right after entering the building's front door.LiNeBrEaKThe public is invited, but must register at www.pennfuture.org/events or call 1-800-321-7775.LiNeBrEaK"This is a growing area and people from NEPA have been contacting us in increasing numbers. There was clearly a need," Pam Fendrock, who will run the office, wrote in an e-mail. "People look to us for guidance, legal support and clarification on these and other environmental and economic issues."LiNeBrEaKHer main duties will be continuing the public environmental education she previously did part-time for the organization, Fendrock noted, as well as raising awareness of state policy proposals and coordinating a local global-warming conference.LiNeBrEaK"Our legal team has worked on water-related issues for years. Other staff has consulted on renewable-energy projects. With the increasing interest in Marcellus shale, we foresee work related to that issue," she wrote.LiNeBrEaKThe new office is the organization's sixth. PennFuture, as it's referred to, works throughout the state on a variety of environmental and health issues and is often seen as influential.LiNeBrEaKIts former chief executive officer and president, John Hanger, was recently tapped by Gov. Ed Rendell as the acting-secretary of the state Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKRory Sweeney, a Times Leader staff writer, may be reached at 970-7418.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	November 27, 2008 Thursday 	'Be It Ever So Humboldt' a youthful take on our community  	Mary Anderson, Redwood Times, Garberville, Calif.  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	659 words  	Nov. 27--On Dec. 4, 5 and 6, the Recycled Youth will present their latest look at the world as seen from high school, the best age for detecting both hypocrisy and signs of hope.LiNeBrEaKThis unique and very special theater arts program is once again under the direction of Joani Rose, assisted by her two self-described sidekicks, Barbara Penny and Susan Alexander. Twenty-three young performers, some veterans of the process now in their senior year of high school, have put together a program with a local focus this year, one that opens up to scrutiny some of the thorniest issues of our time.LiNeBrEaKIn years past, Rose says, the troupe has come together to produce skits about very global issues, such as the global warming and making war around the world, but this year the issues that the group took up are all close to home. LiNeBrEaK"One of the things that came up immediately," Rose says of the writing stage of their production, "was the challenge of growing up in the marijuana culture. We've never really explored that one before in Recycled Youth, except for the one year we talked about the drug at Reggae on the River."LiNeBrEaKThis year's group also took up the topic of death. Rose says that many of the kids in the company have lost one or more friends in accidents related to drinking alcohol and they wanted to address the impact of that on their lives.LiNeBrEaK"This particular piece is very interesting," Penny says, "because it's compassionate to everybody involved. Their idea is that they are really trying hard to find a sober driver, but things come up around that. It's a different way of looking at it and the real stuff they're dealing with."LiNeBrEaKAn examination of homelessness is also included in this year's production. When the students expressed an interest in that subject, Rose invited Deborah Carey, who is with Poverty is Not a Crime, and who works with the homeless.LiNeBrEaK"She came in and talked to us about her work," Rose says, "and, of course, it's all around us."LiNeBrEaKThe students also collaborated on a skit about school funding, built around a trip many of them made to Sacramento to talk to legislators about the impact of school budget cuts on students. They didn't find any legislators to meet with them, and this made a not-so-positive impression on the students.LiNeBrEaKOther topics tackled include gender identity in a piece called Mellow-gender, and the absence of fast food in our community.LiNeBrEaKAlong with exploring the things that bother them the most, and perhaps coming to understand their feelings about them, Recycled Youth gives its young participants some basic theatrical skills to take with them through their future lives. They learn to work together as an ensemble, to feel comfortable in their bodies, to memorize their lines, and to work onstage with poise and confidence.LiNeBrEaKRose says that she and Penny and Alexander learn from the students as well.LiNeBrEaK"The kids are on the cutting edge of where we're going," Rose says. "It's fed us so much to work with them. Kids are rife with ideas and are on the edge of coming into their power. It's powerful for them to have their voices expressed in the community."LiNeBrEaK"Be It Ever So Humboldt" will play at the Mateel Community Center. Doors open at 7: 30 p.m. and the show starts at 8 p.m. Tickets are $10 for adults and $5 for anyone under 19 and can be purchased at the door. Ticket sales help fund the program, along with generous support from the Mateel Community Center, the McLean Foundation and the North Coast Cultural Trust. The troupe also gets wholehearted support from the parents of the actors.

LiNeBrEaKObama referred to this type of energy supply as "a 19th century fossil fuel that is dirty, dwindling, and dangerously expensive".LiNeBrEaKCanada's oil sands, located mainly in the western province of Alberta, are a bountiful source of such fuels.LiNeBrEaKHoping to prevent the loss of a valuable market, Canada moved with surprising diplomatic speed to introduce a trade-off that plays to two of the president-elect's core campaign pledges: weaning America from the 'foreign oil' stranglehold and introducing tougher measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKDouble-edged swordLiNeBrEaKStephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, has also proposed creating a continental carbon emissions trading regime in return for guarantees that the American energy markets will continue to buy all of Canada's exportable oil.LiNeBrEaKA trading system would set caps on the amount of carbon-based pollutants companies can emit; it financially penalises overpolluters but rewards those who control their emissions below the ceiling figure.LiNeBrEaKHowever, some analysts are sceptical of Harper's offer.LiNeBrEaK"Harper's overture is pure political opportunism," Andrew Nikiforuk, the author of the just-published Tar Sands: Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent, recently said.LiNeBrEaK"Given the Canadian government's successive failure to control climate-disrupting emissions from the tar sands, Harper wants to 'continentalise' the problem and thereby secure exemptions for the tar sands -- now a carbon making nation within Canada," Nikiforuk said.LiNeBrEaKClimate change agreementLiNeBrEaKHarper may face an uphill battle to convince his US counterparts of the merits of  carbon-trading mechanism.LiNeBrEaKChristopher Sands, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC, goes a step further and says: "I think that Canada does need to show greater sensitivity to the arguments of its critics that oil from the oil sands is 'dirty'."LiNeBrEaKAt a meeting of American mayors in Miami last year, Canadian fuel emissions were sharply criticised.LiNeBrEaKIn a final statement on the issue, the mayors said: "The production of tar sands oil from Canada emits approximately three times the carbon dioxide pollution per barrel as does conventional oil production and significantly damages Canada's Boreal forest ecosystem -- the world's largest carbon storehouse."LiNeBrEaKSands says that Canada needs to propose establishing a North American climate change agreement .LiNeBrEaK"After all, [it is] an appeal to the new (Obama) administration to undertake the difficult task of designing and implementing a complicated bit of legislation and then imposing it on US states that have, in the absence of federal leadership, begun to act on their own."LiNeBrEaKCanada's economic woesLiNeBrEaKCanada is already required to guarantee oil supplies to the US market under the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) negotiated in 1993.LiNeBrEaKThis cosy arrangement could be scrutinised if and when Obama fulfils his campaign promise to revisit the terms of Nafta.LiNeBrEaKGiven that Canada is America's largest supplier of oil, petroleum products, gas, electricity and uranium, with an average of $1. 7 billion (Cdn) worth of goods crossing the border every day, the Nafta re-negotiations and the disdain for oil from the tar sands could further weaken the Canadian economy.LiNeBrEaKThe Harper government hopes Obama's goals will be tempered with the realism of uncertain economic times and the implicit linkage between energy, the environment and the economy.LiNeBrEaKJim Prentice, the Canadian environment minister, echoed that hope.LiNeBrEaK"When you're talking about the environment, you're also talking about energy, and when you're talking about energy, you're also talking about the economy," he said shortly after the US election.LiNeBrEaK"No closer friends"LiNeBrEaKHarper called Obama immediately following his victory, reminding the president-elect that "there could be no closer friends and allies," and that "our most important relationship is always with the United States."LiNeBrEaKHowever, given the Canadian government's conservative leanings, and Obama's contrary orientation, there are bound to be teething troubles.LiNeBrEaKCanadians remember the last time Washington had a young, charismatic Democrat and Canada had a Conservative leader: President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker.LiNeBrEaKIt was also the time when the US was involved in a standoff with Cuba and wanted to position US missiles on Canadian soil, both of which did not find favour with Diefenbaker.LiNeBrEaKIn one testy exchange, the Canadian prime minister is reported to have told Kennedy: "We are a power, not a puppet."LiNeBrEaKThe rhetoric this time around is just getting started, but Jim Flaherty, Canada's finance minister, has already told the new incoming powerbrokers that he sees his nation as an "emerging energy superpower."LiNeBrEaKWhether superpower or not, an early test will come late in January when the new US president begins receiving foreign heads of state.LiNeBrEaKBowing to tradition by inviting the Canadian prime minister as his first guest in the White House may prove to be an early good sign.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition	Perry: Emission caps could ruin economy  	Asher Price AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  	BUSINESS; Pg. B09  	607 words  	Federal caps on greenhouse gas carbon dioxide emissions would suffocate Texas' economy, Gov. Rick Perry said Tuesday as the state tries to fend off such limits.LiNeBrEaKThe caps are a threat that could "run this nation's strongest economy right off the tracks and into the ditch," Perry said at a news conference.LiNeBrEaKThe news conference came as Perry submitted a report to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which is considering placing regulations on the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe report says that by slapping costs on businesses, such regulations would "create extreme economic hardships, regulatory uncertainty, and immeasurable standards."LiNeBrEaKBut some state environmentalists and lawmakers say Texas, the state with the highest carbon dioxide emissions, should start working with federal regulators to help its businesses before Washington decides what steps to take.LiNeBrEaKTuesday's news conference, during which state leaders took several shots at Washington, highlights how the upcoming change of presidential administrations has transformed the relationship between Austin and Washington. With President George W. Bush in power, Texas and federal environmental regulators were in step, keen to limit rules. But President-elect Barack Obama, supported by Democratic majorities in Congress, has signaled that he wants to cap greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The idea that just because there's been an administrative change and some would say the inevitability of these types of regulations does not change our attitude or change our effort to bring some reality and truth to the issues here," Perry said.LiNeBrEaKWashington could learn from Texas, which leads the nation in wind power, said Barry Smitherman, chairman of the Public Utility Commission and an author of the report.LiNeBrEaK"Washington should be following our lead, rather than the other way around," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe state has long resisted regulations on carbon dioxide emissions, arguing that they would unfairly burden the state's businesses, ratchet up energy costs and wrap Texans in red tape.LiNeBrEaK"Reductions in CO2 will likely be achieved by reducing coal-produced electricity, resulting in less fuel diversity, higher reliance on natural gas, decreased electric reliability, and higher prices for consumers," the report says.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Texas supported the EPA as it argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that the greenhouse gas is not a dangerous air pollutant. But the Supreme Court sided with Massachusetts and a host of other states challenging the EPA's interpretation, leading to the possibility of regulations.LiNeBrEaKPerry has questioned the link between human activities and global warming.LiNeBrEaK"I've heard Al Gore talk about man-made global warming so much that I'm starting to think that his mouth is the leading source of all that supposedly deadly carbon dioxide," Perry told a gathering of California Republicans in September 2007.LiNeBrEaKThe report that Perry is submitting to the EPA as his official comment was authored by Railroad Commission Chairman Michael Williams, an elected official who counts coal and energy companies among his chief campaign donors; Smitherman; and Bryan Shaw, a commissioner at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKWith the change in Washington, Texas should work with regulators to get credit for its wind power and acknowledgement of its energy work, said state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin.LiNeBrEaK"We should be very careful that we don't set up Texas to be in opposition in Washington," he said, "so that a state that is a leader in terms of energy production isn't unduly penalized for what it does for the rest of the country."LiNeBrEaKasherprice@statesman.com; 445-3643	EMISSIONS (93%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (89%); LEGISLATORS (79%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (77%); WIND ENERGY (76%); NATURAL GAS PRICES (75%); POLITICAL PARTIES (74%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (73%); US PRESIDENTS (88%); SUPREME COURTS (60%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%)  			RICK PERRY (94%); GEORGE W BUSH (55%); BARACK OBAMA (55%); AL GORE (51%); MICHAEL J WILLIAMS (50%)  	TEXAS, USA (95%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	November 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved  																
Beaver County Times (Pennsylvania)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Flawed thinking  	Beaver County Times, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	415 words  	Nov. 26--In the waning days of his presidency, George W. Bush is attempting to ensure that the policies his administration has put into effect survive long after he leaves the White House. LiNeBrEaKOne such initiative would relax regulations protecting endangered plants and animals in order to speed up development projects that might invade their habitats.LiNeBrEaKAs it stands now, independent scientists advise the government on the harmful effects of a new dam or highway on wildlife and plant species. The scientists sign off on development projects and, in many cases, modify design plans to better protect species.LiNeBrEaKBut the Bush administration doesn't want some big horn sheep or polar bear -- both listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- to hold up plans for a new parking lot.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press reports that new regulations favored by the administration would eliminate scientific input and permit federal bureaucrats to make determinations based on ... who knows what?LiNeBrEaKIf the regulations are changed, federal agencies in charge of building, authorizing and funding projects would effectively act as judge, jury and executioner of our endangered species.LiNeBrEaKCongressional Democrats have vowed to throw a monkey wrench into the Bush legacy plans.LiNeBrEaK"This is a shining example of the brash giveaways to industry we expect to see during the Bush administration's final days, and a new Congress will stand at the ready top use our authority to overturn this and other harmful rules," said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who chairs the House select committee for energy independence and global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe fish and wildlife service lists 1,358 species of endangered plants and animals, everything from the above-mentioned polar bears to gray wolves. Twenty-four of those species are found in Pennsylvania.LiNeBrEaKWe should remember that it wasn't so long ago that the bald eagle -- that great American symbol -- was on this list.LiNeBrEaKThe federal government would be wise to let scientists -- not the bureaucrats -- determine which plants and animals are important enough to keep around.

The Boston Herald 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   ALL EDITIONS	THE WORKING STIFF;   Scowl! You're on candid Wall St. camera 	By Darren Garnick  	FINANCE; Pg. 026  	509 words  	Most of us grimace at the endless stream of Wall Street bailout stories. Matt Robison keeps a scrapbook.LiNeBrEaKThe 25-year-old Brooklyn resident is the brainchild behind ``The Brokers with Hands on Their Faces Blog,'' an ongoing collection of Web-clipped photos that chronicle anguish, fear, depression, sweat and agony straight from the source. LiNeBrEaKRobison, who works at a Manhattan publishing company, resists the urge to include sarcastic captions with the pictures. In fact, he doesn't offer any commentary at all.LiNeBrEaK``With these photos, there are a number of layers to laugh at,'' he says in an e-mail. ``There is the poor broker, there is the photographer waiting to take that perfect photo of the poor broker, there is the media who ran with these photos for several days straight, and then there is me, this guy who collected them and made a blog, which is totally ridiculous as well.LiNeBrEaK``What I found ultimately fascinating about these photos was how they were able to so perfectly capture the humanity of a group which is so notorious for being soulless and inhuman,'' Robison writes. ``They fail just like us. And that's comforting, even if it also means a global recession.''LiNeBrEaKThe blogger claims he consistently gets about 3,000 hits a day, following a high of 40,000 views one day last month when he was featured on a few popular Internet sites.LiNeBrEaKWith that kind of following, maybe ``The Brokers with Hands on Their Faces Blog'' will become a coffee-table book. If anyone can afford it.LiNeBrEaKThe Germans call it ``Schadenfreude,'' the feeling of pleasure derived from others' misery.LiNeBrEaKI first heard that term on an episode of ``Boston Legal,'' in which criminal defense attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) argues that jurors must ignore their natural inclination to want to see his client punished.LiNeBrEaKBut we can't totally ignore Schadenfreude. If it were a stock, it would be enjoying all-time highs right now.LiNeBrEaKA Facebook friend who usually sends out ``Kumbaya'' messages about music education and global warming just sent me an invitation to join the ``Society for the Appreciation of Pictures of Stockbrokers in Visible Pain.''LiNeBrEaKThe group, which has almost 3,500 members, features photos similar to the ones posted by Robison.LiNeBrEaKThe society's mission statement: ``Let friends know the curious joy you have for the slapped forehead, the pursed lips, the red eyes, the deep-focus-blurred background, the slumped figure. Tell them, tell everyone: The dancers of capitalism are performing for us!''LiNeBrEaKEven if I figure out what their pretentious dancing metaphor means, I have no desire to join this shortsighted organization.LiNeBrEaKThe sweat. The fatigue. The slumping posture. If they haven't already, all of these things are coming to a house near you.LiNeBrEaKWe're the ones that have to pay billions in taxes to make all these stockbrokers happy again.LiNeBrEaK(Robison's scrapbook of unhappy stockbrokers is posted at: http://brokershandsontheirfacesblog.tumblr.com)LiNeBrEaKDarren Garnick's ``The Working Stiff'' column runs every Wednesday.

A13  	786 words  	POLITICAL NOTEBOOKLiNeBrEaKRepublican presidential candidate John McCain confirmed yesterday that he plans to seek reelection to the US Senate from Arizona in 2010.LiNeBrEaKMcCain said that if he wins, he is committed to serving the full six-year term. Asked about running for president again, he replied, laughing, "I do not envision a scenario that would entail that."LiNeBrEaKAsked about the lessons of the election, McCain said Republicans have to return to fiscal discipline and said Americans are very worried about the economy. LiNeBrEaKAt the press conference in Phoenix, his first since the election, McCain also continued to talk up his running mate, Sarah Palin, whom he called "a breath of fresh air that swept the country." "I think Governor Palin's future is very bright," McCain said. "I think she did a great job of energizing our base. I'm very proud of her."LiNeBrEaKGLOBE STAFF LiNeBrEaKIn new post, Kerry plansLiNeBrEaKto focus on global warmingLiNeBrEaKOn the eve of going to a major conference on global climate change, Senator John F. Kerry said yesterday that he will make the issue a priority as the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.LiNeBrEaKAnd that, he said, is a sea change from the Bush administration. "It's a moment we've been waiting for, many of us, for some period of time - for eight years, to be blunt," Kerry said. "And we intend to pick up the baton and really run with it here."LiNeBrEaKKerry acknowledged that some leaders are skittish about aggressive action on climate change as most of the world heads into recession.LiNeBrEaKBut, the Massachusetts Democrat said, "you can't back off what the science tells us must be done as a matter of global survival. And so you have to turn this challenge into the economic resurgence - into the economic rebound."LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama is not attending the gathering, which starts Monday in Poland, but he has said he expects detailed briefings from Kerry and other members of Congress who do attend.LiNeBrEaKGLOBE STAFFLiNeBrEaKPalin, Giuliani try to boostLiNeBrEaKChambliss in Ga. runoffLiNeBrEaKRepublicans are sending in the big guns to defend a crucial US Senate seat in Georgia. LiNeBrEaKFormer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani stumped yesterday on behalf of Saxby Chambliss, who faces a runoff Tuesday against Democratic challenger Jim Martin.LiNeBrEaKSarah Palin, the former GOP vice presidential nominee, is to campaign by Chambliss's side on Monday. For all the controversy that swirled around the Alaska governor, she is highly popular with conservatives and drew rock star-like crowds on the trail.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has dispatched dozens of staffers, and former president Bill Clinton campaigned for Martin last week.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans are trying to stop Democrats from reaching a potentially filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, warning about the evils of one-party rule. Democrats will control at least 58 votes in the new Senate with two seats still undecided.LiNeBrEaKBesides Georgia, there is an increasingly vitriolic recount going on in Minnesota. Before it started, Republican incumbent Norm Coleman led Democrat Al Franken by 215 votes. Through Monday with one-fifth of the ballots still to be counted, the margin was 172, but there are already 2,801 ballot challenges filed by the two campaigns, which will be reviewed by a state canvassing board on Dec. 16.LiNeBrEaKGLOBE STAFFLiNeBrEaKAND ASSOCIATED PRESSLiNeBrEaKObama sets $50,000 capLiNeBrEaKon inaugural fund-raisingLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama, continuing his campaign push to limit special-interest influence on the presidency, unveiled yesterday what his aides say are unprecedented limits on inauguration fund-raising, imposing a cap of $50,000 on all donations.LiNeBrEaKObama's inaugural committee noted that, by law, there is no restriction on the size of contributions, but that past presidents-elect have accepted checks of up to $250,000 apiece.LiNeBrEaKThe committee also announced that, unlike inaugural committees past, it will not accept donations from corporations, political action committees, or registered federal lobbyists.LiNeBrEaKGLOBE STAFFLiNeBrEaKGallup poll sees ObamaLiNeBrEaKgetting a honeymoonLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama kept an even keel throughout the ups and downs of the long campaign, one of the secrets of his success.LiNeBrEaKAnd so far, Americans are following the "no-drama Obama" model, with two-thirds expressing confidence in his ability to be a "good president" in every Gallup daily tracking poll since the election.LiNeBrEaKOne out yesterday puts that number at 65 percent, but it has barely fluctuated between 63 and 67 percent - through all the leaks and speculation about Cabinet picks and all the reports about the tanking economy.LiNeBrEaKGallup notes that Obama's good will is well above the 53 percent of the popular vote that he won on Nov. 4.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Cheap oil, but at what cost?: Canada's sands bounty holds promise for U.S., but the environmental toll could be extreme  	Howard Witt, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1105 words  	Nov. 26--FT. MCMURRAY, Canada -- From here in the far north of Canada through a web of transcontinental pipelines down to a network of refineries ringing the Chicago area, a new supply of precious oil has begun flowing into the gas tanks of more Americans, tapped from a source so vast it could one day furnish close to half of U.S. oil needs for 50 years or more.LiNeBrEaKThis Canadian oil is stable and reliable. It promises to substantially reduce America's future dependence on volatile Middle Eastern sources of oil. And much of it is profitable to produce even with oil prices hovering around $50 per barrel, which explains why some of the world's largest oil conglomerates have invested tens of billions of dollars here despite wild short-term swings in international oil prices. LiNeBrEaKBut what few American consumers know as they routinely fill up their tanks is that this new petroleum bonanza, drawn from dense, tarry deposits known as oil sands, ranks as what environmentalists call the dirtiest oil on the planet. Extracting it causes widespread ecological damage -- and could accelerate global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn Canada, where pitched debate over expanded oil sands development is well under way, critics assert that this abundant source of oil is not worth the environmental costs of extracting it. Oil company officials, joined by Canadian government leaders, counter that they are investing in new technologies to reduce the ecological risks.LiNeBrEaKAlready, about 9 percent of all the oil the U.S. imports comes from Canada's oil sands. Now, as new pipelines are being planned to carry even more of this heavy crude oil to Midwestern refineries, such as BP's expanding facility in Whiting, Ind., the oil sands debate is coming to the United States.LiNeBrEaK"The rush to develop these oil sands flies in the face of the international image of Canada as a steward of the environment," said Gary Stewart, senior adviser to the Seattle-based International Boreal Conservation Campaign. "Yes, the world can use this oil, but at what cost? I don't think Americans would want it if they knew how dirty it is."LiNeBrEaKThe controversies arise because this oil does not gush freely when tapped with a traditional well. Instead, it's bound up in subterranean sand, as black and dense as a hockey puck and less viscous than peanut butter. It must either be clawed out of surface mines or steamed from deep underground.LiNeBrEaKTo access these lucrative oil-sand deposits from strip mines requires churning up huge tracts of ancient boreal forest and polluting so much clean water with poisonous chemicals that the resulting waste ponds can be seen from outer space. Last spring, a flock of 500 migratory ducks perished after landing in one of the waste ponds.LiNeBrEaKGetting at the deeper underground deposits, in a process known as "in situ" mining, necessitates the generation of huge amounts of steam to liquefy the oil so it can be pumped to the surface. Producing the steam requires burning enough natural gas each day to heat 3 million North American homes.LiNeBrEaKThat intensive burning of natural gas is particularly alarming to climatologists, because it sends three times more climate-changing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than drilling for conventional oil.LiNeBrEaKBy any measure, the oil sands deposits are massive. Some 173 billion barrels of oil lie beneath the province of Alberta across an area roughly the size of New York state, making up the second-largest proven oil reserve in the world behind Saudi Arabia.And even though falling world oil prices are causing oil companies to postpone some planned oil sands developments, most experts predict that's only a temporary delay given predictions that prices will rise again once the global economic recession ends.LiNeBrEaK"It's difficult to come up with new sources of supply, and the oil sands represent a politically stable and massive resource that could help meet North America's demand for many decades to come," said Matt Fox, senior vice president for oil sands at ConocoPhillips Canada. "This is a major part of the future."LiNeBrEaKFederal and provincial officials in Canada, eager to reap royalties and tens of thousands of new jobs, are aggressively promoting the oil sands boom. Ft. McMurray, the frontier town of 80,000 that is the gateway to the oil sands fields, has seen such wild growth -- and resulting housing shortages -- that the average single-family home here now sells for nearly $600,000. Workers are so scarce that oil companies build airstrips next to new oil sands mines so they can fly them in on chartered 737s.LiNeBrEaK"A carbon-based economy is still going to be a very good business for a very long time," said Alberta Deputy Premier Ron Stevens.LiNeBrEaKOfficials from government and the oil industry say they are working to mitigate the environmental effects of oil sands development.LiNeBrEaKThey note, for example, that new regulations require all industries in Alberta to immediately reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent. And they say that the oil sands strip mines and wastewater ponds are required to be cleaned up and reclaimed, although Stevens acknowledged that because the mines are active for up to 50 years, "it does take a long time and it's a work in progress as we speak."LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials say that while the extraction of oil from Canada's oil sands produces three times more carbon dioxide than conventional oil, other types of heavy crude result in greater emissions further down the production cycle, in the refining or transportation process.LiNeBrEaKBy the time it winds up in a consumer's gas tank, they contend, oil-sands oil has produced only about 15 percent more emissions.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats in the U.S. Congress are not convinced, however.LiNeBrEaKLate last year, they proposed legislation to block the federal government from purchasing any foreign oil that results in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil -- a definition squarely aimed at Canada's oil sands.LiNeBrEaKThe rule is currently under dispute by the oil industry.LiNeBrEaK"It's a warning shot," said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of the Canada program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This is a sign that the U.S. is starting to move toward caring about not spending taxpayer dollars on fuels that exacerbate global warming."LiNeBrEaKhwitt@tribune.com	OIL and GAS PRICES (91%); OIL SANDS (90%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (90%); CRUDE OIL MARKETS (89%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (78%); PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); IMPORT TRADE (74%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (67%); SURFACE MINING (63%); WATER POLLUTION (62%)  				General  		CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%); SEATTLE, WA, USA (79%) ILLINOIS, USA (90%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); MIDWEST USA (79%) CANADA (97%); UNITED STATES (96%)  	November 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081126-TB-Cheap-oil-but-at-what-cost-1126  	TB

We'll also work with the city's Environmental Task Force to look at the latest initiatives and how they apply."LiNeBrEaKCampodonia has been a member of the non-partisan political organization for eight years. The group's role is to encourage government participation and influence public policy through education and advocacy. Recently, more than two dozen members gathered in Piedmont to hear a PGandE representative talk about how the San Francisco-based company is combating the energy crisis.LiNeBrEaK"The most important thing in my mind is the fact there is a lot we can do and a lot of scope out there. I'd like to think we as a community can energize that and move forward," said PGandE Environmental Policy Manager Jasmin Ansar-Sparks, a 20-year employee and resident of Piedmont. "I really think we can be leaders of the community. Piedmont is a smart, educated and affluent city. We should really be out there, being a model for other cities   certainly matching other communities."LiNeBrEaKAnsar-Sparks compared the energy consumption numbers of Piedmont to other cities with similar climates and number of household members  - like Oakland, Berkeley and Albany   and said the "news is not great." Piedmont uses nearly 50 percent more electricity and 42 percent more gas than each of those cities on a monthly basis.LiNeBrEaK"Of course there are the bigger homes, swimming pools, hot tubs and lawns to take into consideration, but it just gives you an idea of how much we could conserve on a daily basis," added Ansar-Sparks, who has made her home more environmentally friendly by adding solar panels and native grasses and plants to her yard. "I get a lot more butterflies and bees now by restoring the land back to its natural habitat."LiNeBrEaKThose solar panels earned her money as well as saved Ansar-Sparks from a $2,000 monthly electric bill. The energy her home generates but does not use goes back into the grid and PGandE compensates her. The energy giant is also piloting "smart meters" which will roll out to its millions of customers by 2011. The meters show customers exactly how much energy they are using and at peak times so they can cut back personal use, saving money while conserving resources.LiNeBrEaK"I'm really tired of everyone saying we can do this and meet these energy goals by 2020 when we could really do it now. All it takes is the will of the people and the will of politicians," said Marcia Shrago, Piedmont resident and 35-year league member. "We can do it. We just need to make it a priority."

Contra Costa Times (California) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Wood Middle School students prove they can make a difference  	By Lucinda Ryan Correspondent  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	453 words  	Wood Middle School sixth- and seventh-grade science students have been picking through the trash on campus for more than a month.LiNeBrEaKOn Oct. 3, the classes sorted the bags of paper, food containers, plastic utensils, colored pencils and other detritus and conducted their first weigh-in. Much of the waste turned out to be recyclables that would have been dropped into landfill rather than sent to recycling bins. Their second time at the scales was Nov. 6, a little more than a month after students began a campuswide campaign with posters to encourage staff and students to be more selective about what they toss into trash wastebaskets. LiNeBrEaKThe students were participating in a waste reduction program taught by teachers Jeanette Frechou and Jennifer VerDuin. They worked with representatives from the Berkeley-based environmental education nonprofit Earth Team, the Alameda County Office of Education and the Alameda County Waste Management Authority. Besides getting an education in environmental concerns, the students also receive community service credits, Frechou said.LiNeBrEaKThe education program is funded from a measure voters passed in 1990 to reduce landfill, said Nate Ivy of the county office of education.LiNeBrEaK"The education isn't done just with presentations," he said. "The students have to prove they can make a difference. The Wood students are very enthusiastic and energized about their project."LiNeBrEaKAs students picked through the sometimes gooey contents of the waste bags the custodian had collected, they ran across some smelly results. But they forged on, transporting like items into piles (wearing rubber gloves). While some of the roughly 30 students sorted, others acted as journalists, photographing the exercise and taking data. When the items were re-bagged, students weighed them.LiNeBrEaKFrechou continued to ask questions during the exercise.LiNeBrEaK"What do colored pencils have in them? That's right, they have oils. That's a petroleum product. Think about which pile they should be placed. And what do we conclude about this project taking less time than the last project? What is your analysis?"LiNeBrEaKSeventh-grader Zach Bailey said, "It's our fault global warming is happening faster. We throw away electronics and other things that destroy our planet."LiNeBrEaKThe good news is that Bailey and his classmates have already made a difference. The October weigh-in totaled out at 74. 8 pounds of trash and recyclables, many mixed together. The November weigh-in was lower, at 56. 4 pounds of trash and recyclables and with less recyclable materials landing in trash cans.LiNeBrEaKThe students will next compile the results and submit them, along with photographs, to Earth Team, where the information will be available to view at www.earthteam.net .

The Daily Independent (Ashland, Kentucky)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	The Daily Independent, Ashland, Ky., John Cannon column: JOHN CANNON: It's no go for the snows of youth now  	John Cannon, The Daily Independent, Ashland, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	594 words  	Nov. 26--As a child, my memories of Thanksgiving are of playing in the snow with my cousins and my sisters after feasting on a meal of turkey, dressing, pie and other goodies.LiNeBrEaKAnd not just a little bit of snow, but lots of it -- enough to build snowmen and snow forts and play fox and geese with my cousins. My male cousins and I were sure to get in a snowball fight. My sisters were always too prissy to throw snowballs, so the only time I had real snowball fights was when my male cousins were around.LiNeBrEaKAs an adult, I have no memories of a white Thanksgiving. Oh, there may be a little skiff of snow on the ground, but nothing like the four or five inches of snow we always seemed to have on the Thanksgivings of my youth. LiNeBrEaKThe lack of snowfall on Thanksgiving is one way I know that those scientists aren't kidding when they issue dire warnings about "global warming." Even in my native Fayette County, Ohio -- some 80 miles north of Ashland -- there seldom is snow in November any more, and when it does come, it usually is quite light, much like the wimpy snowfalls we've had in the last week or so.LiNeBrEaKAnd according to my dad and grandfather, the winters were much worse in the 1920s and 1930s than they were by the time I was a child in the 1950s.LiNeBrEaKDad would tell stories about slogging several miles through 10 inches or more of snow just to get to school, then sitting next to the potbelly stove in the one-room school for 30 minutes or longer just to thaw out. I think Dad embellished things a bit, but at least they were entertaining stories.LiNeBrEaKThe only problem I had with those stories is that in all the time I was growing up, I can only remember two or three blizzards as severe as Dad said he would be forced to walk through two or three times each winter just to get to school.LiNeBrEaKGrandpa Reno would tell even more harrowing stories about the snowfalls of his youth in the early 1900s. But then I learned early in life that Grandpa told a lot of tall tales and his stories were as much fiction as fact.LiNeBrEaKI suspect my granddaughter and even my children have their doubts about my memories of much harsher winters during the 1950s than we have today, but I swear they are true. Sometimes Mom will get a snowfall in Washington Court House that we don't get in Ashland, but not often. Fayette County just doesn't have the winters it used to have.LiNeBrEaKNot that I really mind. If the truth be known, I don't much like winter. Oh, I like a little cold weather each year just as a change of pace and to kill the yellow jackets in their underground nests, but I've always thought winter should be three days instead of three months. Most of my memories of cold winter days back on the farm are not particularly pleasant ones. Climbing into a silo when it is 5 degrees to throw some fodder down to the hungry cows below is no fun.LiNeBrEaKI'm writing this column days in advance, but if we get a white Thanksgiving this year, I'll be shocked. Shoot, we're lucky to get a white Christmas. That's why we spend so much time dreaming about a white Christmas instead of actually having one.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	U.S. regulators need to copy Texas on greenhouse gases, Perry says  	Elizabeth Souder, The Dallas Morning News  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	279 words  	Nov. 26--Texas Gov. Rick Perry warned on Tuesday that federal regulation of carbon dioxide would harm the Texas and U.S. economies, pushing up energy prices and limiting growth. LiNeBrEaKMr. Perry urged the government to consider copying Texas' renewable energy rules, which have stimulated wind power development, rather than regulate greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKDepending on how the rules work, Texas could be disproportionately affected by climate change regulations because the state has a large number of refining and chemical plants, as well as a large oil and gas industry.LiNeBrEaKMr. Perry convened the Texas Advisory Panel on Federal Environmental Regulation to consider the effect on Texas.LiNeBrEaKThe governor was responding to a federal decision earlier this month to reconsider a permit for a coal-burning power plant in Utah that wouldn't cap carbon dioxide emissions. On Nov. 13, the Environmental Protection Agency's appeals board ordered the EPA to reconsider the plant permit and either limit emissions or justify a decision not to.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA is not expected to act on carbon limits before President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January. But the board decision pointed to the increased likelihood that other plants could face similar challenges with the same outcome.

Duluth News-Tribune (Minnesota)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Wisconsin portion of St. Louis River approved as federal estuary  	John Myers, Duluth News Tribune, Minn.  	SPORTS  	584 words  	Nov. 26--Public lands along Wisconsin's portion of the lower St. Louis River will get special designation under a federal environmental program, Gov. Jim Doyle announced today. LiNeBrEaKThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has approved the state's nomination of the St. Louis River as a National Estuarine Research Center.LiNeBrEaKEstuaries, usually widening in rivers where they meet a great lake or ocean, are considered critical ecological areas for fish and wildlife habitat, especially spawning fish. They often include wetlands, and in the case of Lake Superior, biologists say the St. Louis River estuary is among the most important shoreland habitats for the entire lake's food chain.LiNeBrEaK"We are taking another step towards the long-term protection of our Great Lakes," Governor Doyle said today in a statement. The designation "will help the state, local governments, organizations and citizens better protect our Great Lakes and their natural and recreational resources. By centering this new initiative in Superior -- the headwaters of the Great Lakes -- we have a significant opportunity to prevent and fight invasive species, help promote sustainable growth in coastal communities and be better prepared to deal with changing water levels and climate change."LiNeBrEaKSupporters say the designation will help attract federally-funded research efforts to the region and funds to promote public education on the importance the estuary plays in the Lake Superior region ecosystem.LiNeBrEaKThe federal designation also is expected include the development of a research center on Lake Superior's South Shore dedicated to making the area a regional leader in research and educational outreach related to freshwater estuaries.LiNeBrEaKThe 35-year-old federal National Estuarine Research Reserve System has protected 27 sites, mostly on the Gulf and East coasts. Only one other -- Old Woman Creek Research Reserve in Huron, Ohio, on the shore of Lake Erie -- is in fresh water.LiNeBrEaKThe reserve status applies only to public land along the waterfront -- city, county, state or federal -- and not private property, said Becky Sapper, University of Wisconsin-Extension freshwater estuary outreach coordinator.LiNeBrEaKThe nomination encompasses an area of more than 15,000 acres, including the St. Louis River Streambank Protection Area; UW-Superior's Nelson Outdoor Laboratory, commonly known as Dutchman Creek; the City of Superior's Municipal Forest and Wisconsin Point Conservation Area.LiNeBrEaKA map and other information about the proposed reserve are posted at http://coastal.wisconsin.gov.LiNeBrEaKBefore being formally inducted into the estuary program, state officials will conduct an environmental study develop a management plan based on public input, said Harald Jordahl, deputy administrator for intergovernmental relations for the Wisconsin Department of Administration.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Administration's Wisconsin Coastal Management Program and NOAA will hold a public meeting Monday at 7 p.m. in the University of Wisconsin-Superior Multicultural Center, located in Old Main, Room 232. Parking is in Lot 7 off of 19th Street.

The Economic Times (India)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	3,000 priests, 2-year yagna to tide over crisis  	The Economic Times, India  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	314 words  	Nov. 26--RAMOSANA: At a time when economists and environmentalists are worrying over the economic slowdown and global warming, villagers in a Gujarat hamlet think they have found an antidote. LiNeBrEaKAround 3,000 priests from across the country are performing a two-year-long 'yagna' to seek divine intervention at Ramosana, about 75 km from Ahmedabad. The act may not go down well with environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK"I respect their religious sentiments and wish them luck, but hope they don't end up polluting the environment more," says environmentalist Sunita Narain. Conscious of the air pollution, all 3,000 priests have taken a pledge to plant five 'peepal' trees each near their homes.LiNeBrEaK"The first phase of the yagna will have priests reciting 10 million Chandipath slokas. The second phase will need another 365 days for performing the 'ahuti' ceremony (offering ghee and grains) into 109 havan kunds," said Dahyabhai Patel, convener and trustee of Koti Chandi Mahayagna Seva Samiti (KCMSS), which has organised the event.LiNeBrEaKPriests from UP, Bihar, MP, Rajasthan and Gujarat are performing the ritual. The KCMSS claims to have received huge donations running into crores of rupees for the yagna. "The scale of the event is mind-boggling. Such yagnas do not happen these days," said priest Shari Ratnesh Jha, who has been called in from Bihar. Patel, a prominent farmer, said, "We've been performing yagnas for local crises. This time around, we felt like praying for the world."

Rick Perry said Tuesday that regulating greenhouse gas emissions would have "devastating implications" for Texas' economy and energy industry.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the Bush administration has rejected such regulation, President-elect Barack Obama is believed to be more receptive to clamping down on the gases that have been blamed for global warming.LiNeBrEaKPerry said he plans to discuss his concerns with Obama next week. He is among several governors accepting an invitation to discuss the economic crisis with Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden on Dec. 2 in Philadelphia. LiNeBrEaKPerry said Texas' economy continues to outperform the rest of the nation. But, he warned, the regulation of greenhouse gases, as outlined in a notice posted by the outgoing Environmental Protection Agency administrator last summer, would run Texas "right off the tracks, into the ditch."LiNeBrEaKPerry said the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, posted in July, was a framework for imposing air quality permits and regulations on large swaths of the Texas economy, including commercial buildings, small farms, churches, hotels, hospitals and even large residential homes.LiNeBrEaKThe governor said such federal regulations also would harm the oil and natural gas production that is vital to the Texas economy and jeopardize jobs in the coal industry. He said Texas needs to continue to rely on traditional energy sources as it works to expand access to wind, solar and other alternatives.LiNeBrEaKSome regulation inevitableLiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists said the governor was short-sighted and overly alarmist.LiNeBrEaK"It (the EPA posting) is not a serious proposal," said Cyrus Reed, conservation director for the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKBut, he added, some regulation of greenhouse emissions is inevitable, thanks to recent court and administrative decisions, Obama's election and a larger Democratic majority in Congress.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think anyone thinks there will be permits for churches or small farms," Reed said. "The major impacts will be on large coal plants."LiNeBrEaKPerry said diversifying the state's energy sources is a top priority and noted that Texas already has installed more wind power than any other state and all but three countries. He also supports the development of "next generation nuclear power plants" and "clean" coal plants.LiNeBrEaKBut Texas' existing energy industry, he said, would be crippled and national oil and gas supplies would be curtailed if the federal government were to impose a large tax burden on oil and gas companies.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that the federal government had the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKLast May, an EPA appeals board overturned a permit for a coal plant in Utah because the application failed to require any controls on carbon dioxide pollution, Reed said.LiNeBrEaKTom "Smitty" Smith, director of the Texas office of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said Texas had done a lot toward developing alternative energy sources but needed to do more.LiNeBrEaKclay.robison@chron.com	EMISSIONS (91%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); TALKS and MEETINGS (90%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (89%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (89%); WIND ENERGY (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); COAL INDUSTRY (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (86%); AIR QUALITY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); POWER PLANTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); CRUDE OIL and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE (73%); NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (73%); TAXES and TAXATION (73%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (72%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (70%); SETTLEMENTS and DECISIONS (69%); DECISIONS and RULINGS (69%); POLITICAL PARTIES (69%); SUPREME COURTS (62%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (62%); APPEALS (62%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (58%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (50%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (72%)  				General  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); RICK PERRY (94%); JOE BIDEN (57%)  	AUSTIN, TX, USA (92%) TEXAS, USA (94%); PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%); UTAH, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081126-HO-Perry-concerned-by-plans-to-limit-greenhouse-gases-1126  	HO

Japan Times (Tokyo)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: An Asia-Pacific cheerleader?  	Japan Times, Tokyo  	COMMENTARY  	923 words  	Nov. 26--The test of any institution is its response to crisis. By that benchmark the annual meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum is found wanting. This year the 21 assembled grandees, whose countries represent more than 50 percent of global wealth, vowed to "act quickly and decisively" to battle the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.LiNeBrEaKSubstance, however, was lacking. For the most part, they merely backed the decisions of the Group of 20, a similar group of nations -- whose membership overlaps substantially with that of APEC -- that met recently in Washington and outlined a real response to the crisis. That raises a fundamental question: Should we spend our time and money on an APEC cheerleader? LiNeBrEaKSpanning both sides of the Pacific Ocean with members that include some of the world's richest nations and some of the poorest, as well as some of the largest and smallest economies on the globe, finding APEC's lowest common denominator has always risked settling for too little. Members are torn between competing missions: pushing aggressive plans for the region (such as an Asia-Pacific Free Trade Agreement) or promoting low-level capacity building programs. More recently, a new divide has emerged between governments that promote a more security-focused agenda (chief proponent of this view has been U.S. President George W. Bush) and those that want to get back to basics such as trade and economic policy.LiNeBrEaKThe result has been a series of high-level meetings that offer boilerplate rhetoric exhorting members to back various initiatives, but little in the way of concerted action. Progress has been made at the working level, but this hardly justifies the photo opportunity at the annual summit.LiNeBrEaKThis year's final declaration identified the usual list of concerns: regional integration, structural reform, the negative impact of growth and development, corruption and building capacity. The security agenda embraced the standard pledges to combat terrorism, increase trade security and better prepare for disasters. Efforts to fight global warming, increase energy security and promote clean development also got their due. This year's spike in food prices made food security an inevitable element of the final declaration: The leaders pledged to "expand food and agricultural supply in the region" through the use of "market forces to encourage new investment in agricultural technology and production systems."LiNeBrEaKThe worst financial crisis since the Great Depression spurred the leaders to adopt an additional statement. This document supports the Washington Declaration from the G20 meeting that Mr. Bush hosted a few weeks ago, and specifically endorses the Action Plan for the reform of financial markets that they agreed on. Consistent with that position, the statement embraces the idea that "the principles of free trade and investment rules and open trade will continue to guide global growth, job creation and poverty reduction." The leaders promise to refrain from any protectionist measures for the next 12 months. Keeping that promise will be tough: One government's protectionism is another country's effort to stave off real hardship.LiNeBrEaKThe leaders called for more APEC participation in international financial institutions. Japan repeated its promise to provide $100 billion to the International Monetary Fund for emerging economies, a pledge that went unmatched. And, as at all meetings of the last few years, they called on each other to do more to make the Doha Development Round of trade talks a success.LiNeBrEaKThat last statement makes plain APEC's shortcomings. APEC members have the capacity to push a Doha deal; among them are governments that have blocked agreement. The gap between their rhetoric in APEC and their actions at trade talks raises questions about sincerity and commitment. Sending trade ministers back to Geneva next month for another round of talks looks like the triumph of hope over experience: It is hard to believe that negotiators are prepared to make thus far impossible political compromises when economic circumstances are more dire and the costs of adjustment even harder to absorb.LiNeBrEaKAPEC has its uses. Building capacity at the government level, promoting the dissemination of best practices for both the public and private sectors, and creating regional networks that will develop constituencies for free and fair trade are invaluable contributions and essential to the Asia-Pacific region's march toward prosperity. But the larger message from the most recent meeting, especially when contrasted with that of the G20, is that APEC has not shown that it can inspire or lead its members. The failure to acknowledge that fact, or to remedy it, risks creating expectations that APEC cannot meet.LiNeBrEaKTo maximize its effectiveness, APEC should focus on what it does best -- trade and economic policy. If leaders are not prepared to put together action plans that require real action -- and implement them -- then maybe they should spend their time elsewhere. It is not clear that the Asia-Pacific region needs a high-level meeting of cheerleaders.

Japan Times (Tokyo)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Japan Sea jellyfish menace eases: Fishermen, researchers stumped by sudden drop in net-mangling, catch-poisoning creatures  	Reiji Yoshida, Japan Times, Tokyo  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	428 words  	Nov. 26--To the great relief and puzzlement of fishermen and researchers, the Sea of Japan this year has seen a drastic decline in the huge, toxic jellyfish that have damaged the nation's seafood haul in recent years. LiNeBrEaKKnown either as Nomura's jellyfish or Echizen "kurage" (jellyfish), the bottom creatures can reach 1 to 2 meters in diameter and weigh 100 to 200 kg.LiNeBrEaKThousands can attach themselves to a single fixed fishing net, poisoning the fish inside and often breaking the net itself.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the Japan Fisheries Information Service Center, fishermen had reported about 6,300 sightings of Nomura's jellyfish as of Nov. 20 last year, compared with only 128 this year.LiNeBrEaK"This is a dramatic fall in numbers," said Katsuya Saito, an official at the Tokyo-based nonprofit research center.LiNeBrEaK"Up to last year, 3,000 to 5,000 of the jellyfish would get tangled up in a single fixed net in some cases. But this year, only one or two were reported to have been caught," Saito said.LiNeBrEaKSaito said that until 2001, a heavy presence of the jellyfish occurred only once every several decades.LiNeBrEaKBut from 2002 to 2007, thousands were seen in fall and winter in the Sea of Japan and parts of the East China Sea, Saito said.LiNeBrEaKThe giant creatures have wreaked havoc with fishermen, not only because of the labor entailed in ridding their nets of them, but also the damage they cause to catches.LiNeBrEaKAt one point the crisis prompted fishermen to come up with cooking recipes, although the jellyfish are rarely eaten in Japan.LiNeBrEaKHitoshi Iizumi, an official at Japan Sea National Fisheries Research Institute, a government-affiliated agency, said scientists have not determined the cause of the sudden disappearance.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Iizumi, the jellyfish are believed grow big when they are along the coast of China and then drift toward Japan.LiNeBrEaKResearchers believe three factors near China may have been behind the surge in jellyfish until last year: eutrophic water coming to the sea from modern Chinese cities, global warming that has increased the sea temperatures, and increased fish catches resulting in more zooplankton.LiNeBrEaKBut researchers are not sure if those factors changed this year, Iizumi said.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Reid: Reconsider plans for coal-burning plants  	John G. Edwards, Las Vegas Review-Journal  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	549 words  	Nov. 26--Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday urged Gov. Jim Gibbons to reconsider plans for three coal-fired power plants in the wake of a recent federal regulatory decision. LiNeBrEaKIn a letter to the Republican governor, Reid, D-Nev., cited a Nov. 13 decision that directs the Environmental Protection Agency to explain why it didn't consider requiring reduction of carbon dioxide from a coal-fired power project in Utah. In addition, the Environmental Appeals Board recommended EPA adopt a national policy for dealing with carbon dioxide, which scientists say leads to global warming.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the board's ruling, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection "cannot move forward with any legal certainty" in approving air permits for three coal power projects in Nevada, Reid said. Approving final air permits, Reid said, would put "billions of dollars of Nevadans' investments (in coal projects) in great jeopardy."LiNeBrEaKMendy Elliott, deputy chief of staff for the governor, said she and other officials in the governor's office have been meeting with legislators and haven't seen Reid's letter.LiNeBrEaKSanjay Narayan, senior staff attorney for the Sierra Club, has said the board ruling makes it risky for the Nevada division to grant final air permits until the EPA adopts a policy on carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe developers of the three coal-fired power projects in Nevada have received draft permits, but the state agency has not made a decision on a final air permit for any of them. They are the Ely Energy Center that NV Energy proposes to build near Ely, the White Pine Energy Station that LS Power proposes to construct in the same area and the Toquop Energy Project that Sithe Global Power wants to build outside of Mesquite.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA case stems from plans by the Deseret Electric Cooperative to expand a power plant near Bonanza, Utah.LiNeBrEaKWhile that case was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts vs. EPA that carbon dioxide is an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act of 1977.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA approved a final air permit for the Bonanza coal project, but the Sierra Club appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board.LiNeBrEaKThe environmental board directed the EPA to reopen the Bonanza case and reconsider carbon dioxide restrictions. If EPA determined no carbon dioxide reduction was needed at the Utah plant, EPA should explain why, the board said.LiNeBrEaKThe decision "makes it overwhelmingly clear that the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection cannot move forward with legal certainty in granting final air quality to any of the proposed coal-fired power plants currently being considered in Nevada unless such permits consider the extremely high greenhouse gas emissions from those plants," Reid said in the letter.LiNeBrEaKReid asked Gibbons to "join with me in putting Nevada quickly on a cleaner (path) toward a renewable energy and efficiency-driven economy and safer future."

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Solar power costlier for Florida than nuclear, report finds: A long-awaited report says solar power could be financially viable in Florida, but will be considerably more expensive than nuclear power.  	John Dorschner, The Miami Herald  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	799 words  	Nov. 26--In a much anticipated report that could affect every Floridian's pocketbook, a consultant hired by the state says solar power could be a competitive source of electricity by 2020 in many scenarios, but it will cost considerably more than new nuclear power and natural gas, the main sources of power for present customers of Florida Power and Light.LiNeBrEaKBiomass -- things like plant waste, wood chips and garbage -- will be a financially viable source in all scenarios, but wind isn't likely to be much of a factor in Florida. Power from ocean currents -- still in a very basic experimental stage -- could be producing power that's competitive with solar by 2017. LiNeBrEaKThese are some of the findings of a draft study by Navigant Consulting, commissioned by the Public Service Commission, which has been ordered by the Legislature to come up with a recommendation for a renewable energy portfolio standard that will mandate a certain percentage of power come from clean energy, to offset the need for foreign oil and the greenhouse gases that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe 269-page report is stuffed with numbers and alternative scenarios.LiNeBrEaK"I'm usually a quick study," said Eric Draper, deputy director of Audubon of Florida, after reading the report Tuesday afternoon. "But the interpretation of the costs in this is so complicated that it's difficult for advocates to do their jobs.LiNeBrEaK"It would have been helpful to have this data well before the workshop next Tuesday," when environmentalists, renewable energy businesses and utilities will discuss the results.LiNeBrEaKGov. Charlie Crist has said he wants to see 20 percent of power coming from renewables by 2020. The Legislature didn't go along with that in its last session, passing the buck to the PSC and asking it to come with a standard that balanced the need for green against costs to consumers. The PSC staff currently is recommending 20 percent by 2041, a goal that environmentalists say is far too weak.LiNeBrEaKUntil now, the missing ingredient in the discussion has been the cost of the renewables.LiNeBrEaKSCENARIOSLiNeBrEaKIn its report, Navigant set up three scenarios, each considered with or without renewable energy credits in which producers are paid bonuses for providing clean power.LiNeBrEaKOne listed unfavorable conditions for renewables, such as low fossil fuel prices, withdrawal of renewable subsidies, little if any taxes on greenhouse gases by 2020 and spending on renewables limited to 1 percent of utilities' revenues. In the most favorable scenario, there would be a stiff tax on greenhouse gases, high fossil fuel prices and utilities being forced or allowed to spend up to 5 percent of revenue on renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKLooking at the middle scenario, somewhat favorable to renewables but without credits, solar will remain the most expensive option.LiNeBrEaKNavigant said a company producing ground-mounted solar photovoltaic energy will need 30. 63 cents/kWh in 2009 to make its investment worthwhile over the course of the plant's 30-year life. As the years go by, improvements in technology will mean that figure for solar will decline to 23. 59 cents/kWh in 2020, the last year the study measures.LiNeBrEaKNUCLEAR COSTSLiNeBrEaKThat compares to new nuclear costs of $12. 97 cents/kWh in 2020. Natural gas base plants would be 10. 09.LiNeBrEaKBut the study says that because solar is a intermittent power source, it would be more accurate to compare it with natural-gas turbines that turn on only peak times, which are expected to have costs of 17 to 23 cents/kWh over the next 12 years.LiNeBrEaKWind costs could range from 17. 55 cents/kWh in 2009 to 18. 30 in 2020, but the report said there was not a lot of financially viable on-land wind power in the state. Much of biomass power would be considerably cheaper, with costs in 2020 ranging from 0. 82 cents/kWh to 12 cents.LiNeBrEaKFor power from ocean currents, power could be viable at 17. 42 cents/kWh starting in 2015, declining to 13. 72 cents/kWh for such plants built in 2020.LiNeBrEaKHow these figures were arrived at -- and how accurate they are -- is likely to be hotly debated over the next several months, with consumer advocates concerned primarily about cost and environmentalists looking at the global warming issues.LiNeBrEaK"My focus is on the price issue, because that's what's going to be discussed in the Legislature," said Draper of Audubon. The politicians are likely to support the green movement "as long as their constituents don't complain about their rates going up."

The News-Times (Danbury, Connecticut)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	States wait on power plant fate  	Robert Miller, The News-Times, Danbury, Conn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	709 words  	Nov. 26--The evidence is clear and has been growing for a decade, said Dr. Gregory Dworkin.LiNeBrEaKDoctors know the tiny particles of soot -- or fine particulate matter -- we breathe in from polluted air damages our lungs.LiNeBrEaK"There are particles that get past the filters we have in our nose and get into the lungs," Dworkin, chief of pediatric pulmonology at Danbury Hospital, said Tuesday. "Once they get in, they're hard to get out." LiNeBrEaKThe people most at risk from these particles are pregnant women, infants and young children. Fine particulate matter, he said, may be most harmful to developing lungs.LiNeBrEaKDworkin said one of the best places to learn about this issue is on a Web site post by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, www.epa.gov/particles/basic.html.LiNeBrEaKTherefore, he said, it's perplexing that the EPA, in the waning days of the Bush administration, is considering a move that would weaken EPA regulations and allow big power plants in the Midwest to emit even more pollution -- pollution that prevailing winds carry to Connecticut daily.LiNeBrEaK"It's so disappointing to see these kinds of back-door regulations being prepared," Dworkin said.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Gov. M. Jodi Rell joined the five other New England governors to protest the changes. Writing to EPA Administrator Steven Johnson, Rell and the other governors said the changes "threaten the quality of our states' air and the health of our citizens."LiNeBrEaKNew England, the letter said, is penalized by geography. No matter how hard the Northeastern states strive to clean sources of air pollution within their boundaries, they cannot control the vast clouds of smoke belched from the tall smoke stacks of coal-fired power plants in the Midwest. The upper-air winds, blowing west to east, carry the soot to New England.LiNeBrEaK"We depend heavily on federal leadership to address air pollution transport," the six governors said.LiNeBrEaKAt issue are changes in the federal Clean Air Act, under what is called New Source Review. Under those provisions, power plants due for major renovations must add modern pollution control devices if the renovation would increase the plant's annual emissions.LiNeBrEaKBecause such renovations usually increase the hours a plant operates, they mean the plants will emit more pollution over a year.LiNeBrEaKWhat the proposed change would do is exempt a plant from installing the new pollution controls as long as new emissions don't exceed the plant's existing hourly rate of emissions. Thus, the rule change would allow the plants to continue polluting at the same rate, but for more hours.LiNeBrEaKAlong with the fine particulate matter, this pollution also contributes to smog in the summer, to acid rain, and to climate change, the governors' letter said.LiNeBrEaKWhat's unclear right now is when -- or whether -- the EPA will put these regulations into effect by publishing them in the Federal Register.LiNeBrEaKThere was concern the EPA would publish them last week. That would put them outside a 60-day limit before Jan. 20 -- the day President George W. Bush leaves office and U.S. Sen. Barack Obama takes the oath of office as our next president.LiNeBrEaKIf the EPA had published the regulations outside the 60-day limit, they would go into effect. But if the Bush administration publishes regulations inside the 60-day limit, the incoming Obama administration can block them from going into effect.LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Jonathan Schrader said Tuesday there has been no date set for publishing the new regulations.LiNeBrEaK"There is a significant amount of work to do on them," Schrader said.LiNeBrEaKDennis Schain, spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said Connecticut will monitor the EPA's decisions on the regulations carefully over the next 60 days.LiNeBrEaK"We will stay on top of it," he said. And if the EPA does publish them, "we will take appropriate action."LiNeBrEaKContact Robert MillerLiNeBrEaKat bmiller@newstimes.comLiNeBrEaKor at (203) 731-3345.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	The Creatives: Film After facing death, a filmmaker can't forget  	KRISTI TURNQUIST  	Ultimate  	731 words  	KRISTI TURNQUISTLiNeBrEaKThe trip that changed Chel White's life began prosaically enough.LiNeBrEaK"I had been working for probably four weeks without a day off," recalls White, his voice measured. He and his then-girlfriend, Laura --now his wife --needed a break. "We were champing at the bit to get away, so we made a semi-secret getaway."LiNeBrEaKThat weekend trip to Breitenbush Hot Springs in December 2005 became a four-day ordeal, when the pair's car became stranded in the snow on a remote road in Marion County. The two survived by staying with the car, turning it on for occasional heat, bundling up in blankets and rationing the food they'd brought. LiNeBrEaKWhite vividly recalls the details of how the couple was found by members of the Marion County Search and Rescue unit.LiNeBrEaK"It was late morning and I was writing in my journal. We looked up, and there were these two bright headlights that turned out to be snowmobiles. We could hear a little sound, the buzzing sound of their engines.LiNeBrEaK"Laura jumps out of the car and starts waving and running toward them. It really scared one of the guys, because they were expecting the worst. They said that most people they go to look for, they don't find alive."LiNeBrEaKThere, in the car, with snow and freezing rain cutting them off from home and safety and comfort, White wasn't only focused on surviving. "On the second day, I decided that if I lived through it," he recalls, "I'd have to make a film about having an experience like this."LiNeBrEaKFor most of us, going through such a trial might be something we'd prefer to forget. But for White, 49, it was an inspiration, triggering the creative impulse that has made the tall, soft-spoken Portlander one of the most respected independent filmmakers in Oregon.LiNeBrEaKSince moving to Portland 23 years ago, the native Midwesterner has created a series of personal films whose variety speaks to his versatility. Done in techniques that range from stop-motion animation ("Magda"), to photocopier animation ("Choreography for Copy Machine"), to an allegory on climate change with music performed by Pink Martini bandleader Thomas Lauderdale ("Wind"), they all bear the stamp of the darkly humorous, poetic sensibility that is White's signature.LiNeBrEaKWhite's works have shown in festivals around the world, including such prestigious showcases as Sundance. In addition to awards and grants recognizing his achievements, White's films also have screened at museums around the country, with two of his pieces accepted into the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.LiNeBrEaKNor does White's creativity end with his films. As a partner and director at Bent Image Lab, a Portland-based production company, White has lent his distinctive vision to commercials and music videos for such clients as Radiohead's Thom Yorke.LiNeBrEaKMost filmmakers would be satisfied with that track record. But White isn't satisfied --paradoxically, he's aching to get back to that car in the snowbound Oregon wilderness.LiNeBrEaK"When something like that happens, it puts you in a completely different mind space," White says. "You end up coming back to your life, and you bring something back with you. When I think about what would have happened if I hadn't made it, what would have happened to my daughters."LiNeBrEaKAt the mention of his girls, 13 and 15, White pauses, then collects himself. He and Laura have finished the script for a feature film, his first, based on their time in the woods. White hopes to start shooting in winter 2009. He's scraped together some money: a $35,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and a fellowship from the Regional Arts and Culture Council in Portland.LiNeBrEaK"In terms of making a feature film, it's just pitifully small," White says wryly.LiNeBrEaKBut White is nonetheless determined to share what he learned as the couple wondered if help would come.LiNeBrEaK"The story is about finding a kind of perspective, a consciousness, that when everything that is everyday life is stripped away, what do you have left?" White says. "It's living in the moment and looking death in the face. We didn't know whether we were going to get out. But we did know our lives depended on the decisions that we made."LiNeBrEaKFor even the scrappiest independent filmmaker, raising money to make a feature presents seemingly endless obstacles. But the tone of White's voice --calm, resolute, steady --makes clear that, after what he's been through, that kind of challenge is a walk in the park.

Palestine Herald-Press (Texas)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Cow Tax? EPA looking into regulating greenhouse gases  	Wayne Stewart, Palestine Herald-Press, Texas  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	699 words  	Nov. 26--PALESTINE -- An effort to possibly regulate greenhouse gases by the Environmental Protection Agency could have far-reaching effects on the bottom line for local cattle producers.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has issued an "Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking" and in so doing is seeking public comment on a plan to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles under the Clean Air Act, though an EPA spokeswoman said the agency is still in the data collection stage.LiNeBrEaKIf the plan goes through, the American Farm Bureau said it would trigger other provisions of the Clean Air Act which would have a direct impact on agriculture through a cow and pig tax on individual animals. LiNeBrEaK"Anytime the government wants to do something like this everybody should worry," said Texas Farm Bureau Director of Commodity and Regulatory Activities Ned Meister.LiNeBrEaKAs Meister explained it, if the EPA determines it should regulate greenhouse gases by automobiles, then other activities are going to fall under the agency's regulatory umbrella.LiNeBrEaK"If they are going to regulate automobiles, then they are going to regulate all sources (of greenhouse gases,)" Meister explained. "That includes livestock."LiNeBrEaKCattle and other ruminants produce methane as a natural byproduct of the animal's digestive process. Methane is considered one of the principal culprits of greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKAn activity that produces 100 tons or more of greenhouse gases per year would be subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, Meister explained.LiNeBrEaKFor operations that size, "there is a permit fee, which is in effect a tax," Meister explained.LiNeBrEaKUnder the guidelines a dairy with 25 or more head of cattle or a beef-catle operation with 50 or more head of cattle would be subject to a "presumptive minimum rate" permit fee.LiNeBrEaKThe fee for dairy cattle would be $175 per dairy cow and $87. 50 for every head of beef cattle.LiNeBrEaKSuch an eventuality would make turning a profit from a cow-calf operation nearly impossible, according to Meister.LiNeBrEaK"The markets are down right now," Meister continued. "This would have a direct economic impact (on producers) that is not recoverable."LiNeBrEaKCattle prices have dropped considerably over the past year. In November of 2007, a 500-pound top-grade steer calf would bring from 85 cents to $1. 27 per pound, this year the best to expect is from 79 cents to $1. 10 per pound. A drop of more than 10 percent on the high side.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, a year ago a 500-pound calf could bring in excess of $600 with the same calf this year bringing in $500 or less. Now, take off $87. 50 per animal and the profit margin drops even further when factoring in the higher input costs of diesel, feed and fertilizer.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA proposal also would affect swine production with producers having to pay $20 per animal for operations with 200 or more hogs.LiNeBrEaK"The economic costs to producers from the cow and pig tax would be great and could cause the cost of beef, pork and dairy prices to rise," said American Farm Bureau Federation Director of Regulatory Relations Rick Krause. "The cow and pig tax would impose severe penalties on livestock producers in the United States without effectively reducing greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere."LiNeBrEaKThe deadline for sending comments to the EPA is Friday. Meister said public input is critical.LiNeBrEaK"You need to tell the EPA why regulating greenhouse gases is not a thing we should do from a farm and ranch standpoint," Meister said. "You need to explain to them (the economic burden.)"LiNeBrEaKTo send written comments to the EPA, they should be mailed to Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, Environmental Protection Agency, Mailcode: 2822T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, RE: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-0318; or comments can be sent online by going to www.stopepa.com.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Energy, warming await attention  		OP-ED; Pg. A17  	708 words  	Truly, there is much to be thankful for in this country, even with an economy heading in the wrong direction and creating difficult times for millions of American families. One thing we can all be thankful for is that we held an election that was decisive and ended the divided government that too many Americans unduly cherish. Surely, at last, we need a government that works.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Obama faces an incredible array of challenging issues, with fixing the economy front and center. Not to diminish the importance of getting the economy back on track, however, I would argue that Obama, as well as the nation and the world, face two related but even more critical issues -- energy and climate change. LiNeBrEaKWe can't allow rapidly declining prices at the gas pump to once again lull us into believing that the energy problem has been solved. A day of reckoning has only been delayed, but not put off completely. The economic downturn actually is helpful in this respect because it allows both additional time and additional reasons to make a full-bore effort to radically alter our dependence on fossil fuels. Investing in alternative forms of energy -- such as electric cars, solar, wind, tides and other promising sources -- will help put people back to work in new industries, while moving to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases on something approaching the scale required.LiNeBrEaKWith the presidential election, financial crisis and energy issues dominating the news in recent months, climate change has been flying below the radar screen. Although the great majority of scientists are convinced that global warming is a reality, there is enough controversy and high-profile deniers to fuel the skeptics, who seem to get as much media attention as the actual science itself.LiNeBrEaKThis is the most worrisome of all issues because it plays into the all-too-human trait to put off tough decisions, to avoid difficult actions, until there is no other choice. The problem with that, of course, is that the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere that prevent increasing amounts of the planet's heat from radiating out into space (the "greenhouse effect) is a long-term process with a delayed impact on surface temperatures.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, there is increasing concern among at least a few scientists that human activities already have pushed the Earth beyond a point of no return. The more optimistic view is that there is still time to act, but the response required becomes more draconian the longer it is delayed. Meanwhile, the world's use of fossil fuels gives every sign of growing, not contracting, while the amount of carbon in the atmosphere continues to increase. It is currently around 387 parts per million.LiNeBrEaKDuring the course of human existence, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution brought about the widespread burning of coal and other fossil fuels, the atmosphere's carbon content was 275 ppm. If we want to keep a planet similar to that which fostered human civilization, NASA climate scientist James Hansen, among others, warns that we need to get carbon down below 350 ppm.LiNeBrEaKObama, unlike President Bush, will engage with other countries to come up with a climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Accord that runs out in 2012. But there is a wide gap between agreeing to a set of principles and goals, and making the hard decisions to actually implement them. Matching action to the rhetoric will be a challenge in its own right.LiNeBrEaKOne case in point, particularly apropos to Pennsylvania, is that far too much has been said and promised in the name of "clean coal." The separation of carbon dioxide from coal and its sequestration underground, often offered as a "promising solution" to coal's huge greenhouse-gas impact, is so far from actually being employed on the massive scale that would be required that it shouldn't be taken seriously as a viable solution.LiNeBrEaKI'm not ready to concede that the situation is hopeless. But to avoid it becoming so requires a level of international leadership, determination and cooperation rarely seen, even as the world confronts a long agenda of other major problems that have been left unattended far too long.LiNeBrEaKHERB FIELD is a Patriot-News editorial writer: 255-8441 or hfield@patriot-news.com	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (88%); CLIMATOLOGY (88%); SCIENCE NEWS (86%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (86%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (77%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (77%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (77%); ELECTIONS (77%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (74%); WIND ENERGY (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (74%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (74%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (69%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (66%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (51%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (78%); US PRESIDENTS (76%)  					BARACK OBAMA (91%)  	EARTH (79%); PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Patriot News Co.

Pioneer Press (St. Paul, Minnesota)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	PUC approves northern oil pipeline  	Leslie Brooks Suzukamo, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	467 words  	Nov. 26--A Houston pipeline company got permission from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday to lay a 285-mile pipeline across the northern part of the state to deliver tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, to Superior, Wis. LiNeBrEaKEnbridge Energy Co. said the Minnesota segment is part of a larger $4. 5 billion pipeline project that would stretch nearly 1,000 miles from Alberta through Clearbrook, Minn., to Superior, with the capacity to pump up to 450,000 barrels of crude a day through a 36-inch diameter steel pipe.LiNeBrEaKThe pipeline could be operational by 2010, and the project includes a smaller pipe -- the Minnesota segment is 175 miles -- to deliver diluents from Chicago to Clearbrook that will make the heavy crude easier to pump to Superior and beyond.LiNeBrEaKThe PUC voted 5-0 to approve a use permit for the pipelines, dismissing concerns from environmentalists that strip mining to extract the tar sands would devastate Canadian forests and produce three to five times more greenhouse gases than conventional crude oil operations.LiNeBrEaKThe oil would serve bigger markets like Chicago instead of the Twin Cities, but the entire Midwest would benefit from the extra capacity, said Denise Hamsher, the director of regulatory affairs for Enbridge Energy.LiNeBrEaKWith declining U.S. domestic production, more imports will be needed to meet future needs, and Canada, the United States' largest source of foreign oil providing nearly 2 million barrels a day, is a stable and reliableLiNeBrEaKprovider, she said.LiNeBrEaKEnbridge already has pipelines that deliver 1. 5 million barrels of Canadian oil a day through Minnesota, Hamsher said.LiNeBrEaKThe Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy opposes energy projects like the pipeline that depend upon oil or coal because of these commodities' contributions to greenhouse gases and global warming. It disputed Enbridge's claims about rising energy needs.LiNeBrEaKU.S. drivers reduced gasoline usage by driving 90 billion fewer miles over the past 11 months, said Kevin Reuther, the MCEA's legal director. State and federal policies make it likely further drops will follow, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe PUC delayed a decision on whether to route a small portion of the pipeline through the Fond du Lac Reservation, which already has four Enbridge pipelines. The tribe and Enbridge disagree on how much the tribe should be paid for the new line.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   SOONER EDITION	ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SEND OBAMA THEIR WISH LIST  	Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-6  	434 words  	WASHINGTON -- Don't wait until the financial crisis is over to attack global warming because cleaner ways to produce and use energy will lead to a stronger economy, leaders of environmental groups said yesterday as they outlined their wish list for President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaKThe recommendations from 29 of the nation's most prominent environmental and conservation groups emphasized a clean-energy approach to economic revitalization but also included detailed suggestions for Alaska's Arctic region and for conserving land and water resources nationwide.LiNeBrEaKLeaders of the groups who helped develop the recommendations to Mr. Obama's transition advisers rejected the idea that fighting global warming and protecting the environment would be too expensive in an economic downturn.LiNeBrEaK"Our economy is suffering and so is our environment. The solutions to both go hand in hand," said Larry Schweiger of the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaKThe country needs to reduce global warming emissions and protect its water, fisheries, forests and wildlife, which are all stressed by climate change, Mr. Schweiger said. He also said that environmental protection will affect the quality of life "for Americans everywhere for generations." And he argued that outdoor recreation creates many American jobs.LiNeBrEaK"The engines that drive our economy," he said, "are not only in Detroit."LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama has set Congress the goal of passing a stimulus plan quickly so that he can sign it soon after taking office. The report said the stimulus plan was an opportunity to invest in things such as mass transit, renewable energy and weatherization -- all of them sources of new jobs.LiNeBrEaKThe report also argued that a green plan for the economy would "provide a path out of poverty and a more just society." It argued that many people can't afford some of today's more expensive global warming solutions -- such as hybrid cars or solar panels. But it said that they'd benefit from new jobs and less pollution.LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest sources of jobs would be weatherizing homes and buildings to save energy, said Frances Beinecke, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Studies show that about 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are from wasted energy in buildings.LiNeBrEaKKevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said there also would be jobs in building a new grid to move electricity from solar and wind installations to cities.LiNeBrEaK"We have the last century's patchwork of antiquated technology" that wastes about a quarter of the energy from coal-fired power plants along the electricity transmission lines, he said.

He gave no truck during his campaign to skeptics' frequent claims that climate change has nothing to do with human activity and it's now certain he won't as president.LiNeBrEaKIt is also evident that one of his first orders of business will be to establish a federal greenhouse gas-reduction plan that looks a lot like what California is devising under the mandate of the 2006 measure known as AB32. That's the landmark California law requiring cars and stationary pollution sources to cut their overall carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels over the next 12 years. LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has been frustrated for more than a year in this department because George W. Bush's administration refused to give a go-ahead for the state to adopt strict vehicle emission rules as part of that effort. Under the previous six presidents, green lights for smog-cutting measures tougher than federal standards had always tbeen automatic.LiNeBrEaKAt Bush's behest, the federal Environmental Protection Agency maintained that granting the state a go-ahead like those received for every other anti-pollution advance of the last 37 years would interfere with federal plans to adopt national rules, creating confusion for auto makers.LiNeBrEaKOf course, there are no such federal plans. Nor would there have been any interference with plans if they did exist. For 16 other states now automatically adopt any new California clean-air standard within four years after it's passed here. Those states, together with California, account for more than half the vehicle sales in America   which in practicality means the moment California gets a green light, carmakers must get ready to sell California-qualified cars elsewhere, too.LiNeBrEaKBut the Bush administration claptrap will not last much longer. Obama made that clear in a strongly worded video played the other day as part of the opening ceremony of an international climate change conference hosted by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaK"Too often, Washington has failed to show leadership (on greenhouse gas reductions)," Obama said. "That will change when I take office. My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process"... We'll establish strong annual targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them by an additional 80 percent by 2050."LiNeBrEaKHe was, therefore, adopting the precise goals of AB32, written by then-Assemblywoman, now state senator-elect Fran Pavley of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and later signed by Schwarzenegger after he negotiated some changes to soften it.LiNeBrEaKIf there was any doubt one of his first acts as president will be to grant the delayed California waiver, Obama removed it by saying:LiNeBrEaK"I promise you this. Once I am president, any governor who is willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House." That could have been a description of Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaKIn short, Obama was announcing one change he will bring in his first days in office.LiNeBrEaKFor Schwarzenegger, this means he's lost his mantle as America's loudest and most visible governmental advocate in the global warming fight. But it will also mean that many goals he's pursued will come to fruition, or at least a start in that direction.LiNeBrEaKSo there was satisfaction in his voice when Schwarzenegger said, "That is staggering. This is so huge. That's really big, because now we as a nation can lead, like we do in other things. Now we can inspire other nations"..."LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger, entering his last two years as governor, plainly wants to be remembered for the climate change fight as much as for any other thing he's done. "Let me tell you," he said, "when I signed the nation's first law to cap greenhouse gas emissions, California was leading a revolution, but without any soldiers"... Our revolution now has soldiers and it's spreading around the globe and I'm very happy about that."LiNeBrEaKIn effect, Schwarzenegger was passing a leadership torch to Obama, after years of carrying it through a dark time. And Obama indicated in strong language that he's ready to accept the relay handoff and run with it   another striking example of California pioneering a national and international trend.LiNeBrEaKThomas D.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Opinion: Now is the perfect time for a dollar-a-gallon gasoline tax  	By Larry N. Gerston Special to the Mercury News  	NEWS; Opinion  	634 words  	Don't look now, but energy history is on the verge of repeating itself. All those discussions of a new paradigm in the form of conservation and alternative sources are washing away in less expensive oil. Six months ago, people were incensed by the greed of foreign oil producers; today "inexpensive" gasoline is a welcome respite in an otherwise failing economy. All the big talk of energy independence in Congress has been pushed aside as we struggle to keep our jobs and pay our mortgages. American shortsightedness, one of our most abundant qualities, has reasserted its place in our lives.LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that we stand at a brief moment in history, and nothing more. None of the major factors are different today with oil temporarily at $60 per barrel than they were six months ago when oil sold at nearly $150 per barrel. The petroleum-producing countries have not gone soft on their prices, nor have societies made major shifts in their energy demands other than the vagaries associated with slowing economies. The facts on the ground (perhaps better said, "in" the ground) remain the same. We must remember that: LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKThe world is consuming oil at a rate much faster than new sources can be found; that means we're running out of the gooey stuff. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKMore than two-thirds of the world's oil reserves remain in Middle Eastern countries with unstable governments who loathe American interests. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKChina, India and other developing nations continue to demand oil at growing rates, which place a premium on oil prices. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWith 3 percent of the world's fossil fuel reserves and 4 percent of the world's population, the U.S. continues to use about 25 percent of the oil produced daily. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAnd the emissions produced from oil in the U.S. account for 25 percent of the world's greenhouse emissions, which are directly responsible for global warming. LiNeBrEaKIn short, the energy mess in the U.S. is no different today than it was six months ago.LiNeBrEaKRather than fall back to our harmful energy habits, this is the time to take bold conservation and alternative energy steps. We should move to drastically reduce our fossil fuel dependence, if not permanently wean ourselves from the supply. But how?LiNeBrEaKWe need to add a gasoline consumption tax. The tax itself would help people think twice before purchasing gasoline and other fossil fuel products. Meanwhile, the proceeds could be directed into two pots: one for mass transit build-outs and the other for alternative energy research and development.LiNeBrEaKThe money would come quickly. The 20 million barrels of oil imported by the U.S. daily translate into 483 million gallons of gasoline. An energy tax of one dollar per gallon would capture more than $175 billion annually. That's a lot of money for alternative energy programs and mass transit. Meanwhile, just think about how many jobs that would be created in the process at a time when the economy desperately needs them. And don't forget, it was only a few months ago that presidential candidates pointed to an annual oil import bill of $700 billion.LiNeBrEaKThere will be those who scream at the thought of adding a dollar to the cost of gasoline, reminding us of the recent high prices and their pain on our pocketbooks. That's exactly the point. We can pay to work our way out of the energy mess now or pay much more later. The fact is that our energy and global warming problems will not go away, given the conditions discussed above. To that end, the only way we can control this problem is if we assume control of our destiny, rather than allow others to dictate that path. It's time to be responsible.LiNeBrEaKLarry N.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	South Florida's ocean floor declared a protected area for corals  	By David Fleshler, Sun Sentinel  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	561 words  	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ More than 1,300 square miles of ocean floor from Boynton Beach, Fla., to the farthest islands of the Keys were designated a federal protected area for coral Wednesday, in a conservation action that could affect beach-widening, fishing, shipping and other activities along the coast. LiNeBrEaKElkhorn and staghorn corals, once among the most abundant reef-building corals, have declined by 90 percent in many areas because of global warming, ship groundings, storm damage and over-fishing, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. The service protected them as threatened species in 2006, the first corals given that designation, and as part of that process the government is required to designate habitat that is critical to their survival.LiNeBrEaKThe designation does not mean immediate limits on any activities or the establishment of no-fishing zones. But it adds a level of scrutiny to government actions, such as issuing permits for a beach widening project that could smother coral in sand; what types of fishing gear to allow or whether to ban fertilizers that could be washed into the ocean.LiNeBrEaK"It will lead to more forethought and awareness on the proposals that may affect these areas," said Sarah Heberling, natural resource specialist for the fisheries service. "I think this is another great step forward for these two species."LiNeBrEaKThe entire protected area designated Wednesday encompasses 2,959 square miles on the coasts of southeast Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.LiNeBrEaKBut the Center for Biological Diversity, a San Francisco environmental group that had filed the original petition to have these species protected, said the designation of critical habitat falls short because it fails to call for steps to combat global warming, which threatens coral habitat. Higher ocean temperatures contribute to coral bleaching, and the ocean's absorption of amounts of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels contributes to ocean acidification, which makes it more difficult for corals to grow.LiNeBrEaK"The critical-habitat rule exposes the Bush agenda to ignore global warming, while rising temperatures are driving corals extinct," Miyoko Sakashita, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a written statement. "Critical habitat protection can be an important factor leading to the recovery of our coral reefs, because changes to the ocean habitat are some of the primary threats to the corals. This rule, however, misses the mark by ignoring the simple fact that carbon dioxide pollution is degrading coral habitat and killing coral reefs."LiNeBrEaKHeberling said the federal government was not ignoring global warming and planned to address it in the recovery plan for the two species. A 17-person team is working on a plan that will address global warming, she said, as well as water pollution, fertilizers and other threats to water quality that could harm coral.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Sun-Sentinel on the World Wide Web at http://www.SunSentinel.com	OCEANS (90%); BEACHES (90%); ISLANDS and REEFS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (89%); BIODIVERSITY (89%); WATER POLLUTION (87%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); COASTAL AREAS (78%); FISHERIES (77%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (77%); SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); THREATENED and SENSITIVE SPECIES (77%); NATURAL DISASTERS (76%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS (73%); FERTILIZERS (67%); PETITIONS (64%)  		CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (54%)  				FLORIDA, USA (96%) UNITED STATES (96%); VIRGIN ISLANDS, USA (79%)  	November 27, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 South Florida Sun-Sentinel   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	20081126-BC-ENV-CORAL  	FL  	ARCHIVE GRAPHIC on MCT Direct (from MCT Graphics, 202-383-6064): ENDANGERED CORAL REEFS	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

Bush may be the undisputed champion when it comes to presidential vacations, but his staff is working overtime. As the clock ticks down to Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, the Bush administration is working feverishly to dismantle at least 10 major safeguards of the nation's air, water, endangered species and national parks. LiNeBrEaKMost of the damage took place before Nov. 15, 60 days before Inauguration Day. That's because most new federal rules take effect 60 days after being published in the Federal Register. Once in effect, they are more difficult and time-consuming to undo.LiNeBrEaKIn recent weeks, the Bush administration has:LiNeBrEaK- Opened up 2 million acres of Western land to the development of oil shale, one of the dirtiest fuels on the planet. Another 360,000 acres - including large swaths of public land near Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park in Utah and Dinosaur National Monument on the border of Utah and Colorado - were opened to oil drilling.LiNeBrEaK- Exempted large factory farms and mountaintop mining operations from parts of the Clean Water Act. The prohibition against dumping mining waste into rivers and streams dates back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who was not exactly an environnmental radical.LiNeBrEaK- Loosened clean-air rules to make it easier to build power plants, refineries and chemical plants near national parks. It also changed rules to make it easier for coal-fired power plants to avoid installing pollution controls or clean up soot and smog emissions.LiNeBrEaK- Changed rules to prevent Congress from blocking uranium mining on claims filed near the Grand Canyon. Higher prices for uranium have prompted hundreds of new mining claims on federal land. In June, a House committee ordered that about 1 million acres of land near the Grand Canyon be exempt from mining. The rule change would block that.LiNeBrEaKAnd several days ago, the Washington Post reported that a new rule that is close to being finalized would prevent federal agencies from taking climate change into consideration when they make decisions about imperiled animals and plants. That's apparently being done because polar bears were added earlier this year to the list of species in jeopardy. The administration reportedly believes that the move could serve as a pretext for imposing a cap on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration previously had eliminated rules that require independent scientific reviews of federal agency decisions that could harm protected plants and animals.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	Environmentalists draft bold road map for Obama  	By Dina Cappiello THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	462 words  	WASHINGTON - A united and diverse coalition of environmental advocacy groups has sent President-elect Barack Obama its road map for change - and it represents a U-turn from the policies of President George W. Bush. LiNeBrEaKThe 391-page report titled "Transition to Green" lays out what the incoming Obama administration can do in its first 100 days and beyond at more than a dozen different agencies to achieve the dual goals of cleaning up the environment and revitalizing the economy.LiNeBrEaK"It gives a whole vision on how to move forward to repower, rebuild, refuel America," said Jim Lyon, senior vice president for conservation for the National Wildlife Federation, one of 29 groups that signed on to the laundry list of policy recommendations.LiNeBrEaKMany of the suggestions in the report released Tuesday echo what Obama has said on the campaign trail and signaled during the transition: Capping the gases blamed for global warming; basing environmental decisions on sound science; and taking a more cautious approach to energy production on federal lands.LiNeBrEaKOther recommendations appear to be more aggressive than Obama's stated policies. The groups call for cutting funding for nuclear energy, reinstating a moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and reconsidering recent oil and gas leases in some parts of Alaska.LiNeBrEaKThe bold outline from groups working to protect oceans, increase park space and reduce pollution shows that environmentalists are going on the offensive after eight years of playing defense. The Bush administration has eased some environmental protections in the last eight years, and in the next eight weeks it is set to relax regulations governing power plant emissions and protecting endangered species.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are hoping to capitalize on a new Democratic administration and a larger Democratic majority in Congress that have already signaled that energy and environmental policies are priorities.LiNeBrEaK"We know this administration is much more friendly to environmental protection than the one that is leaving town," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of Wildlife, which signed on to the report with the Natural Resources Defense Council, American Rivers, Greenpeace and the National Audubon Society.LiNeBrEaK"We all see this as an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past," Schlickeisen said.LiNeBrEaKBut they acknowledge that there could be some stumbling blocks - namely, a nation in the throes of an economic crisis and larger caucus of moderate Democrats from manufacturing states.LiNeBrEaK"We need to be able to show that an aggressive response to reducing global warming emissions will not harm the economy, but in fact generate new jobs and marshal investment in clean technologies," said Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The Times of India  	November 26, 2008 Wednesday 	Emissions by rich nations up by 10 percent in 16 yrs  	Nitin Sethi, The Times of India  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	522 words  	Nov. 26--NEW DELHI -- The rich countries, which were mandated to cut down on their emissions, are instead on an upward curve that could lead the world to tipping point. The global warming causing greenhouse gas emissions of the rich nations have increased by 9. 9 percent between 1990-2006. LiNeBrEaKThe data released by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) comes as a wake-up call to the world with scientists having warned earlier that global emissions needed to be cut by as much as 30-40 percent from 1990 levels in order to stabilise the temperatures at a bearable point by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"The data has revealed the doublespeak of rich nations that have been asking India, China and other developing countries to undertake reduction in their already low emission levels even as their own emissions continue to rise," a senior Indian official said.LiNeBrEaKIndia's per capita emissions are almost one-twentieth of the US and one-tenth of EU.LiNeBrEaKThe global climate treaty divides the countries into two sets. One set is called the Annex 1 or industrialised countries, which are responsible for most of the accumulated GHG emissions and have been asked to reduce their emissions by 6-8 percent by 2012. The rest, such as Indian and China, are called non-Annex 1 countries in UN jargon.LiNeBrEaKEastern European countries, where the economic meltdown had led to reduced emissions by default, are called 'economies in transition' and are taken as a separate sub-category within the Annex 1 list.LiNeBrEaKThe worst offenders in the rich nations list turns out to be Turkey, whose emissions increased by 95 percent in the 16-year period. Australia's emissions increased by 27. 3 percent and of the US by 14. 4 percent.LiNeBrEaKHowever, some industrialised countries have reduced their emissions, such as UK by 15. 1 percent and Germany by 18. 2 percent.LiNeBrEaKWhile EU has contended that at least 15 of its members could collectively meet its first phase targets, the battle between nations is heating up with the international panel of scientists demanding much stronger cuts over the next phase (starting from 2012) in order to stabilise temperatures.LiNeBrEaKThe report comes ahead of the meetings of more than 100 countries in Poland in early December to resolve how the emission cuts and its burden should be shared.LiNeBrEaKThe rich nations have been demanding that India and China should also undertake some form of emission cuts whereas the developing nations have been adamant that the accumulated and historical burden lies with the rich nations, which still continue to belch out much more pollution every year. They warn that even though the industrial nations are to blame, it's the poorest in countries like India that could suffer the most if climate change continued unchecked.

The Washington Post 	November 26, 2008 Wednesday   Suburban Edition	White House Prods Allies to Oppose Limits on Greenhouse Gases  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A04  	523 words  	As the Bush administration prepares to issue its ruling on whether to limit greenhouse gases, it's sending out a message to some of its allies: Tell us how much you don't want us to regulate emissions linked to global warming. LiNeBrEaKLast week, the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs sent an e-mail to mayors reminding them that time was running out if they wanted to comment on the proposal the administration issued in July, which laid out how the government might curb greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. A 2007 Supreme Court decision required the Environmental Protection Agency to issue such a ruling, but the White House made it clear in its e-mail that it does not  think that is  a good idea.LiNeBrEaK"At the time, President Bush warned that this was the wrong way to regulate emissions. [House Energy and Commerce Committee] Chairman John D. Dingell called it 'a glorious mess,' " Jeremy J. Broggi, the office's associate director, wrote in the e-mail, obtained by The Washington Post. "And many of you contacted us to let us know how harmful this rule would be to the economies of the cities and counties you serve."LiNeBrEaKThe e-mail notes in bold, underlined text that the comment period for the rulemaking "closes on November 28" and provides a link to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce blog post that warns that a federal cap on greenhouse gases "will operate as a de facto moratorium on major construction and infrastructure projects."LiNeBrEaKWhite House spokesman Tony Fratto said the White House sent the missive to "a lot of mayors" because many of them had warned the administration that a mandatory limit on carbon dioxide would hurt their constituents.LiNeBrEaK"What this e-mail is doing is reminding them that they said this rule would be bad for them, there's a deadline for the public comment period and they should get their comments in," Fratto said. "It's not enough to call us; they need to get their public comments in."LiNeBrEaKBut S. William Becker, executive director for the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, questioned why the administration would actively marshal support for blocking federal action on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"It appears there is no bottom to the administration's pit of disdain for regulating greenhouse gases," Becker said. "On the eve of the comment deadline on one of the most important environmental issues of our time, the White House is resorting to scare tactics, including rhetoric from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to incite opposition among elected county and city officials."LiNeBrEaKWilliam L. Kovacs, the chamber's vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs, said that his office had nothing to do with the White House's e-mail -- "I wish we had that kind of influence" -- and that his group had generated close to 10,000 negative comments on the proposal.LiNeBrEaKAdvocates of regulating greenhouse gas emissions got one piece of good news Tuesday: A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that General Motors, Chrysler and the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers cannot challenge that state's adoption of California's rule limiting automobile tailpipe emissions to combat global warming.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	To preserve farmland, preserve farmers  	By Mary Newsom, McClatchy Newspapers  	COMMENTARY  	726 words  	Dining on shrimp and grits with friends the other night, we all talked about the dismal economy. And while we discussed the excellent meal, other than noting the shrimp was from South Carolina we didn't talk much about where our food came from.LiNeBrEaKBut as we head into Thanksgiving week _ when many of us focus on preparing and sharing Thursday's big meal _ it's appropriate to talk also about what food means to us. As metaphor, it represents hospitality, nurture, tradition, community and communion. LiNeBrEaKBut food is also a big part of our economy.LiNeBrEaKIn lean times, people turn to small-scale food production, mostly gardens, to save money. Over dinner we talked about whether our sinking savings should spur us to install a few hens in the back yard. (A recent article in the Winston-Salem Journal said many N.C. cities, including Greensboro and Winston-Salem, are changing ordinances to allow "urban chickens.")LiNeBrEaKThat urban chicken boomlet is one small piece of a mosaic of food-related trends converging to possibly reshape U.S. food production _ and urban and suburban growth as well.LiNeBrEaKWhat's happening in Cabarrus County, a booming suburban area northeast of Charlotte, may be a harbinger. Cabarrus County Manager John Day sees economic development potential, not to mention smart environmental strategy, in helping boost his county's agriculture. He, too, sees things converging: climate change, a plummeting economy, the specter of declining oil supplies.LiNeBrEaK"If the way we live is going to change _ as I think it will need to _ at the heart of it is the soil and the water and how we eat," he said Friday.LiNeBrEaKCabarrus County and its municipalities, in a far-sighted step, a few years ago adopted a land plan that creates a growth boundary in order to preserve the rural and agricultural flavor of eastern Cabarrus. In general, utility lines won't be extended beyond the boundary.LiNeBrEaKBut if the county aims to preserve farmland by restricting development, he said, it has an obligation to help farmers make a living. After all, he said, "It's really not about preserving farmland, it's about preserving farmers."LiNeBrEaKThat means treating agriculture as both a valued way of life and as a potential economic engine.LiNeBrEaKDay thinks _ as do others _ that it makes good environmental and economic sense to help farmers market their food locally. The county is: Using a $675,000 state grant to build a slaughtering facility in the Rimer community in eastern Cabarrus. It goal is to help cattle ranchers and meat-producers in the region.LiNeBrEaKTurning a 35-acre farm bequeathed to the county into an incubator to help educate, mentor and launch new farmers.LiNeBrEaKStarting a Food Policy Council.LiNeBrEaK"You talk about green-collar jobs of the future," Day said. "Farming ought to be one of them."LiNeBrEaKIt's a big jump from eastern Cabarrus cattle farmers to an urbane Miami architect. But New Urbanism guru Andres Duany, in Charlotte this month for a conference, gave a lecture that convinced me the "local food" movement is big and getting bigger. His topic: "agricultural urbanism."LiNeBrEaKDuany is an astute, tart-tongued trend-watcher and he sees a market for neighborhoods designed around agriculture. "Agriculture is the new golf," he said. Instead of overlooking the links, houses overlook crops.LiNeBrEaKTo justify large-lot suburbia and its environmental harm, he said, make it food-producing, with front- and back-yard gardens and less lawn. Even urban chickens can have a role, he said.LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday think about your food, who grew it and where. While I don't foresee Cabarrus County cranberries any time soon, it's clear that local food and local farms can play a bigger role, not just in our meals and our communities, but in our economy.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKMary Newsom is an associate editor at the Charlotte Observer.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Canada's vast oil sands hide dirty environmental secret  	By Howard Witt, Chicago Tribune  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	1126 words  	FT. MCMURRAY, Canada _ From here in the far north of Canada through a web of transcontinental pipelines down to a network of refineries ringing the Chicago area, a new supply of precious oil has begun flowing into the gas tanks of more Americans, tapped from a source so vast it could one day furnish close to half of U.S. oil needs for 50 years or more.LiNeBrEaKThis Canadian oil is stable and reliable. It promises to substantially reduce America's future dependence on volatile Middle Eastern sources of oil. And much of it is profitable to produce even with oil prices hovering around $50 per barrel, which explains why some of the world's largest oil conglomerates have invested tens of billions of dollars here despite wild short-term swings in international oil prices.LiNeBrEaKBut what few American consumers know as they routinely fill up their tanks is that this new petroleum bonanza, drawn from dense, tarry deposits known as oil sands, ranks as what environmentalists call the dirtiest oil on the planet. Extracting it causes widespread ecological damage _ and could accelerate global warming. LiNeBrEaKIn Canada, where pitched debate over expanded oil sands development is well under way, critics assert that this abundant source of oil is not worth the environmental costs of extracting it. Oil company officials, joined by Canadian government leaders, counter that they are investing in new technologies to reduce the ecological risks.LiNeBrEaKAlready, about 9 percent of all the oil the U.S. imports comes from Canada's oil sands. Now, as new pipelines are being planned to carry even more of this heavy crude oil to Midwestern refineries, such as BP's expanding facility in Whiting, Ind., the oil sands debate is coming to the United States.LiNeBrEaK"The rush to develop these oil sands flies in the face of the international image of Canada as a steward of the environment," said Gary Stewart, senior adviser to the Seattle-based International Boreal Conservation Campaign. "Yes, the world can use this oil, but at what cost? I don't think Americans would want it if they knew how dirty it is."LiNeBrEaKThe controversies arise because this oil does not gush freely when tapped with a traditional well. Instead, it's bound up in subterranean sand, as black and dense as a hockey puck and less viscous than peanut butter. It must either be clawed out of surface mines or steamed from deep underground.LiNeBrEaKTo access these lucrative oil-sand deposits from strip mines requires churning up huge tracts of ancient boreal forest and polluting so much clean water with poisonous chemicals that the resulting waste ponds can be seen from outer space. Last spring, a flock of 500 migratory ducks perished after landing in one of the waste ponds.LiNeBrEaKGetting at the deeper underground deposits, in a process known as "in situ" mining, necessitates the generation of huge amounts of steam to liquefy the oil so it can be pumped to the surface. Producing the steam requires burning enough natural gas each day to heat 3 million North American homes.LiNeBrEaKThat intensive burning of natural gas is particularly alarming to climatologists, because it sends three times more climate-changing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than drilling for conventional oil.LiNeBrEaKBy any measure, the oil sands deposits are massive. Some 173 billion barrels of oil lie beneath the province of Alberta across an area roughly the size of New York state, making up the second-largest proven oil reserve in the world behind Saudi Arabia. And even though falling world oil prices are causing oil companies to postpone some planned oil sands developments, most experts predict that's only a temporary delay given predictions that prices will rise again once the global economic recession ends.LiNeBrEaK"It's difficult to come up with new sources of supply, and the oil sands represent a politically stable and massive resource that could help meet North America's demand for many decades to come," said Matt Fox, senior vice president for oil sands at ConocoPhillips Canada. "This is a major part of the future."LiNeBrEaKFederal and provincial officials in Canada, eager to reap royalties and tens of thousands of new jobs, are aggressively promoting the oil sands boom. Ft. McMurray, the frontier town of 80,000 that is the gateway to the oil sands fields, has seen such wild growth _ and resulting housing shortages _ that the average single-family home here now sells for nearly $600,000. Workers are so scarce that oil companies build airstrips next to new oil sands mines so they can fly them in on chartered 737s.LiNeBrEaK"A carbon-based economy is still going to be a very good business for a very long time," said Alberta Deputy Premier Ron Stevens.LiNeBrEaKOfficials from government and the oil industry say they are working to mitigate the environmental effects of oil sands development.LiNeBrEaKThey note, for example, that new regulations require all industries in Alberta to immediately reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 12 percent. And they say that the oil sands strip mines and wastewater ponds are required to be cleaned up and reclaimed, although Stevens acknowledged that because the mines are active for up to 50 years, "it does take a long time and it's a work in progress as we speak."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials say that while the extraction of oil from Canada's oil sands produces three times more carbon dioxide than conventional oil, other types of heavy crude result in greater emissions further down the production cycle, in the refining or transportation process.LiNeBrEaKBy the time it winds up in a consumer's gas tank, they contend, oil-sands oil has produced only about 15 percent more emissions.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats in the U.S. Congress are not convinced, however.LiNeBrEaKLate last year, they proposed legislation to block the federal government from purchasing any foreign oil that results in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil _ a definition squarely aimed at Canada's oil sands.LiNeBrEaKThe rule is currently under dispute by the oil industry.LiNeBrEaK"It's a warning shot," said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of the Canada program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This is a sign that the U.S. is starting to move toward caring about not spending taxpayer dollars on fuels that exacerbate global warming."

And they say that the oil sands strip mines and wastewater ponds are required to be cleaned up and reclaimed, although Stevens acknowledged that because the mines are active for up to 50 years, "it does take a long time and it's a work in progress as we speak."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials say that while the extraction of oil from Canada's oil sands produces three times more carbon dioxide than conventional oil, other types of heavy crude result in greater emissions further down the production cycle, in the refining or transportation process.LiNeBrEaKBy the time it winds up in a consumer's gas tank, they contend, oil-sands oil has produced only about 15 percent more emissions.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats in the U.S. Congress are not convinced, however.LiNeBrEaKLate last year, they proposed legislation to block the federal government from purchasing any foreign oil that results in higher greenhouse gas emissions than conventional oil _ a definition squarely aimed at Canada's oil sands.LiNeBrEaKThe rule is currently under dispute by the oil industry.LiNeBrEaK"It's a warning shot," said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of the Canada program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "This is a sign that the U.S. is starting to move toward caring about not spending taxpayer dollars on fuels that exacerbate global warming."

Commonwealth Journal (Somerset, Kentucky)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Weather forecasters straddle fence  	Bill Mardis, Commonwealth Journal, Somerset, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	850 words  	Nov. 25--SOMERSET -- Optimistic Pulaski countians shivering the past week or so in below normal temperatures may take heart in a NOAA Climate Prediction Center forecast of a slight chance that the upcoming winter may be warmer than normal.LiNeBrEaKOr will it be colder than normal? Or about average? LiNeBrEaK"It depends on how you look at it," said Shawn Harley, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service Office in Jackson.LiNeBrEaKThe NOAA Climate Prediction Center just released the following long-range forecast &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" December through February &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" for the Lake Cumberland area and across all of Eastern Kentucky. Juggle the following percentages and decide how much kindling you need to cut.LiNeBrEaKHere is the winter weather prediction. Read carefully as you decide whether to put another log on the fire:LiNeBrEaK--There is a 35 percent chance that temperatures will be above the normal average of 42. 8 degrees.LiNeBrEaK--There is a 31 percent chance that temperatures will be below normal, lower than 40. 1 degrees.LiNeBrEaK--There is a 34 percent chance that temperatures will be near normal &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" 42. 8 degrees.LiNeBrEaKHuh? That's a flip-a-coin forecast. If only Albert Einstein were still alive. Maybe we could ask him. Could his theory of relativity shed light on this weather dilemma?LiNeBrEaKEven Harley &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" not the author of the long-range prediction &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" concedes the winter forecast straddles the fence. As he said before, it depends on how you look at it.LiNeBrEaKApparently the NOAA Climate Prediction Center looked at the higher percentage when it called for warmer-than-normal temperatures for much of the central part of the nation, and a continuation of drier-than-normal conditions across the Southeast.LiNeBrEaKSomerset was one of the areas used in making the long-range outlook for the coming winter, beginning December 21 by the calendar, but December through February by the meteorological yardstick.LiNeBrEaKHere in meteorologist's speak, is how the Climate Prediction Center explains its prediction:LiNeBrEaK"With the absence of La Nina and El Nino &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" climate patterns in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that give forecasters clues about potential weather events months in advance &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" predicting weather patterns on seasonal timescales becomes increasingly challenging. Instead, other climate patterns over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions may play a significant role in influencing U.S. winter weather.LiNeBrEaK"These patterns are only predictable a week or two in advance and could persist for weeks at a time," said Michael Halpert, deputy director, Climate Prediction Center. Therefore, we expect variability, or substantial changes in temperature and precipitation across much of the country."LiNeBrEaKWhat was that? What did that say? If you understood the last couple of paragraphs you're smarter than most of us.LiNeBrEaKHarley speaks our language. He gets down to the nitty-gritty about the weather. He's not looking that far down the road.LiNeBrEaK"For the next couple of weeks we're in a pattern of below normal temperatures," said Harley. This follows the latter part of November described by Harley as "unusually cold."LiNeBrEaKThe temperature has already dropped to 12 degrees &acirc;[#x20ac]"- there were reports of readings as low as 7 degrees one morning last week. This is unusually cold weather before Thanksgiving.LiNeBrEaKAfter a modest warming during Thanksgiving weekend, the first couple of weeks in December look ugly. The first weekend in December may be extremely cold, with highs in the 20s and lows in single digits.LiNeBrEaKIf you have read this far and are still confused, may we refer you to more down-to-earth sources for weather information.LiNeBrEaKThe Old Farmers Almanac predicts an exceptionally cold December. After a welcome mid-January thaw, temperatures will be colder than normal in February and March. More information can be found at http://www.almanac.com/LiNeBrEaKTreeologist L.H. "Dick" Frymire was in his Irvington, Ky. office when we telephoned to get a closer-to-home handle on the weather.LiNeBrEaKFrymire, who is spending a lot of time trying to fashion a suitable tombstone for his weather-predicting rooster who passed, says the coldest day of the coming winter will be January 16 when it will be 12 below zero. The frigid spell follows a six-inch snow the day before.LiNeBrEaKFinally, for a down-to-earth prediction with a country twang, try this honored journal's Humble Reporter. Humble predicts 13 snows, based on the 13 foggy mornings in August. Heights of hornets' nests indicate some of the snows will be at least stump deep. Humble is partially retired and needs to be cut a lot of slack.LiNeBrEaKIt comes simply to this. Who are you going to believe &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]" high-paid, U.S. Government forecasters or country prophets who rely on critters to tell the weather.LiNeBrEaKThe choice is yours.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Time for hope, leadership, new direction  	Jim Anderson  	OPINION  	498 words  	In 1933 the United States was facing one of the biggest economic crises in its history. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt spoke directly to the people in a series of fireside chats from the White House. He gave the people hope and a new direction. It took some time, but the country responded and we became the most affluent nation with the strongest economy in the world. LiNeBrEaKWhat the United States and the state of California need more than anything else right now is hope. The world could be on the brink of another Depression. The United States is deeply in debt and California is looking for a bailout. Regardless of what you think about any of our leaders, now, more than ever, we need strong leadership that will take us in a new direction and create hope for a better future.LiNeBrEaKThe federal government is spending money that it does not have in an attempt to shore up a failing financial industry that brought a crisis upon itself because of greed, poor planning, and a belief that the economy would continue to grow without end. We need to make certain that whatever bailout is done will establish safeguards against more greed in the form of profit taking and will reform the industry to prevent this from happening again.LiNeBrEaKIn the Great Depression, many people lost everything when the banks failed. In response, the government created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to protect individual investors.LiNeBrEaKBut, as we have learned recently, many financial institutions other than banks are not covered by federal insurance. The FDIC needs to be reinvented to be more responsive to today's economy.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's Democratic Legislature tried (unsuccessfully) to balance its budget by taking money away from the cities. Our Republican governor is trying to raise taxes. Why are our leaders so afraid of cutting back expenditures and balancing the budget? We are getting knee-jerk reactions instead of leadership.LiNeBrEaKRaising taxes now, in any form, takes away hope from a citizenry that is already deeply in debt and living in fear. Passing the burden from the state to the cities is cowardly.LiNeBrEaKPeople are wise enough to know that we will have to tighten our belts to get out of this mess. Raising taxes, one way or another, is inevitable. The state and the country are simply too deeply in debt. The people are also fed up with governments that lead us all deeper and deeper into debt while diminishing American prestige, power and influence throughout the world.LiNeBrEaKPeople are also worried about global warming, sending our young off to fight two wars, the security of their own jobs, and their children's futures. LiNeBrEaKPlease, leaders, create a plan that shows us that we can work our way out of this financial mess, live in peace and security, and that our children will inherit a healthy planet and live in a country of which they are proud.LiNeBrEaKPlease give us hope, leadership, and a new direction.LiNeBrEaKJim Anderson is a reader member of the Daily Bulletin's editorial board. He lives in Rancho Cucamonga.

Jordan Times (Amman)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	World Bank grant to cut Kingdom's use of ozone-harming chemicals  	Hana Namrouqa, Jordan Times, Amman  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	362 words  	Nov. 25--AMMAN -- The World Bank will soon extend a $1 million grant to Jordan for projects aiming to completely phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are believed to be damaging the ozone layer. LiNeBrEaK"Jordan has phased out 97 per cent of the CFCs harming the ozone with the help of the World Bank and local institutions, and the Kingdom will completely stop using these carbons by the end of 2009," Minister of Environment Khalid Irani told The Jordan Times on Monday.LiNeBrEaKChlorofluorocarbons are a family of chemical compounds developed back in the 1930s as safe, non-toxic, non-flammable alternative to dangerous substances like ammonia for purposes of refrigeration and spray can propellants, according to www.theozonehole.com.LiNeBrEaKOne of the elements which make up CFCs is chlorine, which is often released when ultraviolet radiation at high altitude breaks down chlorofluorocarbons, a process which has the potential to destroy large amounts of the ozone layer.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the minister, projects to be implemented under the grant will increase the efficiency of refrigeration machines and reduce energy consumption.LiNeBrEaKHe noted that the agreement was formulated during the 20th meeting of Montreal Protocol member states and the 8th Conference of Parties of the Vienna Convention, held in Doha on November 16.LiNeBrEaKThe Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of a number of substances believed to be responsible for ozone depletion. The treaty entered into force in 1989.LiNeBrEaKIn last week's meeting of Montreal Protocol member states, over 1,000 experts and ministers from 180 countries discussed hot environmental issues, including climate change and ozone depletion.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Environmental groups recommend clean-energy approach to revitalize economy  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	650 words  	WASHINGTON _ Don't wait until the financial crisis is over to attack global warming because cleaner ways to produce and use energy will lead to a stronger economy, leaders of environmental groups said Tuesday as they outlined their wish list for President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKThe recommendations from 29 of the nation's most prominent environmental and conservation groups emphasized a clean-energy approach to economic revitalization but also included detailed suggestions for Alaska's Arctic region and for conserving land and water resources nationwide. LiNeBrEaKLeaders of the groups who helped develop the recommendations to Obama's transition advisers rejected the idea that fighting global warming and protecting the environment would be too expensive in an economic downturn.LiNeBrEaK"Our economy is suffering and so is our environment. The solutions to both go hand in hand," said Larry Schweiger of the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaKThe country needs to reduce global warming emissions and protect its water, fisheries, forests and wildlife, which are all stressed by climate change, Schweiger said. He also said that environmental protection will affect the quality of life "for Americans everywhere for generations." And he argued that outdoor recreation creates many American jobs.LiNeBrEaK"The engines that drive our economy," he said, "are not only in Detroit."LiNeBrEaKObama has set Congress the goal of passing a stimulus plan quickly so that he can sign it soon after taking office. The report said the stimulus plan was an opportunity to invest in things such as mass transit, renewable energy and weatherization _ all of them sources of new jobs.LiNeBrEaK"There's economic opportunity if we do this right," said Kevin Knobloch, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists.LiNeBrEaKThe report also argued that a green plan for the economy would "provide a path out of poverty and a more just society." It argued that many people can't afford some of today's more expensive global warming solutions _ such as hybrid cars or solar panels. But it said that they'd benefit from new jobs and less pollution.LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest sources of jobs would be weatherizing homes and buildings to save energy, said Frances Beinecke, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Studies show that about 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are from wasted energy in buildings.LiNeBrEaKKnobloch said there also would be jobs in building a new grid to move electricity from solar and wind installations to cities.LiNeBrEaK"We have the last century's patchwork of antiquated technology" that wastes about a quarter of the energy from coal-fired power plants along the electricity transmission lines, he said.LiNeBrEaKA few of the recommendations in the nearly 400-page report:LiNeBrEaK_Pass a law in 2009 that sets up a sale of global-warming pollution permits and uses the money for clean energy, green jobs, consumer relief _ especially for those most in need _ and protection for vulnerable ecosystems.LiNeBrEaK_Grant California and other states a waiver under the Clean Air Act to enforce their own tougher standards for pollution from vehicles.LiNeBrEaK_Start a legal review of all Arctic-area Chukchi and Beaufort Sea oil and gas leases made during the Bush administration. Revoke, suspend or limit as many as legally possible to give time for an environmental review.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Science teacher delivers lesson from under the sea  	By Kathleen McGrory, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	971 words  	MIAMI _ Sixty-three feet below the ocean's surface, the science teacher was giving his morning lesson.LiNeBrEaK"Hi, and welcome to Aquarius for our third and final broadcast from this mission," Mark Tohulka told his third-period marine biology students, watching via webcam from their classroom at MAST Academy in Key Biscayne.LiNeBrEaKAs the teacher continued his talk, he saw a pair of curious fish swim by. LiNeBrEaKOn a weeklong mission aboard Aquarius, the world's only undersea research station, Tohulka helped with research, blogged, answered student e-mails and beamed live webcasts to classrooms across the country.LiNeBrEaKCall him the first teacher to live under water.LiNeBrEaK"Science is all about exploring and discovery," Tohulka said upon his return to dry land last week. "Sometimes, there are questions that require extraordinary means to answer _ like traveling to space or living under water. I want my students to see what is possible."LiNeBrEaKTohulka's students showed plenty of interest, asking dozens of questions when they joined him in a chatroom:LiNeBrEaK"What is the biggest adjustment you have had to make down there?"LiNeBrEaK"Have you done any fish surgeries?"LiNeBrEaK"How's the food?" Taste buds don't work too well under water, so many of the scientists doused their vacuum-packed meals with hot sauce. They also ate plenty of chocolate _ calories aren't a concern when you're losing that much energy in the water.LiNeBrEaKTohulka typed responses to some questions and addressed others during his presentation. There were glitches _ large gaps invaded the video feed _ but that's to be expected when the undersea research station is 3 { miles off the coast of Key Largo.LiNeBrEaK"I couldn't believe that they were down there at the research station and I was up here at school," said Alain Pierre-Louis, 17, a student in Tohulka's marine research class. "It was amazing."LiNeBrEaKAquarius sits in a sand patch in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Roughly the size of a school bus, it holds six bunks, a microwave, a trash compactor, a shower and toilet. Scientists can live there for up to 10 days.LiNeBrEaKResearchers have been diving to the station for more than 14 years to study global climate change, disease pathogens and the coral reef ecosystem, among other things.LiNeBrEaKOn the event of the 100th mission, the Aquarius research team decided to do something a little different.LiNeBrEaK"By embedding a teacher in the science mission, we could give the teacher the experience of being part of the science team," chief scientist Ellen Prager said. "We gave them the real research experience, which, quite frankly, a lot of students don't get."LiNeBrEaKEnter Tohulka, 51, curious for years about living under water. He got his taste in 1995, as part of a diving education program that enabled him to spend one night in an underwater laboratory.LiNeBrEaKSince then, Tohulka has integrated undersea research into lesson plans. In his marine biology classes, Tohulka asks his students to design underwater habitats for humans.LiNeBrEaKSo when Tohulka heard about the Aquarius plan, he got excited fast, spending hours crafting the perfect proposal.LiNeBrEaKTohulka found out in August he had been selected from a competitive field.LiNeBrEaKThree months later, he and a team of scientists began five days of intense training involving numerous diving exercises _ and equipment failure drills conducted without diving masks.LiNeBrEaK"Much of the training had to do with dealing with our problems under water," he said. "The Aquarius is deep enough that we have a decompression obligation. If there's a problem, you can't surface immediately."LiNeBrEaKTohulka also worked with members of the Aquarius team to prepare himself for his research assignment: to study the behavior of fish on Conch Reef.LiNeBrEaKTohulka isn't the only South Florida science teacher going to great lengths to bring science to life for their students.LiNeBrEaKLast spring, two Miami-Dade teachers trained like astronauts in a zero-gravity flight out of Cape Canaveral. Two more are preparing for flights in December.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, teachers in Broward County are connecting their students with researchers in Antarctica with the help of video conferencing technology.LiNeBrEaKTohulka's mission began Nov. 12 and lasted a week.LiNeBrEaKThe team spent mornings diving and observing fish on the reef. They then returned to Aquarius, where Tohulka blogged and chatted with students.LiNeBrEaK"It was really neat to have a network connection under water," he said. "I could hook up my MacBook and open e-mails."LiNeBrEaKTohulka even made a few calls to several classrooms _ including his own.LiNeBrEaKSenior Roda Buenconejo said she and her classmates followed Tohulka's mission on his blog and live video feeds.LiNeBrEaK"There was more space than I thought there would be," she said. "It looked pretty comfortable."LiNeBrEaKAt night, Tohulka would sit at the galley tables and watch fish feed on plankton. Repeat customers included a 4 {-foot goliath grouper.LiNeBrEaK"We saw a lot of the same fish every day," he said. "A lot of them use the station as their territory."LiNeBrEaKAfter 17 hours of decompression, to prevent the bends, the mission came to an end last Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKPrager, the chief scientist, said she was thrilled by how many students participated.LiNeBrEaKFunds permitting, she hopes to bring more teachers to Aquarius.LiNeBrEaKTohulka is looking forward to sharing more of his experience with his students. He's back in the classroom this week.LiNeBrEaK"I would hope that they see me as pretty close to an Average Joe who has had the opportunity to do some things that are definitely out of the ordinary," he said. "They can do things like this, too."

The New York Times 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday  Correction Appended  	A Fiery Czech Is Poised To Be the Face of Europe  	By DAN BILEFSKY  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6  	1242 words  	Late Edition - FinalLiNeBrEaKIn the 1980s, a Communist secret police agent infiltrated clandestine economics seminars hosted by Vaclav Klaus, a fiery future leader of the Czech Republic, who had come under suspicion for extolling free market virtues. Rather than reporting on Marxist heresy, the agent was most struck by Mr. Klaus's now famous arrogance. LiNeBrEaK  ''His behavior and attitudes reveal that he feels like a rejected genius,'' the agent noted in his report, which has since been made public. ''He shows that whoever does not agree with his views is stupid and incompetent.'' LiNeBrEaK  Decades later, Mr. Klaus, the 67-year-old president of the Czech Republic -- an iconoclast with a perfectly clipped mustache -- continues to provoke strong reactions. He has blamed what he calls the misguided fight against global warming for contributing to the international financial crisis, branded Al Gore an ''apostle of arrogance'' for his role in that fight, and accused the European Union of acting like a Communist state.  LiNeBrEaK  Now the Czech Republic is about to assume the rotating presidency of the European Union and there is palpable fear that Mr. Klaus will embarrass the world's biggest trading bloc and complicate its efforts to address the economic crisis and expand its powers. His role in the Czech Republic is largely ceremonial, but he remains a powerful force here, has devotees throughout Europe and delights in basking in the spotlight. LiNeBrEaK  ''Oh God, Vaclav Klaus will come next,'' read a recent headline in the Austrian daily Die Presse, in an article anticipating the havoc he could wreak in a union of 470 million people already divided over its future direction.LiNeBrEaK  An economist by training and a free marketeer by ideology, Mr. Klaus has criticized the course set by the union's departing leader, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. The ambitious Mr. Sarkozy has used France's European Union presidency to push an agenda that includes broader and more coordinated regulation by the largest economies to tame the worst of the market's excesses.LiNeBrEaK  Even those who worry about Mr. Klaus's potential role as a spoiler concede that his influence over policy in the European Union will be circumscribed, given his largely symbolic functions as president in the Czech Republic.LiNeBrEaK  But Mr. Klaus's sheer will and inflammatory talk -- the eminent British historian Timothy Garton Ash once called him ''one of the rudest men I have ever met'' -- are likely to have some impact. LiNeBrEaK  ''Klaus is a provocateur who will twist his arguments to get attention,'' said Jiri Pehe, a former adviser to Vaclav Havel, Mr. Klaus's rival and predecessor as president.LiNeBrEaK  To supporters, Mr. Klaus is a brave, lone crusader, a defender of liberty, the only European leader in the mold of the formidable Margaret Thatcher. (Aides say Mr. Klaus has a photo of the former British prime minister in his office near his desk.)LiNeBrEaK  To his many critics, he is a cynical populist, a hardheaded pragmatist long known as a foil to Mr. Havel, the philosopher-dreamer, and a troublemaker. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Klaus declined to be interviewed for this article. His office called a list of proposed questions ''peculiar.'' LiNeBrEaK  As a former finance minister and prime minister, he is credited with presiding over the peaceful 1993 split of Czechoslovakia into two states and helping to transform the Czech Republic into one of the former Soviet bloc's most successful economies. LiNeBrEaK  But his ideas about governance  are out of step with many of the European Union nations that his country will lead starting Jan. 1. LiNeBrEaK  While even many of the world's most ardent free marketeers  acknowledged the need for the recent coordinated bailout of European banks, Mr. Klaus lambasted it as irresponsible protectionism. He blamed too much -- rather than too little -- regulation for the crisis. LiNeBrEaK  A fervent critic of the environmental movement, he has called global warming a dangerous ''myth,'' arguing that the fight against climate change threatens economic growth. LiNeBrEaK  Perhaps his greatest ire has been reserved for the European Union. In 2005, he called for it to be ''scrapped.'' Now, he is a vocal opponent of the Lisbon Treaty, which aims to help Europe become more of an international player, but which he argues will strip countries of sovereignty. LiNeBrEaK  On a state visit to Ireland this month, Mr. Klaus incensed the government and annoyed many in his own country by publicly praising Declan Ganley, a businessman and political activist who was influential in persuading a majority of Irish voters in June to reject the treaty. LiNeBrEaK  And while other European leaders have criticized a newly assertive Russia, Mr. Klaus has forged close ties with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and recently distanced himself from the Czech government's criticism of Russia over the war with Georgia in August. LiNeBrEaK  Those who know Mr. Klaus say his economic liberalism is an outgrowth of his upbringing. Born in 1941, he obtained an economics degree in 1963 and was deeply influenced by  free market economists like Milton Friedman. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Klaus's son and namesake, Vaclav, recalled in an interview that when he was 13, his father told him to read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to better understand Communism's oppressiveness. LiNeBrEaK  ''If you lived under communism, then you are very sensitive to forces that try to control or limit human liberty,'' he said in an interview. LiNeBrEaK  In 1989, during the Velvet Revolution to overthrow Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders, Mr. Klaus offered his services as an economist to Civic Forum, the group opposing the government. When the new government took control, he became finance minister. But his relationship with the dissidents quickly soured. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Havel recalled in his memoirs that Mr. Klaus had an aversion ''to the rest of us, whom he had clearly consigned to the same Dumpster, with a sign on it saying 'left-wing intellectuals.' ''LiNeBrEaK  In 1991, Mr. Klaus founded a new center-right party, the Civic Democratic Party, which won elections in June 1992, making him prime minister. His radical privatization strategy -- including a voucher scheme later emulated in Russia, where it led to the amassing of vast wealth by a few oligarchs -- was marred by allegations of corruption, with Mr. Havel accusing Mr. Klaus of ''gangster capitalism.''LiNeBrEaK  Ladislav Jakl, now Mr. Klaus's pony-tailed private secretary, said that the main difference between the leaders was that Mr. Havel sought to give people goodness whereas Mr. Klaus was determined to bestow freedom. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Klaus was forced to resign as prime minister in November 1997 after a government crisis caused by a party financing scandal. And in 2002, he was forced to resign as party leader when his party lost a second election. LiNeBrEaK  But Mr. Klaus later decided to run for the presidency and won by a slim margin in 2003. He has since gained in popularity, and was re-elected this year by the Czech Parliament. LiNeBrEaK  Bohumil Dolezal, a leading commentator who once advised Mr. Klaus, said Mr. Klaus's greatest talent was his ability to appeal to average Czechs, who imbibed his easy populism along with their beers. LiNeBrEaK  ''Czechs have a deep and hysterical past full of injustice, and Klaus is a master at tapping into this,'' Mr. Dolezal said, adding that the office of the presidency, despite its limited powers, lends the aura of emperor-king. LiNeBrEaK  ''Even if a horse was president of the Czech Republic, it would have a 50 percent approval rating,'' he said. ''And Klaus is surely much cleverer than a horse.''

The New York Times 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	ECONOMIC SLUMP MAY LIMIT MOVES ON CLEAN ENERGY  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 1  	1606 words  	Just as the world seemed poised to combat global warming more aggressively, the  economic slump and plunging prices of coal and oil are upending plans to wean businesses and consumers from fossil fuel.LiNeBrEaK  From Italy to China, the threat to jobs, profits and government tax revenues posed by the financial crisis has cast doubt on commitments to cap emissions or phase out polluting factories. LiNeBrEaK  Automakers, especially Detroit's Big Three, face collapsing sales, threatening their plans to invest heavily in more fuel-efficient cars. And with gas prices now around $2 a gallon  in the United States, struggling consumers may be less inclined than they once were to trade in their gas-guzzling models in any case.LiNeBrEaK  President-elect Barack Obama and the European Union have vowed to stick to commitments to cap emissions of carbon dioxide and invest in new green technologies, arguing that government action could stimulate the economy and create new jobs in producing sustainable energy. LiNeBrEaK  But as the United Nations prepares to gather the world's environment ministers in Poznan, Poland, next week to try to agree on a new treaty to reduce emissions, both the political will and the economic underpinnings for a much more assertive strategy appear shakier than they did even a few weeks ago. LiNeBrEaK  ''Yes things have changed,'' said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in a phone interview. He is organizing the meeting in Poland. LiNeBrEaK  ''European industry is saying we can't deal with financial crisis and reduce emissions at the same time,'' he said. ''Heads of government have other things on their minds.''LiNeBrEaK  The economic decline also could complicate the political calculus of limiting emissions in developing countries, especially China.LiNeBrEaK  China overtook the United States as the largest producer of greenhouse gases in 2007. But the surge in heavy industry there that produced a sharp increase in its emissions already has given signs of turning into a bust.LiNeBrEaK  Some experts argue that China's emissions -- and the pressing need to limit them -- may recede until economic conditions improve.LiNeBrEaK  No government has officially repudiated climate goals; in Bali last year, all the nations of the world promised to pursue an emissions control treaty. Mr. de Boer said he remained optimistic that major powers would ultimately stick to pledges to reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaK  ''I don't think anyone will show the stupidity to focus on the short term and ignore the long-term issue because these decisions will be with us for 30 years,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  Even so, there are signs of considerable backpedaling in at least near-term commitments to invest in green technology and alternative energy. LiNeBrEaK  Italy's environment minister, Stefania Prestigiacomo, said last month that ''profound changes'' were needed in the European Union climate package because of the global economic crisis. Coal-based economies like Poland's have expressed similar worries. LiNeBrEaK  Theolia, one of France's largest alternative energy companies, has canceled plans for a subsidiary devoted to emerging markets, and pulled back on its goals of how much energy it could produce by 2009. LiNeBrEaK  In the United States, T. Boone Pickens, the Oklahoma oil tycoon who leased hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas for a giant wind farm, has now delayed the project. He told reporters at a recent news conference that fossil fuel prices would have to rise again before it was economically viable.LiNeBrEaK  Barbara Helfferich, the European Commission spokeswoman on the environment, said, ''Investing in reducing emission is more difficult to do in times of economic downturn than when you have money to spend.'' LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama, Mr. de Boer and Stavros Dimas, the European Union environment commissioner, all argue that by promoting new green jobs, even with heavy government subsidies, they could create an engine of economic growth that would help countries pull themselves out of the recession. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama, without releasing specifics of his proposed economic stimulus package, called on the country to build ''wind farms and solar panels, fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead.'' LiNeBrEaK  The European Commission says it is planning to stay its course toward lower emissions -- a 20-percent reduction by 2020 -- and in so doing hopes to have a ''first mover advantage'' in terms of job creation, renewable sources and energy innovation once the global economy rebounds. LiNeBrEaK  ''I know it sounds counterintuitive, but our argument is that because there is an economic turndown, it is just the time to tackle the transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy,'' Ms. Helfferich said. LiNeBrEaK  Recessions can be good or bad for achieving environmental goals, and it remains uncertain how this one will play out. LiNeBrEaK  In the short term, economic declines tend to reduce emissions, because industrial production slows down. Retrenchment will certainly curb fast-growing emissions from China, for example, where double-digit economic growth has been based partly on production from the most polluting industries, such as steel, cement and aluminum. But such reductions are inevitably temporary, rebounding when the economy picks up. LiNeBrEaK  Against this, the current economic slump could have serious long-term environmental consequences, because it may reduce investment in greener production technologies without fundamentally changing the longer-term emissions picture. With so many renewable energy projects and programs in their nascent stages, their success is easily undercut by lack of credit or financing. LiNeBrEaK  Centrica, a British company that has been building wind farms to meet its target of having 15 percent of that country's energy come from renewable sources by 2020, has put three planned offshore wind farms on hold, in part because of rising credit costs. Without projects like these it is unclear if Britain's ambitious emissions reductions target can be met. LiNeBrEaK  At the same time, the price of buying permits to emit carbon dioxide in Europe -- a system the European Union uses to discourage companies from polluting -- have fallen by half compared with the price a year ago, largely because of slower growth. LiNeBrEaK  Wind costs more than $2. 5 billion per gigawatt to build, compared with $600 million for gas. Carbon permits and subsidies can narrow that gap, but the current low prices mean that it is cheaper to burn coal, even after paying penalties for the carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaK  The United Nations says that 40 percent of the world's power generating capacity has to be replaced in the next 5 to 10 years. Six months ago, high oil prices, easy credit and political pressure led many governments to promote biofuels, wind farms and nuclear projects and phase out fossil fuel plants. But the logic of spending more on such plants  has at least partly evaporated.LiNeBrEaK  ''If because of the current economic scenario, you choose cheap and dirty, we'll be in big trouble,'' Mr. de Boer said.LiNeBrEaK  Paradoxically, it may not look that way, at least at first. One big short-term effect of the economic situation is likely to be a reduction of emissions from the developing world. In the decade after the Eastern bloc countries gained independence in 1989, pollution dropped precipitously, as Soviet-era heavy industry shut down.LiNeBrEaK  Emissions dropped sharply between 1990 and 2000, only to start rebounding in the boom years after 2000. By 2006, for example, emissions dropped by 1 percent in industrialized countries (mostly those in Western Europe) that report their emissions to the United Nations. At the same time, they increased by 3 percent in the so called ''economies in transition,'' including the former Soviet bloc states of Eastern Europe. LiNeBrEaK  In the current global recession China could follow a similar trajectory.LiNeBrEaK  The number of cement plants in China rose to 7,000 from 3,000 from the year 2002 to 2007, as China built new cities at a record pace. That catapulted China to top of the list of global emitters, more than a decade earlier than scientists had anticipated just a few years before.LiNeBrEaK  Yet straight-line projections about China's emissions are now again in question, said Trevor Houser, a visiting fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics. LiNeBrEaK  ''Demand for goods like steel, cement and aluminum is contracting severely, so the energy used to produce them is also severely down,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  Last month, he said, China's energy use fell by 4 percent compared with the same month in 2007. A year ago, use was growing at an annual rate of 15 percent.LiNeBrEaK  That may ultimately be a good thing for the Chinese economy as well as the environment, because heavy industry produces heavy emissions, but very few jobs. LiNeBrEaK  Indeed, the slowdown may provide an opportunity for China, too, to reinvent itself with investment in a greener economy. ''Slower energy demand provides an opportunity to move away from coal,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Still, such benefits may be more apparent to environmentalists than to factory owners and finance ministers trying to meet budgets and make profits. The European Union estimates that it will cost Italian industry 13 billion euros, about $16. 7 billion,  to reduce emissions. Italy puts the cost up to 27 billion euros, which is says it cannot afford. LiNeBrEaK  ''Transitions are expensive, but this one will help avoid the ups and downs we've recently seen,'' Ms. Helfferich said. ''This is a short-term bitter apple to create new sectors that are conducive to fighting climate change and jobs as well.''

The Olympian (Washington)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	City reduces emissions  	John Dodge, The Olympian, Olympia, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	889 words  	Nov. 25--The mayors of Olympia, Lacey and Tumwater were among the more than 700 mayors of United States cities who signed an agreement to meet or beat the greenhouse gas reduction goals set forth in the 2005 Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKThe protocol -- signed by 141 countries, but not the United States -- calls for a 7 percent reduction below 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by 2012. LiNeBrEaKSo how are the South Sound cities doing in their bid to act locally on the major global environment issue of the day?LiNeBrEaKIf it was a race, Olympia would be the frontrunner, with Lacey in second and Tumwater starting to make progress, but lagging behind.LiNeBrEaKOlympia: Keeping tabsLiNeBrEaKElected officials in Olympia started taking global warming seriously more than 15 years ago, setting the wheels in motion for a number of projects and programs to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from city operations, city public works director Michael Mucha said.LiNeBrEaKThe city has:LiNeBrEaKSwitched to a biodiesel fuel mix in all diesel-p owered city vehicles, except fire trucks.LiNeBrEaKReduced the size of the vehicle fleet from 250 cars and trucks five years ago to 220 in 2008. From 2000 to 2007, the city reduced fuel consumption by 15,795 gallons and drove 32,209 fewer miles per year.LiNeBrEaKInstalled tire pressure monitoring and anti-idling systems on city vehicles in 2007, which reduces fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKAdded 11 hybrid electric vehicles to the city fleet from 2001 to January 2007.LiNeBrEaKConverted to energy efficient traffic signals beginning in 2005 and launched an energy efficiency program in city buildings in 2006.LiNeBrEaKStarted purchasing green power for all city utility operations in 2007.LiNeBrEaKThe net effect? The city has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions from roughly 7,800 tons per year in 1990 to 5,600 tons in 2007, a 28 percent reduction, according to a carbon footprint calculation of city operations submitted to the City Council earlier this year.LiNeBrEaK"The city has already done a lot without much fanfare," said Jack Zeiger, an energy engineer and member of the Climate Action Group, a South Sound volunteer group.LiNeBrEaKThis year, the city went a step further, using the same model to calculate the entire city's carbon footprint. It totals 659,064 tons, or about 15 tons per person, said Vince McGowan, a data resources manager for the city public works department.LiNeBrEaKThe data will be used by a college intern the city will bring on board in January. The intern will work on ways to incorporate greenhouse gas reductions in a city comprehensive plan slated for completion in 2011.LiNeBrEaKTumwater: Targeting governmentLiNeBrEaKTumwater is the other local government in South Sound to calculate the carbon footprint of its city operations. They used Andy Deffobis, a student at The Evergreen State College who's work as the city's climate protection intern helped him earn his master's degree this year.LiNeBrEaKDeffobis calculated city greenhouse gas emissions at 3,141 tons in 2000 and 4,451 tons in 2006. The city goal is to reduce emissions 7 percent below 2000 levels by 2012.LiNeBrEaKThe city's initial efforts will concentrate on energy efficiency in city buildings and traffic lights, city administrator Doug Baker said.LiNeBrEaK"We need to get our own house in order first," Baker said of the decision to target city operations before conducting a citywide carbon footprint calculation.LiNeBrEaKThe 40 gasoline-powered golf carts at the city-owned Tumwater Valley Golf Course were replaced with electric carts in 2002, and a hybrid electric vehicle and all-electric vehicle have been added to the city fleet.LiNeBrEaKLacey: Green powerLiNeBrEaKLacey has yet to calculate its carbon footprint, but the city did put a big dent in its greenhouse gas emissions by switching to green power in August 2007, assistant city manager Scott Spence said.LiNeBrEaKLacey was the first city in South Sound to change to energy efficient traffic lights, and new vehicles purchased by the city will be powered by biofuels or other alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKLacey spends at least $2 per resident per year on tree plantings and tree care, which helps to sequester greenhouse gases, Spence noted.LiNeBrEaKThurston County: Reducing wasteLiNeBrEaKThurston County government hasn't calculated its carbon footprint either, but has made strides since 2007 to purchase environmentally friendly products and reduce waste at its six county buildings, Thurston County solid waste educator Amber Wells.LiNeBrEaK"We're making some real progress," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe number of local governments, institutions and businesses looking for help to calculate their carbon footprint and develop climate action plans has prompted a winter quarter class at Evergreen in the master's of environmental studies program to train more students to do the work, said John Pumilio, TESC director of sustainability and the class instructor.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Evergreen will host a morning symposium Dec. 6 for local elected officials and government employees to learn more about the emerging energy economy and local climate action plans, Pumilio said.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday   Sunrise Edition	Research ship finds underwater volcano  	MICHELLE MA  	Regional News; Pg. C02  	559 words  	SUMMARY: Exploration   | High-resolution sonar leads to the discovery off Washington's coastLiNeBrEaKResearch ship finds underwater volcanoLiNeBrEaKMICHELLE MALiNeBrEaKSEATTLE --The crew aboard a new research ship didn't expect to find an underwater volcano off the coast of Washington this fall.LiNeBrEaKMaps from previous missions showed only a bump on the seafloor about 200 miles west of Grays Harbor. But the contours of a large volcano emerged as sonar mapped more than 10,000 feet below the ocean's surface. LiNeBrEaK"It turns out we had this great volcano in the spot we were testing," said Jeremy Weirich, the ship's operations officer.LiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship commissioned in August, recently returned to Pier 66 in Seattle after its trial run off Washington. Crew members said they were surprised at the mapping program's extraordinary detail.LiNeBrEaKCollecting ocean images is one part of the ship's mission. Despite ongoing research, NOAA scientists say, close to 95 percent of the ocean remains unexplored. That means a world of underwater volcanoes, deep-dwelling organisms and shipwrecks hasn't been seen by humans.LiNeBrEaKBut understanding the sea goes beyond mere curiosity, experts say. The ocean helps to regulate Earth's temperature and provides oxygen needed for life.LiNeBrEaK"There's no shortage of need to understand the oceans," said Craig Russell, program coordinator for NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research.LiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer is the first U.S. government ship devoted solely to exploring the ocean for scientific discovery. A satellite dish on board will transmit real-time images over the Internet to viewers in classrooms, museums and homes.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is to bring people on shore aboard the ship via modern technology," Russell said.LiNeBrEaKThe ocean's floor hasn't been mapped in great detail along much of Washington's coast, making it a worthwhile place to test the sonar technology, Weirich said. The high-resolution sonar mapped each depth as a different color, showing a dynamic ocean floor with deep ridges and canyons.LiNeBrEaK"There are still discoveries to be made off the coast of Seattle," Weirich said.LiNeBrEaKThe Navy has used the ship since 1988 for sonar surveillance before it was decommissioned and transferred about four years ago to NOAA for exploration.LiNeBrEaKThe Navy put $18 million into preparing the ship, and NOAA contributed an another $5 million, officials said. The ship now has lab space, a control room with two dozen high-definition screens and three underwater robots that can be deployed to explore the sea.LiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer has used Seattle as a temporary home base while being refitted. The ship will be docked at Pier 66 along Seattle's waterfront for the winter, and its underwater-robot technology will be tested off the West Coast in the spring. The ship will have its home port in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay.LiNeBrEaKMost of the experts involved with the ship won't actually be on board while it's out exploring. A communication system with real-time images allows scientists and experts on shore to direct the ship's crew while at sea.LiNeBrEaKSeattle has one of the command centers, while the other four are on the East Coast.LiNeBrEaKFurther field tests for the Okeanos Explorer next year on the West Coast will involve experts at the onshore command centers. The public can watch the ship's progress online when it embarks on its maiden voyage in 2010.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday   Sunrise Edition	Navigating a change in our water future THE CASCADES AQUIFER  	Gordon Grant, Special to The Oregonian  	Editorial; Pg. AME  	636 words  	GORDON GRANT  IN MY OPINION  Navigating a changeLiNeBrEaKin our water futureLiNeBrEaKTHE CASCADES AQUIFERLiNeBrEaKR eaders of the recent article in The Oregonian concerning groundwater in the Cascades ("Cascades hide a mother lode of water," Oct. 20) and the follow-up opinion piece by Douglas Woodcock and Marshall Gannett ("Clearing the air on all that water," Oct. 31) might understandably be confused about the current state of knowledge on the source and availability of water in the Cascades now and in the future. There is actually a high level of agreement among federal, state and university scientists and water managers on this important issue. So let me help to clarify both the knowns and unknowns about the Cascade's remarkable groundwater system.LiNeBrEaKThe relatively young volcanic areas of the central Oregon and northern California Cascades support a large groundwater aquifer. Scientists have known about the presence of this aquifer and its role in supporting streamflow in rivers draining both sides of the Cascade crest since the early part of the last century, although this fact is not widely known outside the region. This aquifer does not represent a new source of water so much as a large storage reservoir, whose full dimensions, extent and dynamics in response to drought and changing climate are still subjects of active research. LiNeBrEaKThe water stored in this aquifer, which originates as rain and snowmelt, emerges through springs and seepage to streams, supplying streamflow throughout the year. Communities, irrigators and aquatic ecosystems depend on this water, most of which is fully allocated under state law.LiNeBrEaKWhile much of this is already known, the "news" that has more recently come to light is the way in which this aquifer system will respond to climate change. Throughout the West, water data indicate --and computer models substantiate --an emerging trend in which warmer temperatures are, in general, causing smaller winter snowpacks and earlier snowmelt. The resulting mismatch between the timing of winter runoff and spring and summer demand is expected to cause greater difficulty in meeting water needs.LiNeBrEaKBut because the Cascade aquifer acts as a large reservoir, storing up rain and snowmelt and releasing it slowly to streams throughout the year, river basins with headwaters in the Cascades will continue to have larger summer flows than many other Western rivers that depend primarily on runoff. Computer modeling has shown, however, that critical late-season flows fed from the Cascade aquifer may be reduced by global warming. The bottom line is that while Cascade streams will continue to have water throughout the year, the late-season flows that we depend on may be markedly smaller.LiNeBrEaKThe implications of this are not fully understood. On the positive side, this region will likely have more water at critical times of the year than other parts of the West, which could result in economic growth. On the negative side, we will likely experience diminished late-season flows and possible increased demand, placing further stress on existing water supplies for municipalities, agriculture, industry and aquatic ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKNavigating this uncertain future will require planning by knowledgeable water managers, policymakers and an informed public. Although work is under way to better characterize our present and future water resources, we should consider investing in expanded data collection and further development of surface-water, groundwater and biological models to forecast the hydrologic and ecosystem responses to climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn the long run, our common goal is to better understand and manage this valuable resource for the benefit of communities and ecosystems in Oregon.LiNeBrEaKGordon Grant is a research hydrologist with the U.S. Forest Service at the Pacific Northwest Research Station in Corvallis.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	SAFE POWER // Policies to build nuclear plants need to be reasonable, rationale  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A12  	440 words  	It's not just banks, insurance companies and automakers looking to Uncle Sam to protect them from the ravages of the marketplace. The nation's electric utilities have their hands out, too. LiNeBrEaKIt's a virtual certainty that no new nuclear plant will be built in this country unless the federal government provides loan guarantees. The companies have said as much.LiNeBrEaKThat includes PPL Corp., which is considering building a third reactor at its nuclear power station near Berwick. The proposed Bell Bend plant, equipped with a French-designed re actor capable of generating 1,600 megawatts of electricity, would be larger than any existing reactor in the United States, and more than twice the size of Three Mile Island Unit 1.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Poli cy Act of 2005 au thorized loan guar antees for energy projects that do not produce the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming and that involve new technologies. The nuclear industry has submitted $122 billion in requests to the Department of Energy, which has approved only $18. 5 billion of them, according to The Wall Street Journal.LiNeBrEaKIn the nuclear-plant building boom of the 1970s it was the rare project that did not exceed original estimates, often by a magnitude of two, three or more times. What nuclear plants ultimately will cost under simplified licensing rules, but unpredictable costs for steel, cement and money, is impossible to say. A proposed new nuclear plant in South Texas has been estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion, but a two-reactor plant proposed in Florida has a $17 million price tag.LiNeBrEaKOf course, nuclear isn't the only energy technology counting on the federal government to provide a financial helping hand. Solar, wind, biofuels and even "clean-coal" technology are heavily funded by taxpayers in various ways.LiNeBrEaKBut nuclear also has the added burden of dealing with long-active, highly lethal radioactive nuclear waste. Continuing to store this material at or near the 104 operating nuclear reactors is a disaster waiting to happen.LiNeBrEaKThe holdup is the impossible standards established by the government to ensure that the waste stored at the government's proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, operates flawlessly for 10,000 years, twice the length of recorded history.LiNeBrEaKSafe nuclear power should be part of the mix in the urgent need to move away from the burning of fossil fuels. But the policies that get us there need to be reasonable and rationale. And the cost of the facilities must stay within the bounds of reality and be competitive with other energy solutions.LiNeBrEaKOtherwise, once again, taxpayers will be taken to the cleaners with little to show for it.

The Press-Republican (Plattsburgh, New York)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Lawmakers missing from climate conversation: Climate conference drew few local public officials  	Kim Smith Dedam, The Press-Republican, Plattsburgh, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	814 words  	Nov. 25--LAKE PLACID -- Even with a sold-out crowd, something seemed missing from the Adirondack Response to Climate Change conference last week.LiNeBrEaKLocal lawmakers were notably absent.LiNeBrEaKOnly five or six county supervisors, mayors or town councilors attended.LiNeBrEaKBut their policy will be required to chart any successful energy-efficient course. LiNeBrEaKBAD TIMINGLiNeBrEaKBusy schedules and distance were reasons some supervisors had for not attending.LiNeBrEaK"The timing for townships couldn't have been worse," said Supervisor Thomas Scozzafava (R-Moriah).LiNeBrEaKTown budgets were due to the state by Nov. 20.LiNeBrEaKPlus the 150-to-175-mile round trip to the conference held at the Wild Center in Tupper Lake proved too costly.LiNeBrEaK"My reason," said Supervisor David H. Blades (R-Lewis), "is from the Town of Lewis to Tupper Lake and back again is a lot of miles. In these times of economic distress, I just felt it was a costly situation."LiNeBrEaK"There isn't time," said Supervisor Daniel Connell (D-Westport). "We're trying to rebuild a bridge, interviewing six firms to design the town garage, applying for permits for a new water system in Wadhams. We held a public hearing (Tuesday night) for a subdivision so we can rebuild a road.LiNeBrEaK"Supervisors' jobs have turned into a monster. Almost every town in Essex County has a water project going, a sewer project going."LiNeBrEaKSupervisor Joyce Morency (R-St. Armand) said nearly the same thing.LiNeBrEaK"My calendar fills right up. Being a small town, you have so many things to do, and the budget process has been longer and harder this year."LiNeBrEaK"Supervisors just had real scheduling conflicts," said Supervisor Noel Merrihew III (R-Elizabethtown). "You've got to put out the fires burning brightest."LiNeBrEaKEXPERTISELiNeBrEaKFranklin County Legislator Tim Burpoe (D-Saranac Lake), also an accredited forest manager, said climate change is a subject of keen interest to him.LiNeBrEaK"To tell you the truth, I didn't know about the conference," he said. "If they had invited me, they would have gotten two for one."LiNeBrEaKHe ended up traveling elsewhere on business last week.LiNeBrEaKENLIGHTENINGLiNeBrEaKSupervisor Cathy Moses (R-Schroon), who is chair of the Essex County Board of Supervisors, did attend full sessions on both days.LiNeBrEaKShe said what she took from the conference was invaluable.LiNeBrEaK"I really felt better educated. I thought the way they presented the conference was really good, with the breakout sessions and working groups.LiNeBrEaK"I was one of those skeptics going in, but what I failed to understand is how science has measured climate change moving along faster than it would naturally in our environment."LiNeBrEaKSAVING MONEYLiNeBrEaKWhether contrarian or not, she said, bottom-line energy efficiency matters to taxpayers.LiNeBrEaK"I will move forward and discuss these ideas with my colleagues at the Board of Supervisors. If there's a way we can save money for our taxpayers, we should move forward on it."LiNeBrEaKImproved energy efficiency is a key priority, each town leader said, with or without a changing climate.LiNeBrEaKIn Moriah, for example, the new wastewater treatment plant was just updated with Energy Star motors and pumps that cost less to run.LiNeBrEaKAnd plans are on the table to build a woodchip heating system for the town garage, Scozzafava said.LiNeBrEaK"It's a $70,000 investment, but the return on that investment looks pretty good compared to $30,000 expense for No. 2 fuel.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not going to become part of the debate about climate change, but we absolutely need to find different sources of energy for now and for future generations."LiNeBrEaKCARBON VALUELiNeBrEaKTowns in both Essex and Franklin counties are major players in carbon trade; each county has more than 1 million acres of state land.LiNeBrEaKBurpoe said carbon sequestration value brings a case for selective forestry management.LiNeBrEaK"State purchases for non-managed lands are not helping our state carbon footprint," he said.LiNeBrEaKUnmanaged Forever Wild lands are not as valuable as forests cut to keep new growth constant, Burpoe said.LiNeBrEaK"There are all kinds of incentives for carbon sequestration, financial and otherwise, on the forestry side of the equation."LiNeBrEaKLegislators discussed 23 points to reduce the Franklin County budget last week, he noted.LiNeBrEaK"A number of them I would consider green."LiNeBrEaKMerrihew said energy-efficiency policy will be part of county discussions.LiNeBrEaK"To have 18 supervisors attend a conference is not an efficient use of government management. Hopefully, the final analysis will forward directives to the next layer (policymaker), to see what is a next step."LiNeBrEaKE-mail Kim Smith Dedam at: kdedam@pressrepublican.com	LEGISLATORS (91%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); COUNTIES (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); MAYORS (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (77%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (71%); WATER and SEWER SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION (71%); BUDGET (70%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (65%); SEWERAGE SYSTEMS (65%)  				General  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (55%)  	NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	November 25, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081125-ZI-Lawmakers-missing-from-climate-conversation-1125  	ZI  													
Sacramento Bee (California)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Californians will lead on warming  	The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	612 words  	Nov. 25--In responding to the threat of climate change, California has been far ahead of the federal government. It's an exciting and worrisome place to be.LiNeBrEaKExciting, because California has rightly acknowledged the threat that global warming poses to its future and to that of all countries.LiNeBrEaKWorrisome, because if California were to go it alone in cutting greenhouse gases and transitioning to a cleaner economy, other states and nations might continue with business as usual, overwhelming any progress here. LiNeBrEaKYet as the Nov. 4 election has demonstrated, California will not need to go it alone. In speaking by video to a conference in Los Angeles last week, President-elect Barack Obama repeated his vow to seek federal legislation that would cut greenhouse gas emissions nationwide to 1990 levels by 2020, with an additional 80 percent cut by 2050.LiNeBrEaKHe also promised "a new era of global cooperation on climate change" -- in other words, an international treaty that President George W. Bush has spurned.LiNeBrEaKIt was revealing that Obama chose a bipartisan summit in Los Angeles, convened by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and four other governors, to make his second major policy address since the election. Clearly, the sun is rising over California's influence on climate policy.LiNeBrEaKOne sign of California's clout is the ascension of U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman of Los Angeles to head the House Energy and Commerce Committee. On a 137-122 vote in his Democratic caucus last week, Waxman unseated John Dingell of Michigan to head this powerful panel, which has authority over major bills involving energy, health care and climate policy.LiNeBrEaKUnlike Dingell, who has long been aligned with the Detroit auto industry, Waxman supports stringent laws to cap greenhouse gases and improve the fuel efficiency of trucks and cars. Had Dingell retained his chairmanship, it would have complicated Obama's efforts to pass strong environmental legislation and retool the auto industry for the challenges ahead.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's new post means that he and California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who heads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, will play pivotal roles on future climate legislation. And by the time Obama finishes making all his appointments, Waxman and Boxer could have several California connections within the new administration.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Obama's transition office announced its intent to name one of Waxman's aides, Philip Schiliro, as the White House director of congressional relations.LiNeBrEaKMary Nichols, who heads the California Environmental Protection Agency and is charged with implementing the state's main climate law, Assembly Bill 32, has been mentioned as a possible candidate to serve as Obama's EPA secretary. Other Californians are being considered for posts at the energy and interior departments.LiNeBrEaKWhile some analysts continue to dismiss California's climate policies as acts of symbolism, the actions of the president-elect indicate otherwise. These policies are being closely studied by other states and countries, and they could well become a template for the new president and his environmental advisers.LiNeBrEaKAt the very least, Obama and his transition team seem highly interested in California's trailblazing efforts, and in the trailblazers who have put the state on the map.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Building boom at Scripps;  Conference center taking shape; new lab gets funds 	Mike Lee, STAFF WRITER  	LOCAL ; Pg. B-1  	644 words  	Construction is winding down on a state-of-the-art conference center at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, but campus officials won't get much of a break before their next building project begins.LiNeBrEaKCrews worked yesterday at the gleaming conference center, which is expected to boost the institution's already strong scientific reputation by allowing it to host major meetings about climate change, sea life and other hot topics.LiNeBrEaKOn the same day, the institution announced the U.S. Department of Commerce pledged $12 million toward a new marine ecosystems laboratory. Construction is scheduled to start in summer 2010 and conclude in 2012. LiNeBrEaKThe award was a coup for Scripps, selected from among 93 grant applications nationwide. Officials said it's rare for the federal government to offer grant money for building laboratories.LiNeBrEaK"We are grateful for this vote of confidence," said Tony Haymet, Scripps director. "It sort of shows that we are still at the top of our game."LiNeBrEaKThe building, expected to offer more than 18,000 square feet of usable space, will combine research programs related to understanding how the world's oceans work and predicting how they will change. Scripps plans to cover the total $26. 5 million cost with the federal grant, campus funds, a loan and donations.LiNeBrEaKNews about the laboratory gift arrived as the $15. 5 million conference center takes final form on the southwest edge of campus, which is part of the University of California San Diego.LiNeBrEaKThe Robert Paine Scripps Forum for Science, Society and the Environment was paid for by private gifts -- mostly from Scripps family members -- and $3 million in loans, said Doug Bennett, finance director at the institution.LiNeBrEaKRobert Paine Scripps is known as the man who saved the institution during the Great Depression.LiNeBrEaKMajor construction is supposed to conclude in mid-December, followed by several weeks of installing furniture and equipment. The public opening is set for March.LiNeBrEaKThe center includes a main auditorium and four meeting rooms. It was designed to overcome what school administrators have called a "significant handicap" -- a lack of places where researchers and policymakers from around the world can connect. Until now, Scripps has relied on a decades-old auditorium with inadequate multimedia capabilities.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the existing conference room, the Scripps Forum will offer the latest technology, including teleconference capabilities, surround sound and 3-D projection systems.LiNeBrEaK"The facility was envisioned as the next-generation meeting space and the ... place where great scientific minds from ocean and earth science could come together and solve the problems facing the planet," Bennett said.LiNeBrEaKThe building also signifies Scripps' increasing interest in playing a bigger role in San Diego and other communities.LiNeBrEaK"In the climate change area ... our job has been collecting the data, understanding what it means and explaining it to people. But things have definitely changed," Haymet said. "The (Scripps) family wanted to look outward and, on the basis of scientific data, be informing policy decisions."LiNeBrEaKFrom an aesthetic perspective, the center adds drama to UCSD's lower campus, with its curved lines, soaring sunshades and liberal use of teak and glass. It features exterior walkways, a second-story deck, a cafe and sweeping views of the beach below.LiNeBrEaKArchitect Taal Safdie of San Diego aimed to make the conference center feel like a "village" of small buildings. "We wanted to make sure that the building did not become a wall that blocks the view of the ocean for the rest of the campus," Safdie said.LiNeBrEaKCONFERENCE CENTERLiNeBrEaKBY THE NUMBERSLiNeBrEaKThe Scripps Institution of Oceanography is almost done building its new complex:LiNeBrEaK4: meeting roomsLiNeBrEaK290: seats in the main auditoriumLiNeBrEaK850: total seatingLiNeBrEaK12,000: square feet of meeting spaceLiNeBrEaK$7,500: cost of daily rental to the publicLiNeBrEaK$15. 5 million: total project cost	EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); OCEANS (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); GRANTS and GIFTS (90%); OCEANOGRAPHY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (89%); COMMERCIAL and INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTION (79%); SCIENCE NEWS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (76%); RESEARCH (75%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (75%); EDUCATION (64%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (55%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (50%) BEACHES; COLLEGES; COST; ENVIRONMENT; OCEANS; SAN DIEGO;   		UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (54%)  				SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 27, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The San Diego Union-Tribune   				1 CHART; 3 PICS; CAPTIONS: 1.

LiNeBrEaKThe Santa Cruz lawmaker, known for his work on environmental protection and for authoring legislation on its behalf, has accepted an appointment to the California Integrated Waste Management Board, four blocks from the Assembly chamber.LiNeBrEaKAs a member of the six-person leadership board, Laird will help steer the agency's nearly 500 employees and $209 million annual budget in managing roughly 92 million tons of waste generated in California each year and finding ways to reduce it.LiNeBrEaK"They have a role in some of the major environmental issues of our time," Laird said Monday.LiNeBrEaKThe agency has recently had its hand in clearing hazardous waste sites from national parks, developing programs to deal with the state's mounting e-waste, introducing environmental literacy programs in schools and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from California landfills.LiNeBrEaK"It's a place where you can make of it what you want," Laird said. "It's hard to imagine I won't get involved in climate change and some of the things related to oceans."LiNeBrEaKThe three-term assemblyman, who is forced to leave office because of term limits, was named to the post by currentLiNeBrEaKAssembly Speaker Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaK"John Laird has consistently demonstrated the ability to handle tough challenges with a sharp intellect and good humor," Bass said in a prepared statement. "Those qualities will be very valuable in his new duties helping promote a sustainable environment in California."LiNeBrEaKLaird is expected to start work Monday, the day after he officially leaves the Assembly.LiNeBrEaKAs chair of the Assembly Budget Committee for the past four years, he has been working until the end with the governor and legislative leaders to address the state's unprecedented budget gap.LiNeBrEaKWhile he jokes about getting some sleep once his budget responsibilities are behind him, Laird wishes he was able to leave office with the state on more solid financial footing.LiNeBrEaK"It's just frustrating because people are retreating to their ideological corners," he said. "And some of us are trying to be realistic."LiNeBrEaKThe budget debate, which has mired lawmakers the entirety of Laird's final year, has come down to Democrats pushing for new revenues, namely taxes, and Republicans adamant about cutting public spending with no new taxes.LiNeBrEaKBeyond taking center stage in state budget battles, Laird leaves the Assembly with several new environmental laws on the books, including legislation that protects wildlife, expands water conservation and recycling programs and promotes renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKOn the waste management board, Laird expects to continue his environmental agenda, spending time in both Sacramento as well as in a yet-to-be-determined Santa Cruz County office.LiNeBrEaKHe will make about $130,000 annually as a board member. He replaces Cheryl Peace, who is stepping down from her current term, which ends in 2010. Laird could be appointed for another term at that time.LiNeBrEaKCarmel resident Bill Monning will replace Laird as the 27th District assemblyman, representing portions of Santa Cruz, Monterey and Santa Clara counties.LiNeBrEaKContact Kurtis Alexander at kalexander@santacruzsentinel.com or 706-3267.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Hot team, hot topic  	The Salt Lake Tribune  	COMMENTARY  	466 words  	Nov. 25--Gov. Jon Huntsman and other Western governors who want quick action to reduce potentially catastrophic global warming apparently have found an ally in President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaKObama, under the gun to ease the economic meltdown that is threatening the U.S. economy as soon as he takes office, says he does not plan to delay his promised attack on carbon emissions. He and his energy advisers say the two issues should be addressed at the same time since they are intertwined.LiNeBrEaKHis approach dovetails nicely with the forward-thinking ideas the governors have wisely embraced. Not surprisingly, the conservative Utah Legislature is less than wholeheartedly behind Huntsman on this issue. But the governor and Obama realize the country has no time to waste before acting to clean up the air, to preserve precious water supplies and to end a dead-end reliance on fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKHuntsman, a Republican just elected to his second term with record voter support, and Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, let the president-to-be know precisely where the Western Governors Association stands on energy. In a letter they hand-delivered to Washington last week, 14 of the 19 association members support priorities for addressing global warming, including reducing greenhouse-gas emissions using a market approach, rewarding better energy efficiency, importing less oil, encouraging energy research and helping consumers.LiNeBrEaKThe governors and Obama agree that implementingLiNeBrEaKnew technologies for alternative energy and making existing power plants more environment-friendly can create jobs.LiNeBrEaKHuntsman and his colleagues warn that procrastinating on meeting the climate-change threat would be dangerous. The Earth's temperatures are rising more rapidly than predicted and are linked to severe weather, increasing wildfires, reduced snowpack and longer, hotter summers in the West.LiNeBrEaKObama agrees. He is likely to push for a stimulus package for the ailing economy that would include investments in energy alternatives and advanced "green" technologies. Democratic members of Congress also feel the urgency. The election of California's Henry Waxman, an environmental hawk, as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee bodes well for quick action.LiNeBrEaKClimate change is a nonpartisan global threat. Utah lawmakers should join the governor in efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	Sun rising on state's power horizon;  Solar adds less than 1% to energy stores, but backer says new systems 'impressive' 	George Raine, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Business; Pg. D1  	612 words  	Solar power accounts for less than 1 percent of California's energy resources, but Bay Area residents are buying systems in increasing numbers, which is good news for the environment and the solar industry, advocates say.LiNeBrEaKCalifornians have more than 60 percent of the nation's solar installations, and more than 66 percent of the state's solar applications are in Northern California, according to a report released Monday by the Northern California Solar Energy Association, a nonprofit advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKFor 2007, statewide there were 50,466 photovoltaic installations, yielding 244 megawatts of electricity, according to the report. LiNeBrEaKThe report also tracks energy installations for 165 cities in the nine Bay Area counties plus Santa Cruz County.LiNeBrEaKIt finds that the installations statewide, for homes and commercial facilities, generate nearly 400 megawatts of power one megawatt serves 750 homes, and the number is growing. Over the past several years, Californians have installed from 30 to 40 percent more systems than the year before, and 2008 is expected to show an even greater increase.LiNeBrEaKAmong other findings:LiNeBrEaK-- Santa Clara County has the most solar installations among the region's counties, with 2,462. That's far more than second-place Alameda's 1,699.LiNeBrEaK-- Napa County is first among counties in watts per capita, with 51. 3.LiNeBrEaK-- Santa Rosa is first among large cities in watts per capita installed, with 29. 9.LiNeBrEaK-- Berkeley has the highest number of solar systems per 1,000 citizens, with 4. 17.LiNeBrEaK-- In the Bay Area and Santa Cruz County, there are 11,563 solar projects, built at a cost of $746 million, producing more than 84 megawatts of electricity, according to the report. The report includes installations as of Dec. 31.LiNeBrEaKGary Gerber, president of Sun Light and Power in Berkeley and a sponsor of the report, said, "The information provided by this report is absolutely critical to understanding this industry, and the growth that this report demonstrated in the popularity of solar energy is truly impressive."LiNeBrEaKThe California Energy Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission track solar usage as well. The energy commission found that in the past two years, since a state program promoting solar energy was launched, there have been 17,000 solar energy installations placed on homes and businesses, said spokeswoman Amy Morgan.LiNeBrEaKSolar power is increasingly popular because it's clean. It causes no emissions and does not contribute to global warming. Fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that traps heat like a greenhouse and raises temperatures.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger launched an effort called the Million Solar Roofs plan, to encourage property owners to install a million solar roofs in California by 2018.LiNeBrEaKIn August, he signed legislation that continues a property tax exclusion for projects that utilize solar panel energy and expands the exclusion to builder-installed solar energy systems in new homes. The original property tax exclusion was passed by voters in 1980.LiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 17, Schwarzenegger signed an executive order that aims to streamline the state's renewable energy project approval process and seeks to increase renewable energy usage to 33 percent of the total by 2020.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, renewables represent only 11. 8 percent of the total system power in the state for major installations.LiNeBrEaKBay counties' solar collection LiNeBrEaKSanta Clara has by far the highest number of solar installations among Bay Area counties.LiNeBrEaKCountyLiNeBrEaKInstallationsLiNeBrEaKSanta ClaraLiNeBrEaKAlamedaLiNeBrEaKSonomaLiNeBrEaKContra CostaLiNeBrEaKMarinLiNeBrEaKSan MateoLiNeBrEaKSan FranciscoLiNeBrEaKNapaLiNeBrEaKSolanoLiNeBrEaKSource: Northern California Solar Energy Association 	SOLAR ENERGY (94%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (89%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (79%); EMISSIONS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (77%); SPONSORSHIP (75%); PLANETS and ASTEROIDS (74%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (74%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (73%); PROPERTY TAX (69%) BUSINESS; SOLAR ENERGY; STATISTICS  					ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (50%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (97%); SAN JOSE, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	August 10, 2009  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  				Javier Hernandez and other students in a solar photovoltaic systems instructional class assemble an array in San Jose in August.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	THE BOTTOM LINE  		Business; THE BOTTOM LINE; Pg. D1  	729 words  	Flexing muscles for EarthLiNeBrEaKLevi Strauss has joined the war on global warming. So has Sun Microsystems. The two Bay Area multinationals are founding members of the recently formed BICEP, or Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy. With the changes in Washington, D.C., "it's time to move toward more of an advocacy position," said Anna Walker, senior manager of worldwide government affairs and public policy for Levi Strauss. LiNeBrEaK The group's other members are Nike, Starbucks and Timberland. Together, they'll be pushing Congress to pass legislation in the Obama administration's first 100 days to: LiNeBrEaK-- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 25 percent below 1990 levels.LiNeBrEaK-- Create a global cap and trade system.LiNeBrEaK-- Invest hugely in green tech.LiNeBrEaK "What we bring are big brand names that help give leverage to lawmakers who want to do something ambitious," Walker said.LiNeBrEaK But Levi Strauss has some work to do closer to home. Admitting that its own emissions record needs improving, Walker said the San Francisco company is developing reduction targets for its factories and buildings. It's also switching out the laundry labels on its namesake jeans. They will henceforth urge consumers to switch to cold water wash and tumble dry medium settings. Or hang them on a clothes line to dry assuming the condo association approves. LiNeBrEaKA trivial step in the grand scheme of things? Research indicates that some of the biggest greenhouse gas emissions come from home laundering. "That was a big aha moment for us," Walker said.LiNeBrEaKSalary givebacks? At UC, it's all academic: University heads are giving back some of their outsize salaries, according to news reports. They include the chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the presidents of Washington University in Seattle and Washington State University. "It seems like sort of belated recognition that this presidential pay thing has gotten out of hand," Pat Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, is quoted as saying.LiNeBrEaKAre similar thoughts occurring to UC President Mark Yudof - whose estimated compensation for 2007-08 was $828,000 - or to the regents who set his pay? While UC is undergoing cost cutting and is looking for more systemwide savings, "asking employees at any level to take pay cuts is not part of our strategy at the moment," said UC spokesman Brad Hayward. "And that includes the president."LiNeBrEaKDeath by a thousand cuts: One thousand, seven hundred pounds of turkey preordered by customers would normally be considered a good business indicator for your friendly neighborhood butcher. But Josh Drewes wasn't smiling much as he watched the Thanksgiving cargo being unloaded from a refrigerated truck Sunday morning outside Drewes Bros. in San Francisco's relatively affluent Noe Valley. Even here, people are cutting back. This season's turkey shipment was significantly less than what he would have normally planned on selling. Even the great American eating fest will barely make a dent in the "horrible" time Josh said the 120-year-old meat market has experienced of late.LiNeBrEaKA sign on a wall above Drewes' meat counter told more of the story: "CASH HELPS THIS BUSINESS WITH DAILY OPERATIONS." Meaning customers could pay for their victuals the old-fashioned way, rather than Josh having to wait for credit card and debit card payments to clear the bank. Why? Because his wholesalers are demanding cash payments, what with the credit freeze that's hitting small businesses badly. "They really are afraid," Drewes said. "So I'm spending all my time negotiating and bartering to keep things going. Not what I should be doing every day." LiNeBrEaKAnother great carve-up: Mervyns' 18,000 employees are still waiting to see whether the Hayward chain raises enough money from its going-out-of-business sales to pay for their accrued vacation pay. The private equity owners, on the other hand, haven't had to wait to count their accrued gains of $250 million or more from the liquidating company. That was the estimated profit they earned from selling off the real estate they bought as part of the buyout of the Hayward company in 2004, according to a lawsuit filed by Mervyns' management and a story in Monday's Wall Street Journal.LiNeBrEaKOwner/beneficiary in chief: Cerberus Capital Management, the same outfit that currently owns Chrysler.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	PUC approves northern oil pipeline  	By Leslie Brooks Suzukamo lsuzukamo@pioneerpress.com  	BUSINESS  	396 words  	A Houston pipeline company got permission from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday to lay a 285-mile pipeline across the northern part of the state to deliver tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, to Superior, Wis. LiNeBrEaKEnbridge Energy Co. said the Minnesota segment is part of a larger $4. 5 billion pipeline project that would stretch nearly 1,000 miles from Alberta through Clearbrook, Minn., to Superior, with the capacity to pump up to 450,000 barrels of crude a day through a 36-inch diameter steel pipe.LiNeBrEaKThe pipeline could be operational by 2010, and the project includes a smaller pipe -- the Minnesota segment is 175 miles -- to deliver diluents from Chicago to Clearbrook that will make the heavy crude easier to pump to Superior and beyond.LiNeBrEaKThe PUC voted 5-0 to approve a use permit for the pipelines, dismissing concerns from environmentalists that strip mining to extract the tar sands would devastate Canadian forests and produce three to five times more greenhouse gases than conventional crude oil operations.LiNeBrEaKThe oil would serve bigger markets like Chicago instead of the Twin Cities, but the entire Midwest would benefit from the extra capacity, said Denise Hamsher, the director of regulatory affairs for Enbridge Energy.LiNeBrEaKWith declining U.S. domestic production, more imports will be needed to meet future needs, and Canada, the United States' largest source of foreign oil providing nearly 2 million barrels a day, is a stable and reliable provider, she said.LiNeBrEaKEnbridge already has pipelines that deliver 1. 5 million barrels of Canadian oil a day through Minnesota, Hamsher said.LiNeBrEaKThe Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy opposes energy projects like the pipeline that depend upon oil or coal because of these commodities' contributions to greenhouse gases and global warming. It disputed Enbridge's claims about rising energy needs.LiNeBrEaKU.S. drivers reduced gasoline usage by driving 90 billion fewer miles over the past 11 months, said Kevin Reuther, the MCEA's legal director. State and federal policies make it likely further drops will follow, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe PUC delayed a decision on whether to route a small portion of the pipeline through the Fond du Lac Reservation, which already has four Enbridge pipelines. The tribe and Enbridge disagree on how much the tribe should be paid for the new line.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Racial disparities persist despite election of first black president  	STEPHEN OHLEMACHER  	FRONT; Pg. A3  	610 words  	By Stephen OhlemacherLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKThe day after Barack Obama was elected president, Kari Fulton heard a white colleague proclaim that racism in America is dead.LiNeBrEaKShe cringed, worrying it might be a sign of flagging interest in the fight against discrimination.LiNeBrEaK"In reality, racism is still very much alive and well," said Fulton, who graduated last year from Howard University, a historically black college in the nation's capital. LiNeBrEaKObama's election has generated a euphoria among black Americans. For some, the weight of history has finally been eased after generations of struggling for equality. But amid the postelection glow of racial harmony lurks a sobering fact: Racial disparities persist - in just about every measurable form - and they won't simply melt away because the nation has a black president.LiNeBrEaKFulton, 23, was part of a group of young black activists from across the country who worked to register and turn out young black voters in the presidential election. The National Coalition on Black Civic Participation brought the group together shortly after the election to learn about converting their enthusiasm into ongoing political activism.LiNeBrEaK"Election Day was just the beginning," said Fulton, who lives in Washington and works as an organizer for the Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative. "People don't expect President Obama to be a superhero. We have to solve our own problems."LiNeBrEaKThe problems are significant. About a quarter of black Americans live in poverty - nearly three times the rate for whites - at a time when rising budget deficits and expensive corporate bailouts are going to leave little federal money for anti-poverty programs. The federal budget deficit is likely to hit a record $1 trillion next year.LiNeBrEaKBlack adults are less likely than whites to have college degrees and more likely to be in prison. Blacks are less likely than whites to have health insurance and, on average, they don't live as long as whites. Homicide is the leading cause of death among black males ages 15 to 34 .LiNeBrEaKThe good news: Poverty and education levels for blacks have improved in the past two decades, and incarceration rates for blacks are dropping even as they increase for whites.LiNeBrEaKStill, the income gap has barely changed in 30 years, with a typical black household making only 62 percent of the income of a typical white household.LiNeBrEaKMarc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League, knows the numbers well. Each year, the civil rights group publishes a book called "The State of Black America," which has chapters of data on disparities between whites and blacks.LiNeBrEaK"A mere election does not change the abject conditions for African Americans or the 230-plus years of racial injustice," Morial said.LiNeBrEaKThe foreword of the 2007 edition of the book was written by Obama, then the junior senator from Illinois.LiNeBrEaK"This sad story is a stark reminder that the long march toward true and meaningful equality in America isn't over," Obama wrote. "We have a long way to go."LiNeBrEaKIn his election-night victory speech Obama talked about the historic nature of his election. But he had spent much of the campaign soft-pedaling race; he acknowledged its role in society when asked, but he rarely brought it up on his own.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, many black Americans, who voted more than 9-to-1 for Obama, have embraced his victory as their own.LiNeBrEaK"You can never really measure the symbolism of a Barack Obama victory," Morial said. "There is no substitute for this idea of role modeling."LiNeBrEaKone inequalityLiNeBrEaKA typical black household makes only 62 percent of the income of a typical white household, a gap that has barely changed in 30 years.

The Washington Times 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Senate runoff seen favoring Chambliss;  Obama team aids rival 	By S.A. Miller, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PAGE ONE; A01  	909 words  	Democrat Jim Martin is campaigning feverishly, aided by Barack Obama's grass-roots organization from the presidential race and a flood of support from the national party, but he remains an underdog against incumbent Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss in a Georgia runoff election considered pivotal for the balance of power in the U.S. Senate.LiNeBrEaKMr. Martin is behind in polls, has half the cash of his opponent and early-voting turnout among black voters is stagnating - a crucial block for any Democrat in this mostly conservative state where Republicans also hold the other U.S. Senate seat, the governor's office and majorities in both houses of the state General Assembly. LiNeBrEaKThat doesn't bode well for Mr. Martin and Senate Democrats eyeing an unexpected victory Tuesday to put them one vote away from a filibuster-breaking 60-vote majority and the power to ram the party's agenda through the chamber.LiNeBrEaK"The holiday, the cold weather, the relatively lackluster campaign [by Mr. Martin] will put Senator Chambliss in the winning column," said University of Georgia political science professor Audrey A. Haynes. "With all of the potential issues that are positive for Martin and negative for Chambliss, it should be a Martin win, albeit a bit of a squeaker. But there just doesn't seem to be any fire."LiNeBrEaKMr. Martin balked at the charge he was not exciting the electorate.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think that's true," he told The Washington Times. "We are working hard at it. You know, it is not for me to excite them. They are excited about this race. They are excited about change in this country. They are excited about my candidacy ... and the issues I've talked about That's what's exciting."LiNeBrEaKMost of the excitement has surrounded Mr. Martin's events that were headlined by celebrity politicians, including a visit last week by former President Bill Clinton and a fundraiser Sunday in Atlanta with climate-change crusader and former Vice President Al Gore.LiNeBrEaKBoth campaigns overhauled their get-out-the-vote drives to counter the voter fatigue typical in runoffs. But Mr. Martin needs more of a turnout boost than his opponent. He finished nearly 110,000 votes behind Mr. Chambliss in the general election, despite the enthusiasm generated by Mr. Obama at the top of the Democratic ticket.LiNeBrEaKThe task only gets more difficult in this second round of balloting, which was triggered when none of the contenders captured more than 50 percent of the vote Nov. 4.LiNeBrEaKMr. Martin enlisted Mr. Obama's turnout team from Georgia and neighboring states. They have opened about 25 office across the state with 200 staff members and thousands of volunteers, supplying Mr. Obama's database from the general election to target voters for Mr. Martin.LiNeBrEaK"We have Georgians," Chambliss campaign spokeswoman Michelle Grasso said. "We don't need the AFL-CIO or people from other states."LiNeBrEaKMr. Chambliss finished first in the general election 49. 8 percent to Mr. Martin's 46. 8 percent. Libertarian Allen Buckley, a tax lawyer from Smyrna, Ga., took 3. 4 percent of the vote to help force a runoff. Under Georgia law, only the top two candidates advance to the Tuesday vote.LiNeBrEaKMr. Martin continues to trail in polls and even his campaign staff say their own pollsters show the former state lawmaker behind 48 percent to 46 percent, though within the margin of error.LiNeBrEaKA new poll released Monday showed Mr. Chambliss widening his lead to a six-point margin since the general election. The survey by Public Policy Polling, a nonpartisan firm based in Raleigh, N.C., found the incumbent gaining among independent voters that likely backed Mr. Buckley in the first vote.LiNeBrEaKThe poll also gauged declining interest among black voters and young voters. Those groups likely benefited Mr. Martin as they helped give Mr. Obama 47 percent of the vote in a solid red state won by Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain with 52. 2 percent.LiNeBrEaK"They may have voted for Jim Martin as long as they were at the polls, but for now anyway, it doesn't look like they're planning to come out just for Martin," Public Policy Polling president Dean Debnam said. "That puts Saxby Chambliss in good shape headed to the final week of the campaign."LiNeBrEaKMartin supporters hold out hope Mr. Obama will swoop in to rally the base, but those chances appear to be dimming, as the president-elect would risk suffering a political loss before the inauguration and expose himself to criticism of striking a partisan tone during what he promises will be a transition to a postpartisan Washington.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama did produce a radio spot for the Democrat that is airing across the state, and there are reports a TV ad featuring Mr. Obama may be in the works.LiNeBrEaKEven without a TV appearance or an in-person visit, Mr. Obama looms large in the election.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama echoes the Obama presidential campaign, calling for change and blasting Mr. Chambliss for siding with Wall Street over Main Street. He blames him for the financial meltdown and for voting for the $700 billion rescue for the finance industry.LiNeBrEaK"For six years, he voted to get us into this mess," said the baritone narrator in a frequently aired Martin TV ad.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Chambliss, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and some third-party groups are dominating the TV ad war. The ads hit Mr. Martin for being soft on crime, for supporting abortions for children without parental consent and for backing tax increases as a state representative while voting to increase his own taxpayer-funded expense account.

The Washington Times 	November 25, 2008 Tuesday 	Waxman vital link for Obama agenda  	By Jon Ward, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PLUGGED IN - POLITICS; B01  	925 words  	In the first year or two of President-elect Barack Obama's term, he will work hand in glove with Rep. Henry Waxman to devise a plan limiting carbon emissions that will impact every corner of the economy and U.S. industry.LiNeBrEaKThe new president and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also will coordinate to remake America's health care system and provide universal coverage. LiNeBrEaKOne man will be the conduit that makes this landscape-altering relationship tick.LiNeBrEaKPhil Schiliro, 52, worked for Mr. Waxman, California Democrat, for 25 of the past 26 years, until July, when Mr. Obama hired him to oversee congressional relations for his presidential campaign.LiNeBrEaKA week ago, Mr. Obama announced that Mr. Schiliro will be head of legislative affairs at the White House, acting as the main liaison between Capitol Hill and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama is "now hooked up to what will probably be the most powerful committee on the Hill for the next two years," said Brian McNicoll, an aide to outgoing Rep. Thomas M. Davis III, Virginia Republican, who has worked with and against Mr. Waxman on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over the past decade.LiNeBrEaK"The Obama administration has a direct link" to Mr. Waxman's committee, Mr. McNicoll said. "That is where they want to make their mark, on energy and environmental policy and stuff that goes through that committee."LiNeBrEaKMr. Schiliro also worked in 2004 for then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, South Dakota Democrat, on the Senate Democratic Leadership Committee.LiNeBrEaKJim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said that "health care and climate change are going to be two of the toughest, most complex issues that we will have to deal with in the next Congress."LiNeBrEaK"The fact that Phil knows the Hill so well is certainly going to help."LiNeBrEaKBoth Mr. Waxman and Mr. Schiliro declined to comment for this article, but their close working relationship was clear as far back as 1992, when Mr. Schiliro mounted an unsuccessful run for Congress, and Mr. Waxman wrote a fundraising letter saying the race meant "a great deal" to him.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama last week promised that his presidency "will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change," in a nod to environmentalists and liberals frustrated by what they regard as eight years of obstruction by President Bush.LiNeBrEaKCentral to Mr. Obama's goal of reducing emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050 is a cap-and-trade system on carbon-dioxide emissions. The likely trigger for the creation of a cap-and-trade system will be the granting of a waiver to California, allowing that state to impose stricter emissions requirements on automobiles, a bid the Bush administration has denied.LiNeBrEaKOnce Mr. Obama signs an executive order or Congress passes a bill giving California a green light, the Obama administration and Congress likely will take about 18 months to design a cap-and-trade system that will allow businesses that emit carbon dioxide to buy the right to do that from alternative or clean-energy producers, said Brad Johnson of the liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) Action Fund.LiNeBrEaKSuch a system will dramatically affect a wide swath of American industries and corporations, from utilities to banks.LiNeBrEaK"Utilities say how much a plant will cost, but they don't factor in the coal pricing, and when you do that, the finances of this totally changes," Mr. Johnson said.LiNeBrEaKMr. McNicoll said Mr. Schiliro's presence in the White House will give Mr. Waxman an "intimate" sense of what should go into climate-change legislation and what should not as the Obama administration weighs business interests and the political and economic ramifications of their actions.LiNeBrEaKMr. Schiliro also stands as something of a symbol for how Mr. Obama appears set on governing. His rise within Mr. Obama's world in the past several months was widely interpreted as a signal from the president-elect that tipped a power struggle over the Energy and Commerce chairmanship in Mr. Waxman's favor.LiNeBrEaKOne day after Mr. Obama's election, he named Mr. Schiliro to one of 13 positions on the transition senior staff.LiNeBrEaKIf the writing on the wall hadn't been clear enough over the summer, it was obvious at that point: Mr. Schiliro would run the White House Office of Legislative Affairs come January.LiNeBrEaKThe official announcement came Nov. 15, and five days later, Mr. Waxman toppled Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan from the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which the Michigan Democrat had held in every Democrat-controlled Congress since 1981.LiNeBrEaKMany saw Mr. Schiliro's elevation within the incoming Obama administration as a clear gesture that the president-elect wanted Mr. Waxman in and Mr. Dingell out.LiNeBrEaK"Waxman is ready and willing to work closely with the Obama administration from Day One," said Mr. Johnson, who wrote about the Waxman coup for one of CAP's blogs, the Wonk Room.LiNeBrEaK"If Obama orchestrated this, then he did it in a very effective way where it was not done in public and without any fingerprints," Mr. Johnson said.LiNeBrEaKOn the day when Mr. Waxman shoved Mr. Dingell aside, Mr. Obama was catching flak from some in the left-wing blogosphere for his involvement in helping Sen. Joe Lieberman, Connecticut independent, keep his chairmanship of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect had made a public gesture of bipartisanship and allowed a political opponent to retain a hold on power while surreptitiously approving the dethroning of a man who stood in the way of his policy goals.

The Arizona Daily Sun (Flagstaff)  	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Flagstaff, Ariz., officials cool to warming strategies  	Cyndy Cole, The Arizona Daily Sun, Flagstaff  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1011 words  	Nov. 24--If Flagstaff wants to get serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions citywide in line with a 2006 pledge, it should tax carbon and trash, said post-doctoral NAU researcher Matthew Hurteau.LiNeBrEaKHis support for this and other measures to combat climate change was echoed Thursday night by many in a crowd of about 50 seeking to weigh in on the city's plans.LiNeBrEaKBut amid a recession, questions about what's legally and politically feasible, and doubt by two council members about the severity of global warming, it appears the city is unlikely to implement costly or sweeping changes next year. LiNeBrEaKSix of the seven members of the Flagstaff City Council, including the mayor, responded to a series of questions about a range of measures proposed to slow global warming, in line with the City Council's 2006 pledge to cut emissions to pre-1990 levels by 2012.LiNeBrEaKWith no changes, greenhouse gas emissions produced from residents, tourists and businesses across the city are forecast to increase by 52 percent from 1990 to 2020. Most climate scientists believe these emissions are a key component in global warming.LiNeBrEaKAll six of those council members responding said they would give builders tax incentives to construct more energy-efficient buildings, as long as it wasn't a requirement.LiNeBrEaKBeyond that, the council is split on other recommendations made by a consultant that range from putting more hybrid cars on the streets to requiring businesses and residents to purchase renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThere are no estimates of what these plans would cost.LiNeBrEaKCouncilwoman Coral Evans did not respond to phone calls seeking an interview.LiNeBrEaK-- Two councilmen, Joe Haughey and Scott Overton, voted against the proposal to limit greenhouse gases at the city level in 2006 and say it is not the city's top priority or role to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaK-- A bare majority of four on the council -- Al White, Mayor Sara Presler, Karla Brewster and Rick Swanson -- would require builders to construct more energy-efficient homes and commercial buildings.LiNeBrEaKProposals that paid for themselves and ultimately saved homeowners or renters money should take top priority, White said.LiNeBrEaKOverton opposed this and some of the other proposals, saying, "I don't believe it's the municipal role to dictate how people live their lifestyles."LiNeBrEaK-- Proposals to require homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of homes during sale or remodel were unpopular with the council.LiNeBrEaK"I would love to be able to require them, but at this point I don't think we can. Particularly with the economic downturn," Brewster said.LiNeBrEaK-- Also unpopular was any idea of requiring vehicles in Flagstaff become more fuel-efficient, with several council members saying such a move would also likely be illegal.LiNeBrEaK"We can do our best as a municipal government to increase our fuel efficiency, but I don't think we can mandate it to automobile owners," Swanson said.LiNeBrEaK-- Only two of the six, White and Brewster, said they might support requiring residents and businesses to purchase renewable energy.LiNeBrEaK-- Except for Brewster, who would support a carbon tax on gasoline or electricity sometime in the future, the other council members say they would oppose one or were undecided.LiNeBrEaKIt would not make sense for the city to take such actions independent of state and federal policies addressing climate change, Presler said.LiNeBrEaK"When one community tries to solve everyone's problems, it may not be as successful as when everyone tries to solve everyone's problems together," she said.LiNeBrEaKAlong the way, all were asked whether they thought global warming was a problem.LiNeBrEaKSwanson, Presler, White and Brewster said yes.LiNeBrEaKHaughey, who makes air quotes with his hands when speaking of the "global warming-climate change thing," said global warming "could be, maybe not" a problem, and that the science is not entirely conclusive.LiNeBrEaKOverton's response was parallel.LiNeBrEaK"It is not definitively known," he said. "It's still being questioned."LiNeBrEaKSo far, 901 cities have signed onto a pledge to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, though many might not make it.LiNeBrEaK-- Billings, Mont., is looking at more energy efficiency, and at capturing methane gas from its landfill. The community doesn't have measurements that will indicate whether the community is meeting its goals, said city administrator Christina Volek.LiNeBrEaK-- Aspen, Colo., plans to become carbon neutral in its city-owned electricity and water utility by 2012, which will cost $4 million extra, said Phil Overeynder, who manages utilities.LiNeBrEaKWind, solar and geothermal will all play a part.LiNeBrEaKBeyond that, the city has set different goals than Flagstaff, hoping to cut greenhouse gases 30 percent below 2004 levels by 2020. It has the largest rural bus system in the country.LiNeBrEaKAspen has a tiered electricity billing system. Those that use more pay more, per unit, just as Flagstaff water customers pay much more for using more water than the average household.LiNeBrEaK-- Moab, Utah, fluctuates between 8,000 and 20,000 in population, given tourism, which has major carbon impacts, just like for Flagstaff.LiNeBrEaKThere, City Hall has set a goal of making city buildings more energy-efficient, though no study has been done on the community's carbon footprint due to the cost, said Mayor Dave Sakrison.LiNeBrEaKResidents have voluntarily signed up to buy renewable energy at higher rates.LiNeBrEaK"To tell you that we've dropped our emissions by 25 percent, I can't tell you that. But I can tell you that, through our actions, we've definitely done something," Sakrison said. "Fifteen percent of the population's buying green power for gosh sakes. That's significant."LiNeBrEaKFor more information, or to give the city your opinion, see www.flagstaff.az.gov/climate.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Thailand's service industry needs to become more green, experts say  	Nareerat Wiriyapong, Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	554 words  	Nov. 24--The global recession and the sharp drop in oil prices should not hold back the green revolution, experts say, noting Thai hotels and resorts are facing challenges to respond to the demands of environmentally conscious tourists. LiNeBrEaKAccording to McKinnon and Clarke, a UK-based energy consultancy, the hospitality sector across Asia is paying more attention to environmental concerns.LiNeBrEaK"Customers are increasingly discerning about what they buy. It is not surprising to see environmentally conscious tourists choose their hotels based on green credentials," said Chris Davenport, corporate manager for McKinnon's energy and environmental service.LiNeBrEaK"Hoteliers that can point to actions to improve their energy efficiency will be in a stronger position in terms of competitiveness as a result of lower overheads, but also be able to actively market their goods and services to win more business."LiNeBrEaKIn Thailand, companies active in energy conservation are mostly in manufacturing rather than hospitality, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe Thailand Environmental Institute started the eco-label campaign for companies able to reduce emissions by at least 25 percent compared to a 2002 baseline. "All 10 operators vying for the eco-label are in manufacturing. This is a challenge for the Thai service sector," said Davenport.LiNeBrEaKHe also does not believe oil prices will as low as they are now, and in any case oil price levels should not affect energy reduction commitments.LiNeBrEaKPrasertsuk Chamornmarn, deputy executive director of the Thai Greenhouse Gas Management Organisation (TGO), agreed that the service sector was not active in emission reduction plans for selling certified emission reduction credits (CERs), commonly known as carbon credits.LiNeBrEaKThe TGO has approved 46 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects to reduce 3. 2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. This could generate total revenue of 2. 4 billion baht in the global carbon-trading market. Of the total, 10 have been endorsed by the United Nations and three more are in the process, said Prasertsuk.LiNeBrEaKCDM is a concept that allows developing countries such as Thailand to sell carbon credits to industrialised nations that have emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto accord.LiNeBrEaK"None of these projects are from the service sector. We are going to educate and encourage them to be more active in the carbon trading business," she said.LiNeBrEaKSteve Buckly, director of UK Trade and Investment at the British Embassy, said soaring emissions in the developing world strengthened the UK's commitment to reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The UK and Thailand must -- as part of an international effort -- lead the way in moving to a low-carbon economy and take action to secure clean and reliable energy supplies," he said.LiNeBrEaKLow-carbon incentives are clear, he said, adding that the International Energy Agency estimates that responding to climate change would cost around 300 billion over the next 10 years.

The Boston Globe 	November 24, 2008 Monday   THIRD EDITION	Obama urged to create `Green New Deal'  	Beth Daley GLOBE STAFF  	HEALTHSCIENCE; Pg. A15  	911 words  	The worldwide economic crisis is prompting a growing number of countries to back away from pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy, just a week before the start of talks in Poland on a new worldwide climate change treaty. LiNeBrEaKIn the United States, some business groups are calling on President-elect Barack Obama to move cautiously in tackling global warming, saying that a too aggressive response could prolong the economic downturn and cost jobs. LiNeBrEaKBut a growing chorus of other businesses, environmentalists, and politicians are calling for a green-based economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKAn enormous federal government investment in clean technology would provide low-cost capital to accelerate energy efficiency, build massive renewable energy projects, and jumpstart a sustainable low-carbon economy, these groups say. Such a Green New Deal, woven into the economic stimulus package being crafted for early next year, could create millions of government-subsidized jobs and build a new energy infrastructure.LiNeBrEaK"It's a smart thing to do for the economy and a strategically wonderful thing to do for the environment," said David Foster, executive director of the Blue Green Alliance, a partnership between the Sierra Club and United Steelworkers that works to develop green jobs. His group points to a University of Massachusetts report earlier this fall that said a $100 billion investment in clean technology could create 2 million new jobs in the next two years.LiNeBrEaK"It leads us down the path for energy independence," he said. "It's a historic opportunity."LiNeBrEaKOn Saturday, Obama gave his strongest comments yet about making the environment a cornerstone of his economic stimulus plan. He outlined a package to create 2. 5 million jobs, that included "building wind farms and solar panels, fuel-efficient cars and alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil..."LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama pledged to cap carbon dioxide emissions and reduce them 80 percent by 2050 and to have 25 percent of US energy come from renewable sources by 2025. He wants to invest $150 billion in clean energy in the next decade. In addition, he has said he will raise vehicle fuel economy standards and aggressively pursue energy efficiency and conservation.LiNeBrEaKSupporters, including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council, say such a plan could include federal financial incentives to quickly build large-scale solar, wind, and other renewable projects. It could also include massive investment in new transmission lines to bring renewable power from rural areas into cities, creating a new electricity grid.LiNeBrEaKAnd they say a cap on carbon dioxide emissions would force power plants and other industries to pay to pollute - which would lower emissions and bring in needed revenue during the economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKThey point to several studies that suggest that investment in efficient and renewable energy could create a lot more jobs than the same size investment in the already established oil and gas industry.LiNeBrEaKYet even the most ardent environmentalists acknowledge it won't be easy to do now. Any meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide from power plants are likely to raise electricity prices, says Robert N. Stavins, who directs the Harvard Project on International Climate Agreements. Even if the costs are marginal, the public and political leaders are unlikely to buy into such a plan during an economic crisis because it will be viewed as hurting industry at a vulnerable time, he says.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, he says, the economic crisis could "distract attention" from the environment, and "for that reason alone it would not be surprising if there is less rapid and less intense [response] to global climate change than the predictions being made six months ago."LiNeBrEaKSome business leaders say that while renewable energy is a laudable goal, no technology exists that could replace the reliability of fossil fuels. If too much federal money is given to subsidize alternative energy or force a stringent cap on heat-trapping emissions, they say the ensuing energy price spike would severely undercut an economic recovery.LiNeBrEaK"We can't afford that kind of cost today," said William Kovacs, vice president for the Environment, Technology and Regulatory Affairs Division at the US Chamber of Commerce. "We need to drill [for oil and gas] immediately on the outer continental shelf and then take those [royalties] and invest them in alternative technologies."LiNeBrEaKPublic commitment to energy matters has been shown to respond to economic factors. When oil prices topped $130 a barrel, and gas prices soared, Americans drove less for the first time in nearly two decades. But fuel prices are now dropping as demand falls, and people are already driving more often.LiNeBrEaKThe oil price decline and the economic crisis could also cause venture capital investment in renewable power and green technology to falter.LiNeBrEaK"Yet in many ways, this is an ideal time" for government investment, said Robert Kaufmann, director of the center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University. He says the economic crisis will translate into a slowdown of carbon dioxide emissions from factories and power plants. If an emissions cap is imposed now, "there is more wiggle room under it" for industry, he said. This means businesses would probably pay little to pollute in the short-term, until a recovery takes hold.

Buffalo News (New York) 	November 24, 2008 Monday   CENTRAL EDITION	Wishes for a better future;  Nichols senior selling mystical bracelets to help save rain forests 	By Gene Warner - NEWS STAFF REPORTER  	LOCAL; Pg. B1  	571 words  	A 17-year-old North Buffalo youth is doing his part to preserve the Brazilian rain forests and sharpen his own entrepreneurial skills -- all with the help of a centuries-old mystical tradition known for granting individuals three wishes.LiNeBrEaKWill Gisel, a senior at Nichols School, along with an older cousin from Denver, have started a business selling Brazilets -- short for Brazilian bracelets. LiNeBrEaKThe Brazilets, from the mystical city of Bahia, Brazil, are approximately 18 inches long, available in 13 colors and made of a thin, ribbon-like material.LiNeBrEaKThe bracelets are considered to be a fashion accessory with an added spiritual significance. Anyone who buys or is given a Brazilet is supposed to wrap it around the wrist and tie it with three knots for three wishes.LiNeBrEaKLegend has it that when the material dissolves naturally and falls off, the three wishes will be granted.LiNeBrEaK"Kids think it's cool how they dissolve," Will said. "And if they're on the fence [about making a purchase], the charity is the extra push that gets them to buy them."LiNeBrEaKHow long does each bracelet last? It depends on the person wearing it, but Will still has a tattered one from June 2007 on his wrist.LiNeBrEaKBrazilets have several selling points: the concept of the three wishes, the fashionable look, the bracelet trend popularized by Lance Armstrong's LiveStrong Foundation -- and the larger environmental cause.LiNeBrEaKWill and his 26-year-old cousin Kael Robinson have pledged to donate a portion of their proceeds to Plant a Billion Trees, a Nature Conservancy project committed to planting a billion trees in the Brazilian rain forest.LiNeBrEaK"This affects everyone," Will said. "I don't see how you can't see the effects of global warming. . . . I didn't really think much about the environment before. This causes me to think about it. It's one of the biggest problems that we have."LiNeBrEaKWill isn't kidding about donating a "portion" of the proceeds. He's sold slightly more than $1,000 worth of Brazilets, and he's donated 100 percent of his take to the conservancy project.LiNeBrEaKThe Brazilets have been selling for $4 at Firebrand, an Elmwood Avenue store, and through the company's Web site, www.brazilets.com.LiNeBrEaKWill and his cousin hatched the idea for the business at a family wedding during the summer of 2007, after the cousin, a fashion entrepreneur, had bought some bracelets in Brazil and sold them to her friends. The cousins immediately realized the bracelets' selling points.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he's just 17, Will, a budding businessman, sees a lot of growth potential in Brazilets.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Chicago Tribune Greg Burns column: SUV sales stir as gas prices sink  	Greg Burns, Chicago Tribune  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	590 words  	Nov. 24--All those folks who unloaded their sport-utility vehicles when gasoline shot past $4 a gallon this summer might be developing a case of seller's remorse.LiNeBrEaKAmericans love their wheels. The bigger the better, if the past is any guide. The ideals of personal freedom and mobility embodied in the automobile haven't changed in the least.LiNeBrEaKSo, no surprise, with gas prices down around $2 again, the much-maligned SUV is making something of a comeback. LiNeBrEaKCar sales on the whole remain a bust, and this comeback barely lives up to the name, considering the bleak conditions overall. Yet the General Motors assembly plant making Yukons, Tahoes and Escalades has put its workers on overtime. And dealers from Texas to Montana report that the big vehicles clogging up their lots for months like so much radioactive waste have started moving again, albeit at slashed prices.LiNeBrEaKEnterprise Rent-a-Car has 1. 1 million cars in its fleet, and when gas stood at $4, it could barely rent a minivan, pickup or SUV.LiNeBrEaKThat's not the case at $2, reports spokesman Pat Farrell: "Now that it's come back down, people are more than willing to upgrade to bigger cars."LiNeBrEaKSUVs remain, as ever, politically incorrect. When GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner made his bailout pitch to a skeptical U.S. Senate last week, his prepared remarks included not a word about the SUVs, light trucks or minivans that until recently were his company's mainstays.LiNeBrEaKHe did, however, inform the assembled lawmakers that as of next year the biggest domestic automaker would be offering its U.S. customers nine hybrids and 20 models that get at least 30 miles per gallon on the highway.LiNeBrEaK"And we're running all-out to get the Chevy Volt extended-range electric vehicle to market as soon as possible," Wagoner pledged.LiNeBrEaKThat's right: The Volt. A Chevy. Plugs in. The excitement is electric.LiNeBrEaKBut what if in their hearts, the typical American driver wants an oversize, gas-guzzling "Yank Tank," as the British call them?LiNeBrEaKVolt or no Volt, SUVs face an uphill slog on the road back to best seller.LiNeBrEaKFor starters, there's the small matter of the recession. Hard times are making big cars less affordable than ever for millions of Americans. Plus, consumer tastes are changing amid growing recognition of the environmental threat posed by greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe Enterprise fleet includes only 5,000 hybrids and 70,000 flex-fuels, well short of consumer demand, no matter what the price of gas.LiNeBrEaK"For us to be sustainable, we have to deal with a product that is acceptable to society," Farrell said. "What you see changing is the type of vehicle we put out there."LiNeBrEaKAnother potential factor: the growth of car-sharing services. It could be a big car or a small car, but the point is that more people are willing to share rather than own.LiNeBrEaKAt Zipcar, the leading player, CEO Scott Griffith figures that each of his vehicles replaces 15 or 20 private cars. "The whole category is moving mainstream," he said. "Within the next five or 10 years, millions of people will use this service. The model of one driver, one car, is broken."LiNeBrEaKIf so, that's a lot of cars that won't be sold, from SUVs on down.LiNeBrEaKgburns@tribune.com	MOTOR VEHICLES (92%); SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (91%); GASOLINE PRICES (90%); PRICE CHANGES (90%); AUTOMOTIVE SALES (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (78%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (78%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (78%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (76%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); LEGISLATORS (74%); PRICE CUTTING (71%); RECESSION (71%); ECONOMIC NEWS (71%); BAILOUTS (70%); CARPOOL and CARSHARE SERVICES (67%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (65%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (50%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (57%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (72%)  		GMP (PAR) (72%); GMB (BRU) (72%); GM (NYSE) (57%) NYSE:GM  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (72%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (72%) General  	RICK WAGONER (67%); MICHAEL MCMAHON (53%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%) ILLINOIS, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081124-TB-Chicago-Tribune-Greg-Burns-column-1124  	TB  													
The Denver Post 	November 24, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	EDITORIAL Breathe easier over mercury As of Jan. 1, Colorado's power plants must measure how much of the toxic metal is spewed over the state every year.  		Pg. A-21  	513 words  	After the confetti falls on New Year's Eve, Coloradans can rejoice to know that significant steps to stop mercury from falling over our fair state are underway.LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 1, 11 power plants will start measuring the amount of mercury spewing from smoke stacks as part of a rule change that will cut 80 percent of the dangerous neurotoxin by 2014 and 90 percent by 2018. LiNeBrEaKWe toast Colorado's Air Quality Control Commission for its leadership, and bid a good riddance to the Bush administration's so-called Environmental Protection Agency, which tried to exempt power plants from limits set by states.LiNeBrEaKAs Post reporter Mark Jaffe reported last week, the EPA in 2005 tried to establish an idiotic cap-and-trade program for mercury, which is a heavy metal that falls to earth in the vicinity of the smoke stack that emitted it, poisoning soils and streams, birds and fishes. The toxin can cause birth defects, central nervous system disorders, and heart problems. Some of the neurological abnormalities in babies and young children that mercury has been proven to cause include cerebral palsy and delays and deficits in learning ability.LiNeBrEaKCap-and-trade rules can make sense with greenhouse gases, because they mix in the atmosphere. But the EPA's cap-and-trade rule for mercury makes so little sense that a federal appeals court shot it down earlier this year.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the EPA says that power plants in the United States account for one-third of the mercury that contaminates our environment each year.LiNeBrEaKAnd before its 2005 cap-and-trade rule change, the EPA found that one in six women of child-bearing age contained levels of mercury in their blood that were dangerous to children.LiNeBrEaKKnowing all this, the EPA further embarrassed itself by appealing the ruling, but while the Supreme Court considers whether to hear the matter, Colorado is moving forward.LiNeBrEaKIn doing so, Colorado is one of a few states to act decisively on setting mercury limits.LiNeBrEaK"Colorado moving ahead like this is a model for what other states should be doing," said James Pew, a lawyer with Earthjustice.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, Air Quality Control officials worked with industry executives and environmentalists in crafting the rules, and won enough buy-in from the diverse groups that so far no one is calling foul.LiNeBrEaKOnce accurate measures of mercury emissions are determined, the state's two largest plants - Xcel Energy's Pawnee plant and the Platte River Power Authority's Rawhide plant - agreed to cut mercury emissions 80 percent by 2012. The remaining plants will do so by 2014.LiNeBrEaKBy 2018, the plants are to cut mercury emissions by 90 percent.LiNeBrEaKThat's significant, considering that state officials estimate power plants spray as much as 1,000 pounds of the toxic metal over Colorado each year.LiNeBrEaKWe hope President-elect Barack Obama is paying attention to the EPA's sad shirking of its responsibilities and that he charges new appointees with returning to rules like those of the Clinton administration.LiNeBrEaKAnalysis suggests that the rules supported by Clinton's EPA could have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by 90 percent this year.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Gas prices drop, but will habits?;  The conservation-minded have cut miles and boarded buses to save when gas was at its highest. 	LARRY HANNAN  	Pg. B-1  	716 words  	When Betsy Yonn was between cars last year, she decided to ride the bus until she got her new vehicle.LiNeBrEaKAfter all, there is a bus stop right in front of her condo on San Juan Avenue, and the bus lets her out two blocks from her job on Riverside Avenue.LiNeBrEaK"It gave me time to read the paper in the morning and relax, read or study in the afternoons on the way home," Yonn said. LiNeBrEaKShe found herself putting off the search for a vehicle and, eventually, she stopped looking. Many of her friends and co-workers were mystified. But she didn't see the point of getting a car when she could get everywhere on the bus, and save money at the same time.LiNeBrEaKYonn is among the many who changed the way they live -- driving differently, using public transportation more -- in response to gas prices that topped $4 a gallon in the past year. But with gas prices back under $2 a gallon, will people go back to their old habits?LiNeBrEaKMonique Borboen, Northeast Florida policy coordinator for the Audubon Society of Florida, said it's impossible to predict what will happen. The lure of driving can be strong, and people went back to consuming lots of gas when fuel prices were high in the late 1970s. But she believes this time might be different because people have changed their attitudes toward conservation.LiNeBrEaKThe general public is more aware of climate change and air pollution than they were in the 1970s. Many of the people who started driving less to save money might keep doing it because they want to improve the environment, Borboen said.LiNeBrEaKPETROLEUM AND PATIENCELiNeBrEaKAAA Auto Club South spokesman Gregg Laskoski said Americans will remain diligent about fuel conservation because they see it has a positive effect.LiNeBrEaKIt also is unlikely that the price of gas will remain under $2 a gallon for an extended period of time. Gas prices are likely to go up again next summer when consumer demand starts to increase.LiNeBrEaKAnd if the U.S. dollar drops, that also could lead to an increase in gas prices, Laskoski said.LiNeBrEaKPat Moricca, president of the Gasoline Retailers Association of America, said he believes consumers have finally gotten fed up with the oil companies. The companies thought they could offer any price and consumers would pay it. But $4-a-gallon gas ended that.LiNeBrEaKMoricca said people have become serious about not taking their car to the grocery store when all they need is a pack of cigarettes. Americans still buy a lot of gas, but they are finally showing they are only willing to put up with so much.LiNeBrEaKBULLISH ON BUSESLiNeBrEaKThe Jacksonville Transportation Authority shares the experts' optimism and believes the authority has given riders other reasons to stay on board.LiNeBrEaKIn October, JTA exceeded 1 million riders for the first time in 10 years. It was a 14 percent increase in ridership from October 2007. Aside from the high price of gas, officials attribute the increase to better customer service and the popularity of buses made up to look like trolleys that take people from The Jacksonville Landing downtown to the Five Points area.LiNeBrEaKJTA Executive Director Michael Blaylock said the high ridership proves that all the effort they put into a recent system redesign is paying off. That redesign included community meetings and surveys that asked Jacksonville residents how the bus system could be improved.LiNeBrEaK"Now that gas prices have begun to decrease, we hope new riders who chose transit when gas was $4 a gallon will continue to choose JTA to save money and help contribute to a cleaner environment," Blaylock said.LiNeBrEaKDRIVING DIFFERENTLYLiNeBrEaKGeraldine Kohn, who lives in Mandarin, got a job in Daytona Beach in September and has had to commute for the past few months.LiNeBrEaKAt first Kohn would drive between 70 mph and 75 mph while commuting. But when she slowed down to between 63 mph and 65 mph, she was able to save gas, she said. She plans to continue driving under the speed limit even with the lower cost of gas.LiNeBrEaK"It is like trying to make a piece of meat or a meal last longer for the money," Kohn said.LiNeBrEaKThough Kohn plans to stay on the same course, she doubts others will.LiNeBrEaKWhen gas was expensive, she saw other people driving slowly. But now almost everyone drives over 75 mph, she said.LiNeBrEaKlarry.hannan@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4470LiNeBrEaKHABIT-FORMINGLiNeBrEaKHere are ways people are reacting to recent high gas prices:LiNeBrEaK-- Drive lessLiNeBrEaK-- Slow downLiNeBrEaK-- Take the bus	OIL and GAS PRICES (92%); PRICE CHANGES (90%); MOTORCOACHES and BUSES (89%); GASOLINE PRICES (88%); PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (73%); PRICE INCREASES (73%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (73%); CLIMATE CHANGE (73%); GASOLINE (73%); GAS STATIONS (73%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (71%); US DOLLAR (69%); RETAILERS (66%); AIR POLLUTION (64%); GROCERY STORES and SUPERMARKETS (64%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (66%)  	AAA AUTO CLUB SOUTH (65%)  	NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY (55%)  				JACKSONVILLE, FL, USA (79%) FLORIDA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 25, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Florida Times-Union   																
Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	November 24, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: 'Change' coming to Washington  		B; Pg. 12B  	770 words  	Indications multiply that those who hoped Barack Obama and the resurgent Democratic Party would calm down and govern "to the center" are about to face a rude awakening.LiNeBrEaKOn the campaign trail, candidate Obama - whose legislative record showed him to be an ardent backer of gun control - toned down his hoplophobia, vowing in soothing tones that he would "not take away" Americans' firearms. Yet his just-announced choice for attorney general, Eric Holder, earlier this year signed an amicus brief in the court case District of Columbia vs. Heller, supporting the District's ban on the use of any firearm for self-defense in the home - as Barack Obama himself supported that patently unconstitutional measure.LiNeBrEaKAs deputy attorney general, the gun-rights stances of Mr. Holder made Janet Reno look like Annie Oakley. LiNeBrEaKThe man now tapped to become our next attorney general advocated federal licensing of American handgun owners, a three-day waiting period on handgun sales, and rationing handgun sales to no more than one per month - for starters.LiNeBrEaKNot to be outdone in this race to the radical left, congressional Democrats responded in kind Thursday, dumping Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and replacing him with Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Beverly Hills and West Hollywood.LiNeBrEaKThe secret ballot among members of the Democratic caucus - the kind of ballot congressional Democrats hope to soon take away from American workers threatened with unionization - swung 137-122 to depart from the chamber's usual seniority system.LiNeBrEaKRep. Dingell, 82, is hardly a free-market zealot. Nonetheless, he represents greater Detroit and is seen as a champion of the auto business. Skeptical of massive steps to cripple the economy in pursuit of the chimera of "global warming," he has slowed or blocked action on stricter vehicle emissions standards, fuel-economy improvements and other initiatives to accelerate the "green" destruction of the domestic auto industry.LiNeBrEaKRep. Waxman, on the other hand, represents not constituents who manufacture a product made of steel, but rather a town that manufactures dreams.LiNeBrEaKAnd it shows.LiNeBrEaK"Whether you agree with him or not, Chairman Dingell has long been respected as an insightful, reasonable and pragmatic legislator," said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a pro-business research group. "These are not qualities for which Mr. Waxman is known."LiNeBrEaKMr. Pyle said that Rep. Waxman probably would bring "sweeping changes" to the committee's focus, "which isn't good news if you're in the business of American energy or other kinds of free-market commerce."LiNeBrEaKBy contrast, environmentalists hailed Rep. Waxman's promotion.LiNeBrEaK"It's a whole new day for the environment," cheers Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, an environmental advocacy group. "The committee through which all major environmental legislation has to pass has gone from someone hostile to environmental protection to a real champion."LiNeBrEaKRep. Waxman's selection "will put him at the center of efforts to advance President-elect Barack Obama's proposals to curb global warming, develop alternative fuels and expand health insurance coverage," his hometown Los Angeles Times enthused on Friday.LiNeBrEaKRep. Waxman will not maintain a low profile - he never has. Even when his bailiwick was limited to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, he did not hesitate to bask in the camera lights as he hauled everyone from hedge-fund managers to steroid-using baseball players to former spy Valerie Plame through his committee room to testify at high-profile hearings.LiNeBrEaK"Waxman's election suggests that Congress will tackle climate-change legislation next year," the L.A. Times noted. "Waxman, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate committee on the environment, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have called for tough new limits on emissions from power plants, factories and other pollution sources."LiNeBrEaKBy "pollution," of course, the Times refers primarily to the non-toxic gas carbon dioxide - the stuff Rep. Waxman and his constituents produce when they exhale.LiNeBrEaKBecause the new state religion of Environmentalism says we must stop burning coal, oil, and natural gas - never mind the effect on our economy - lest we all end up frying like bacon on a griddle.LiNeBrEaKThink those edicts in which our regal rulers wave their magic wands and declare what percentage of our power "must" be generated by windmills and solar panels were already a bit presumptuous?LiNeBrEaKThink your energy bills were already a tad high?LiNeBrEaKHold on, folks.

The Meadville Tribune (Pennsylvania)  	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Project illustrates need to reduce emissions  	Penni Schaefer, The Meadville Tribune, Pa.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	674 words  	Nov. 24--Hang onto your tighty-whities! Or better yet, put them on a drying rack and save the planet. That's the message that one group of Allegheny College environmental science students is broadcasting on their mission to raise awareness about carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK"At first, we thought about hanging 350 bed sheets on clotheslines to express the '350 Project,'" said Lauren Quintrell. "But we soon figured out that we wouldn't be able to collect 350 sheets." LiNeBrEaKSo Quintrell, along with Julianne (Jules) D'Amico, Marieke Perchik, Fiona Hensley and Liz Benvin, put their heads together to think of another way to represent the number 350 parts per million, which is the level of carbon dioxide that the earth's atmosphere can support before it can no longer function properly and irreparable damage occurs.LiNeBrEaKThat's when Quintrell modified the plan to a smaller -- and in some cases, a much, much smaller -- scale.LiNeBrEaK"We thought 'why not underwear?' " Quintrell said, as she pinned a pair next to some socks on a rope strewn between two trees in front of the Campus Center.LiNeBrEaKSo the group of students began to solicit for underwear and whatever unmentionables they could find to make their statement.LiNeBrEaK"Making it to 350 was a bit more challenging than we thought it would be," she said. "We found out that people aren't keen on letting you borrow their underwear."LiNeBrEaKSo the group of young women began to search the unclaimed piles of clothes at various laundry facilities and lost-and-LiNeBrEaKfounds around campus. When they still didn't have enough, they continued to explore options. There were a couple of ideas that they ruled out, such as hitting up members of the administration, faculty and staff.LiNeBrEaK"We didn't ask them because that would reach a whole new level of awkward," she said.LiNeBrEaKSo, meeting their goal meant they would have to dig deep. Deep into their own drawers, that is (no pun intended.)LiNeBrEaKOne of the main points behind the rows of mismatched socks, underwear and even the occasional bra, is that even a simple act such as line-drying clothing can make a significant contribution towards helping the environment.LiNeBrEaK"Dryers take enormous amounts of energy and release a tremendous amount of carbon emissions," D'Amico said. "Hanging clothes on a clothesline is a very simple way people can change their lifestyles for the better."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to hanging up the undergarments, the students wrote facts about climate change on waxed paper.LiNeBrEaK"Right now we are definitely above the 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide that the Earth's atmosphere can safely handle," Quintrell said. "It changes every day, but currently we are around 400. The good news is that it's not irreversible; we can cut that figure down by asking citizens and every day people to change their actions."LiNeBrEaKQuintrell acknowledged that some nay-sayers attribute climate change to Earth's natural heating and cooling cycles.LiNeBrEaK"The planet goes through cycles, but our actions are speeding that up exponentially. Evolution and adaptation are slow and the Earth can't naturally account for the temperature rise," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe display across the lawn has succeeded in its goal, with more than a few people questioning why there are so many peoples' duds hanging out for public viewing.LiNeBrEaK"Some kids were just really shocked at first, but then they got it," she said. "It's impossible to ask people to cut 2,000 miles of driving off of their annual mileage, but it's not much to ask them to use a drying rack in their room!"LiNeBrEaKThe 350 Project will remain on the Allegheny College campus through Tuesday.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	November 24, 2008 Monday 	California bulks up defenses against tide of global warming  	Chris Bowman, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	738 words  	Nov. 24--California is building a second line of defense against global warming, one that will prepare the state for a harsher environment while the other continues to cut climate-changing emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe two-front approach acknowledges that rising sea levels, bigger floods, greater loss of species and other harsh effects of warming are inevitable, if not already occurring -- no matter the state's success in slashing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the pioneering save-the-planet mandates to tighten automobile exhaust limits and renewable energy standards, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is not loudly trumpeting these defense moves: LiNeBrEaK-- The state Transportation Department is proposing to move a 3-mile stretch of ocean-hugging Highway 1 in Big Sur up to 475 feet inland, to keep ahead of the accelerating tidal rise and bluff erosion.LiNeBrEaK-- State wildlife officials are deliberating plans for "triage," to decide which species should be saved from global warming and which can't be saved.LiNeBrEaK-- The state's San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission is consulting with Dutch engineers and holding an international contest to create designs for flood- resilient buildings.LiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 14, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order to identify the state's biggest vulnerabilities to rising sea levels and draft an "adaptation strategy." State, federal and local managers of transportation, public health, wildlife, water and power supplies are being tapped for this task, along with business and public-interest groups.LiNeBrEaK"It's saying we need to take action today," Anthony Brunello, the state deputy secretary for climate change, said of the governor's directive. "We need to figure out what we should be doing."LiNeBrEaKTo that end, the National Academy of Sciences will be asked to convene an independent panel of experts. The executive order calls on scientists to forecast a range of likely scenarios along the coast through the end of the century. That panel would recommend ways to minimize damage to coastal roads, beaches, sewage and water treatment plants, wetlands and marine life.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, all state agencies are to immediately identify risks and account for them in planning their public works projects.LiNeBrEaKClimate change alters projectsLiNeBrEaKSome major projects under way already account for climate change.LiNeBrEaKA 50-year, $1 billion effort to restore thousands of acres of former Cargill Inc. salt evaporation ponds to tidal marsh in San Francisco Bay will have levees to prevent flooding from rising seas anticipated with global warming.LiNeBrEaK"You will always have a viable and healthy estuary even as the waters rise," said Will Travis, executive director of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, state water planners are adding an extra foot of water depth in designs for a weir to control flows important to fish and drinking water quality in the south Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, this will extend the life of the project," said John Andrews, executive manager for climate change at the state Department of Water Resources.LiNeBrEaKExtending the survival of certain plant and animal species threatened by rising temperatures will present scientific and ethical challenges, said Terry Root, a Stanford University biologist.LiNeBrEaKRoot and other scientists are urging state and federal wildlife managers to categorize species according to their ability to withstand warming or migrate to more hospitable terrain. In some cases, she said, it may become necessary to move some species to save them.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't think I would ever have to say this in my life, but I do think we have to start prioritizing species," Root said in a September speech at the state's annual Climate Change Research Conference in Sacramento.LiNeBrEaKRoot reluctantly calls such categorizing "triage."LiNeBrEaK"Do we save this species or do we let this species go?" she said. "It is not an easy thing to be working on. It's going to be exceedingly painful."LiNeBrEaKChange of direction; big costLiNeBrEaKSome of the needed changes will be expensive.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Chris Bowman, (916) 321-1069.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 24, 2008 Monday 	UDOT crisis a blessing  	Public Forum Letter  	PUBLIC FORUM; Opinion  	200 words  	On Thursday, Lisa Roskelley, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jon Huntsman, advised Utahns to drive their cars more to make up for recent losses in gas tax revenues and rescue the ailing construction budget of the Utah Department of Transportation ("More cuts in store for state agencies," Tribune, Nov. 20). On the same day, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality announced a new program to alert Wasatch Front elementary schools when air pollution levels are too high for children to have recess outdoors ("Giving young lungs a break," Nov. 20). Meanwhile, the next day's paper tells of a visionary set of energy and climate change policy proposals that Gov. Huntsman is delivering to President-elect Barack Obama's transition team ("Guv carries climate message to White House," Nov. 21). LiNeBrEaKUDOT pursues a mission of accommodating additional driving, while state environmental officials and the governor are looking to reduce driving to clean up the air and reduce the threat of catastrophic climate change.LiNeBrEaKWe should welcome the reduction in gas tax revenues and the UDOT construction budget as a movement toward an environmentally sustainable future, not as a budget crises.LiNeBrEaKKeith BartholomewLiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); FUEL TAX (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); GOVERNORS (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (76%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (72%); AIR POLLUTION (71%)  					BARACK OBAMA (56%); JON HUNTSMAN (56%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	November 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  																
The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Hot team, hot topic  	Tribune Editorial  	OPINION; Editorials  	396 words  	Gov. Jon Huntsman and other Western governors who want quick action to reduce potentially catastrophic global warming apparently have found an ally in President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKObama, under the gun to ease the economic meltdown that is threatening the U.S. economy as soon as he takes office, says he does not plan to delay his promised attack on carbon emissions. He and his energy advisers say the two issues should be addressed at the same time since they are intertwined. LiNeBrEaKHis approach dovetails nicely with the forward-thinking ideas the governors have wisely embraced. Not surprisingly, the conservative Utah Legislature is less than wholeheartedly behind Huntsman on this issue. But the governor and Obama realize the country has no time to waste before acting to clean up the air, to preserve precious water supplies and to end a dead-end reliance on fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKHuntsman, a Republican just elected to his second term with record voter support, and Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, let the president-to-be know precisely where the Western Governors Association stands on energy. In a letter they hand-delivered to Washington last week, 14 of the 19 association members support priorities for addressing global warming, including reducing greenhouse-gas emissions using a market approach, rewarding better energy efficiency, importing less oil, encouraging energy research and helping consumers.LiNeBrEaKThe governors and Obama agree that implementing new technologies for alternative energy and making existing power plants more environment-friendly can create jobs.LiNeBrEaKHuntsman and his colleagues warn that procrastinating on meeting the climate-change threat would be dangerous. The Earth's temperatures are rising more rapidly than predicted and are linked to severe weather, increasing wildfires, reduced snowpack and longer, hotter summers in the West.LiNeBrEaKObama agrees. He is likely to push for a stimulus package for the ailing economy that would include investments in energy alternatives and advanced "green" technologies. Democratic members of Congress also feel the urgency. The election of California's Henry Waxman, an environmental hawk, as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee bodes well for quick action.LiNeBrEaKClimate change is a nonpartisan global threat. Utah lawmakers should join the governor in efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Opinion: Bay Area cities, businesses work together to fight global warming  	Mercury News  	NEWS; Opinion  	2122 words  	As California becomes a leader in combating global climate change, the Bay Area is stepping to the forefront by forming a "Bay Area Climate Change Collaborative." It will focus on 10 goals in a climate-change compact that will accelerate the sharing and implementation of innovative and effective policies and programs, helping make the Bay Area a national and international model of public-private cooperation.LiNeBrEaKIn a signing ceremony Dec. 10 with the mayors of San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland, Bay Area cities and regional government organizations will commit to work together to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and increase the region's ability to deal with the effects of climate change. They will work to increase the use of renewable energy, increase the number of zero-emission vehicles in use, adopt municipal and organizational climate adaptation plans and train workers for the new clean and green economy.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this fall, the mayors of the Bay Area's three largest cities joined the chief executive of SpikeSource to discuss the compact at the Silicon Valley Projections: Clean and Green conference sponsored by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. The discussion was moderated by Barbara Marshman, editorial pages editor of the Mercury News. An edited transcript follows. LiNeBrEaKPanel membersLiNeBrEaKChuck Reed, mayor, San JoseLiNeBrEaKGavin Newsom, mayor, San FranciscoLiNeBrEaKRon Dellums, mayor, OaklandLiNeBrEaKKim Polese, CEO, SpikeSourceLiNeBrEaKMarshman: Before we start talking about the regional approaches that are our topic today, I'd like to ask our three mayors to talk just a little bit about their independent initiatives in their own cities.LiNeBrEaKReed: We launched our "Green Vision" last year. We think we have a tremendous opportunity here, as the capital of Silicon Valley, to leverage the things that are happening around us, to leverage the enthusiasm and the energy around climate change, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating a lot of jobs, and creating a lot of profits for Silicon Valley companies, all coming together at the same time. So we want to be the world center of clean tech.LiNeBrEaKWe can't do it without San Francisco and Oakland and all of our other cities getting engaged in this. And in many ways San Francisco and Oakland are ahead of San Jose. We're all a little bit competing to be the greenest, doing many of the same things, but that's good, to have the competition, the innovation and the ideas that are going to come out of our cities.LiNeBrEaKWe don't have money. Nobody's got money. Ron's got a deficit. We've got a deficit. Gavin's got a deficit. So it's not about us spending a lot of money. It's about working with other people's money, working with innovation, creativity and ideas, to make it work.LiNeBrEaKDellums: Oakland, well over 10 years ago, took a leadership role in this regard. People were very progressive. We've embraced the concept of Oakland as a sustainable, model community. Our strategies have been fourfold: one, to reduce gas emissions; two, (reduce) dependence on oil; (three), to reduce our solid-waste disposal ultimately to zero; and, finally, to develop green technology, green employment and green jobs.LiNeBrEaKBut, that said, I'd like to make one other opening statement. Whatever we're doing, whatever the brilliance of what my colleague, Gavin Newsom, is doing, whatever the brilliance of what Mayor Reed is doing, whatever the brilliance of what Oakland is doing, at the end of the day, we're at the margins of a gigantic problem that dwarfs us all. So while it's good for us to pat ourselves on the back about the things that we're doing, it's a drop in the bucket.LiNeBrEaKNewsom: We're very passionate about this issue in San Francisco. When the Bush administration decided to pull away from the Kyoto Protocols, mayors across this country said, "Enough." And we banded together and we put together our own local climate action plans. San Francisco decided to roll back its CO2 emissions 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2012   twice as far as the Kyoto Protocols.LiNeBrEaKWe've moved forward with the most aggressive green building standards in America, the most aggressive solar program in America, the highest recycling rates almost on the planet. Over 70 percent of our waste is already diverted. That's why we're "doing" plastic bags and water bottles and Styrofoam, that get a lot of attention. We've worked with the private sector, folks like Andy Ball at Webcor, to design those green building standards. We've worked with the private sector to encourage these green-collar jobs: 181 clean-tech companies are now in the City and County of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKWe've been very aggressive in converting our vehicle fleet to biodiesel. We're the first city in America to convert its taxicab fleet to alternative fuels. All of this has been easy to do, and to pick up on what Ron said, it's still in the margins. And that's why it's appropriate today to challenge not only all of those in this room, but to make sue we hold ourselves accountable to do a lot more in the future.LiNeBrEaKMarshman: What are the biggest impediments you face in trying to tackle these challenges?LiNeBrEaKReed: In the medium term, the No. 1 impediment is bureaucratic, regulatory and legislative inertia. Let me give you one example of a bill that we got through the Legislature this year   and I want to thank Joe Simitian. He helped us in the Senate, John Laird in the Assembly   to allow us to put a solar facility on a parking garage and use it for energy for an office building. Well, you can't do that, because that's against the rules. Fortunately, that bill has been passed to allow cities and other government entities to do that, to basically transfer that power from one building to another. A very simple thing to do. But we had to go to the state Legislature to do it.LiNeBrEaKDellums: First of all, I would say getting people to understand that there are no options here. It's either we do it or we do not survive. No. 2 is the financial implications of what we have to do. We're still playing politician with it. "Well, who are we gonna tax?" We're not really dealing with finances.LiNeBrEaKLet me give you a practical example. The Association of Bay Area Governments says, "San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, based on smart planning and sustainable growth, we want your cities to take major growth." That makes sense to me. I understand this as an environmentalist. I understand this as a planner. But how (do) Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco continue to build on a rapidly deteriorating infrastructure? That has ripple-effect financial implications. We need to deal with it.LiNeBrEaKMarshman: Kim, could you talk about this from a private-company perspective? What stands in your way?LiNeBrEaKPolese: Like many of us here in the valley, and in the Bay Area, and in California, we think not in terms of "impediment," but in terms of opportunity. I want to just say, I couldn't be prouder to be from a region with leadership like we're seeing here today. In terms of the private sector, what we're seeing is the opportunity to create a whole new economy. The kind of innovation that's happening is amazing   companies like Solazyme turning algae into jet fuel, or Calera creating carbon-negative cement, and the list goes on. The venture capital that's pouring into California is happening at an unprecedented rate   $1. 8 billion last year, and it's because, again, the leadership that's being shown at the state and the local levels. Business has a tremendous responsibility and a tremendous opportunity here.LiNeBrEaKMarshman: How do you see AB 32, the state's landmark climate-change legislation, affecting your business?LiNeBrEaKPolese: There are some business organizations that did actually view AB 32 as a burden. I think it's just the opposite. It's a tremendous opportunity. The Leadership Group actually was one of the few business organizations in California to actively support AB 32. The impact has been tremendous. Just the change from 2006 to 2007, a 50 percent increase in green-tech venture capital. And that's because California adopted emissions caps, and really demonstrated very clearly that it is committed to reducing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKMarshman: Let's talk about the Bay Area Climate Change Compact. It's an initiative the Leadership Group has set up as a call to action for communities, government agencies and private businesses throughout the Bay Area, to work together on a regional approach to climate change and conservation issues. What value do you see in this kind of regional compact?LiNeBrEaKDellums: A regional infrastructure to address the issue of climate change just makes sense to me. It allows us to work collaboratively. It allows us to coordinate, to communicate with each other, and to take each other's best practices.LiNeBrEaKWe started an experimental demonstration project that has gained a great deal of excitement around the country. It's called our Green Corps program. It simply says, "Let's fight pollution and fight poverty simultaneously." (People) are being trained, not for obsolescence, but being trained for the future. So, at the same time, you strike a mighty blow, dealing with global change, and you bring people together, bring people forward who are rooted in poverty, underemployment, undereducation, and so forth.LiNeBrEaKNewsom: And there is your answer about regionalism! I mean we stole that idea two years ago. (laughter) And we call it "CityBuild." Here is the opportunity to create those jobs that cannot be outsourced. You can't, as my good friend Van Jones says, take a house and ship it over to China, and put a solar installation on top of it, and ship it back to the States.LiNeBrEaKThat's what a regional compact provides: the ability to share best practices in real time; the ability for us, as we're already doing, to say, "Ron, how many cars are you purchasing next year? What kind of cars are you purchasing?" Or "How many cars, Chuck, are you purchasing next year?" "Well, we're purchasing 150. You're purchasing 175, 200. Why don't we commit to plug-in hybrids? And let's do an open order, and then let's scale that with the rest of the region."LiNeBrEaKReed: There are parts of the things that we want to do as individual cities that can only be done on a regional basis. For example, the electric car. It's going to happen. But, when it does happen, you've got to have a place to plug them in, to recharge them. You can't just do it at home. So, while in San Jose, we've worked very hard to land Tesla as a manufacturing facility in San Jose, but where are you going to plug in the cars when they drive to San Francisco? We have to work on those things together.LiNeBrEaKMarshman: Kim, would you like to talk about this from the private perspective?LiNeBrEaKPolese: There are two main opportunities here. First, clearly, economic leadership. The speed with which technology innovation has to happen, and these products need to be delivered, is unprecedented. That means there's a huge market opportunity, obviously. That's solar. That's biofuels. That's electric cars. That's green buildings. It's energy-efficiency technologies.LiNeBrEaKThere's also a risk for companies that don't prepare, because this is going to happen to them whether they like it or not. Policies will be enacted at every level of government, and we, as companies, can either choose to be pushed, or lead, and the risk of not leading is also tremendous.LiNeBrEaKI think the second very important reason to be engaged is that it's the right thing to do. We don't just work here. We live in this region, and our kids go to school here, and our friends and family live here, and our future depends on it. So it's the right thing to do as citizens   as individuals, and as corporate citizens.LiNeBrEaKMarshman: We've been talking about jobs for the 21st century. How do we balance the need for pay scales that may be lower at a time when the margins for renewable companies are small   and, at the same time, people making lower wages are having a harder time functioning, maintaining a home and family in the valley?LiNeBrEaKPolese: I think there are certainly jobs that can be created at every level. There's a huge new opportunity for a manufacturing economy here in the Bay Area, as we're hearing. There's an enormous opportunity at every level for jobs, skilled and unskilled.LiNeBrEaKDellums: I have a fervent view that jobs are not created in a vacuum, that jobs are a byproduct of a society's commitment to solve other problems. If we address the issue of climate change, we're going to generate employment. We're going to generate employment in research that is necessary, technology that will flow from the investment in new research, the employment that will flow from infrastructure formulation and infrastructure development, employment that will flow from education and training a new workforce. It will result in the development of green employment.

Seattle Times (Washington)  	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Research ship finds first surprise  	Michelle Ma, Seattle Times  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	717 words  	Nov. 24--The crew aboard a new research ship didn't expect to find an underwater volcano this fall off the coast of Washington.LiNeBrEaKMaps from previous missions showed only a bump on the seafloor about 200 miles west of Grays Harbor. But the contours of a large volcano emerged as sonar mapped the ocean floor more than 10,000 feet below the surface.LiNeBrEaK"It turns out we had this great volcano in the spot we were testing," said Jeremy Weirich, the ship's operations officer. LiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ship commissioned in August, just returned to Pier 66 in Seattle after its trial run off the Washington coast. Crew members said they were surprised at the mapping program's extraordinary detail.LiNeBrEaKCollecting ocean images is one part of the ship's mission. Despite ongoing research, NOAA scientists say close to 95 percent of the ocean remains unexplored. That means a world of underwater volcanoes, deep-dwelling organisms and shipwrecks hasn't been seen by humans.LiNeBrEaKBut understanding the sea goes beyond mere curiosity, experts say. The ocean helps to regulate the Earth's temperature and provides oxygen needed for life.LiNeBrEaK"There's no shortage of need to understand the oceans," said Craig Russell, program coordinator for NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research.LiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer is the first U.S. government ship devoted solely to exploring the ocean for scientific discovery. A satellite dish on board will transmit real-time images over the Internet to viewers in classrooms, museums and homes.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is to bring people on shore aboard the ship via modern technology," Russell said.LiNeBrEaKThe ocean's floor hasn't been mapped in great detail along much of Washington's coast, making it a worthwhile place to test the sonar technology, Weirich said. The high-resolution sonar mapped each depth as a different color, showing a dynamic ocean floor with deep ridges and canyons.LiNeBrEaK"There are still discoveries to be made off the coast of Seattle," Weirich said.LiNeBrEaKThe Navy has used the ship since 1988 for sonar surveillance before it was decommissioned and transferred about four years ago to NOAA for exploration. The Navy put $18 million into preparing the ship, and NOAA contributed an another $5 million, officials said. The ship now has lab space, a control room with two dozen high-definition screens, and three underwater robots that can be deployed to explore the sea.LiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer has used Seattle as a temporary home base while being refitted. The ship will be docked at Pier 66 along Seattle's waterfront for the winter, and its underwater-robot technology will be tested off the West Coast in the spring. The ship will home-port in Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay.LiNeBrEaKNOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research was created less than a decade ago to share discoveries with educators, scientists and the public. The ship likely will spend about 240 days at sea each year mapping the ocean, collecting underwater images and traveling between missions.LiNeBrEaKTechnology aboard the ship lets scientists map parts of the deep sea and look for interesting creatures and new habitats. If something catches their eye, scientists can return on a separate trip and send down robots to collect high-definition video or take samples.LiNeBrEaKMost of the experts involved with the ship won't actually be on board while it's out exploring. A communication system with real-time images allows scientists and experts on shore to direct the ship's crew while at sea.LiNeBrEaKSeattle has one of the command centers, while the other four are on the East Coast.LiNeBrEaKFurther field tests for the Okeanos Explorer next year on the West Coast will involve experts at the onshore command centers. The public can watch the ship's progress online when it embarks on its maiden voyage in 2010.LiNeBrEaKMichelle Ma: 206-464-2303 or mma@seattletimes.comLiNeBrEaKInformationLiNeBrEaKOkeanos Explorer: http:// oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos	RESEARCH (91%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); OCEANS (89%); SONAR SYSTEMS (89%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ROBOTICS (63%)  		NATIONAL OCEANIC and ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (57%)  		Trade/Transportation  		SEATTLE, WA, USA (95%) WASHINGTON, USA (95%); EARTH (79%); WEST USA (79%); RHODE ISLAND, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	November 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Seattle Times   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081124-SE-Research-ship-finds-first-surprise-1124  	SE  													
St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	November 24, 2008 Monday   FIRST EDITION	Graveyard's solar panels help Spanish town go green  	By Daniel Woolls The Associated Press  	NEWS; Pg. A15  	413 words  	MADRID, Spain - A new kind of silent hero has joined the fight against climate change.LiNeBrEaKSanta Coloma de Gramenet, a gritty, working-class town outside Barcelona, has placed a sea of solar panels atop mausoleums at its cemetery, transforming a place of perpetual rest into one buzzing with renewable energy. LiNeBrEaKFlat, open and sun-drenched land is so scarce in Santa Coloma that the graveyard was just about the only viable spot to move ahead with its solar energy program.LiNeBrEaKThe power the 462 panels produces - equivalent to the yearly use by 60 homes - flows into the local energy grid for normal consumption and is one community's odd nod to the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The best tribute we can pay to our ancestors, whatever your religion may be, is to generate clean energy for new generations. That is our leitmotif," said Esteve Serret, director Conste-Live Energy, a Spanish company that runs the cemetery in Santa Coloma and also works in renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKIn row after row of gleamin blue-gray, the panels rest on mausoleums holding five layers of coffins, many of them marked with bouquets of fake flowers. The panels face almost due south, which is good for soaking up sunshine, and started working on Wednesday - the culmination of a project that began three years ago.LiNeBrEaKThe concept emerged as a way to utilize an ideal stretch of land in a town that wants solar energy but is so densely built-up it had virtually no place to generate it.LiNeBrEaKAt first, parking solar panels on coffins was a tough sell, said Antoni Fogue, a city council member who was a driving force behind the plan.LiNeBrEaK"Let's say we heard things like, 'They're crazy. Who do they think they are? What a lack of respect!'" Fogue said in a telephone interview.LiNeBrEaKBut town hall and cemetery officials waged a public-awareness campaign to explain the worthiness of the project and the painstaking care with which it would be carried out. Eventually it worked, Fogue said.LiNeBrEaKThe panels were erected at a low angle so as to be as unobtrusive as possible.LiNeBrEaK"There has not been any problem whatsoever because people who go to the cemetery see that nothing has changed," Fogue said. "This installation is compatible with respect for the deceased and for the families of the deceased."LiNeBrEaKThe cemetery hold the remains of about 57,000 people, and the solar panels cover less than 5 percent of the total surface area. They cost $900,000 to install and each year will keep about 62 tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, Serret said.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	November 24, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	It may be time to start boarding the boat  	ANDREI KISLYAKOV  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 015  	816 words  	The world geological community is warning that today's seismic activity on our planet is nothing compared with what's to come.LiNeBrEaKOver the past three years, Pakistan, for example, has been hit by dozens of earthquakes. In March 2005, 80,000 people died under the rubble there. On Oct. 30, the last time nature went on a rampage, there were hundreds of victims. Tens of thousands of people drowned during an overwhelming Asian tsunami at the end of 2004. China and Afghanistan have been rocked by quakes again more recently.LiNeBrEaKThese natural disasters, which have swept our planet in recent years, indicate that the world has entered an era not only of a political but of a natural instability. Most scientists - biologists and environmentalists - tend to blame the human race for the catastrophic climate change on Earth. No doubt, the greenhouse effect due to industrial activity plays a considerable role in global warming, but there are other reasons worth considering. LiNeBrEaKEarth is rotating around its own axis more slowly. The International Earth Rotation Service has regularly added a second or two to the length of a 24-hour day in recent years.LiNeBrEaKThis is the main reason, according to Igor Kopylov, professor at Moscow Energy Institute, why the planet - a gigantic electrical machine - has had its energy balance upset. He expressed this viewpoint in 2004. Kopylov is convinced that Earth has entered the first phase of a global change. A weakening of Earth's magnetic field was first registered early in the 20th century and a consistent drop in the speed of rotation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It has been established that when Earth's rotation slows by one second a year, it releases a tremendous amount of heat, hundreds of times the volume of energy released by human industrial activity.LiNeBrEaKIf we accept that all processes on Earth run according to cosmic cycles, which, in turn, depend on the solar system's position in our galaxy, then humankind may be facing another Great Flood.LiNeBrEaKThe solar system travels through the galaxy in spiraling elliptic paths. The cycle time for the larger spiral is 200 million to 210 million years and for the smaller one, which determines minor galactic cycles, 26,000 years. Correspondingly, half a cycle lasts 130 centuries. This period almost exactly coincides with the date of the last flood, the occurrence of which was real. The myths and legends of many peoples including that of the Bible recorded the event.LiNeBrEaKThe flood has been dated rather precisely: at 11,100 B.C. If we accept that civilized society Earth has been developing for 400,000 years, then this period saw 30 great floods, and we are witnessing the beginnings of the 31st.LiNeBrEaKThe cosmic cycles are so gigantically long by human standards that they have little impact on the life of people, but the active initial phase of the galactic cycle is of vital importance for the development of civilization. In the view of Russian scientists, Earth finds itself at precisely this point in the cycle.LiNeBrEaKThe transitional process in the electrical machine "planet Earth" can be divided into three phases. During the first - lasting 300 to 500 years - a relatively quick change in the direction of cross current (according to the law of electric machines) will alter Earth's magnetic field, with the northern magnetic pole shifting to the eastern part of the Arctic Ocean. This change in Earth's magnetic field is accompanied by strong magnetic storms, earthquakes and disastrous atmospheric events caused by a change in the circulation of oceanic waters and the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThe change in the magnetic field leads to changes in Earth's ozone layer, which cause abrupt leaps in the biosphere's evolution owing to the altered level of radiation. As the planet's average temperature rises, glaciers thaw, raising ocean levels across the world.LiNeBrEaKThe first, "warm" phase of the transitional period is the shortest and most active. This period witnesses a relatively fast braking of the planet and the release of tremendous amounts of heat, leading to global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn the second phase, the magnetic field will stabilize. Earth will slowly increase its rotation speed, and the electrical machine "Earth" will revert to near normal speed. The increased rotation speed will bring on a cold spell, the ice glaciers will regain their mass and the oceans will displace their former volumes.LiNeBrEaKIn the third phase, the transitional period will end, the speed of Earth rotation will stabilize and the planet's energy balance will return to the conditions of previous millennia.LiNeBrEaKFollowing the last Great Flood, people began migrating from east to west. Are we now to see a great exodus to the east? It looks as if we should give serious thought to developing Siberia.LiNeBrEaKAndrei Kislyakov is a science commentator for the Russian News and Information Agency Novosti.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	November 24, 2008 Monday 	Democrats may be their own worst enemies in congress  	Martin Kady II, Politico  	POLITICS; News  	1270 words  	(Politico ) Forget the Republican filibuster and the race to 60. The real fight in the next Congress is Democrats vs. themselves.LiNeBrEaKWith nearly complete control of Washington for the first time in three decades, Democrats are entering a treacherous power zone in which many of their priorities could easily be undone by the geographic, demographic and ideological factions that compete for supremacy within the party.LiNeBrEaKUnless Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) can whip their caucuses into unity, numerous fault lines will be revealed: Southern Democrats vs. Northern liberals on labor law; California greens vs. Rust Belt Democrats on global warming; socialized medicine adherents vs. go-slow health care reformers; anti-war liberals vs. cautious centrists on national security. And don't forget the anti-bailout crowd vs. the powerful Michigan Democrats in both chambers when it comes to money for Detroit.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans insist they will fight for their issues when they can, but they also might simply take a front-row seat to see if Democrats implode. LiNeBrEaK"When you're playing with live ammunition and you have to actually live with the consequences of the policy, it's much, much tougher," said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). "Do Democrats really want to hamstring U.S. manufacturers with new climate change regulations in the current economic climate?"LiNeBrEaKDemocrats contend their majority is now large enough that they can afford to lose many of their own on key votes.LiNeBrEaK"Yes, we will have differences, but having a larger majority gives us a chance to build consensus," Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly said. "To build consensus, you don't need unanimity."LiNeBrEaKHere's a look at the top Democratic fault lines in the next Congress.LiNeBrEaKWaxman vs. the heartlandLiNeBrEaKTwo liberal Californians -- Henry A. Waxman and Barbara Boxer -- chairing the House and Senate committees that oversee global warming policy is an environmentalist's dream come true.LiNeBrEaKBut will Rust Belt Democrats bite back?LiNeBrEaKRep. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat from Toledo, Ohio, passed out a flier during her failed leadership run last week, warning that too many top Democrats hailed from the two coasts. Her message: Don't ignore the hard-hit manufacturing states when you start rewriting environmental policy.LiNeBrEaKThere are already signs that coal-region Democrats such as Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher and oil-patch lawmakers such as Texas Rep. Gene Green might be jettisoned from their subcommittee chairmanships under Waxman. These members could easily cause a stink within the Democratic caucus.LiNeBrEaKBut even if Waxman and Pelosi push through a more aggressive environmental agenda, Democratic senators such as Evan Bayh of Indiana, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio are going to clash with those policies in the upper chamber.LiNeBrEaK"The Midwestern Democrats -- Brown, Bayh and the Michigan senators -- are not going to let it go too far left," said one Democratic Senate leadership aide. "That's one issue where we will have a split in the caucus. There will need to be some moderation. ... It's not going to be off the rails."LiNeBrEaKLaboring over union billLiNeBrEaKOpponents call it "card check" and say it oversimplifies the unionizing process and takes away the secret ballot. Advocates call it the Employee Free Choice Act and say it will open up new doors for labor protections.LiNeBrEaKThis legislation -- which would make it much easier for shops to unionize -- is the big payback for Big Labor. The measure already passed the House this year and should easily pass the House next year. But the 100-member Senate needs 60 votes to break a filibuster, and the pro-business and pro-labor factions on both sides believe the Senate is stuck at 59.LiNeBrEaKThe legislation is a tough call for new Southern Democratic senators such as Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Warner of Virginia, along with moderate Southerners such as Blanche L. Lincoln of Arkansas and Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, all of whom hail from less union-friendly Southern states.LiNeBrEaKThe critical question is whether Reid and labor advocates can convince these moderates to back the cloture motion to stop a filibuster, then let them vote against the final bill, which requires only a simple majority to pass.LiNeBrEaK"We don't know if we have 60 yet. We're at 59 [for cloture] right now," said Josh Goldstein, a spokesman for American Rights at Work, a pro-labor group. "The issue has become front and center, and the worse the economy gets, the more support we get. [Business groups are] trying to make this a volatile issue for senators."LiNeBrEaKHealth care now -- or later?LiNeBrEaKWhere to start with the Democratic infighting on health care?LiNeBrEaKThey've got problems from the left, caution from deficit hawks in the center and potential turf issues in the Senate.LiNeBrEaKThe group Health Care for America Now, which advocates affordable health care for all, achieved its main success in winning support from fiscally conservative Democrats such as Warner during the campaign season, pushing Democratic candidates to back a health care plan that is universal but notLiNeBrEaKmandatory.LiNeBrEaKBut the biggest fault lines on health care come from the left in this Democratic fight.LiNeBrEaKRichard Kirsch, the national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now, foresees trouble from a group of 90 more-liberal House Democrats who want a European-style, single-payer health care system that is part of a bill advocated by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.).LiNeBrEaK"The 90 on the left who have signed on to the single-payer Conyers bill -- that's a very active, single-payer group, and we do need to unite them," Kirsch said.LiNeBrEaKHealth care advocates such as Kirsch also worry that there's a cautious mindset among Democrats in Congress who have always feared the label "socialized medicine" and have never really envisioned a muscular majority that could actually take a serious crack at health care reform.LiNeBrEaK"The real challenge is whether Democratic members and staff -- who have spent many years only being able to think small -- will be able to understand this election is about change in a real way," Kirsch said. "Some have talked about a very incremental approach. This is not an incremental moment."LiNeBrEaKOn top of that, turf issues are already brewing in the Senate, where Democratic Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Max Baucus of Montana and Ron Wyden of Oregon have all released competing plans for universal health care.LiNeBrEaKIraq divisionsLiNeBrEaKTroop levels in Iraq -- and the pace of withdrawal from the war zone -- are largely in the hands of the incoming commander in chief.LiNeBrEaKYet anti-war groups are already worried.LiNeBrEaKWith Obama bringing in Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state and potentially keeping Robert Gates as secretary of defense, anti-war Democrats in Congress see senior advisers with their foot on the brake pedal on Iraq, potentially slowing down troop withdrawals.LiNeBrEaKAnd the Pentagon has already requested another $82 billion Iraq and Afghanistan supplemental spending bill. Do the new president and the new Congress want to get bogged down in a troop withdrawal debate again?LiNeBrEaKThe anti-war crowd will be watching to see if anyone on the Democratic side gets squishy.LiNeBrEaK"You have campaign fault lines now incorporated into [Obama's] Cabinet," warned Tom Andrews, a former congressman from Maine and leader of the group Win Without War. "We have to watch the inside baseball of defense spending, missile defense program. That's an important fault line. ... The Republicans are going to play that hard -- that will be a fault line issue. They will target the red-state Democrats and the new Democrats."

Complete with 30 solar panels on the roof, this ultra-airtight house only requires two units of Mitsubishi Mr. Slim, a skinny wall-mounted ventilator, to heat and cool it year round.LiNeBrEaKJust imagine two 1,500-watt hair dryers and an 80-watt bulb turned on, said Carter Scott, the local developer who built the home. That's all the power it takes to keep this house at 70 degrees Fahrenheit inside when it's 6 degrees outside.LiNeBrEaKWelcome to a "zero net-energy" house, an ultimate energy-efficient home designed to produce all the energy one needs to live there.LiNeBrEaKThis house is set up for the owner to sell any solar energy left unused during the day to the electric company -- though one needs to buy it at night and on cloudy days. Thus, the "net use" of energy from the grid -- which relies on carbon-emitting power sources like coal -- over the course of year is zero.LiNeBrEaKThis house, currently a front-runner for the $25,000 top prize in Massachusetts New Homes with Energy Star's Zero EnergyLiNeBrEaKChallenge, is the first of its kind on Coppersmith Way, a 41-unit "green" subdivision that Scott, 46, has been working on. With a lifelong mission to fight global warming, he has spent the past 15 years experimenting with construction methods that help minimize emissions of "greenhouse gas" -- such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that trap heat in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKOn Coppersmith Way, all but one house have energy-efficiency features and come with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Designer (LEED) certificates, a seal of approval from the U.S. Green Building Council.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, Coppersmith Way is an affordable housing project permitted under state law Chapter 40B. Cost-efficiency is often the most important issue in 40B projects because the law requires developers to sell at least 25 percent of units at prices affordable to low- and moderate-income residents. On Coppersmith Way, 12 of the 41 homes, or 29 percent, qualify as affordable.LiNeBrEaKMany developers regard eco-friendly homes as a budget-buster. Scott says it's a myth, and vows to debunk it. He said going green saved money, and that one only needs to think "out of the box" to achieve it.LiNeBrEaK"What works for the environment tends to work for developers," Scott said.LiNeBrEaKSo how did he do it?LiNeBrEaKThe Evergreen Spruce solar panels mounted on the house produce up to 5. 7 kW. These panels convert up to 50 percent of the heat from the sun into useful energy -- compared to typical 10 to 15 percent -- thanks to a water-heating system called the SunDrum Collector attached underneath them. The SunDrum pumps water through the collector, thus capturing much of the heat from the panels -- before it's lost to the air -- while cooling the solar panels to enhance their performance. Heating the water this way for five hours a day saves 150 gallons of heating oil -- and reducing carbon dioxide emission by 5 tons, according to SunDrum Solar, LLC., maker of the product.LiNeBrEaKThe house also comes with a Singular Residential Wastewater System, a septic tank that Scott says makes wastewater as clean as tap water by removing 85 percent of the nitrogen in it. Dual-flush toilets allow for use of a small or large amount of water, depending on need.LiNeBrEaKWhile Scott spent $60,201 buying these nifty gadgets, as well as for replacing regular windows and insulation forms with energy-efficient ones and making double-studded walls, he saved $25,000 in rebates on the solar panels from the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative and $3,550 for not having to install a central heating unit. He also saved $3,886 for the cost of wood, trimming and painting by using plaster -- not wood -- for window trimming.LiNeBrEaKThere is also a $6,000 tax credit for the solar-based hot water and electric systems.LiNeBrEaKOverall, he calculated that construction of the zero-energy house cost him $9,193 more than a conventional house would. And that balance would turn in Scott's favor if he wins the $25,000 prize for the zero-energy challenge.LiNeBrEaKHouse buyers would also save up to 100 percent in utility costs when moving from a conventional four-bedroom to a three-bedroom zero-energy house, according to Scott -- a difference that can amount to $6,000 a year. Scott believes that's the reason the Townsend home was snapped up even before construction.LiNeBrEaKScott has moved gradually toward zero-energy. The first 15 homes built on Coppersmith Way are designed to reduce carbon emission by 60 percent, 70 percent or 80 percent from today's standard. For some of these houses, Scott installed a ground-source heat pump -- which uses heat in the ground -- instead of a conventional central heating system.LiNeBrEaKScott, a Lexington native who first wrote about solar energy in high school amid the 1970s oil shock, ventured into real estate development in 1993. He holds a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from Northeastern University, and previously owned a painting company that employed 30 people.LiNeBrEaK"It's part of what I'm here to do," Scott said of ecological development. "It's helping solve the global warming one house at a time."

USA TODAY 	November 24, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	SnoMotes go to ends of the Earth;  Unmanned research robots destined to roam ice sheets 	Doyle Rice  	LIFE; Pg. 7D  	609 words  	Seeing snowmobiles roar across the frozen Alaska wilderness may not seem unusual, but the ones zooming across the ice and snow on a glacier near Juneau last June were far from ordinary.LiNeBrEaKThese toy-sized snowmobiles were unmanned robots called SnoMotes, the first prototypes of machines that someday will gather weather and climate data from remote, hard-to-reach parts of the Arctic and Antarctic too dangerous for scientists to traverse.LiNeBrEaKScientists need the data to understand how and why the world's ice sheets are melting as a result of man-made climate change. Though satellites can provide much of the data, they simply aren't as accurate as ground-based information. LiNeBrEaKAyanna Howard, an associate professor at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, worked with scientists at Penn State University in State College, Pa., to build the robots. Howard also was on the team that developed the unmanned Mars rovers for NASA in 2004.LiNeBrEaK"Our goal was to create rovers that could gather more accurate data to help scientists create better climate models," Howard says. "We're applying the rover technology to navigate in extreme environments, where data is very sparse."LiNeBrEaKThe three SnoMote prototypes were built from plastic hobby toys that Howard and her team adapted with sensors, microprocessors and cameras from the robots developed for NASA. She believes the SnoMotes could be just as useful for new discoveries here on Earth as the rovers have been in learning  more about the Martian surface.LiNeBrEaKThe robots are designed to move across unstable  terrain where ice sheets -- which can crack, shift and fill with water -- are unsafe for humans. The machines are built to gather measurements of barometric pressure, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed and direction.LiNeBrEaKHoward is working with Derrick Lampkin, an assistant professor at Penn State who studies ice sheets and how climate change contributes to changes in these large ice masses. She also is working with Georgia Tech's Magnus Egerstedt on the project.LiNeBrEaKThere are many unsampled regions in Greenland and Antarctica, Lampkin says, that could be served by the unmanned robots. In fact, he says, "there are many remote areas in the Antarctic where no humans have ever set foot."LiNeBrEaK"The changing mass of Greenland and Antarctica represents the largest unknown in predictions of global sea-level rise over the coming decades. Given the substantial impact these structures can have on future sea levels, improved monitoring of the ice-sheet mass balance is of vital concern," Lampkin says.LiNeBrEaKSays Howard: "This is the third rendition of the robot. In the development stage, I considered the nature of ice and snow and how people actually walk on both. The first version of the robot had legs. We then shifted to a hybrid leg and wheel design that allowed the wheels to maneuver out of snow patches if the legs became stuck."LiNeBrEaKThe SnoMote's skis are used for steering with a tractor-like tread for forward mobility. Howard says the goal is to avoid having the vehicle become stuck in a crevice.LiNeBrEaKThe SnoMotes are not remote-controlled: They operate independently with a camera system and a GPS unit for navigation.LiNeBrEaKThe SnoMotes are prototypes of what Howard expects will be full-scale machines about twice the size of the current robots, which are only 2 feet long and 1foot wide. Though the prototypes don't include the full range of sensors, the finished robots eventually will be equipped with all the sensors and instruments needed to take measurements the scientists specify.LiNeBrEaKThe finished robots may not be deployed  for five to 10  years, Howard says.LiNeBrEaK*For the latest news on weather and climate science, visit climate.usatoday.com.

USA TODAY 	November 24, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	On the Internet, anyone can be a great leader ... so hop to it  	Kerry Hannon  	MONEY; Pg. 7B  	758 words  	Tribes: We Need You to Lead UsLiNeBrEaKBy Seth GodinLiNeBrEaKPortfolio, 151 pages, $19. 95LiNeBrEaKAuthor Seth Godin is all about change. In Tribes, as he has in his previous books such as Purple Cow and The Dip, he challenges the status quo with a straight-on, get-with-it kind of attitude, and you got to love him for it. His books are sweetly short, and they manage to be breezy and thought-provoking at the same time.LiNeBrEaKThis time out he tackles the oft-dissected concept of leadership. But he does so with a twist. He delves into the surfacing of a new kind of leader -- one who has emerged since the Internet has enabled and mobilized countless global tribes around passions ranging from global warming to politics to great restaurants. LiNeBrEaKGodin defines a tribe as a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea that inspires their passion. He argues that human beings have a need to belong, "to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of like-minded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging and the thrill of the new," he writes.LiNeBrEaKIf you are thinking, Barack Obama, and his astonishing political ascent and money-raising prowess, you're on to it. But of course, the Grateful Dead pushed this concept some four decades ago. "The Dead helped us understand how tribes work," Godin writes. "They didn't succeed by selling records (they only had one Top 40 album). Instead, they succeeded by attracting and leading a tribe."LiNeBrEaKThanks to the Web, the barriers to leadership have fallen. There are tribes everywhere, millions in search of leaders, waiting to connect to create change. And people yearn to belong to more than one tribe, according to Godin.LiNeBrEaKAnd therein lies the opening door for Net-savvy leader wannabes. Because the Internet eliminates geography, existing tribes are bigger and there are smaller tribes, too -- tribes you work with, tribes you travel with, tribes that ride motorcycles, and more. There are "literally thousands of ways to coordinate and connect groups of people that didn't exist a generation ago," he writes.LiNeBrEaKGodin's mantra is that everyone can now find or assemble a tribe and lead it. The tools are there to lead the tribes that are forming from Facebook to Twitter to Craigslist.LiNeBrEaK"All that's missing is you, and your vision and your passion," he urges.LiNeBrEaKNo one gives you permission or approval to lead. You can just do it. The only one who can say no is you. In other words, you can make a difference if you have something to say, and want to, that is, in his view.LiNeBrEaKHe even has a name for someone who strikes out to assemble or lead a tribe, a "heretic." Heretics are no longer condemned or burned at the stake as they were in days of old. "The world has changed a lot. There are heretics everywhere you look," he writes. "Heretics are engaged, passionate, and more powerful and happier than everyone else," he explains. "And they have a tribe that they support (and supports them in turn)."LiNeBrEaKHeretics reach out to others and put their ideas on the line. Heretics believe. "Can you imagine Apple founder Steve Jobs showing up for a paycheck?" he asks. It's nice to get paid. It's essential to believe in what you do, Godin opines.LiNeBrEaKFaith is at the heart of the matter. It is one component of leadership that is underrated. "The only thing holding you back from becoming the kind of person who changes things is this: lack of faith," he writes. "Faith that you can do it. Faith that it's worth doing. Faith that failure won't destroy you."LiNeBrEaKSo after all the pep talk and feel-good motivation, what's wrong with Godin's latest tribe manifesto? He tells you: "People might say that it's too disorganized or not practical enough or that I require you to do too much work to actually accomplish anything. That's OK. ... Criticism like that almost always accompanies change."LiNeBrEaKSo what if he's right. ... Now go pursue something that matters. And lead.LiNeBrEaKKerry Hannon is a freelance writer based in Washington, D.C. LiNeBrEaKWhat does it take to inspire others?LiNeBrEaKHere are Godin's seven elements of the newLiNeBrEaKleadership:LiNeBrEaK*Leaders challenge the status quo.LiNeBrEaK*Leaders create a culture around their goal and involve others in that culture.LiNeBrEaK*Leaders have an extraordinary amount of curiosity about the world they are trying to change.LiNeBrEaK*Leaders use charisma (in a variety of forms) to attract and motivate followers.LiNeBrEaK*Leaders communicate their vision of the future.LiNeBrEaK*Leaders commit to a vision and make decisions based on that commitment.LiNeBrEaK*Leaders connect their followers to one another.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	November 24, 2008 Monday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Solar panels draw heat from unlikely spot - town cemetery  	DANIEL WOOLLS  	FRONT; Pg. A9  	390 words  	By Daniel WoollsLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKMADRID, SpainLiNeBrEaKSanta Coloma de Gramenet, a gritty, working-class town outside Barcelona, has placed a sea of solar panels atop mausoleums at its cemetery, transforming a place of perpetual rest into one buzzing with renewable energy. LiNeBrEaKFlat, open and sun-drenched land is so scarce in Santa Coloma that the graveyard was just about the only spot where the town could move ahead with its solar energy program.LiNeBrEaKThe power the 462 panels produce - equivalent to the yearly use of 60 homes - flows into the local energy grid for normal consumption and is one community's odd nod to the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The best tribute we can pay to our ancestors, whatever your religion may be, is to generate clean energy for new generations," said Esteve Serret, director of Conste-Live Energy, a Spanish company that runs the cemetery and also works in renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKRow after row of gleaming, blue-gray panels rest on mausoleums holding five layers of coffins. The panels face almost due south, which is good for soaking up sunshine. The sun-gathering started working Wednesday - the culmination of a project that began three years ago.LiNeBrEaKThe concept emerged as a way to use an ideal stretch of land in a town that wants solar energy but is so densely built-up - Santa Coloma's population of 124,000 is crammed into 1. 5 square miles - it had virtually no place to generate it.LiNeBrEaKAt first, parking solar panels on coffins was a tough sell, said Antoni Fogue, a City Council member who was a driving force behind the plan.LiNeBrEaKBut Town Hall and cemetery officials waged a public-awareness campaign to explain the worthiness of the project and the painstaking care with which it would be carried out.LiNeBrEaK"There has not been any problem whatsoever because people who go to the cemetery see that nothing has changed," Fogue said.LiNeBrEaKThe cemetery holds the remains of about 57,000 people, and the solar panels cover less than 5 percent of the total surface area. They cost $900,000 to install, Serret said.LiNeBrEaKThe community's leaders hope to erect more panels and triple the electricity output, Fogue said.LiNeBrEaKabout the siteLiNeBrEaKThe cemetery holds the remains of about 57,000 people and the solar panels cover less than 5 percent of the surface area.

The Washington Post 	November 24, 2008 Monday   Suburban Edition	Who Are the Better Managers -- Political Appointees or Career Bureaucrats?  	Shankar Vedantam  	A-SECTION; Pg. A06  	1011 words  	Every time the White House changes hands between the Democrats and the Republicans, the outgoing party quickly sees the virtues of staffing government departments with competent managers. The incoming party invariably seeks to reward loyal campaign operatives with political appointments.LiNeBrEaKPresidents from Thomas Jefferson onward have grappled with opposing forces during their transitions to power: One school of thought argues that lots of political appointees can sweep away bureaucratic cobwebs. The other suggests that appointees mostly get in the way of the career professionals who really know how to make government work. LiNeBrEaKThe United States has a far larger number of political appointees in government than any other industrialized democracy. Growing evidence suggests that while presidents and political parties appoint partisans in the belief that loyalists will drive the president's agenda forward, appointees may actually damage the long-term interests of both presidents and their parties.LiNeBrEaKExhibit A for the negative effect that too many political appointees can have on the vitality of presidents and their parties, several political scientists said, is the outgoing administration of George W. Bush.LiNeBrEaK"Loyalty and ideology were valued over expertise, and policy and management suffered as a result," said Donald Moynihan, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. "Political appointees helped to handicap FEMA, which contributed to the dire response to Katrina. White House appointees tried to shape the judgments of the EPA on the causes of global warming. Political appointees pushed weak intelligence to make a case for the war on Iraq. They illegally politicized the selection of career positions in the Department of Justice. Inexperienced but politically connected appointees in the Coalition Provisional Authority failed to manage the rebuilding of Iraq."LiNeBrEaKIn an unusual new analysis, another political scientist compared the Bush administration's own evaluations of more than 600 government programs with the backgrounds of the 242 managers who ran those programs. David E. Lewis, who is now at Vanderbilt University, found that three-quarters of the managers administering the programs were political appointees while a quarter were career civil servants.LiNeBrEaKThe political appointees were better educated, on average, than the civil staff. Many had stellar records in the private sector or on the campaign trail. Side by side, the political appointees just looked like a much smarter bunch than the careerists.LiNeBrEaKWhen it came to performance, however, the bureaucrats whipped the politicals: Programs administered by civil servants were significantly more likely to display better strategic planning, program design, financial oversight -- and results. These findings, remember, were based on the Bush administration's own evaluation system -- the Program Assessment Rating Tool, administered by the Office of Management and Budget.LiNeBrEaKLewis and Moynihan said presidents often forget that while political appointees may be whip-smart operatives, it is the career civil staffers who hold institutional knowledge about agencies -- and that the bureaucrats tend to stick around longer than the appointees. For all the hatred that political candidates aim at the Washington bureaucracy during campaigns, political interference rather than bureaucratic inertia appears to be the central driver of governmental incompetence.LiNeBrEaKThere were 1,778 political appointees in 1960 and nearly double that number in 2004, not counting part-time, advisory and White House positions. The federal government grew dramatically in that period, too, but the number of political appointees grew nearly twice as fast, said Lewis, author of the book "The Politics of Presidential Appointments."LiNeBrEaKLewis said President-elect Barack Obama would do well to reduce the number of political appointees by as much as a quarter, and to appoint career civil servants to positions typically given to political appointees.LiNeBrEaKNot everyone agrees that the United States has too many political appointees: Robert Maranto at the University of Arkansas argued that political appointees have poorer track records than bureaucrats because presidents may preferentially give them the toughest assignments. Moreover, Maranto said, amid rising political partisanship, presidents need to stock departments with people who understand politics and the increased importance of interaction with Congress, lobbyists and the media. If a president placed more civil servants in slots now occupied by politicals, he argued, this could expose bureaucrats to the kind of controversies that can jeopardize careers.LiNeBrEaKLewis, however, said his analysis controlled for a number of confounding factors, including the difficulty of administering different programs. He said civil servants outperformed political appointees even when the analysis was restricted to comparably difficult programs.LiNeBrEaKThere is a happy balance between political control and the civil service corps, the political scientist added: If presidents feel they have to build separate bureaucracies to duplicate agency functions, it probably means the bureaucrats are out of control. On the other hand, if government departments are having a difficult time recruiting and retaining high-quality people, it probably means that departments are suffering from excessive political interference.LiNeBrEaKJim Pfiffner, a political scientist at George Mason University, went even further than Lewis and suggested the number of political appointees be slashed by a third -- but acknowledged this was unlikely to happen.LiNeBrEaK"Presidents want patronage and think it will help them control the government," he said. "But the increasing number of layers of political appointees attenuates rather than increases control from the top."LiNeBrEaKThe message could not be clearer for all those Obama-campaign-operatives-turned-political-appointment- hunters: If they really want to know what they can do for their country, they shouldn't be asking their president what he can do for them.

The Arizona Daily Star (Tucson)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Morenci acid spill riles Rosemont foes: But company says proposed mine's plan has safeguards  	Tony Davis, The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1440 words  	Nov. 23--As the state investigates the cause of a recent 168,000-gallon acid spill at a Morenci copper mine, opponents of the proposed Rosemont copper mine are questioning whether such a spill could happen here.LiNeBrEaKState investigators have not yet determined whether human error or design flaws led to the release of the sulfuric acid solution into Eastern Arizona's Chase Creek in late October, according to a state inspection report.LiNeBrEaKThe spill poured down the creek for almost two miles before earthen dams built by workers of mining giant Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. stopped the liquids 40 feet from where the creek drains into the much larger San Francisco River.LiNeBrEaKA Freeport spokesman, Richard Peterson, said the cause was human error, but he declined to offer more details. LiNeBrEaKAt Rosemont, the principal issues regarding potential spills center on whether the plans laid out in writing by Augusta Resource Co. for operating the mine in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson are adequate.LiNeBrEaKOpponents are focusing on two areas. One is the mine's planned use of dry tailings to limit water consumption. The other is its stormwater-control measures. Those measures meet government standards, but opponents contend they are not strong enough to survive in an era of long-term climate change that many scientists say will lead to more extreme storms.LiNeBrEaKAugusta officials say they've taken plenty of steps to protect against spills and that they don't want to speculate on what might happen if the climate changes.LiNeBrEaKThe company has proposed to mine 27 million tons a year of copper, molybdenum and silver on 4,400 acres of private and public land. The U.S. Forest Service is in the middle of conducting studies for an environmental analysis of the mine's effects, and it plans to release its report in about a year.LiNeBrEaKThe company says it has planned extensive measures to prevent spills of any contaminated or potentially contaminated liquids used in mining at Rosemont. The mine, liquid storage ponds and buildings will all be put behind large, earthen structures to separate them from washes leaving the mine site.LiNeBrEaKAugusta is designing such barriers, including stormwater ponds and check dams it will build to withstand a 100-year flood, in accordance with state and federal standards, a company spokeswoman said. A 100-year flood is one large enough that it would statistically be expected to hit about once in a century. There's a 1 percent chance that a flood that big would happen in any given year.LiNeBrEaKThe company is also keeping all of its mine facilities within one drainage, Barrel Canyon, whereas past mine plans for the site put tailings and other waste-rock storage areas in three canyons, Rosemont's mining plan said.LiNeBrEaKStormwater runoff will be diverted away from the tailings piles, the plan said.LiNeBrEaK"Our philosophy is, 'Let's design it from the beginning to prevent these things from happening,' " said Augusta spokeswoman Jan Howard. "As for the Morenci mine, it is hard to speculate as to how it is different from ours.LiNeBrEaK"We're not familiar with what happened there. There's no way we can be appropriately compared to them."LiNeBrEaKOpponents, however, say they're worried that a spill from the Rosemont mine could reach Davidson Canyon, a highly prized riverfront riparian area that lies 2. 7 miles downstream from the mine site. After Barrel Canyon passes through the Rosemont site, it feeds Davidson Canyon, which in turn is a tributary to Cienega Creek. Both Cienega Creek and Davidson Canyon contain Pima County-owned open space.LiNeBrEaKThe Morenci-area spill happened in a populated area, where plenty of people saw it and had time to stop the acid liquid before it could reach the San Francisco River, said Elizabeth Webb, a community activist who lives about three miles east of Davidson Canyon and about seven miles from the Rosemont mine as the crow flies.LiNeBrEaKIf a similar spill happened at Rosemont, "we would be the first ones to notice it," Webb said. "I cross Davidson Canyon every day to go home from work. How would we get home if we had to cross this mess?"LiNeBrEaKWebb and another activist drove to the site of the Freeport spill and videotaped the cleanup work, three days after the spill occurred. "We walked over the creek on a bridge, and our eyes were burning," Webb recalled.LiNeBrEaKAll liquids were removed from Chase Creek by Nov. 4, the state inspection report said. Besides removing all the liquids, Freeport crews also hauled out tens of thousands of tons of soil from the creek for testing to see how contaminated it is. At one point, the company had 200 people and 60 pieces of equipment at the cleanup site, the state report said.LiNeBrEaKThe dry tailings plan has been a hallmark of Rosemont's proposal from the start, not because of contamination issues, but as a water-saving tool. With dry stacking of tailings, in which a company mechanically removes water from the waste materials, that creates tailings with a very low moisture content.LiNeBrEaKThe water can be reused many times, which the company has said would reduce its expected water use in half.LiNeBrEaKBut Webb and other Rosemont opponents have said that the dry stacking method was designed primarily for very arid climates, such as the Chilean desert where about 2 inches of rain fall each year compared to 18 to 24 inches annually in the Santa Ritas. The opponents are concerned that the additional rain could make the tailings wetter and more prone to collapses and overflows that could lead to spills.LiNeBrEaK"What it boils down to is that the dry tailings design and everything that goes along with it is untested in our climate. It's not worth the risk," Webb said.LiNeBrEaKIn a newly released report, however, a consulting firm hired by Rosemont mentioned two mine sites in Mexico that use dry stacked tailings in areas that get about 30 inches of annual rainfall. One is an open-pit silver-gold mine near the town of Alamos, Sonora. The other is a gold mine in southwestern Chihuahua.LiNeBrEaKThe consultant's report listed 40 existing mines including these two that use the dry tailings technology, and nine others not including Rosemont that are studying the feasibility of using it for future operations.LiNeBrEaKWhile dry tailings aren't a panacea for the industry, their use is growing and they have potential environmental advantages over conventional tailings "largely because physical failures of tailings cannot occur," the report said.LiNeBrEaKMost of the dry stack operations studied by the consultant are far smaller operations than Rosemont's, which would mine nearly 75,000 tons of copper daily. The two Mexican mines studied, for instance, get between 3,500 and 5,300 tons daily.LiNeBrEaKMine opponents also point to the summer 2006 storm that washed out the paved road in Sabino Canyon as an example of the kinds of storms that the Rosemont mine would not be protected against. During five days, the Catalina and Rincon mountains got a total of 5 to 11 inches of rain and Tucson got 1 to 6 inches in various areas.LiNeBrEaKThe overall storm was a 1,000-year event, said a new report from the Pima County Regional Flood Control District. The peak flows on the Rillito and Tanque Verde creeks were 500-year floods and the peak on Sabino Creek was a 200-year flood, the report said.LiNeBrEaKWhile most climate scientists have cautioned that no single storm can be linked to climate change, they've said climate change is likely to bring more extreme storms in the future.LiNeBrEaK"They can't be designing to 100-year standards for Rosemont in such a sensitive area," said Lainie Levick, a board member for Friends of the Scenic Santa Ritas, which opposes Rosemont. Levick, who was stranded in her far Northeast Side neighborhood for a day during the 2006 flooding, said she's concerned that a larger-than-100-year flood at Rosemont could cause its tailings dam to fail. Levick is a senior research specialist in watershed management at the University of Arizona.LiNeBrEaKAugusta's Howard replied: "We're trying to build to as high a standard as is appropriate at this time. We don't want to speculate from a climate change standpoint about what the standard might be. That's something that the federal government is looking at.LiNeBrEaK"It seems to be a valid goal to build towards the 100-year storm."LiNeBrEaK--Contact reporter Tony Davis at 806-7746 or tdavis@azstarnet.com	COPPER MINING (91%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); MINES and MINING (89%); DAMS and RESERVOIRS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (87%); CLIMATE CHANGE (87%); NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION (76%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (71%); MOUNTAINS (67%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (65%); SCIENCE NEWS (65%); ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (76%)  	FREEPORT-MCMORAN COPPER and GOLD INC (71%)  		FCX (NYSE) (71%) NYSE:FCX, NASDAQ-OTCBB:CCKH  	NAICS331411 PRIMARY SMELTING and REFINING OF COPPER (71%); NAICS213114 SUPPORT ACTIVITIES FOR METAL MINING (71%); NAICS212234 COPPER ORE and NICKEL ORE MINING (71%); NAICS212222 SILVER ORE MINING (71%); NAICS212221 GOLD ORE MINING (71%); SIC3341 SECONDARY SMELTING and REFINING OF NONFERROUS METALS (71%); SIC3331 PRIMARY SMELTING and REFINING OF COPPER (71%); SIC1081 METAL MINING SERVICES (71%); SIC1044 SILVER ORES (71%); SIC1041 GOLD ORES (71%); SIC1021 COPPER ORES (71%) General  		TUCSON, AZ, USA (92%) ARIZONA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Arizona Daily Star   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081123-AZ-Morenci-acid-spill-riles-Rosemont-foes-1123  	AZ  													
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Main Edition	CDC director faces ouster under new administration  	CRAIG SCHNEIDER; Staff  	NEWS; Pg. 5A  	801 words  	Dr. Julie Gerberding's controversial tenure as director of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could end as early as January, as a new Obama administration puts its stamp on federal agencies, several public health experts said.LiNeBrEaKDuring Gerberding's six years at the CDC, critics lambasted her for sacrificing science for politics --- for carrying the Bush agenda on global warming and other issues into the world of scientific research. LiNeBrEaKHer defenders counter that she expanded the mission of the agency to include bioterrorism research, combating AIDS globally and responding to national health threats.LiNeBrEaKBut fans and detractors alike say her leaving would not be a surprise.LiNeBrEaKGerberding, an infectious disease expert, was appointed CDC director in 2002 under the Bush administration. She has led the CDC --- the country's premier public health lab --- into the post-9/11 world.LiNeBrEaKBut along the way, her reorganization of the center's staff, her edited testimony before a congressional hearing and the removal of a few respected CDC leaders have created a firestorm of criticism.LiNeBrEaK"I am very certain that the new administration will look for a new director of the CDC and will not keep Dr. Gerberding in that role," said Dr. Nils Daulaire, president of the Global Health Council, a Washington-based organization of several thousand health professionals and groups. LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama is quickly changing the guard. It was widely reported last week, for example, that Obama has chosen former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle as secretary of health and human services. The secretary appoints the CDC director.LiNeBrEaKObama transition officials declined to comment on the CDC post, though transition team members have visited the CDC, federal officials said.LiNeBrEaKEven if Gerberding is replaced, her supporters say that may be no reflection on her performance, that new leaders often want to bring in their own players.LiNeBrEaKAnd the director's departure is by no means a foregone conclusion, said Debra Lappin, a health consultant on the advisory board to the CDC director. Gerberding could provide continuity for the new administration, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Her commitment to science cuts across the aisle," she said.LiNeBrEaKGerberding's perceived alignment with the Bush administration, however, could work against her remaining in the job, said Russ Toal, a distinguished fellow in health policy at Georgia State University.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration "was an extremely political administration that reached down into the lower levels of government," Toal said.LiNeBrEaKGerberding was criticized last year after allegations emerged that she allowed the White House to censor her congressional testimony on climate change.LiNeBrEaKA deleted section of the testimony included the statement that "catastrophic weather events such as heat waves and hurricanes are expected to become more frequent, severe and costly."LiNeBrEaKGerberding said at the time that the White House review process was customary, and she said she spoke openly and without constraint.LiNeBrEaKDr. David Sencer, who led the CDC from 1966 to 1977, believes Gerberding would find it difficult to adapt to a new administration. He has raised objections about the direction of the agency.LiNeBrEaK"Sometimes CDC was putting politics ahead of science," he said.LiNeBrEaKSencer was among five former CDC directors who wrote to Gerberding in 2006 to express concern that her reorganization of the agency prompted morale problems and an exodus of key leaders and scientists.LiNeBrEaKGerberding responded that some morale issues were expected during the reorganization, and she stressed that the agency continued to perform well through the transition.LiNeBrEaKIn July of this year, Gerberding came under fire from business leaders, labor unions and lawmakers who alleged that she played politics by refusing to reappoint the respected leader of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.LiNeBrEaKGerberding responded that the agency was taking a new direction to enhance occupational health.LiNeBrEaKGerberding, 53, lives in Atlanta with her husband, David Rose, who is a software engineer.LiNeBrEaKShe is also a clinical professor of medicine at Emory University.LiNeBrEaKAsked whether she would like to remain in the CDC post, Gerberding issued a statement Thursday saying, "CDC is at the forefront when it comes to protecting our nation's health, and I want to do everything in my power, in whatever capacity, to champion the agency's cause."LiNeBrEaKHer supporters hope she will remain in the position.LiNeBrEaK"I personally think she's been a can-do person. ... She did difficult things at difficult times," said U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).LiNeBrEaKIsakson praised her leadership during the anthrax attacks, the agency's commitment to battling AIDS and its progress on building new labs.LiNeBrEaKStill, Isakson said, he would not be surprised if the Obama administration replaced her.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Main Edition	Green-collar workers on the rise;  Environmentalism is now the mainstream, some business observers say. 	LAURA RAINES; For the Journal-Constitution  	AJCJOBS; Pg. 1R  	1211 words  	Birkenstocks meet business suits. The "green" movement has moved beyond the Sierra Club to Wall Street.LiNeBrEaKFortune 500 corporations and small companies are making sustainability a part of their game plans. It's become good business to meet the needs of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.LiNeBrEaK"Environmentalism used to be out of the mainstream. Now venture capitalists are putting one-third of their capital toward green technologies," said Gayle Oliver-Plath, CEO of G3 Agency, a recruiting firm for green jobs, and founder of www.careereco.com. "They've woken up and seen that solving challenges like dwindling resources and changing climates is good for the economy and the planet.LiNeBrEaK"These problems are changing companies, spawning new companies and creating a ton of new business opportunities. We're going to see a lot more green-collar jobs in the future." LiNeBrEaKOliver-Plath founded CareerEco, an online community where environmentally conscious companies, university researchers, government agencies, organizations and job seekers can exchange ideas and information.LiNeBrEaK"What we're seeing is a great opportunity for capitalists and environmentalists to get on the same page," she said.LiNeBrEaKIt can be a win for both, said Melissa Vernon, director of sustainable strategy for InterfaceFLOR, the U.S. commercial carpet division for Interface Inc. Founder Ray Anderson built the first plant in LaGrange in 1973 intending to make carpet and money. Other than complying with government regulations, he gave little thought to environmental issues until he read Paul Hawken's "The Ecology of Commerce" in 1994.LiNeBrEaK"He said it was like a spear in his chest," Vernon said. "He saw that his industry was plundering the Earth to make a product and then throw it away. He realized that we couldn't look to government to save us. We had to look to business."LiNeBrEaKThat epiphany changed the path of the company and its culture.LiNeBrEaK"We found that we could save a lot of money by reducing waste and how we used resources," Vernon said. "Now we consider ourselves a sustainability company that makes carpet."LiNeBrEaKAs the company rethought its designs, processes and products, it found that many of the creative ideas came from its own employees. The company now runs its plants with renewable energy such as solar, wind and landfill gas. Waste elimination activities have totaled $107 million since 1994, and the waste cost per unit of production has been reduced by 48 percent. InterfaceFLOR designs its carpet so it can take it back. Its recycling plants create jobs in Georgia and around the world. It has invented the technology to use recycled fibers in new carpet.LiNeBrEaKThe company's showroom in Atlanta was the first space in the country to receive a platinum rating with the Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System for commercial interiors.LiNeBrEaK"For employees, working for an environmentally responsible company means that you can bring your whole self to work. You don't have to check your values at the door. Sustainability has become a way of life here, and one of the results is low employee turnover," Vernon said.LiNeBrEaKOnce, companies such as InterfaceFLOR had to educate their customers on the advantages of being environmentally conscious.LiNeBrEaK"Now the 'green movement' is being driven by customers who want to know what a business is doing to be sustainable," said Jerry Scher, principal of Peak Focus, an Atlanta coaching and consulting company. After sitting in on meetings of the Sustainable Green Printing Partnership, an organization dedicated to helping printers be environmentally friendly, Scher published "The Green GPS," a step-by-step guide to assist printers in implementing a green/sustainable plan.LiNeBrEaK"Printers already have the FSC and SFI certifications that show that they are using papers that inflict the least damage on the environment, but now printers are being asked to look at all of their processes," said Scher. He wrote the guide for small and mid-sized printers who wanted to be pro-environment, but didn't know where to begin.LiNeBrEaK"If they start with a strategic plan and set up benchmarks, sustainability doesn't have to be more expensive. Looking at their printing products, processes and envelope [everything that is a part of the business from low-flush toilets to not using Styrofoam cups] companies have a huge opportunity to eliminate waste and reduce operating costs," Scher said.LiNeBrEaK"Companies are beginning to see that it's a good and a smart move. Every day I read the stories on www .environmentalleader.com and I see creative, significant and impressive changes taking place."LiNeBrEaKMany of those changes are happening in new "clean/green technology" companies that are looking at ways to save natural resources and reduce pollution, Oliver-Plath said.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to see more green jobs come out of our search for renewable energy sources," she said.LiNeBrEaKSuniva Inc., a manufacturer of solar cells used in solar panels, opened its first factory in Norcross in June. Suniva already has $1 billion in sales contracts with leading solar panel makers Solon AG and Titan Energy Systems Ltd., and it plans to employ 100 people in the first year, said Wendy Rosen of Antenna Group. In November it opened a second production line to double its manufacturing capacity.LiNeBrEaKCompany founder Ajeet Rohatgi of Georgia Tech's University Center of Excellence in Photovoltaics believes that Suniva's new efficiencies and innovations in creating solar cells will make the company a market leader and drive down the costs of solar energy.LiNeBrEaKSuniva CEO John Baumstark said the company is "pleased to be moving into our next phase of growth close to home, and we are interested in working with state and local government to create an ecosystem of clean energy companies in the Atlanta metro area."LiNeBrEaKOne of those companies, C2Biofuels, has made great progress in producing cellulosic ethanol from pine chips.LiNeBrEaK"This is one of the most promising, near-term solutions to help us reduce our use of oil-based transportation fuels," said Roger Reisert, C2Biofuels' president and CEO.LiNeBrEaKBiomass fuels don't emit greenhouse gases and are renewable because they come from plant material.LiNeBrEaK"Other regions are studying corn and grasses for fuel use: Georgia has an abundance of pine trees grown for the saw timber business. They are on a 35-year replaceable cycle, marginal agricultural land [so they aren't taking away land for food crops] and don't require pesticides or fertilizer," Reisert said.LiNeBrEaKWorking with Georgia Tech and UGA scientists, Reisert started the business in 2005 and is fund-raising to build a pilot plant. He's projecting to build the first commercial plant in 2013.LiNeBrEaK"The state could support five plants on a sustainable basis, costing about $250 million each and employing around 70 people per plant," he said. "That doesn't include all the jobs related to growing, harvesting and delivering the trees and fuel."LiNeBrEaKHe's excited to be part of a cutting-edge growth industry that is making a difference.LiNeBrEaK"For every gallon of fossil fuel we save, that's less carbon emissions into the environment and more economic development that we are keeping in this country," he said. "Our biggest challenge is doing it quickly enough."

The Boston Globe 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Swimmers take cue from temperature plunge  	David Beard Globe Staff  	NORTHWEST; Pg. Reg3  	231 words  	GLOBE NORTHWEST 1LiNeBrEaKWith temperatures dipping below freezing this week - and feeling 10 degrees colder than that with the chilly winds - is this a perfect time to unpack that Speedo and think about a lap in Henry David Thoreau's favorite pond? If so, an environmental group wants you! LiNeBrEaKSwimmers will line up at 2 p.m. on Dec. 6 for the Polar Bear Plunge into Walden Pond, the Global Warming Education Network said at a conference at MIT last weekend.LiNeBrEaKLast year's frosty dip at Thoreau's historic spot in Concord produced worldwide coverage in the fight against global warming, said Roger Shamel, the Lexington-based group's president.LiNeBrEaKEach swimmer is asked to bring two friends for a support team. And a swimsuit, of course. (Organizers are not taking Thoreau's "simplify, simplify" theme to its bare extreme.)LiNeBrEaKAfter the plunge, the shivering splashers will share a celebratory cup of hot chocolate, said Shamel. The event is part of the National Polar Bear Plunge, timed to coincide with the United Nations Climate Talks Dec. 1-12 in Poland.LiNeBrEaKFor more information, go to www.gwenet.org or www.keepwintercold.org.LiNeBrEaKWould you brave December's breezes for a dip in Thoreau's pond?

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: N.C. coast's changing face  	Jack Betts, The Charlotte Observer, N.C.  	COMMENTARY  	777 words  	Nov. 23--RALEIGH Perhaps nowhere is the law of unintended consequences more vivid than on North Carolina's Outer Banks.LiNeBrEaKThere, in the depths of the Great Depression, well-intentioned engineers built a barrier of sand dunes from the Virginia state line down the banks, past the sharp westerly turn at Cape Hatteras and on to the end of Ocracoke Island's southerly inlet. It was a noble idea: It protected the sandy lanes the sturdy Bankers used in their daily efforts to wrest a living from the shifting soil and nearby sea. It allowed Banks residents who had long lived on the sound side to move closer to the ocean. It allowed the state to pave Highway 12 right down the banks, opening up the Banks to tourism and bringing a measure of prosperity once unimaginable there.LiNeBrEaKAnd it backfired. Building a barrier that would stop the ocean from washing over the flat sandy stretches and replenishing the islands with new sand guaranteed that the Banks in time would become narrower, riskier places vulnerable to the sea. The ocean scoured away sand in front of the barrier, eroded its base, broke through the dunes and began gobbling up Highway 12 in places up and down the Outer Banks. LiNeBrEaKThe highway, says East Carolina University coastal geologist Stan Riggs, has "gone to sea" many times over the years as state transportation officials have had to relocate and rebuild the highway further from the encroaching sea.LiNeBrEaKThe disappearing beachfront up and down the state's barrier islands, all the way to the South Carolina line, reflect the same concerns: The building of barriers has had an unintended consequence of more beach erosion and prompted communities to spend millions of dollars on sand replenishment to save their beaches.LiNeBrEaKSometimes these projects work nicely to rebuild beaches; often they, too, erode away in hurricanes and other storms. It is an endless fight against an inexorable foe.LiNeBrEaKThat's one reason why Riggs, an expert on coastal geology who has painstakingly measured N.C. coastal changes for more than three decades, and five of his colleagues have come up with a vivid guide to how this state's coastline developed, how it has changed rapidly in the past seven decades -- and how global warming and sea level rise might dramatically change it again. It's called "North Carolina's Coasts in Crisis," available online at www.coastal.geology.ecu.edu/NCCOHAZ/LiNeBrEaKAmong other things, it urges the state to develop a management plan to cope with results of devastating, Katrina-like storms. That might mean withdrawing from parts of a dramatically reshaped island chain and creating opportunities to take advantage of a "String of Pearls" with destination villages along the northeastern coast. There would be "Islands of Opportunity" along the southeastern coast where barrier islands are much closer to the mainland. There will be more inlets, smaller islands and less land in many places, altering the tourism economy but not eliminating it. It will have to change, just as the coastal face has changed over time.LiNeBrEaKAnyone who has seen a photograph of the Outer Banks taken from outer space has no doubt spotted the curious curving line running from near Lake Drummond in the Great Dismal Swamp down to a point west of Cape Lookout. That line -- depicted in the illustration below -- shows where North Carolina's coastline was about 80,000 years ago, when sea level was 20 to 25 feet higher than it is today.LiNeBrEaKBut the islands have been in constant change. About 7,000 years ago much of what we call Eastern N.C. was solid ground. About 1,100 years ago, what we call Pamlico Sound was drowned in a huge body of water; much of the Outer Banks was below water. When the first settlers arrived in the 16th century, they noted a series of short barrier islands punctuated with many inlets. Obviously, our geologic history reflects a long series of big changes on the coast.LiNeBrEaKNow we're in for more change. Sea level is rising at a rate of up to 1. 5 feet per 100 years and beaches are eroding at a rate of up to 17 feet a year on some parts of the Outer Banks. It's time to adapt.LiNeBrEaK"We must accept these changes as inevitable but we seem reluctant to do so," the report from Riggs and his colleagues notes. "This is why our coasts are in crisis."

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Rahall wields more power  	Paul J. Nyden, The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	937 words  	Nov. 23--CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Rep. Nick J. Rahall, D-W.Va., is hopeful about what the House Committee on Natural Resources can accomplish after Barack Obama becomes president.LiNeBrEaKLast week, the House Democratic Caucus re-elected Rahall to be chairman of its Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaKRahall said the federal government must make stronger efforts to protect the nation's waters and endangered species. LiNeBrEaKHe also said energy companies need to pay more royalties for mining or drilling on federal lands.LiNeBrEaKRahall has played a growing role in dealing with all these issues during his 38 years in Congress.LiNeBrEaKHis influence is likely to increase with the election of a Democratic president and increased Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress.LiNeBrEaKCrucial waterwaysLiNeBrEaKRahall said the federal government is not doing enough to safeguard our lakes, rivers and oceans.LiNeBrEaKCalling oceans "crucial to life on earth," Rahall fears they are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction, overfishing, the spread of invasive and predatory species of animals and plants, climate change and pollution -- domestically and internationally.LiNeBrEaKRahall plans to press for new legislation to improve how fisheries are managed and to protect "special places in the marine environment as the inheritance of future generations."LiNeBrEaKAlso, the availability of water is becoming an increasing problem, especially in Western states.LiNeBrEaK"Drought conditions, effects of climate change and conflicts over allocation are undermining the reliability of water supply for municipal and agricultural use," he said.LiNeBrEaKMany small farmers are feeling pressure to close down and sell their land.LiNeBrEaKThe Natural Resources Committee, Rahall said, will look into the possibilities of new technologies and managing limited water resources more carefully.LiNeBrEaKEndangered Species ActLiNeBrEaKThe Endangered Species Act, passed in 1973 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon, is "the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation in the United States.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately, the Bush administration has spent the past eight years trying to undermine the fundamental tenets of the ESA and the species protections it provides," he said.LiNeBrEaKBush is expected to allow federal agencies to decide for themselves whether their projects comply with the Endangered Species Act, without consulting with wildlife biologists at agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.LiNeBrEaKRahall said the Natural Resources Committee would immediately improve the ways endangered species programs are supervised by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service.LiNeBrEaKOil, natural gas and mineralsLiNeBrEaKThe House Natural Resources Committee will also seek stricter regulation and increased royalties from extraction of oil, natural gas and minerals -- including gold and silver -- from federal lands.LiNeBrEaKToday, 25 percent of all U.S. oil and gas comes from land owned by the federal government. National energy security can be enhanced by extracting oil and natural gas from federal lands and waters, he said.LiNeBrEaKBut, Rahall added, that must "be done in an environmentally and fiscally responsible manner.... I look forward to tackling the gross mismanagement and malfeasance which today permeates through the federal oil and gas royalty system."LiNeBrEaKRahall has repeatedly said he believes that oil, natural gas and metal-mining companies do not pay enough royalties back to taxpayers for the privilege to extract natural resources from federal land.LiNeBrEaKThe Mining Law of 1872, for example, allows metal-mining companies to extract valuable minerals without paying any royalties at all.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Rahall restated his longstanding opposition to that law, calling it "a relic of bygone days, written in the pioneer era to encourage the development of the mining industry and the settlement of the Western United States.LiNeBrEaK"Today, however, it defies logic to allow multinational corporations to mine valuable hardrock minerals ... without paying a royalty" and "to allow corporations to purchase these lands at 1872 prices."LiNeBrEaKIn November 2007, the House passed new legislation to reform the 1872 Act, by a 244 to 166 margin. But it never became law.LiNeBrEaKAmerican IndiansLiNeBrEaKThe Natural Resources Committee oversees the rights of American Indians who live on reservations across the nation.LiNeBrEaK"We must respect tribal sovereignty and rectify the lack of consultation that was the hallmark of the Bush administration's Indian policy," Rahall said.LiNeBrEaKRahall said Congress should also "provide decent health care for Indian Country" and "respect their sacred places."LiNeBrEaKThe interests and rights of more than four million people living in U.S. territories -- Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Marina Islands -- must also be enhanced.LiNeBrEaK"As a nation, we have a responsibility to foster sustainable development, energy security and improved infrastructure in these areas," he said.LiNeBrEaKRahall said all these issues must be faced at the same time our country faces a series of grave crises.

The Daily Times (Farmington, New Mexico)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	New Mexico on the cutting edge of energy indsutry  	Cornelia de Bruin, The Daily Times, Farmington, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1191 words  	Nov. 23--FARMINGTON -- Reid Grigg would rather find a way to remove the hundreds of tons of chemicals many say cause global warming than to take sides arguing about the hot button issue.LiNeBrEaK"What interests me is removing pollution from the air," said Grigg, a research scientist at New Mexico Tech in Socorro.LiNeBrEaKThe senior scientist, funded by a $15 million grant from the Department of Energy, is working with Ryan Frost, Steve Jones and Tom D. Cochrane Jr. of ConocoPhillips to inject millions of tons of carbon dioxide 3,000 feet beneath the earth into coal beds in Pump Canyon near Navajo City.LiNeBrEaKConocoPhillips leases the state land and operates coalbed methane wells in the area. It agreed to drill the injection well as part of the carbon dioxide sequestration project. The company also operates the injection well. LiNeBrEaK"One person monitors the injection, which is mostly automated," said Cochrane, staff production engineer for ConocoPhillips San Juan Business Unit. "He has to monitor the pressure because it cannot exceed 1,135 pounds per square inch of gauge pressure."LiNeBrEaKGrigg is developing the science necessary to perfect the injection technique. He thinks it might become attractive to the power industry soon as more focus is put on environmental issues by the incoming Democratic administration of President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaK"Sequestration is the main purpose of this project," Frost said. "There's a lotLiNeBrEaKof interest in it, but the technique is in its infancy."LiNeBrEaKThe ConocoPhillips partnership with New Mexico Tech is called the Southwest Partnership. It's one of about 10 to 12 carbon dioxide injection projects in the country.LiNeBrEaKJones, ConocoPhillips manager of Asset Optimization, said it's drawing a lot of interest.LiNeBrEaK"This project is actually in the injection phase," he said. "Most other partnerships are working through regulatory issues."LiNeBrEaKCreated in the earth naturally, the carbon dioxide comes to the Pump Canyon facility through a pipeline owned by Kinder Morgan. It originates in the McElmo Dome area west of Cortez, Colo.LiNeBrEaK"We're injecting 1 million cubic feet per day and are about one-third of the way through the planned project life," Jones said.LiNeBrEaKThe project will inject a total of 155 million cubic feet into the Fruitland Coal formation the well reaches.LiNeBrEaKA chemical reaction enables carbon dioxide to adhere to coal. Jones likened the coal formation to a sort of Rubik's Cube, with the coal itself represented by the square portions of the cube. He referred to the spaces between the coal as "cleats," explaining they are the spaces the gas fills.LiNeBrEaK"A problem with the technique is it causes the coal to swell so there is less space within the natural fractures for the CO2 to move through," Jones said. "This causes a decrease in injectivity in the formation."LiNeBrEaKHe defined injectivity as how fast the carbon dioxide goes into the coal.LiNeBrEaKPut another way, forcing the carbon dioxide into the spaces will take more and more pressure, eventually bringing the project to an end.LiNeBrEaKAs the gas is forced in, it pushes natural gas (methane) out of the coal, enabling producers to harvest it. The Southwest Partnership project does not include that step, however.LiNeBrEaKSensitive equipment is monitoring effects of the injection for the New Mexico Tech scientists. It will track the carbon dioxide as it moves through the coal beds. Jones said the gas likely will act like a plume, or "wave-front," although not enough gas has been injected for the instruments to detect, yet.LiNeBrEaK"We're doing seismic tests to see where the CO2 is, and surface tests looking for leakage," Grigg said. "We don't want any of this stuff to re-enter the atmosphere."LiNeBrEaKScientists fire sound waves into the ground when they perform seismic testing. The sound waves reflect differently from the pockets of carbon dioxide than from the sandstone and coal deep in the earth and indicate the position of the gas.LiNeBrEaK"We also have some extra-sensitive tilt meters that can sense movements of the earth as small as the diameter of a piece of hair," Grigg said. "When the big earthquake happened in China, we saw it on our machines."LiNeBrEaKA chemical tracking agent added to the gas will allow its detection if the carbon dioxide begins percolating into three coalbed methane wells ConocoPhillips operates in the same 160-acre tract of land.LiNeBrEaKCustom fit for N.M.?LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide is not federally regulated as a greenhouse gas, but indications from Obama are that he will classify the gas as a pollutant that can be regulated.LiNeBrEaKBloomberg.com writer Jim Efstathiou Jr. reported Oct. 16 that Obama "will classify carbon dioxide as a dangerous pollutant that can be regulated should he win the presidential election on Nov. 4, opening the way for new rules on greenhouse gas emissions."LiNeBrEaKIf Obama follows through, the change could make it more attractive for energy producing companies to dispose of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK"Just two years ago, the cost of injection was more than the price for methane," Grigg said. "With ... people wanting to get rid of CO2, this process looks like a good way to store CO2."LiNeBrEaKGrigg began injecting carbon dioxide to increase oil well production beginning 35 years ago. Now he's testing it to perfect the science of tracking the gas.LiNeBrEaKThe Navajo City project -- Phase 2 of the three-phased, Department of Energy-funded project -- is expected to end in about six months. Grigg, however, hopes to keep injecting the gas as long as he can so he can keep studying its movements. Tracking the carbon dioxide will continue after injection stops.LiNeBrEaKThe possibility of more coal-fired power plants being built in the Four Corners area suggests to Grigg that private industry might profit from developing a carbon dioxide disposal well here.LiNeBrEaKPower plant emissions typically are about 15 percent carbon dioxide, but it's expensive to separate the gas from the other emissions. Grigg said the cost of separation is about one-third the cost of generating power.LiNeBrEaK"You have a lot of coal and hydrocarbons in the Four Corners, which gives us the possibility of building an injection well with industry funds," Grigg said. "It's good we have industry partners because they can do it so much more cost-effectively."LiNeBrEaKPhase 3 of the project begins near Wellington, Utah, after the Navajo City partnership ends. The next phase lasts four years and is projected to sequester as much as 2. 9 million tons of carbon dioxide into a geologic feature called Farnham Dome.LiNeBrEaK"We need to do all sorts of things to solve the energy crisis," Grigg said. "We need to look at carbon dioxide and to show this can be done."LiNeBrEaKThe carbon sequestration partnership includes the states of New Mexico and Utah, along with Colorado and parts of Arizona, Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKCornelia de Bruin: cdebruin@daily-times.com	SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); PLATFORMS and ISSUES (90%); METHANE (78%); WATER POLLUTION (78%); SCIENCE FUNDING (77%); ENGINEERING (77%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (76%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (76%); NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (72%); GRANTS and GIFTS (71%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (68%)  	CONOCOPHILLIPS (95%); KNIGHT INC (52%); KINDER MORGAN INC (52%)  		COP (NYSE) (95%) NYSE:COP, NYSE:KMI  	Energy  	BARACK OBAMA (54%); MICHAEL MCMAHON (52%)  	NEW MEXICO, USA (95%); COLORADO, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Daily Times (Farmington, NM)   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081123-FJ-New-Mexico-on-the-cutting-edge-of-energy-indsutry-1123  	FJ  													
The Denver Post 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Ski areas voice their wish list for Obama High on their desires are stimulating the economy and addressing climate change.  	Jason Blevins The Denver Post  	BUSINESS; Pg. K-01  	838 words  	Colorado's ski industry is greeting President-elect Barack Obama and the Democratic sweep of Congress with its trademark optimism.LiNeBrEaKAnd a list.LiNeBrEaKHighest on the $4 billion-a-year industry's wish list from a unified Democratic president and Congress:LiNeBrEaKStimulate the economy and get people vacationing. LiNeBrEaKReform immigration and consider upping the number of temporary worker, or H-2B, visas that are the lifeline for resorts seeking seasonal employees.LiNeBrEaKIncrease Forest Service funding or at least separate firefighting funds from operation budgets.LiNeBrEaKAddress climate change by increasing tax credits for businesses that pursue environmentally friendly programs.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously this administration has a lot on its plate," said Melanie Mills, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, the marketing and policy group responsible for peddling Colorado skiing as a whole. "We don't want recreation to be left behind."LiNeBrEaKPublic-lands policy did not play much of a role in this year's presidential campaign, as more pressing issues took the spotlight. Obama's approach to public lands and his plans for the Forest Service are uncertain. The first sign of direction will be his appointment of the undersecretary for natural resources and environment, the position in the U.S. Department of Agriculture responsible for Forest Service policies and operations.LiNeBrEaK"We are waiting with bated breath to see who is appointed," said Geraldine Link, head of public policy for the 134-resort National Ski Areas Association in Lakewood.LiNeBrEaKAs for the top of the list, the No. 1 priority depends a lot on who's wishing.LiNeBrEaK"I think climate change is much more important than anything right now," said Chris Diamond, head of the Steamboat resort. "I'm hoping the new president takes the 30,000-foot view. I mean climate change, we have got to fix this or we are all done."LiNeBrEaKIn that vein, 70 ski resorts across the nation are lobbying Congress for mandatory caps on carbon-dioxide emissions, hoping to decrease the amount of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of people in the industry are very concerned about climate change and something will actually be done about it in this Congress," Link said. "That's the big one."LiNeBrEaKEconomic relief ranks up there too. Already the signs of tough economic times are hitting the ski industry, with declining early bookings. Severe drops in retail spending could translate into dips in vacations. And the ski industry needs vacationers.LiNeBrEaK"I see the No. 1 benefit of this election as one-party control," said Vail Resorts chief executive Rob Katz. "We can take actions that get people feeling more confident and stable in the economy."LiNeBrEaKBut then immigration reform is also a fix-it-now type of problem that has simmered on the back burner. A year ago, Congress failed to renew the country's H-2B visa program, effectively nixing Australian, New Zealand and South American workers who flock to resorts each winter.LiNeBrEaK"Small businesses and ski resorts across America have been let down by Congress in the last year and we need swift and lasting action on this," Link said.LiNeBrEaKEven those on the losing side of November's election are hoping.LiNeBrEaKThey're just hoping the new regime plays nice.LiNeBrEaK"Tax me fairly but don't regulate the hell out of me and stymie me in other ways so that I can't do business," said Tim Mueller, owner of Crested Butte Mountain Resort and Okemo ski area in Vermont, and operator of New Hampshire's Sunapee.LiNeBrEaK"The ski business is generally considered a clean business and environmentally friendly, and our country needs recreation. Don't hamstring us with extraordinarily restrictive Forest Service requirements and other environmental policies that are anti-business and anti-ski-area growth."LiNeBrEaKBut rolling back some business-friendly public-land policy proposed by President Bush is high on the Obama administration's agenda. Bush's recent moves to relax environmental regulations - specifically a rollback of protections for endangered species - have been targeted for reversal by Obama's team.LiNeBrEaKAny ski-industry uncertainty about Obama is assuaged by Mark Udall's winning a seat in the Senate.LiNeBrEaKUdall, a Democrat from Eldorado Springs, has long advocated for the Colorado ski industry. This summer Udall scripted a bill that would tweak the country's 1986 ski-area-permitting law to give ski areas on public lands more latitude in offering year-round play. Udall's bill, which never passed through committee, would have given the Forest Service more room when it comes to approving activities such as tubing, snowLiNeBrEaKbiking, mountain biking and hiking.LiNeBrEaKUdall spokeswoman Tara Trujillo said that while her boss has yet to finalize plans for his role as senator, he likely will reintroduce his bill in the next Congress.LiNeBrEaK"I think you will see him continuing to support the economies of small towns in the mountains," Trujillo said. "If you can draw more tourists and visitors up to the smaller mountain communities, it strengthens not just their economies but the entire state's economy."LiNeBrEaKJason Blevins: 303-954-1374LiNeBrEaKor jblevins@denverpost.com	SKIING FACILITIES (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); RESORTS (90%); SKIING (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); EMISSIONS (87%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (78%); LOBBYING (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (78%); IMMIGRATION LAW (78%); SEASONAL WORKERS (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); EMPLOYMENT VISAS (76%); IMMIGRATION (76%); LEISURE TRAVEL (76%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (75%); FORESTRY REGULATION and POLICY (75%); TAX LAW (73%); TAXES and TAXATION (71%); TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT (71%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (70%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	VAIL RESORTS INC (58%)  	US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (55%)  	MTN (NYSE) (58%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	COLORADO, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  																
The Denver Post 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	An Allard-CSU marriage would be union born of folly  	SUSAN GREENE Denver Post Columnist  	DENVER and THE WEST; Pg. B-01  	587 words  	Job opening: President of Colorado State University.LiNeBrEaKQualifications: Anti-intellectual global-LiNeBrEaKwarming skeptic, not particularly influential among his peers, who has spent years working against the environment and education.LiNeBrEaKSomething is seriously wrong with this scenario.LiNeBrEaKNow comes Wayne Allard, retiring after 12 lackluster years in the U.S. Senate, seeking to lead one of Colorado's top research universities. LiNeBrEaKThe list of reasons why this is a bad idea starts with the 17 years the Loveland Republican has worked in Washington against the interests of students and higher learning.LiNeBrEaKIn May, for example, he voted against a GI Bill amendment providing education funding for members of the armed forces. And last year he not only opposed an appropriation extending financial aid to college students, but also gave his thumbs down to gradually increasing Pell Grants and incrementally lowering interest rates for federal student loans.LiNeBrEaKThe National Education Association has graded him with an "F." And the American Association of University Women has rated his work with a "zero."LiNeBrEaK"Sen. Allard is a kind and humble man. But his voting record on educational issues has not received passing grades," says former at-large University of Colorado Regent Jim Martin. "To appoint him would not be in the best interest of the institution or the state."LiNeBrEaKAllard's environmental record - most notably, his doubts about humankind's part in climate change - also would besmirch the university.LiNeBrEaKHe recently supported shutting down debate on a bill to reduce global warming pollution. He voted twice this year against transferring tax credits from Big Oil to the clean-LiNeBrEaKenergy industry. And in 2003 he opposed fellow Republican John McCain's bill to cut greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKHis views could hinder the school's efforts to become a national model for a "green" campus and open a new School of Global Environmental Sustainability. He also may have a tough time among most CSU researchers who, as is the consensus among scientists, accept climate change's link to human activity as a no-brainer on par with that pesky concept about the Earth being round.LiNeBrEaK"Putting a global-warming skeptic in charge of CSU would be like putting a tobacco lobbyist in charge of a hospital," says ecologist Gary Wockner, a research associate at CSU.LiNeBrEaK"He's not someone who's aligned with our commitment to a new-energy economy," added state Sen. Gail Schwartz, D-Snowmass Village and a former CU regent.LiNeBrEaKAs president, Allard's job would entail fundraising - a task in which he has under- performed as the de facto dean of Colorado's Republican Party.LiNeBrEaKIf he would answer my phone calls, he might tout his ties with CSU - that he's a third-generation alumnus, that he represented the Fort Collins campus for 26 years in state and national government and that he even honored longtime football coach Sonny Lubick with a tribute in the Senate.LiNeBrEaKHe also might decry this column as unfair, just as he did when the moderate Time magazine criticized him for "almost never" playing a role in major legislation and named him as one of the "least influential senators."LiNeBrEaKTo that, I would echo the words of the D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters' political director, Tony Massaro, a fellow CSU grad:LiNeBrEaK"This idea that just because you've served in the U.S. Senate makes you qualified to lead a research university is ludicrous," he said. "Wayne Allard as chancellor would be a big mistake."LiNeBrEaKSusan Greene writes Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	Giant glaciers found underground on Mars;  Glaciers could contain as much water as entire Great Lakes 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A4  	407 words  	In a discovery that partly answers the question of where all the water went on Mars, scientists have found vast, debris-covered glaciers much nearer the equatorial region than anyone had expected, according to a report Friday in the journal Science. LiNeBrEaKThe glaciers, estimated to contain at least as much water as Lake Huron and possibly as much as the entire Great Lakes, were found by ground-penetrating radar on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.LiNeBrEaK"We have found a big chunk of the missing water that people have known must be there," said Ali Safaeinili, a member of the radar team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge, Calif.LiNeBrEaKScientists analyzing Martian topography have seen lots of evidence of water-caused erosion on the planet, but until now the only deposits of ice have been seen at the poles.LiNeBrEaKSize of Los AngelesLiNeBrEaKOne of the glaciers is estimated as being the size of Los Angeles and as much as half a mile thick.LiNeBrEaKHow did the ice get there? The best guess, said John Holt, a researcher for the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas, is climate change was brought on by changes in Mars' rotational axis over time.LiNeBrEaKBecause Mars doesn't have a large moon to keep its axis relatively stable, as the Earth does, the planet can tilt dramatically, redistributing the sun's heat and energy and shifting the poles around.LiNeBrEaKThese icy deposits might have lain hidden in their current state as long as 200 million years, Holt said.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery was not a complete surprise.LiNeBrEaKScientists previously noticed rocky debris "aprons" that seemed to flow away from steep hills as if something underground was lubricating their movements.LiNeBrEaKBut there was no proof what was going on until the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Italian-built radar confirmed the presence of large ice structures.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery could be one of the most significant for those who want to see a manned mission to the Red Planet, a goal announced by President Bush in 2004 but since quietly de-emphasized by NASA.LiNeBrEaKKnowing astronauts could obtain water in the more temperate regions probably would make the mission more feasible.LiNeBrEaKIt is still unclear, however, whether the water is accessible from the surface. Holt said the radar measurements indicated it could be covered by as much as 30 feet of debris.LiNeBrEaK"If you could get a backhoe in there, you could get at it," said Jeffrey Plaut, a geologist at JPL.LiNeBrEaK"You'd have to figure out how to get a backhoe to Mars."

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	Teachers serious about playtime;  Expert says kids need more time to just play 		NATIONAL; Pg. A11  	400 words  	NEW YORK -- In one classroom, a group of preschool teachers squatted on the floor, pretending to be cave-dwelling hunter-gatherers. Next door, another group ended a raucous musical game by placing their tambourines and drums atop their heads. LiNeBrEaKSilly business, to be sure, but part of an agenda of utmost seriousness: to spread the word America's children need more time for freewheeling play at home and in their schools.LiNeBrEaK"We're all sad, and we're a little worried. ... We're sad about something missing in childhood," psychologist and author Michael Thompson told 900 early childhood educators from 22 states packed into an auditorium last week.LiNeBrEaK"We have to fight back," he declared. "We're going to fight for play."LiNeBrEaKAfter his keynote speech at New York's 92nd Street YMCA, the teachers dispersed into dozens of workshops, some lighthearted, some scholarly -- but all supporting the case that creative, spontaneous play is vital and endangered.LiNeBrEaKAmong the speakers at last week's Wonderplay conference was Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a Temple University psychologist who contends that lack of play in early childhood education "could be the next global warming."LiNeBrEaKKey to creative thinkingLiNeBrEaKWithout ample opportunity for forms of play that foster innovation and creative thinking, she argues, America's children will be at a disadvantage in the global economy.LiNeBrEaK"Play equals learning," she said. "For too long, we have divorced the two."LiNeBrEaKSome of the factors behind diminished play time have been evolving for decades, others are more recent. Added together, they have resulted in eight to 12 fewer hours of free play time per week for the average American child since the 1980s, experts say.LiNeBrEaKAmong the key factors, according to Thompson:LiNeBrEaK-- Parents' reluctance to let their kids play outside on their own, for fear of abduction or injury, and the companion trend of scheduling lessons, supervised sports and other structured activities that consume a large chunk of a child's non-school hours.LiNeBrEaK-- More hours per week spent by kids watching TV, playing video games, using the Internet, communicating on cell phones.LiNeBrEaK-- Shortening or eliminating recess at many schools -- a trend so pronounced the National PTA has launched a "Rescuing Recess" campaign.LiNeBrEaK-- More emphasis on formal learning in preschool, more homework for elementary school students and more pressure from parents on young children to quickly acquire academic skills.

Gulf Daily News (Manama, Bahrain)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	A green lesson  	Rebecca Torr, Gulf Daily News, Manama, Bahrain  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	678 words  	Nov. 23--SCHOOLS across Bahrain are joining the battle against global warming, in a campaign to cut their own carbon footprints.LiNeBrEaKThey are taking part in a project to calculate how much carbon dioxide they emit -- to cut it down.LiNeBrEaKThe more CO2 emissions are produced the greater the school's contribution to global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe project is a joint initiative of the Public Commission for the Protection of Marine Resources, Environment and Wildlife, the Education Ministry and The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Programme (GLOBE).LiNeBrEaKGLOBE is a worldwide primary and secondary school-based science and education programme.LiNeBrEaKIt supports students, teachers and scientists in collaborating on investigations into the environment and how to protect it.LiNeBrEaKIt works in partnership with the US-based National Aeronautics and Space Administration and National Science Foundation Earth System Science Projects, in research on the dynamics of the environment.LiNeBrEaK"Greenhouse gases are the primary cause of climate change and we are introducing these concepts to them (students)," commission senior environment specialist Luma Al Mahroos told the GDN.LiNeBrEaK"The students must know the source of greenhouse gases in their schools and find ways to reduce it, such as by saving electricity.LiNeBrEaK"We have just started the programme and selected a footprint calculator software programme. We hope to finish it by June.LiNeBrEaK"We have selected 28 schools registered with the GLOBE programme."LiNeBrEaKMs Al Mahroos said climate change was an international issue and being taken seriously in Bahrain through various activities, including awareness campaigns as part of the country's commitment to the UN Climate Change Convention.LiNeBrEaK"We want them (the young) to know that even simple activities such as using electrical equipment and having the TV or computer on, have an impact on the environment and they need to change their routine a little," she said.LiNeBrEaK"For example, if they use energy saving light bulbs they will reduce power consumption and save money on their bill.LiNeBrEaK"We are focusing on youngsters in schools, we want them to have their own projects."LiNeBrEaKMs Al Mahroos said awareness programmes were vital because they helped educate the community on climate change and the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment.LiNeBrEaKThe commission is also introducing the subject of climate change in public and private schools through its Environment Friendly Schools programme.LiNeBrEaKTwenty-three schools are taking part in this year's programme, which was introduced to teachers and students at a workshop at the Bahrain Medical Society in Juffair.LiNeBrEaKCommission public relations and environment media directorate director Zakariya Khunji said the Environment Friendly Schools project began in 2004 and each year a different theme was selected.LiNeBrEaKHe said the aim was to encourage schools to conduct activities such as producing posters and articles and holding exhibitions under the chosen environment theme.LiNeBrEaK"At the workshop we teach them what the theme is for the year, what activities they can take and we go to schools and help them with their activities and bring them to our nursery.LiNeBrEaK"We chose climate change this year because it's the biggest issue everywhere.

The Hartford Courant (Connecticut)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Saving Green By Going Green: Incentives Offered For Energy Savings In Home  	David Funkhouser, The Hartford Courant, Conn.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1242 words  	Nov. 23--For homeowners thinking about how to cut their energy bills, and maybe lower their carbon footprint, the price of going green just dropped, thanks to new and renewed federal tax incentives for energy-saving home improvements.LiNeBrEaKThese join a slew of state and federal programs already in place to encourage citizens and businesses to lower their energy use.LiNeBrEaKThose efforts can help reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. In Connecticut, residential buildings are the third-highest contributor to those emissions, after transportation and electricity generation.LiNeBrEaKThe payback time in energy savings will vary depending on the project and the going cost of energy -- a couple of years for insulation, perhaps; as much as 15 years for major systems. LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Green Building Council offers a Green Home Guide ( www.greenhomeguide.org) with information on ways to make your home more energy-efficient, tax credits and other incentives, local contractors and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program. The LEED program, administered here by the Connecticut Green Building Council, rates buildings according to a long list of criteria -- from renewable energy sources, native plantings and recycled building materials to low-toxicity carpeting and paint.LiNeBrEaKThe Green Home Guide features lots of suggestions, including "15 green projects for under $500."LiNeBrEaKHere's a summary of the programs out there:LiNeBrEaKFederal Tax IncentivesLiNeBrEaKConservation tax credits were renewed and expanded this October as part of legislation that aims to shore up the troubled financial sector. Certain rating and efficiency guidelines will apply, so consult your contractor or supplier.LiNeBrEaK--For home improvements such as insulation, caulking, energy-efficient windows, doors and roofs, non-solar water heaters and certain high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment: tax credits up to $500, depending on the item. Must be put in service in 2009.LiNeBrEaK--Solar energy systems: tax credit for 30 percent of the cost of hot water and photovoltaic systems placed in service between Jan. 1, 2006, and 2016. Through this year, there is a $2,000 cap; starting in 2009, the cap is lifted for photovoltaic systems, but not for solar water heaters.LiNeBrEaK--Geothermal heat pumps: tax credit for 30 percent of the cost, up to $2,000. For systems installed from 2009 through 2016.LiNeBrEaK--Fuel cells: tax credit for 30 percent of the cost, up to $1,500 per half kilowatt of capacity maximum. For systems installed from 2006 through 2016.LiNeBrEaK--Wind power: tax credit for 30 percent of the cost, up to $500 per half kilowatt of capacity, up to a total of $4,000, for small wind turbine systems put in service from 2008 to 2016.LiNeBrEaKThere also are energy-related tax credits for home builders and tax deductions for commercial buildings. For details: www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_tax_credits.LiNeBrEaKConnecticut IncentivesLiNeBrEaK--Sales tax: Some heating systems and weatherization products are exempt from the state sales and use tax, including water heaters, furnaces, boilers, heat pumps, programmable thermostats, room air conditioners, water coolers, battery chargers, insulation, weatherstripping and caulking, windows and doors.LiNeBrEaKSome items must meet federal Energy Star standards or minimum efficiency ratings. Also exempt: compact fluorescent light bulbs.LiNeBrEaKAlso exempt from the sales tax: "Class I" renewable energy systems (solar, wind, biomass, fuel cells, etc.) and hydropower facilities that generate electricity for private residential use, for systems installed on or after Oct. 1, 2007, and that serve single-family homes or multifamily dwellings up to four units.LiNeBrEaK--Property tax: Renewable energy systems used in private residences of up to four units and installed on or after Oct. 1, 2007, are exempt from property tax. Towns may but are not required to offer a limited exemption for older systems.LiNeBrEaKAny passive or active solar water or space heating system or geothermal energy resource also is exempt from property taxes, regardless of the type of facility the system serves.LiNeBrEaKMunicipalities are authorized, but not required, to offer a property tax exemption for qualifying combined heat and power systems installed on or after July 1, 2007.LiNeBrEaK--Rebates for photovoltaic systems: The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund (www.ctcleanenergy.com) offers rebates that can add up to half the cost of residential and commercial photovoltaic electric systems. For residential, it will pay up to about $40,000 per household, under certain guidelines.LiNeBrEaKThe state also has begun a leasing program for residential photovoltaic systems. The program requires no down payment and has low fixed monthly payments -- less than $120 per month for a typical 5 kilowatt system.LiNeBrEaK--Energy conservation loans: available for single families through the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund ( www.chif.org) to owners of one- to four-family homes who meet income limits for family size and location.LiNeBrEaKThe loans -- up to $25,000 for homeowners with up to four units, or $60,000 for a larger multifamily building -- may be used for a variety of energy conservation improvements.LiNeBrEaK--Net metering: The state requires Connecticut Light and Power and United Illuminating to provide net metering. That means if you generate enough electricity using sources such as solar or wind, they have to credit you for your excess power.LiNeBrEaKThe state and utility companies also have various loans and rebates for businesses, commercial and industrial customers for energy efficiency efforts. The Clean Energy Fund's Affordable Housing Initiative gives grants to developers for solar photovoltaic systems installed in affordable housing projects. A second program helps finance commercial onsite, renewable energy systems, such as wind turbines, fuel cells, solar, hydropower or biomass.LiNeBrEaKCleaner Energy In Your CommunityLiNeBrEaKThe Connecticut Clean Energy Options program allows customers of CLandP or UI to buy power generated from renewable resources such as wind, small hydro and landfill gas. You buy power, at a slightly higher price, through your electric service provider. Contact your utility or go to www.ctcleanenergy.com.LiNeBrEaKIf your community has joined the Connecticut Clean Energy Communities program, by joining Clean Energy Options you can help your city or town qualify for a free solar electric system or other renewable system for a public building.LiNeBrEaKAs of Nov. 1, the rules of the program changed slightly.LiNeBrEaKBesides committing to the use of more renewable-source energy, communities also must agree to reduce energy use by 10 percent, as part of the federal Environmental Protection Agency's Community Energy Challenge.LiNeBrEaKAt least 17 communities in Connecticut have already signed on.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	NEWSMAKERS;  Creator of the Segway, Dean Kamen, showcases his private island, which is energy self-sufficient;  Inventor unveils green `nation'	JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, Associated Press  	A; Pg. 2  	306 words  	MYSTIC, CONN. - Energy independence is still only a hypothetical goal for the U.S., but the owner of a tiny island off the coast of Connecticut says he has already achieved that feat and is offering his work as a model. LiNeBrEaKDean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and numerous medical devices, jokingly refers to his North Dumpling Island as an independent nation and himself as Lord Dumpling.LiNeBrEaKBut Kamen, who bought the 3-acre island in the 1980s as a retreat, is serious about energy independence and the lessons it offers at a time of volatile gas prices and fears about global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The rest of the world will eventually catch up if the Dumplonians can get their message out," said the island's sole resident.LiNeBrEaKKamen's energy plan began when the Coast Guard recently notified him that it was cutting off electrical service to the rocky island because it was switching to solar energy to power a lighthouse.LiNeBrEaK"That can typically ruin your day," said Kamen.LiNeBrEaKThen he had an epiphany: Why not make the island energy self-sufficient and a showcase to the world?LiNeBrEaKKamen granted "visas" to a select group of corporate sponsors such as Wal-Mart and other companies, inviting them to North Dumpling Island to brainstorm about his plans.LiNeBrEaKVisitors arrived on a wind-swept day, with Kamen's wind turbine spinning a generator and solar panels facing the sky. A replica of Stonehenge is lit up with green LED lights that use less electricity than common incandescent light bulbs.LiNeBrEaKHe showed his visitors his basement water purification system, already working in Honduras, and the energy-efficient Stirling engine he has used in Bangladesh to produce electricity by burning methane gas generated by cow manure.LiNeBrEaKKamen says his island nation will distribute the technology he is demonstrating to poor countries.LiNeBrEaK"It will be part of our foreign aid program," Kamen says.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   2 STAR EDITION	Governors push climate agenda;  State leaders sign pact to work with other nations 	BOB KEEFE, Cox News Service  	A; Pg. 4  	622 words  	State leaders are cheering President-elect Barack Obama's plans to make addressing climate change a national priority - but say they'll continue to move forward on their own.LiNeBrEaKAt a first-of-its-kind climate change meeting in Beverly Hills, international and state leaders said the problems that global warming present to the world are too big not to do everything possible to address it.LiNeBrEaK"When you realize the kind of impact that climate change can have on a state like Florida, as any other ... I think the people of our respective states expect us to at least try to make a difference," Fla. Gov. Charlie Crist said last week at the conference hosted by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. LiNeBrEaKInternational climate helpLiNeBrEaKRising sea levels and other global warming-related problems could devastate Florida and its tourist-driven economy, Crist said.LiNeBrEaKHe and 12 other governors, as well as leaders from five other countries, signed a wide-reaching agreement Wednesday to work together on strategies to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKUnder the agreement, they also will create international working groups that will provide recommendations to United Nations negotiators who are drafting new global limits on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKHelping tropical forestsLiNeBrEaKIn one step, Schwarzenegger and governors from Illinois and Wisconsin signed an agreement to work with six other governors from Brazil and Indonesia to share technology and other resources to help reduce clear-cutting of tropical forests. The agreement was billed as the first of its kind between sub-national government leaders.LiNeBrEaKGovernors like Schwarzenegger and Crist, both Republicans, have been on the national forefront on climate change in recent years as the Bush administration's approach to global warming was criticized as lackadaisical.LiNeBrEaKUnder Crist's leadership, Florida passed a comprehensive energy bill this year that calls for the state to get 10 percent of its fuels from alternative sources by next year and provides millions of dollars in grants and incentives to develop and promote solar and other types of renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKIn California, Schwarzenegger is fighting the Bush administration to require automakers to meet more stringent emissions regulations. He also launched one of the biggest solar energy initiatives in the world. And last week, he signed an order requiring California to get a third of its energy from renewable power by 2020, increasing previous goals.LiNeBrEaKProdding BushLiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger and other governors began organizing the climate summit several years ago, partly to push the Bush administration and the next president to do more to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKLast week, they apparently got their wish.LiNeBrEaKIn a videotaped address to conference attendees, Obama on Tuesday reiterated a campaign pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. The Bush administration in the past has declined to adhere to measurable emission limits, claiming that doing so would hurt the U.S. economy and give economic advantages to still-maturing countries like China and India.LiNeBrEaKDelay not an optionLiNeBrEaKObama, however, made it clear he has a different view.LiNeBrEaK"Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all," he said in his remarks. "Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response. The stakes are too high, the consequences too serious.LiNeBrEaK"When I am president, any governor who is willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama's remarks encouraged many at the conference.LiNeBrEaK"I do think this political issue is largely resolved with the election of ... Obama," said Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle. "And states that don't get on this bandwagon are going to find they're 15 to 20 years behind in the future."

The Houston Chronicle 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   2 STAR EDITION	Environmentalists await Obama's nominees;  President-elect expected to be ally; land-rights backers have different view 	LES BLUMENTHAL, McClatchy-Tribune  	A; Pg. 4  	579 words  	WASHINGTON - Here's the question: What does a community organizer from Chicago who spent four years in the Senate before being elected president know about spotted owls, endangered salmon, mountain bark beetles, Western water rights, old-growth forests and the maintenance backlog in the national parks? LiNeBrEaKThe answer: Probably not much.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has offered only scattered clues as to where he stands on the most pressing public lands and endangered species issues.LiNeBrEaKIn reading the tea leaves, however, environmental groups are optimistic, timber industry and land-rights groups are wary, and an influential lawmaker is excited about having an ally in the White House.LiNeBrEaK"This guy is a quick study, and I'm sure he will find competent people," said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who as chairman of the House Appropriations interior subcommittee oversees nearly $28 billion in annual funding for the Interior Department, the U.S. Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. "We will be able to work with him. Anything will be better than (President) Bush."LiNeBrEaKOn-the-ground issuesLiNeBrEaKWhen it comes to the environment, Obama has focused his attention almost exclusively on global warming and clean energy. There are few references on his campaign Web site to on-the-ground issues, especially those specific to the West.LiNeBrEaKObama received an 86 out of a possible 100 in the environmental scorecard for members of Congress published by the League of Conservation Voters. He was also a co-sponsor of a bill that would have protected about 58 million acres of federal lands. The Bush administration had sought to open up those roadless lands to development.LiNeBrEaKAsked about public lands and endangered species issues, Tommy Vietor, an Obama transition spokesman, said, "President-elect Obama believes there is only one president at a time, and thus isn't commenting on many of these issues at this time."LiNeBrEaKSome hints about Obama can be gleaned from those reviewing natural resource and environmental issues during the transition.LiNeBrEaKDan Hayes, who is leading the effort at the departments of Interior and Energy, is a former deputy interior secretary in the Clinton administration who has a background in water and greenhouse gas issues. John Leshy is a former Interior Department solicitor who has ties to one of the most ardent environmentalists on Capitol Hill, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.LiNeBrEaKReversing Bush actionsLiNeBrEaKBill Arthur, a deputy national field director for the Sierra Club based in Seattle, said there have been encouraging signs from members of the transition team who have indicated an Obama administration would reverse Bush administration initiatives and bar mountaintop-removal mining in Appalachia and block oil and gas leasing in southern Utah's Red Rock area.LiNeBrEaKAnother Bush initiative that almost certainly will face scrutiny is a rule that would allow individual federal agencies to decide whether their actions violated the Endangered Species Act, rather than consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the act.LiNeBrEaKThe new administration also faces more fundamental issues.LiNeBrEaKThe budgets of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service have been sharply trimmed in recent years. The Forest Service budget has been sliced by a third, while at the same time more than half its budget is now spent in the fight against catastrophic wildfires.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are hopeful the new administration will reverse what they see as eight years of setback after setback.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   3 STAR EDITION	Solar squabble burns brightly in California;  When business brings in palm trees, neighbor says they're cutting sunlight for his panels 	MARLA DICKERSON, LOS ANGELES TIMES  	BUSINESS; Pg. 2  	1009 words  	CULVER CITY, Calif. - One neighbor loves his solar panels, which have cut his energy bill and are helping to combat global warming. The other neighbor adores his trees, which boost his property value and capture greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKSo what happens when one guy's greenery casts a shadow on the other fellow's solar array?LiNeBrEaKIt's an environmental battle that's heating up. And not just in Culver City, where the two neighbors &shy;- furniture maker Gary Schultz and architect Michael Rachlin - have begun using some decidedly un-sunny language to describe one another. LiNeBrEaK"He's arrogant," said Schultz, who installed the solar panels.LiNeBrEaK"He has been a chronic sort of complainer," said Rachlin, who planted the stately date palms.LiNeBrEaKTesty letters and e-mails have been flying between the two. There is talk of litigation.LiNeBrEaKAmbitious plansLiNeBrEaKCalifornia has embarked on an ambitious program to install photovoltaic panels on 1 million roofs in California by the end of 2017. So it was perhaps inevitable that property owners, who already fuss with each other about everything under the sun, would end up feuding about that as well.LiNeBrEaKComplaints are arising from an obscure state law known as the Solar Shade Control Act. It protects homeowners' investments in solar panels, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Property owners whose trees block the sun from more than 10 percent of their neighbors' panels can be fined up to $1,000 a day if they refuse to trim them.LiNeBrEaKSigned in 1978 by Gov. Jerry Brown, the law was little noticed until this year, when a solar spat ended up in a criminal court in the San Francisco Bay Area.LiNeBrEaKA judge convicted a Sunnyvale couple of violating the shade law &shy;- a criminal infraction on par with a parking ticket &shy;- for refusing to trim a stand of redwoods that were causing power losses on their neighbor's solar array. The couple eventually pruned some branches to avoid the fine, but only after spending $37,000 defending themselves in court.LiNeBrEaKThe criminal prosecution attracted international attention and some "only-in-California" snickers. But with more installed megawatts of solar photovoltaic panels than any other state in the nation, Californians have good reason take their solar seriously.LiNeBrEaKBig power billsLiNeBrEaKJust ask Schultz.LiNeBrEaKA furniture and cabinet maker who uses lots of heavy equipment at his Culver City shop, which is about 10 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, Schultz was fed up with Southern California Edison bills that averaged around $5,000 a month &shy;- more than the mortgage on his buildingLiNeBrEaKHe decided to go solar. Schultz researched the technology and took classes so that he could install and maintain the panels himself. The cost for the 28. 8-kilowatt system after the state rebate was $80,000, Schultz said. That's a hefty sum. But when the system came online in May 2006, it immediately reduced his power bill to zero.LiNeBrEaK"I was ecstatic," said Schultz, 48. "It was working exactly as I had designed it to work."LiNeBrEaKThen came the palms.LiNeBrEaKRachlin planted six of them in December 2007 along the property line he shares with Schultz. The 15-foot trees were the exclamation points on his company's new headquarters in an abandoned shoe-polish factory.LiNeBrEaKThe trees alone cost $10,000 each to buy, transport and plant, he said.LiNeBrEaKBut Schultz said his system is producing less electricity than it did before, causing him to write at least $8,500 in checks to Edison this year.LiNeBrEaKSchultz hired a solar consultant to document his power losses and presented it to Rachlin and to Culver City officials, who Schultz said should never have approved the offending landscaping because it violates the Solar Shade Control Act.LiNeBrEaKRachlin said he hired his own expert who concluded that the palm shading is insignificant and that Schultz's power losses are from poor orientation of his solar panels. Rachlin said he has offered to pay a portion of the cost of relocating Schultz's panels to a sunnier spot, an offer Schultz rejected because it would require him to make expensive roof reinforcements and because it would make his panels visible to potential thieves.LiNeBrEaK"I have tried to be a good neighbor," Rachlin said. "This is just a guy that keeps just coming, coming at you."LiNeBrEaKPositioned near a panelLiNeBrEaKSchultz said he wouldn't be kvetching if Rachlin hadn't insisted on planting enormous palms near a solar panel of which he was fully aware.LiNeBrEaK"He is supposed to be LEED expert?" Schultz said. "He needs to do the right thing and remove those trees."LiNeBrEaKSchultz said that he doesn't want to go to court but that he is prepared to take legal action. Culver City officials are scrambling to come up with a compromise.LiNeBrEaKCouncil member Andrew Weissman said he doesn't believe the city is culpable. Still, he said, there has been discussion about whether Culver City could purchase Rachlin's trees and relocate them for use somewhere else.LiNeBrEaKAn attorney by profession, Weissman said trees have long been the subject of neighbor disputes, be it leaves littering a swimming pool or roots clogging drainage pipes. But he said this is the first feud that he has heard of involving shade and solar paneling.LiNeBrEaK"It's a reflection of how new the technology is," he said. "It's an area we're going to have to pay attention to."LiNeBrEaKNew state rules that take affect Jan. 1 aim to avoid another solar scandal like the one in Sunnyvale. Violations of the Solar Shade Control Act no longer will be considered a crime and will have to be enforced in civil court. And trees and shrubs planted before someone installs solar panels will never have to face the ax, no matter how tall they grow.LiNeBrEaKSue Kateley, executive director of the California Solar Energy Industries Association, sighed when informed of the Culver City dispute. She said the solar squabbles, while rare, could deter some people from purchasing panels. And she said they detract from the larger issue of climate change and its potentially disastrous effects.LiNeBrEaK"It makes a joke out of the serious business of trying to reduce energy consumption," Kateley said. "Global warming is real. ... To diminish it to some kind of barking dog dispute is sad."

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Dalai Lama urges patience over sputtering China talks on Tibet  	By Tim Johnson, McClatchy Newspapers  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	738 words  	DHARAMSALA, India _ The Dalai Lama Sunday said he would not immediately break off talks with China over Tibet's future even though hundreds of his top followers want him to halt what they see as fruitless negotiations.LiNeBrEaK"Wait another month. Then we'll decide," he said at a news conference.LiNeBrEaKHis remarks kept alive the possibility that six-year-long talks between Beijing and his government-in-exile have not utterly broken down. LiNeBrEaKThe Dalai Lama, who is spiritual leader of Tibetans, warmly praised a historic forum of Tibetan exiles that brought together 560 scholars, activists, refugee leaders, business owners and senior monks from around the globe over the past week.LiNeBrEaKThe forum, which ended Saturday, gave an unprecedented voice to younger exiles who want him to withdraw his recognition of China's sovereignty over Tibet while seeking greater autonomy. The majority of exiles still back the Dalai Lama's position but a minority group of pro-independence exiles was formally recognized as legitimate rather than rabble-rousers who should be excluded.LiNeBrEaKOne participant in the forum said back-channel links with China remain active and may have prompted the Dalai Lama's call for a month-long hiatus.LiNeBrEaK"The Tibetan side is waiting for informal channels to give the final signal," said Lobsang Sangay, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School, who led a subgroup at the exile forum. "There are a few people going back and forth (between Dharamsala and Beijing). There are some common friends."LiNeBrEaKThe Dalai Lama fled his homeland in 1959 with thousands of his followers as Chinese troops consolidated Beijing's control of Tibet. Since then, he has become a global icon for his peaceful efforts to loosen China's grip, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. He set up a government-in-exile headquartered in this northern Indian hill town.LiNeBrEaKAfter an eighth round of talks ended earlier this month, China scolded the Dalai Lama for sending envoys to the talks with a proposal that it said was a hidden attempt to sever Tibet from China's' grasp. It described as "doomed" any effort to seek Tibetan independence.LiNeBrEaKThe talks have drawn little international attention. No foreign country openly recognizes the Tibetan government-in-exile even though the Dalai Lama is widely admired outside of China for his pacifist approach and his secular calls for greater global compassion and united action to fight global warming and protect the environment.LiNeBrEaKAt a final session of the Nov. 17-22 closed-door meeting of exiles, Tibetan exile parliamentary Speaker Karma Choephel said a majority of exiles "were in favor of the Middle Way approach" espoused by the Dalai Lama.LiNeBrEaKDeputy Speaker Dolma Gyari said participants urged the government in exile to cease sending envoys for further contact with China, and warned that if China does not send a positive signal soon "then there is no option left for us than to go for complete independence."LiNeBrEaKThe Dalai Lama didn't take part in the forum because he said he didn't want to sway opinions among exiles, many of whom revere him as a deity, but was aware of daily discussions.LiNeBrEaKHe warmly praised what he called the "very frank" debate among the exiles.LiNeBrEaK"They expressed fully what they believed, without fear," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe recounted the history of negotiations with China, which began in 2002, offering a glimpse at the complexity of dealing with a one-party state where leaders must answer to a nine-member Politburo standing committee that is less unified than appears.LiNeBrEaKAt one point in the talks, the Dalai Lama said, a go-between offered advice that "such-and-such a leader (is) very, very keen on talks," while others were not, adding up to "complicated, confusing signals."LiNeBrEaKHe reiterated a contention that Tibetan culture is being choked by Chinese control, a charge that Beijing denies.LiNeBrEaKChina is "trying to eliminate" Tibetan culture and spirit, he said, adding, "Things are very, very sad for us."LiNeBrEaKIn an enigmatic aside, perhaps resulting from his operation last month to remove gallstones, from which he is fully recovered, he said: "I'm not a dead duck!" and began to giggle.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	How Arctic melting could benefit shippers, oil companies  	Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1149 words  	Nov. 23--WASHINGTON -- With global warming melting the Arctic's eons-old ice at an alarming rate, shipping and oil companies are looking ahead at how to exploit the new open waters.LiNeBrEaKFor the past 30 years, the summer Arctic icepack has been shrinking. In 2007, the melt reached record levels. This past summer, the ice shrank to the second smallest area on record.LiNeBrEaKAnd while much of the discussions so far have been focused on dealing with global warming and on preserving habitat and protecting polar bears and walruses, another change is looming. When will commercial interests be able to develop the once-impregnable region?LiNeBrEaKScientists say the Arctic's seas could be essentially free of ice in the summertime by mid-century. LiNeBrEaK"I'm convinced, based on models and observations, the trend is one of accelerated ice loss, and we're probably looking at a scenario, even with the best efforts to mitigate (global warming), that we'll continue to see loss," said Richard Spinrad, director of research for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.LiNeBrEaKAlready, shipping has increased within the Arctic Circle to serve the oil and gas industry.LiNeBrEaKThe recent increase has been the result of a spike in commodity prices, not to capitalize on retreating sea ice, said Lawson Brigham, a former Coast Guard captain and climate scientist who made many voyages into the Arctic and around Antarctica.LiNeBrEaKThe pull is strong in a world dependent on petroleum. In July, the U.S. Geological Survey issued the first public estimate of the petroleum resources north of the Arctic Circle. Its findings: 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.LiNeBrEaKBrigham is helping plan for the changes ahead as chairman of the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment of the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum of eight Arctic nations.LiNeBrEaK"We don't profess to know exactly how industry will move ahead, but we know there's an increase of ships in the Arctic Ocean, and maybe that increase hasn't been matched by policy responses from safety and environmental standpoint, so that's what we're working on," he said.LiNeBrEaKBrigham was the captain of the icebreaker Polar Sea in 1994 when it teamed in a scientific expedition with Canada's Louis S. St. Laurent to make the first ocean-to-ocean surface voyage over the North Pole. "There was a lot more ice there than there is today," he said. "Quite an extraordinary difference in 14 years."LiNeBrEaKExcept for some cruise ships and icebreakers, the traffic in the Arctic now is regional -- mostly ships going in and out to provide transportation for the oil and gas industry, he said.LiNeBrEaKOil companies have been looking at Alaska's arctic waters as a new frontier.LiNeBrEaKAnd in the past two years, the Bush administration has leased large parts of those waters -- the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.LiNeBrEaKShell was the main buyer of the Chukchi leases in February, spending $2. 1 billion.LiNeBrEaK"Shell, like many other national and international oil companies, is actively assessing Arctic opportunities," said Shell spokeswoman Darci Sinclair.LiNeBrEaKConservation groups and Native communities challenged the Minerals Management Service's approval of a permit for Shell to drill exploratory wells in the Beaufort Sea. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that the MMS did not conduct the "hard look" at environmental impacts required by law and canceled the permit.LiNeBrEaK"We're very concerned about the aggressiveness the Bush administration has shown about oil and gas leasing in polar bear habitat," said Mike Daulton, the legislative director of the National Audubon Society.LiNeBrEaKAlaska's oil mostly is produced on land. The U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates Alaska's offshore waters hold 26. 6 billion barrels of oil that are technically recoverable, and that nearly 90 percent of it is in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKShell wants to drill in open water during the summer and fall seasons.LiNeBrEaK"We can only conduct exploratory drilling in open water conditions because of the mobile nature of our drill rigs," Sinclair said. "From season to season, as we drill exploratory wells, those wells will be capped over the winter and revisited when the open water allows."LiNeBrEaK"In the event the project moves in to the development and production stages, we envision putting in place a permanent structure that can withstand moving sea ice," she said. "We have yet to decide what that structure would look like."LiNeBrEaKThere's also competition. Russia has claimed a vast territory in the Arctic Ocean by declaring that the undersea Lomonosov Ridge is its continental shelf, setting up a dispute with the U.S., Canada and other Arctic nations.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S., Russia and other nations agreed earlier this year to use the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea to sort out competing claims. The U.S. can't bring any claims, however, because the Senate hasn't ratified it.LiNeBrEaKDevelopment hasn't proved easy so far for Russia's national energy company, Gazprom, in the Shtokman gas field near Murmansk, even in open water of the Barents Sea, said William Chandler, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.LiNeBrEaK"If there weren't almost insurmountable technical and financial challenges to get that stuff, why isn't it happening?" Chandler said.LiNeBrEaKRussia also has problems on land, where ice roads needed for development in the Western Siberian basin are melting earlier, leaving less time for exploration and development, Chandler said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Navy Cmdr. Andrew Garlington, who works on maritime security policy, said the Navy is planning for increased use of the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"But let me give you a caution," Garlington said. "When you hear ice-free waters in the Arctic, that doesn't mean it's free of all ice. That just means it's less than 10 percent coverage. It's still a very dangerous and dynamic environment up there."LiNeBrEaKThe Coast Guard also is looking north and working with Canada and Russia on oil spill response plans.LiNeBrEaKThe Northwest Passage between Baffin Bay and the Beaufort Sea was navigable for a period starting late last August, and also the year before. But Michael Storgaard, a spokesman for A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world's biggest shipping company, said it's shallow with many narrow straits, not fully mapped in detail and lacking large-scale rescue and repair facilities.LiNeBrEaK"For now, we do not see any immediate commercial possibilities in connection with the Northwest Passage," he said. "Our view is also that it will be some time, perhaps even decades, before we see a more consistent commercial utilization."LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

Section ; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg.   	374 words  	To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''Honesty About Ethanol'' (editorial, Nov. 18):LiNeBrEaK  We agree that the Environmental Protection Agency should use the most unbiased, accurate accounting possible in measuring the life-cycle emissions of biofuels. But this accounting will take additional time to perfect.  LiNeBrEaK  It is easy to show that biofuels recycle carbon in a way that fossil fuels can't. But the E.P.A. is now trying to figure out how growing crops for biofuels in the United States might affect land-use decisions in other countries. Academic experts have pointed out that there are many interconnected causes of land-use change. Our existing models for predicting the impact of biofuels are inexact and often driven by assumptions.LiNeBrEaK  At the end of the day, we believe firmly that advanced biofuels are poised to reduce greenhouse emissions, lower fuel prices, foster energy security and create new jobs. That is why it is so important that the E.P.A. get the analysis right.LiNeBrEaK  Brent Erickson  Washington, Nov. 18, 2008LiNeBrEaK  The writer is executive vice president of the industrial and environmental section of the Biotechnology Industry Organization.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Your editorial about ethanol does not mention the carbon impact of the large amount of fossil fuel-based fertilizers used on a conventionally raised field of corn. LiNeBrEaK  And what about the other serious environmental concerns posed by corn-ethanol production, like the degradation of topsoil, the huge quantities of fresh water used by refineries, and pesticide and fertilizer runoff? LiNeBrEaK  There is far more to the ethanol debate than tabulating carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK  Anderson M. Gansner  Chicago, Nov. 18, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  As a teacher of the history of science at Stevens Institute of Technology, I often assign students the task of figuring out whether corn-based ethanol offers a net-positive energy gain. LiNeBrEaK  The goal is to get them to realize how politicized science and technology can become when entangled in multibillion-dollar interests like agricultural subsidies, petroleum and auto manufacturing. Throw in Nafta, Cafta and, soon perhaps, a ''free trade'' agreement with Colombia, and the jumble of vested interests becomes impossible to untangle.LiNeBrEaK  Daniel Newsome   Elizaville, N.Y., Nov. 18, 2008	BIOFUELS (95%); BIOMASS (90%); ALCOHOLS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ETHANOL (90%); FREE TRADE TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (85%); ETHYL ALCOHOL MFG (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); NONPOINT SOURCE POLLUTION (78%); AGRICULTURAL POLLUTION (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); AGRICULTURAL WASTES (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (76%); AGRICULTURE (75%); FERTILIZERS (75%); CORN FARMING (75%); AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES (73%); PESTICIDES (71%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (70%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (68%); JOB CREATION (68%); WATER POLLUTION (65%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (64%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (64%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (53%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (66%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION (55%)  			MICHAEL MCMAHON (74%)  	UNITED STATES (92%); COLOMBIA (79%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The New York Times Company   						http://www.nytimes.com  	Letter

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   TWO STAR EDITION	PACK IT UP;  A deer hunter's backpack brings versatility, enjoyment and safety to a long day in the woods 	Ben Moyer  	OUTDOORS; HUNTING; Pg. C-13  	680 words  	Maybe it's climate change; maybe random chance. Whatever the reason, Pennsylvania's deer season in recent years has offered it all -- daylong downpours, short-sleeve heat, tree-toppling wind and, this year, perhaps snow and cold.LiNeBrEaKWhat never changes, though, is that if you want to get a deer, you've got to stay out. And if you want to stay out through fickle conditions, you need to be prepared. LiNeBrEaKYou could throw everything you might need into the vehicle and head for the woods. But every time you walk back to the truck to retrieve a raincoat, or to shed a parka in the heat, a nice buck might amble past your stand.LiNeBrEaKThe answer, according to hard-hunting experts, is to use a good backpack, designed with a hunter's needs in mind.LiNeBrEaK"Anytime you go into the woods, you want to be prepared for the expected and the unexpected. A backpack does that for you," said Brian Thompson, general manager of Woodlands World outdoor store in Uniontown. "I'm ready if I need to stay out all night, and it's even served me as a shooting rest. When I was a kid I stuffed a sandwich in my pocket and went, but I now consider a good pack to be essential."LiNeBrEaKBolstering Thompson's credentials in outdoor retailing are past hunts for caribou, elk, bear and deer in far flung places like Quebec, New Brunswick, New Mexico, Texas and Colorado, as well as West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania. Thompson's customers get hard-tested advice.LiNeBrEaKEven without the occasional overnight emergency, Thompson says a backpack makes him a versatile hunter, able to adapt to changing conditions.LiNeBrEaK"I can stuff in a raincoat in case it rains, and a fleece vest if it gets colder and I've got room to stash my heavy coat if the weather gets warm. My pack is like a temporary base camp on my back."LiNeBrEaKSelecting a backpack is not complicated. In fact, the prime consideration is the same as when buying a couch from which to watch Steelers games.LiNeBrEaK"Comfort is the key. A lot of people are drawn to bells and whistles, but the point is making a hunt versatile and comfortable," said Dominick Murphy, sales manager for Badlands Backpacks of Salt Lake City, Utah. "Regardless of who makes the product, the bottom line is how the pack interfaces with the body. Try on different styles in the store before you buy."LiNeBrEaKIn-store try-ons, though, won't tell you much unless you simulate hunting situations.LiNeBrEaK"Go right over to the reloading counter and put some shot in that pack and weigh it down," Murphy said. "Whether you're packing out elk quarters or just lugging a jug of coffee all day, you won't know how it feels unless you put some weight in there."LiNeBrEaKMurphy and Thompson agree that design features, such as the suspension system, hip belts, and the distribution of weight over the body are what make a pack both comfortable and durable. Both agree, too, that you don't have to take out a second mortgage to get a dependable pack, but you shouldn't buy junk.LiNeBrEaK"Buying cheap stuff is not worth it when you hunt hard," Thompson said. "You can get a good pack from one of our quality manufacturers like Badlands, Hide Away, Scent Blocker, Rocky or Trail Tech for between $75 and $125."LiNeBrEaKBeyond comfort, Murphy said what's important to him is accessibility.LiNeBrEaK"I like to know where all my stuff is and be able to get to it without sorting through everything else," he said. "We try to design accessibility and organization into our packs. You shouldn't need to go through your raingear to find your flashlight."LiNeBrEaKPacking a backpack is, to some degree, a matter of personal preference. Over time, a hunter comes to know what's essential and what makes the day more enjoyable. Typical items carried by experienced packers include a dragging rope, knife, whistle, lunch, water, compass or GPS, maps, rag for cleaning hands after field dressing, First Aid kit, fire building materials, emergency blanket, extra clothes, hand warmers and cord for attaching that deer tag.LiNeBrEaK"Before I go on a trip I make a list of what I'll pack," Thompson said. "When I get back I check off the things I didn't use, and the things that I did. Then I know what to pack next time."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	RE-ENERGIZE AMERICA;  HOW A NEW ENERGY SYSTEM COULD STIMULATE THE ECONOMY, MAKE US MORE ENERGY INDEPENDENT AND SLOW CLIMATE CHANGE 	M. GRANGER MORGAN  	EDITORIAL; Pg. G-1  	826 words  	For too many years we've talked about energy independence and the problems of climate change while many of our brightest science and engineering graduates have gone off to Wall Street to invent ever more sophisticated strategies for wealth manipulation.LiNeBrEaKThe recent economic meltdown offers an opportunity to stop talking and reinvigorate the economy by putting Americans to work rebuilding our energy infrastructures. It is time to start casting concrete and bending metal to create new wealth in the form of clean and dramatically more efficient energy and transportation systems. LiNeBrEaKIf that is going to happen, government must do two things.LiNeBrEaKFirst, it must work much harder on creating the right incentives for private entrepreneurial activity and investment. For example, small distributed power systems, called micro-grids, can provide heating, cooling and electricity with roughly two times the efficiency of large power plants plus conventional furnaces and water heaters. However, private investors cannot legally build and operate such systems in most of the United States today.LiNeBrEaKPerformance standards on appliances, buildings and vehicles can make them far more efficient. With a few notable exceptions such as refrigerators -- which, thanks to government standards, are now larger and cheaper yet use about one third as much power as they did 30 years ago -- government has been slow to act. At modest cost, new buildings can be made 70 percent to 80 percent more energy efficient, but that likely will happen only if there are standards.LiNeBrEaKAnd no private firm in its right mind will put large amounts of capital into controlling carbon emissions from power plants or factories until it is clear that the United States is going to have serious emission limits that grow tighter in a gradual and predictable way over time.LiNeBrEaKSecond, rather than pour money into revving the economy by stimulating us all to buy more imported consumer goods from China, government should get us out of the recession by investing in key energy infrastructure, such as electrified urban and regional passenger rail, and technology to capture carbon dioxide so it does not enter the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKGovernment also must dramatically expand its investments in research in key technologies such as low-cost long-lived batteries and energy efficiency. Together, infrastructure and technology will be the cornerstones of our competitiveness. Otherwise, when we get around to controlling CO2 after the recession, we will be importing Chinese technology to do it rather then selling our own.LiNeBrEaKWhile reinventing the energy system offers the potential to unleash enormous creative energy, it also presents a great risk of wasted resources and opportunities if we let our choices be driven by ideology and don't engage in serious engineering and economic analysis before we choose where and how to proceed.LiNeBrEaKTo make sure we don't blow it once again with another program like the ill-fated synfuel efforts of the '80s (economics weren't right), the million solar roofs of the '90s (technology wasn't ready), or the corn ethanol craze of the past decade (unintended consequences ignored), the new president should immediately appoint a commission with serious technical, economic and analytical staff capabilities and is charged with doing three things in his first 100 days:LiNeBrEaK* 1) Identify a range of possible investment opportunities in energy infrastructure and perform a tough engineering-economic assessment of their present and likely future potential. For example, which technologies can best be advanced through deployment now (such as energy-efficient buildings, carbon capture and sequestration), which are better served through money spent on research (such as advanced batteries, photovoltaics, deep geothermal)?LiNeBrEaK* 2) Help the country think systematically and more clearly about where the objectives of energy independence and of climate policy may be in conflict and where they likely will align, both today and over the coming decades. For example, if we invest heavily in wind, but don't develop efficient power storage, what are the long-term implications of also having to build thousands of gas turbine power plants burning imported fuel to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing?LiNeBrEaK* 3) Identify strategies by which the nation can overcome or successfully work around key structural problems in the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKA presidential commission could get us off to a good start, but to make sure we don't stray in the months that follow, we also need a reinvigorated White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and a considerably strengthened technology assessment capability on Capitol Hill.LiNeBrEaKBuilding on the strength of a new generation of science and engineering graduates, committed to wealth creation, not wealth manipulation, let's put America's people to work redesigning and rebuilding our energy and transportation infrastructures to make them clean and self-sufficient.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	WASHINGTON;  CAMPAIGN ARMY ASKED TO MARCH AGAIN 	McClatchy Newspapers  	NATIONAL; THE NATION AT A GLANCE; Pg. A-6  	297 words  	President-elect Barack Obama's 3 million campaign volunteers got re-enlistment notices last week.LiNeBrEaKCampaign manager David Plouffe, in a mass e-mail sent Wednesday to former workers, asked how much time they can spare for four missions integral to Obama's effort to transform his victory into a broader political movement. LiNeBrEaKMr. Plouffe wrote that the volunteers' options are:LiNeBrEaK* Campaign for progressive state and local candidatesLiNeBrEaK* Undertake grass-roots local efforts to advance Mr. Obama's agendaLiNeBrEaK* Train others in Mr. Obama's organizing techniquesLiNeBrEaK* Focus on local political issues.LiNeBrEaK"Obama's building a political machine," said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, a center-left Washington research group.LiNeBrEaK"These people have just opened up a new world for politics," added Mr. Hess, the author of "What Do We Do Now?: A Workbook for the President-Elect."LiNeBrEaKPre-Internet presidents, he said, lacked the ability to communicate in real time with masses of their volunteers. In addition, the social networks such as MySpace and Facebook that link Mr. Obama's army together didn't exist.LiNeBrEaKThe net effect was that pre-Obama political machines grew out of local politics and remained rooted there. Statewide or presidential candidates relied largely on local leaders' support.LiNeBrEaKNot so Mr. Obama, who -- at least for now -- has the allegiance of thousands of volunteers in most if not all congressional districts.LiNeBrEaK"Your hard work built this movement," Mr. Plouffe wrote them. "Now, it's up to you to decide how we move forward."LiNeBrEaKHis four-page questionnaire also asks respondents to name their top-priority issues out of 27 listed. The options included environment and global warming, civil rights and voting rights, war in Iraq, jobs and trade, or divisive politics and partisanship.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Federal aid sought to limit emissions  		NEWS; Local; Pg. 2  	1480 words  	With various stimulus packages being proposed for banks, insurers, the auto industry and homeowners, the Conservation Law Foundation in Rhode Island has made yet another suggestion   it is calling on the state s congressional delegation to try to get federal dollars to shore up the state s battered infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKThe environmental advocacy group proposed that more than $116 million be earmarked for various specific projects ranging from sewer services to the state public bus fleet.LiNeBrEaK In these difficult times, it is essential that dollars dedicated to economic stimulus be wisely appropriated to most effectively create jobs, help residents and rebuild our economy and, at the same time, to solve   and not exacerbate   two of the most significant environmental problems facing our state and region: climate change and water pollution,  wrote Jerry Elmer, staff lawyer for the CLF s Rhode Island office.LiNeBrEaK To achieve these goals, we recommend that any economic stimulus package include serious investment in public transit, coupled with a fix-it-first policy of maintaining highway infrastructure, as well as needed projects to assist municipalities in protecting water quality. LiNeBrEaKCLF asked for:LiNeBrEaK $10. 8 million to prevent cutbacks in service by the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority.LiNeBrEaK $3. 9 million to buy 10 compressed natural gas buses for RIPTA. The buses emit 90 percent less particulate matter and 58 percent less oxides of nitrogen than conventional diesel buses.LiNeBrEaK $1. 4 million to continue for two years the summer ferry service between Providence and Newport.LiNeBrEaK $4. 96 million to provide diesel particulate filters for all 620 heavy and light-duty diesel vehicles in the state s fleet.LiNeBrEaK $784,000 to retrofit additional 98 municipal diesel garbage trucks and recycling vehicles.LiNeBrEaK $35. 95 million to help pay for Phase 1 of the state s combined sewer overflow construction project.LiNeBrEaK $59. 5 million to help pay for the tunnel pump station in the CSO project.LiNeBrEaKRinging the bell to reduce CO{-2}LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Scott A. Gunn announced that the tower bell of Christ Church, 1643 Lonsdale Ave., Lincoln, will ring out 350 times today at noon to support a healthier planet by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Scientists have said that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere need to be reduced to 350 parts per million to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Currently, carbon dioxide levels are approaching 390 and rising.LiNeBrEaKMr. Gunn directs interested persons to the Web site www. 350.org for information or call the church at (401) 725-1920.LiNeBrEaKAudubon Center offers programsLiNeBrEaKOn Friday , the Audubon Environmental Education Center, 1401 Hope St., Bristol, is offering day-after-Thanksgiving activities for families, including crafts, nature stores and animal interviews, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.LiNeBrEaKThey include a nature craft table, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; tide pool talk, 10: 30 a.m.; nature story, 11: 30 a.m.; owl presentation, 1: 30 p.m.; and nature story, 3 p.m.LiNeBrEaKPrograms, suitable for all ages, are free with admission.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   All Editions	One man's green 'nation';  Segway inventor's island sets example 	By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Wire Services  	NEWS; Pg. A09  	406 words  	MYSTIC, Conn. ? Energy independence is still only a hypothetical goal for the U.S., but the owner of a tiny island off the coast of Connecticut says he has already achieved that feat and is offering his work as a model. LiNeBrEaKDean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and numerous medical devices, jokingly refers to his North Dumpling Island as an independent nation and himself as Lord Dumpling. Kamen claims to have his own currency and offers visas to visitors to the tiny island a few miles from Mystic, where he is the only resident.LiNeBrEaKBut Kamen, who bought the 3-acre island in the 1980s as a retreat, is serious about energy independence and the lessons it offers at a time of volatile gas prices and fears about global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The rest of the world will eventually catch up if the Dumplonians can get their message out," he said.LiNeBrEaKKamen's energy plan began when the Coast Guard recently notified him that it was cutting off electrical service to the rocky island, part of New York State, because it was switching to solar energy to power a lighthouse.LiNeBrEaK"That can typically ruin your day," said Kamen.LiNeBrEaKThen he had an epiphany: Why not make the island energy self-sufficient and a showcase to the world.LiNeBrEaKKamen, a prolific inventor who has hundreds of patents, already had been working on energy conservation projects that he has introduced in poor countries.LiNeBrEaKHe also figured his island's timely new status could be used to draw attention to the annual high school robotics competition he created called FIRST, or For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology. Kamen believes that by getting children excited about science and technology, the robotics competition is creating a large pool of innovators who can eventually solve the world's energy crisis and other challenges.LiNeBrEaKKamen granted "visas" to representatives of a select group of corporate sponsors such as Wal-Mart and other companies, inviting them to North Dumpling Island to brainstorm about his plans for the island and how it could be used to raise awareness and money for his robotics competition.LiNeBrEaKVisitors arrived on a wind-swept day, with Kamen's wind turbine spinning a generator and solar panels facing the sky.LiNeBrEaKA replica of Stonehenge is lit up with LED lights that use less electricity than common incandescent light bulbs.LiNeBrEaKKamen says his island nation will distribute the technology he is demonstrating to poor countries.LiNeBrEaK"It will be part of our foreign aid program," Kamen says.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   All Editions	Massive glaciers discovered on Mars  	SPECIAL FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, Wire Services  	NEWS; Pg. A17  	301 words  	In a discovery that partly answers the question of where all the water went on Mars, scientists have found vast, debris-covered glaciers much nearer the equatorial region than anyone had expected, according to a report Friday in the journal Science. LiNeBrEaKThe glaciers, estimated to contain at least as much water as Lake Huron and possibly as much as the entire Great Lakes, were found by ground-penetrating radar on NASA?s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.LiNeBrEaK"We have found a big chunk of the missing water that people have known must be there," said Ali Safaeinili, a member of the radar team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge, Calif.LiNeBrEaKScientists analyzing Martian topography have seen lots of evidence of water-caused erosion on the planet, but until now the only deposits of ice have been seen at the poles. One of the glaciers has been estimated as being the size of Los Angeles and as much as half a mile thick.LiNeBrEaKHow did the ice get there? The best guess, said John W. Holt, a researcher for the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas, is that climate change was brought on by changes in Mars? rotational axis over time. Because Mars doesn?t have a large moon to keep its axis relatively stable, as the Earth does, the planet can tilt dramatically, redistributing the sun?s heat and energy and shifting the poles around.LiNeBrEaKThese icy deposits may have lain hidden in their current state as long as 200 million years, Holt said.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery wasn?t a complete surprise. Scientists had previously noticed rocky debris "aprons" that seemed to flow away from steep hills as if something underground was lubricating their movements. But there was no proof what was going on until the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter?s Italian-built radar confirmed the presence of large ice structures.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   All Editions	Plankton's death bloom a warning on warming oceans;  Climate change may threaten migratory animals 	By DAVID PERLMAN, SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, Wire Services  	NEWS; Pg. A20  	390 words  	Vanishing Arctic sea ice brought on by climate change is causing the crucially important microscopic marine plants called phytoplankton to bloom explosively and die away as never before, a phenomenon that is likely to create havoc among migratory creatures that rely on the ocean for food, Stanford scientists have found. LiNeBrEaKA few organisms may benefit from this disruption of the Arctic?s fragile ecology, but a variety of animals, from gray whales to seabirds, will suffer, said Stanford biological oceanographer Kevin Arrigo.LiNeBrEaK"It?s all a question of timing," Arrigo said. "If migratory animals reach the Arctic and find the phytoplankton?s gone, they?ll have missed the boat."LiNeBrEaKPhytoplankton throughout the world?s oceans is the crucial nutrient at the base of the food web on which all marine life depends; when it?s plentiful, life thrives, and when it?s gone, marine life is impossible.LiNeBrEaKArrigo and his colleagues gathered 10 years of observations from six NASA satellites to study changes in the evidence of chlorophyll ? a key to measuring the annual abundance and disappearance of phytoplankton blooms ? at the surface of the oceans. The satellite network has also recorded the yearly appearance and disappearance of vast expanses of sea ice and the increasing areas of open ocean all around the Arctic, an indication of how climate change is taking hold in the northern reaches of the globe.LiNeBrEaKA report of their findings is to appear in the current issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters.LiNeBrEaKThe annual deep freeze that has covered much of the northern seas with ice around the polar regions was once a regular event, but what has been normal for millennia in the High Arctic is no longer the case. As global climate change has warmed the world?s oceans, warmer water has moved into the frigid Arctic, causing changes in the once-regular appearance and disappearance of sea ice over vast areas.LiNeBrEaKThe result is a shift in when explosive blooms of phytoplankton appear and disappear, Arrigo?s team has found.LiNeBrEaK"It?s a complex system," Arrigo said in an interview, "but as the changes in ice cover throw the timing of phytoplankton abundance off, then the birds and animals whose brains have long been programmed to migrate north at specific times of the year will have missed the boat if there?s no nourishment for them when they get there."

Richmond Times - Dispatch (Virginia)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Debating pros, cons of ethanol  	Rex Springston, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	484 words  	Nov. 23--Green Dinneen Ethanol represents a national boon, or a delusion.LiNeBrEaKThose are the competing views of Bob Dinneen, president and chief executive officer of the Renewable Fuels Association, an industry group, and Kenneth P. Green, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank. LiNeBrEaKWhat are some economic impacts of ethanol?LiNeBrEaKDinneen: An ethanol-making plant like the one opening in Hopewell should add $150 million to $200 million to the local economy in income to farmers, grain haulers, plant workers and others.LiNeBrEaK"It's a real economic development engine."LiNeBrEaKGreen: Ethanol benefits from significant government supports, including a tariff that keeps a lot of cheaper ethanol from entering the U.S.LiNeBrEaK"Ethanol is bad because it raises the cost of energy when you don't need to."LiNeBrEaKDinneen: "There is no energy market anyplace in the world that is without some kind of government support, including gasoline. . . . That's because energy is too important to the economies of every country on the globe."LiNeBrEaKThe Hopewell plant will make ethanol from barley. The vast majority of ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn. What's the difference?LiNeBrEaKGreen: Ethanol from barley is probably less harmful to the environment than corn, because it would require less fertilizer and pesticides.LiNeBrEaKBut growing barley for ethanol would mean putting more land under the plow.LiNeBrEaK"Farming is terrible for the environment. You basically level ecosystems. You wipe out all the animals that live there. You poison half the insects that live there that fertilize other plants."LiNeBrEaKGases such as carbon dioxide trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming, experts say. How is ethanol involved?LiNeBrEaKDinneen: Ethanol's greenhouse-gas emissions are 30 percent lower than those of gasoline.LiNeBrEaKThat's because the source of ethanol -- whether it's barley, corn or some other crop -- removes carbon dioxide from the air when it's growing.LiNeBrEaK(Carbon dioxide returns to the air when the ethanol is burned in cars and when farm equipment burns fuel to tend the crop, among other ways.)LiNeBrEaK"Ethanol is the only liquid transportation fuel that we have today that has any kind of a greenhouse-gas benefit."LiNeBrEaKGreen: The tilling of land -- particularly new land -- for ethanol crops releases carbon dioxide from the soil.LiNeBrEaK"You are going to have to displace an awful lot of gasoline sales" to overcome that initial carbon release, and that could take decades.LiNeBrEaKContact Rex Springston at (804) 649-6453 or rspringston@timesdispatch.com	BIOFUELS (91%); ALCOHOLS (90%); ETHANOL (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (77%); AGRICULTURAL INCOME (77%); AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); MISC GRAIN FARMING (75%); FERTILIZERS (75%); FACTORY WORKERS (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (71%); PESTICIDES (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (63%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%); AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH (58%)  			General  		VIRGINIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Richmond Times - Dispatch   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081123-RV-Debating-pros-cons-of-ethanol-1123  	RV

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	Debating pros, cons of ethanol  	REX SPRINGSTON; Times-Dispatch Staff Writer  	AREA/STATE; Pg. A-12  	410 words  	Ethanol represents a national boon, or a delusion.LiNeBrEaK Those are the competing views of Bob Dinneen, president and chief executive officer of the Renewable Fuels Association, an industry group, and Kenneth P. Green, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank. LiNeBrEaK What are some economic impacts of ethanol?LiNeBrEaK Dinneen: An ethanol-making plant like the one opening in Hopewell should add $150 million to $200 million to the local economy in income to farmers, grain haulers, plant workers and others.LiNeBrEaK "It's a real economic development engine."LiNeBrEaK Green: Ethanol benefits from significant government supports, including a tariff that keeps a lot of cheaper ethanol from entering the U.S.LiNeBrEaK "Ethanol is bad because it raises the cost of energy when you don't need to."LiNeBrEaK Dinneen: "There is no energy market anyplace in the world that is without some kind of government support, including gasoline.... That's because energy is too important to the economies of every country on the globe."LiNeBrEaK The Hopewell plant will make ethanol from barley. The vast majority of ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn. What's the difference?LiNeBrEaK Green: Ethanol from barley is probably less harmful to the environment than corn, because it would require less fertilizer and pesticides.LiNeBrEaK But growing barley for ethanol would mean putting more land under the plow.LiNeBrEaK "Farming is terrible for the environment. You basically level ecosystems. You wipe out all the animals that live there. You poison half the insects that live there that fertilize other plants."LiNeBrEaK Gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming, experts say. How is ethanol involved?LiNeBrEaK Dinneen: Ethanol's greenhouse-gas emissions are 30 percent lower than those of gasoline.LiNeBrEaK That's because the source of ethanol - whether it's barley, corn or some other crop - removes carbon dioxide from the air when it's growing.LiNeBrEaK (Carbon dioxide returns to the air when the ethanol is burned in cars and when farm equipment burns fuel to tend the crop, among other ways.)LiNeBrEaK "Ethanol is the only liquid transportation fuel that we have today that has any kind of a greenhouse-gas benefit."LiNeBrEaK Green: The tilling of land - particularly new land - for ethanol crops releases carbon dioxide from the soil.LiNeBrEaK "You are going to have to displace an awful lot of gasoline sales" to overcome that initial carbon release, and that could take decades.LiNeBrEaKContact Rex Springston atLiNeBrEaK(804) 649-6453 or rspringston@timesdispatch.com	BIOFUELS (91%); ALCOHOLS (90%); ETHANOL (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); INTERVIEWS (78%); AGRICULTURAL INCOME (77%); CLIMATOLOGY (77%); MISC GRAIN FARMING (76%); AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT (76%); FERTILIZERS (76%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); FACTORY WORKERS (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (71%); PESTICIDES (71%); GLOBAL WARMING (63%) FUEL; BUSINESS; TECHNOLOGY; INTERVIEW  	AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH (58%)  					VIRGINIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 27, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Richmond Newspapers, Inc.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	575 words  	Nov. 23--Surveys of Californians find them in a bleak mood -- and no wonder.LiNeBrEaKNot only is the economy in a tailspin -- with the unemployment topping 8 percent -- but even those with jobs find home equities and retirement accounts melting away.LiNeBrEaKThe state budget deficit grows by the hour, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislators are stuck in a familiar no-action rut. Budget woes probably mean sharp cuts in school funds, thus postponing indefinitely a much-needed overhaul of education, as well as erosion of the safety net for the poor -- and/or heavy new taxes. LiNeBrEaKWe face a third dry winter with reservoirs already at record low levels, and the budget stalemate is surpassed only by gridlock on water. And then there are those wildfires.LiNeBrEaKWhen California goes through a bad patch, out-of-state media gleefully pounce on the theme that the Golden State is fatally tarnished.LiNeBrEaKWe saw many such print media and video pieces in the early 1990s, when the end of the Cold War clobbered defense industries and we had the worst recession in 60 years. And we saw them again a decade later when the dot-com bubble burst.LiNeBrEaKNow, not surprisingly, we're seeing them again. "Sundown for California" is the title of a lengthy essay on the state's economic, cultural and political problems in The American magazine, penned by trendmeister Joel Kotkin.LiNeBrEaKNoting that he wrote a book in the 1980s about the state's ascendancy to global influence, Kotkin contends that "today, our Golden State appears headed, if not for imminent disaster, then toward an unanticipated, maddening, and largely unnecessary mediocrity."LiNeBrEaKKotkin is especially critical of Schwarzenegger who, he says, "never understood the economic rot undermining the state," i.e. the erosion of its manufacturing and trade sectors and "the danger of the state's growing reliance on the real estate bubble." Instead, Kotkin says, Schwarzenegger "preened for the local and national media by making California the focal point for addressing global climate change."LiNeBrEaKIt's tempting to dismiss Kotkin's screed as another gratuitous poke at California that will reverberate in other media. This, however, was not written by someone from New York or Washington who sees California as an exotic foreign locale, but by someone who lives in and knows the state well. And for the most part, he's spot-on, as the British say.LiNeBrEaKThis downturn has a fundamentally more serious air than those of the past. The social, economic and political forces Kotkin cites are very ominous. We are in deep trouble on a variety of fronts and overarching everything is that we have, consciously or unconsciously, rendered ourselves functionally ungovernable -- chronically unable to address the economic and social ills that plague us.LiNeBrEaKThis could be the beginning of sundown in California, particularly if we stick our heads in the sand and pretend, as Schwarzenegger often does, that everything will turn out OK just because we're in California.LiNeBrEaKIt won't.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Dan Walters, (916) 321-1195.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FINAL Edition	No country for old men  		Op-Ed; EDITORIALS; Pg. G10  	676 words  	If you doubt Washington can change, ask John Dingell. After 53 years in the House, he was dumped as chairman of a congressional committee that sets energy, environmental and health policy - pretty much the political world these days.LiNeBrEaKDingell, a Detroit-area Democrat, was brought down by another longtimer and fellow Democrat, Henry Waxman from Los Angeles. Both are liberal old bulls who've drawn wink-and-nudge labels such as aggressive, fierce and hard-charging, suggesting each can be Godzilla with a gavel.LiNeBrEaKBut put aside the personal drama. The changeover carries the message that heads are rolling as the Obama army approaches. Waxman saw this opportunity and moved quickly, lining up House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who played a restrained but deliberate role in removing Dingell, who's crossed her in the past.  LiNeBrEaKThe list of implications is long. Detroit carmakers, more than ever, are on life support with the loss of a loyal protector. Their plea for a $25 billion bailout got a definite maybe from skeptical Congress last week. Without Dingell to guard against major policy changes, the path is cleared for the Obama agenda on climate change, alternative fuels and high-mileage mandates. LiNeBrEaK And, via Waxman, California finally may have its way on setting tailpipe emissions and mileage rules after enduring opposition from the Michigan congressman and the Bush White House. LiNeBrEaKThe foot-dragging from Washington has undercut state ambitions to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2020. The countersurge from this coast will match Waxman with Sen. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who heads that chamber's panel that deals with the environment. Never has this state ever had such a powerful one-two punch on the topic.LiNeBrEaKAlso, the lockstep seniority system can be bucked. As Waxman, who's represented the west side of Los Angeles since 1974, said, "Seniority is important, but it should not be a grant of property rights." LiNeBrEaKHis win, by majority vote of House Democrats, puts him in command of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which Dingell ran for 28 years. The panel's purview sounds like an Obama campaign brochure: global warming, energy policy and health care.LiNeBrEaKAs chairman, Waxman controls the flow of bills on these topics in an overwhelmingly Democratic House. In his prior committee posts, as head of panels dealing with government oversight and health, Waxman lashed out at tobacco firms, drugmakers and Bush policymakers.LiNeBrEaK His ascension to his new chairmanship drew showers of praise from environmentalists hungering for the House to follow through on Obama campaign promises. But it also drew doubts from Dingell supporters who feel the liberal West Coast-er will ride roughshod over the wishes of more moderate America.LiNeBrEaKOn issues such as health policy, the two representatives had parallel records. It was on clean air controls for coal-burning power plants and the fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks where key differences lay. Washington had blocked California's plans for tailpipe and mileage laws that aimed at curbing smog and greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKDetroit complained that the engine redesigns were costly and should be imposed nationwide, not by individual states. In practical terms, this meant no change would result because carmakers and business allies had veto power in the lawmaking process in Washington. LiNeBrEaKBeginning with concern about climate change and culminating with Obama's victory, this old political formula has fractured. Waxman's win could signal other changes in Washington's power circles as the landscape continues to shift. LiNeBrEaKIn the Senate, Democrats gently ousted 91-year old West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd as head of the weighty Appropriations Committee. Another mighty oak, Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska and the longest-serving Republican in Senate history, lost a re-election bid after a corruption conviction. LiNeBrEaKOf this batch, the Waxman-Dingell standoff was the plainest battlefield test of opposing forces. Now it's time to see how a new team in the White House matches up with a rearranged lineup on Capitol Hill.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FINAL Edition	Bonds blasting deer, not baseballs  	Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross  	Metro; MATIER and ROSS; Pg. B1  	957 words  	Barry Bonds has put down his bat and picked up a gun in his new role as spokesman for Christensen Arms, a munitions company that specializes in high-powered hunting rifles.LiNeBrEaK"It gets your blood pumping," a camouflage-clad Bonds says as he stares through the scope of a 300 Ultra Mac rifle in a seven-minute info-video for the company.LiNeBrEaKThe video shows baseball's all-time home-run leader hunting down a whitetail deer in an alfalfa field three hours north of Edmonton, Alberta. LiNeBrEaKThe video, which has a heart-thumping soundtrack, goes dark just before you hear a single rifle blast.LiNeBrEaKThe words "To be continued" then flash onto the screen.LiNeBrEaKAn accompanying Web photo, however, gives away the ending - showing a smiling Bonds crouching behind his trophy kill along with the quote, "One blast is all it took." LiNeBrEaK"I just want to tell everyone at Christensen Arms thanks for building such a tremendous rifle," the ex-Giant says in the Web text that accompanies the video. "Keep up the great work, and God bless."LiNeBrEaKAnd, in fact, Bonds is quite the hunter.LiNeBrEaKWhen a federal grand jury in San Francisco indicted Bonds last year on perjury and obstruction of justice charges for allegedly lying about steroids use, Bonds wasn't around - he was off hunting in Colorado.LiNeBrEaKFeel free to check out the video for yourself, at christensenarms. com. LiNeBrEaKPower play: The toppling of longtime Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the political equivalent of a 9. 8 earthquake - and it was set off thanks to the efforts of Bay Area lawmakers.LiNeBrEaK"It's something that only happens maybe once every 50 years," said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, one of the key players in the coup that ousted Dingell and replaced him with fellow California Democrat Henry Waxman of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKEshoo, who is on the panel, makes no bones about her role in turning Dingell out. "For the past 10 years, he has been driving this committee with the emergency brake on," Eshoo said, pointing to his reluctance to take on such issues as global warming, fuel-economy standards and health care reform.LiNeBrEaKOver the last few months, Eshoo along with Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez - with the apparent blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco - worked to get the votes for the play.LiNeBrEaK"And California was the first out of the gate with the votes," Eshoo said.LiNeBrEaKGreen day: Downstairs at San Francisco City Hall, Mayor Gavin Newsom was bathing in the glow of TV lights as he expounded on the wonders of electric-powered green cars.LiNeBrEaKUpstairs, there was another meeting between Newsom's chief of staff, Steve Kawa, and about 30 labor leaders, who were told that the shortage of civic green - as in, greenbacks - would mean either sizable contract givebacks or sizable layoffs of city workers.LiNeBrEaKThe irony of the simultaneous good news-bad news meetings was not lost on the assembled leaders. Newsom's absence from the bad news meeting wasn't lost on them, either.LiNeBrEaKBig splash: Not all things go better with Coke.LiNeBrEaKThe soda giant and the San Francisco Giants have been ordered to pay $185,000 to Terree Roush of Fresno - the woman we told you about last year who broke her ankle during a tumble down the 56-foot-long "Guzzler" Coke bottle slide at ATandT Park.LiNeBrEaK A San Francisco jury came back with the award Wednesday.LiNeBrEaK The 53-year-old Roush sued Coca Cola Co., the Giants and the slide's manufacturer, claiming negligence.LiNeBrEaK"Now it's a public fact," said Roush's attorney, Fred Meis.LiNeBrEaKGiants general counsel Jack Bair said the team is "considering our options" in light of the jury's finding, but maintained that the slide is safe - as evidenced by the millions of rides enjoyed by fans since the ballpark opened in 2000. LiNeBrEaKLabor RX: Political consultant turned real estate magnate Clint Reilly played host to more than 300 supporters of embattled health care workers union leader SalRosselli the other night.LiNeBrEaKSome $200,000 was raised at the event to help Rosselli's fight to retain control of the 150,000-member union from a takeover by national union boss Andy Stern.LiNeBrEaKThose who filled the Julia Morgan Ballroom atop Reilly's Merchants Exchange Building in San Francisco included former Supervisor Angela Alioto, former state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, current Supervisors Aaron Peskin and Ross Mirkarimi, incoming Supervisor Eric Mar and state Sen.-to-be Mark Leno.LiNeBrEaKJust about every union leader in the city was there as well, including sign painters union head Mike Hardeman, firefighters union chief John Hanley and teachers union boss Dennis Kelly.LiNeBrEaKA bevy of political consultants showed up, too, including Newsom's adviser Eric Jaye - who got his start in the business working for Reilly. LiNeBrEaK"This is one of the most active and democratic unions in the state," said Reilly. "And a lot of people here want to make sure it stays that way."LiNeBrEaKGoing once, twice ... : It's tough times everywhere - even at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, where they're auctioning off the office art to help boost cash reserves.LiNeBrEaK "Ships Sailing in the San Francisco Bay with Fort Point in the Distance," by turn-of-the-century artist William Alexander Coulter, has hung in the chamber's boardroom for decades. Now it's set to go on the block Monday at Bonhams and Butterfields, with a minimum asking price of $150,000.LiNeBrEaKThe chamber inherited the Coulter piece from the old Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. sometime in the 1960s, and has since been carrying the artwork on its books as a cash asset.LiNeBrEaK"If we can change it to a liquid asset that the chamber can put to better use, I say, 'Why not?' " said chamber President Steve Falk. LiNeBrEaK Besides, he says, for sailing buffs who might be interested in buying it, "It's a great piece - it's one of a kind."LiNeBrEaKEXTRA!

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Scientists find answer to Mars water riddle  		NEWS; Pg. 007  	208 words  	In a discovery that partly answers the question of where all the water went on Mars, scientists have found vast, debris-covered glaciers much nearer the equatorial region than anyone had expected, according to a report yesterday in the journal Science. LiNeBrEaKThe glaciers, estimated to contain at least as much water as Lake Huron and possibly as much as the entire Great Lakes, were found by ground-penetrating radar on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.LiNeBrEaK"We have found a big chunk of the missing water that people have known must be there," said Ali Safaeinili, a member of the radar team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge, Calif.LiNeBrEaKScientists analyzing Martian topography have seen lots of evidence of water-caused erosion on the planet, but until now the only deposits of ice have been seen at the poles.LiNeBrEaKHow did the ice get there? The best guess, said John W. Holt, a researcher for the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas, is that climate change was brought on by changes in Mars' rotational axis over time.LiNeBrEaKBecause Mars doesn't have a large moon to keep its axis relatively stable, as the Earth does, the planet can tilt dramatically, redistributing the sun's heat and energy and shifting the poles around.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	OBAMA ENERGY POLICY: CURE FOR OIL ADDICTION?  	ASJYLYN LODER, Times Staff Writer  	BUSINESS; Pg. 1D  	1043 words  	The election silenced the cries of "Drill, baby, drill." Plunging oil prices have stilled the hand wringing over energy security. With all eyes on the economy, veterans of past oil shocks may wonder if Americans will once again forget about weening the nation off suddenly cheap oil.LiNeBrEaKThis time, though, looks different. LiNeBrEaKNearly 30 states, including Florida, are forging plans to boost renewable energy and slash greenhouse gases. Business leaders nationwide have called for a clear, nationwide policy. A political consensus has emerged in Washington that something must be done.LiNeBrEaK"We go from shock to trance," President-elect Barack Obama said in an interview with 60 Minutes that aired last Sunday night. "... Prices go back down, and suddenly we act like it's not important, and we start, you know, filling up our SUVs again. And, as a consequence, we never make any progress. It's part of the addiction, all right. That has to be broken. Now is the time to break it."LiNeBrEaKIn the span of two years and one election cycle, the dramatic remaking of energy policy has gone from long odds to a near certainty. Once the luxury we couldn't afford, it's now billed as the opportunity we can't afford to miss.LiNeBrEaK"All of us who are paying attention and watched this election believe that we will have federal renewable-energy legislation," said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. "I actually believe it will be one of the first things that move, because I believe it will be part of a larger energy and economic stimulus package, because it will promote green industry and green jobs."LiNeBrEaK"It may be a little harder, politically," Obama told 60 Minutes, "but it's more important."LiNeBrEaKThe business lobby, once a reliably monolithic opponent to clean-energy rules, has fragmented. Where some businesses still flatly oppose climate legislation, some have shifted gears to support "reasonable" goals. Others, like Florida Crystals, have joined forces with the environmental community in calling for strong renewable targets.LiNeBrEaK"The traditional stereotype was that the business community opposes policies that would cap greenhouse gas emissions. That doesn't exist anymore," said Susan Glickman, the southern region director for the Climate Group, which works with Fortune 500 companies like IBM, Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola to build an economic case for taking action against the greenhouse gases believed to cause climate change.LiNeBrEaKOrganizations like the U.S. Climate Action Partnership and the Chicago Climate Exchange have already engaged willing businesses in efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Solar and wind companies have forged powerful lobbies in states with strong renewable targets, like Texas, New Jersey and Colorado. Large banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup earlier this year established the first "carbon principles" to help measure the risks companies face from climate change and climate legislation.LiNeBrEaKEven the chairman of Chevron, one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, supports a clear and realistic policy on carbon dioxide, the gas believed to cause climate change. Instead of debating whether the United States should regulate greenhouse gases, the debate now centers on how deep the cuts should be.LiNeBrEaK"Getting certainty in policy and certainty in carbon costs is a real positive for everybody," said David Parker, a utility analyst with Robert W. Baird in Tampa. "If Obama can bring some certainty to energy policy in the U.S., I don't necessarily see it as a negative, and I don't think the markets do, either."LiNeBrEaKThe promise of new investment and "green" jobs has a powerful attraction, especially in Florida. Unemployment has risen to 7 percent. Construction and manufacturing workers have been especially hard hit.LiNeBrEaKObama's energy plan calls for the creation of 5-million jobs through an investment of $150-billion over the next decade. Military veterans would get job training under his "Green Vet" initiative. America's idle manufacturing workers will go back to work building wind turbines, hybrid cars and solar panels, he promised. Carpenters, plumbers and electricians will retrofit homes to be more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaKOne study estimated that Florida could create more than 120,000 new jobs by investing in clean energy.LiNeBrEaKGov. Charlie Crist last year launched Florida's efforts to control carbon. He called for the state's utilities to get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy by 2020 and proposed a carbon cap-and-trade system to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKNot everyone sees what Crist has called the "gold in green."LiNeBrEaKBarney Bishop, president and chief executive of Associated Industries of Florida, a business lobbying group that has strongly opposed carbon caps, derided green jobs as a "fantasy." He pointed to a study from the National Association of Manufacturers that said carbon cap legislation could cost Florida up to 117,000 jobs, result in a loss of $11-billion in gross state product by 2020, and decrease Florida's household income by $3,000 a year. The study predicted that electric rates would increase 135 percent by 2030.LiNeBrEaKReducing carbon emissions will cost Floridians money, Bishop said. "Anybody that thinks otherwise is on some pretty good drugs."LiNeBrEaKBishop, though, is a realist. He doesn't believe there's much of a climate crisis. Even if he did believe in global warming - and he's not saying he does - he's not sure that industry's carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	WE CAN MEET ENERGY CHALLENGES  		PERSPECTIVE; YOUR LETTERS; Pg. 2P  	1173 words  	Working together on energy solutions - Nov. 19, commentaryLiNeBrEaKGov. Crist is absolutely correct when he points out the very real economic and job-creation benefits that the state and country can reap from proactive, sound policies to tackle the pressing issue of climate change.LiNeBrEaKA quick glance at China shows what can be achieved. China's share of global solar power capacity climbed from just 1 percent in 2003 to 35 percent in 2007. In the process, the country created an industry worth $12. 9-billion. The more than 400 solar companies employ more than 300,000 people.LiNeBrEaKGov. Crist also correctly outlined the need for partnerships to realize the full potential, not only between states but between business and government. A report recently published by the Climate Group estimated that the information, communications and technology industry could deliver solutions that would enable other business sectors and customers to achieve global reductions in annual man-made emissions of 15 percent by 2020 - with energy efficiency savings worth more than $946. 5-billion worldwide.LiNeBrEaKIt will take clear and consistent policies to unlock this potential. We at the Climate Group are delighted that President-elect Barack Obama has stated his commitment to such policies - and that he will invest $15-billion each year to catalyze private sector efforts to build a clean-energy future. LiNeBrEaKThe challenge will be to ensure that Congress gives the president the support he needs to move this important issue forward - and this includes representatives from here in Florida.LiNeBrEaKSusan Glickman, U.S. Southern regional director, the Climate Group, Indian Rocks BeachLiNeBrEaKThe ethanol problemLiNeBrEaKThe Times recently reported that Florida's university professors are leaving the state due to budget shortfalls. It also reported that the state will subsidize ethanol again this year.LiNeBrEaKEthanol is expensive to produce, lowers gas mileage, requires large amounts of fresh water, is an inefficient conversion of energy, increases food costs, destroys rainforests, pollutes the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, and increases our dependency on imported gasoline.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Exxon Mobil paid $31-billion in federal income taxes. The company paid billions more in payroll, state and sales taxes ($171-billion in total), while shareholders paid additional taxes on dividends. This revenue stayed in the United States.LiNeBrEaKFederal and state governments should be encouraging businesses to develop more, not less, U.S. petroleum and natural gas products and using the fees and taxes generated to develop new, long-range sources of nonpetroleum energy.LiNeBrEaKInvestments in alternative energy sources should be limited, however, to sources where the long-term cost/benefit ratio is positive. Wind, solar, ethanol and other alternative energy sources must eventually prove competitive with oil and gas to justify taxpayer subsidies.LiNeBrEaKOur legislators should encourage university professors to stay in Florida with ground-breaking grant opportunities to develop and profit from alternative energy sources. Ethanol and other alternative energy subsidies that cannot pass the cost/benefit test are counterproductive to our state and national goals.LiNeBrEaKTerrence Stapleton, Tarpon SpringsLiNeBrEaKD.C. tenure tussle may hold lesson for nationNov. 16, Bill Maxwell columnLiNeBrEaKA kick when they're downLiNeBrEaKI strongly disagree with Bill Maxwell's opening in which he states that public school teachers have their eyes on Washington, but not because of Barack Obama's coming inauguration. In fact, Mr. Maxwell, I find it bewildering that you have yet to comment on this historic election. I can tell you that as a Pinellas County school teacher and a proud liberal, I strongly supported Sen. Obama's campaign, as did most of my colleagues. We were thrilled that he was elected, and not just because of his educational platform.LiNeBrEaKI believe that chancellor Michelle Rhee has good intentions and wants to improve the D.C. public schools. I know that the conditions of most D.C. schools are abysmal.LiNeBrEaKBut take a look at your own community before you start making sweeping statements about incompetent teachers. Pinellas County teachers are working without a contract. The elementary teachers are besieged with constant assessment requirements and pacing guides. The middle school teachers report high stress levels and low morale as a result of the seven-period school day. No pay increase is likely and our health insurance is going up. Many of us work second jobs just to keep the lights on at home.LiNeBrEaKI have worked in Pinellas County since 1987. Sure I can come up with an anecdote here and there about incompetent teachers I've seen. And I've seen some bad ones get the heave-ho too. But their numbers pale beside the number of heroically dedicated, creative, good-hearted teachers I've worked with or known through my daughter's school journey.LiNeBrEaKSo have a heart, Mr. Maxwell. Seems to me that your column is kicking folks when they're down.LiNeBrEaKMaryellen Mariani, SeminoleLiNeBrEaKAnts and God and us - Nov. 16, PerspectiveLiNeBrEaKThe human factorLiNeBrEaKI am not familiar with the specific data Edward Wilson refers to, but to state that there is genetic predisposition to altruism is premature to say the least. The only way to prove genetic determination is to demonstrate that a certain gene or group of genes encode a number of proteins that determine human behavior. This demonstration exists only for certain specific diseases (for example predisposition to certain cancers, neurological or mental diseases). At most Wilson can say that certain genes are more or less prevalent in altruistic people. An association at most generates hypotheses for other studies, but it is in no way a proof of causation.LiNeBrEaKSecond, even if we grant that altruism is genetically determined, like eye and hair color, this does not mean the end of free will. The way every individual becomes aware of his or her personal talents and decides to use them is still a scientific mystery.LiNeBrEaKI may agree with Wilson that faith and religion is a product of human evolution, but does that disprove the existence of a God? If anything, the evolutionary nature of religious beliefs shows that they express the most intellectually sophisticated achievements of humanity.LiNeBrEaKLodovico Balducci, professor of oncology and medicine, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, TampaLiNeBrEaKHistory will size up Bush - Nov. 16, commentaryLiNeBrEaKBush is no TrumanLiNeBrEaKLet me be among the many who will criticize the rather positive article on President Bush's performance. First of all, the comparison with President Truman is equivocal, as Truman was contending with the onset of the massive Cold War with Soviet Russia and Communist China, which he handled with reasonable competence.LiNeBrEaKBush created his problems in Iraq first and then the economy. His only excuse was the 9/11 terrorist attack which, unfortunately, made him a pseudo-war president and allowed him to do whatever he desired at home and abroad until the disastrous results became apparent.

The Sunday Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Sunrise Edition	Tree-sitters: Remote sits prove to be less effective  	LARRY BINGHAM, The Oregonian  	Sunday Features (O!)  	1586 words  	Remote sits proveLiNeBrEaKto be less effectiveLiNeBrEaKOut of the woods, back in the limelightLiNeBrEaKTree-sitters climb up with a new mind-set and refocused target --'urban sits'LiNeBrEaKLARRY BINGHAMLiNeBrEaKWhere have all the tree-sitters gone?LiNeBrEaKThe acts of civil disobedience that were such a publicized part of the Northwest "timber wars" of the 1980s and '90s have tapered off. There are still tree sits every now and then, but they are not as frequent as they were. It's been six years, in fact, since a group made front-page news when they camped 30 miles from Portland in the Mount Hood National Forest to protest the Eagle Creek timber sale. The U.S. Forest Service eventually canceled the disputed logging contract, but not because of the protest, and one of the sitters, a 22-year-old woman, fell 150 feet from a tree perch soon after the cancellation and died.LiNeBrEaKIf a recent event in Salem is any indication, tree-sitting might be staging a comeback, albeit in a form tweaked to address a new mind-set and a never-ending news cycle.LiNeBrEaKWho sits in a tree these days, and why do it? LiNeBrEaKTo find out, come to the steps of the state Capitol, where 200 people gathered for a Nov. 14 rally carrying signs that said "We Speak for the Trees" and "Don't Underestimate Heat."LiNeBrEaKTree-sitters still protest logging, as they did in years past, though global warming has replaced the spotted owl. The most recent sit aimed to stir opposition to the Bureau of Land Management's "Western Oregon Plan Revisions," an increase in logging proposal that opponents have nicknamed "The WOPR."LiNeBrEaKTree-sitters still represent radical environmental groups and tend to be young people in their 20s. They still face trespassing charges and are still glorified by some people and scorned by others.LiNeBrEaKAt the Salem rally, "radical cheerleaders," young women in neon-pink satin jackets, rainbow-striped knee socks and zebra-print miniskirts, shouted chants like this one to whip up the crowd: "If you think our trees are neat, let us hear you stomp your feet."LiNeBrEaKThe cheerleaders then led the protesters across the grounds to the base of a towering pine. Everyone looked up at a wooden platform 50 feet above, and when a face appeared from under a vinyl tarp, the crowd cheered.LiNeBrEaK"Give that woman a medal, not a ticket!" someone shouted.LiNeBrEaKThe tree-sitter, a University of Oregon senior who had lived on the 5-by 10- foot platform for the past 81 hours, began her descent. She rappelled down a rope, a 22-year-old with a Pippi Longstocking braid, as the crowd moved to congratulate her.LiNeBrEaKSomeone on the ground smoked a clove cigarette. Someone else banged a drum. Oregon State Police stood nearby in case trouble erupted. One trooper removed a folded citation from his pocket to hand the tree-sitter as soon as her feet touched the ground.LiNeBrEaKSuch a scene used to be more commonplace, when tree-sitters were cause celebres, heroes or hippies depending on your views. Julia "Butterfly" Hill lived in a California redwood she named "Luna" for two years. Convicted arsonist Michael Scarpitti, who called himself Tre Arrow, climbed onto a ledge at the U.S. Forest Service headquarters in Portland in 2000 and is now serving prison time for two fire bombings.LiNeBrEaKThe only sitters you hear about with any regularity are the ones on the University of California campus at Berkeley. And even the tree-sitters there, four young men trying to save an oak grove from becoming a sports training facility for student athletes, came down in September.LiNeBrEaK* When the radical advocacy group Cascadia Rising Tide decided two months ago to stage a tree-sit, it turned to one of its own for advice --The Lorax.LiNeBrEaKAnthony Villagomez, 28, a part-time arborist who also works in a used bookstore, borrowed the name from Dr. Seuss during an urban sit in Hood River, where he lives. One of the goals was to draw the attention of children.LiNeBrEaKAs a veteran, Villagomez has organized and participated in a dozen Northwest sits and says they fell off after Sept. 11, when anyone who climbed a tree was labeled an "eco-terrorist."LiNeBrEaKHe told the group that remote sits are no longer effective: The media today is too busy feeding an insatiable Internet appetite to trek deep into a forest for a single story.LiNeBrEaKSuccessful contemporary sits take place in urban settings, where the media is near and the sitter can cut out the middle man and take the message directly to passersby. Another advantage of the urban sit is that it puts a face on the issue, he says, and it's safer than sitting in a tree marked to be chopped down.LiNeBrEaKVillagomez offered practical advice, too, explaining the three kinds of platforms: the standard one used in Salem; the kind that circles a tree so loggers or police can't climb up and extract the sitter; and the most dangerous, the "dunk 'em" platform, where supports can't be disabled without putting the sitter at risk.LiNeBrEaKDespite the risks, or because of the risks, Villagomez thinks sits will never go away. "As a tactic in the toolbox . . . it shows the public you are willing to step outside your comfort zone for something you believe in," he says. "You are willing to risk your life for it."LiNeBrEaKOne reason sits may have declined is that the U.S. Forest Service manages in a "more ecosystem-frame of mind" these days, says Rick Acosta, spokesman for the Mount Hood National Forest. "We still harvest timber in the national forest, but we do it in a collaborative way, whether it's reducing fuels or improving aquatic habitat, and still produce some boards."LiNeBrEaKCollaboration has brought about some unusual partnerships, like one in the Clackamas County River district, where the environmental group BARK is working alongside county leaders, the forest service and loggers during a thinning project.LiNeBrEaKAt the American Forest Resource Council, president Tom Partin says he thinks the number of sits may have dropped because the industry evolved. Though logging is still controversial, fewer acres are being logged and new logging techniques "leave a lighter touch" on the land. "Some of their concerns," he says, "are just not out there anymore."LiNeBrEaKPartin also thinks the issue itself isn't viewed the way it once was. "With what's happening to the economy and with energy, it's not a top-tier issue anymore," he says. "I don't remember having a tree-sitter for a couple of years. The people who were doing it 15 years ago understand that moderation is better. You still have a few young zealots out there who were born 15 or 20 years too late."LiNeBrEaK* Dark, rainy, no one aroundLiNeBrEaKIt was 3: 30 Tuesday morning when Jasmine Zimmer-Stucky pulled up behind the Capitol.LiNeBrEaKShe had gone on a scouting mission days earlier and chosen a western white pine that offered high visibility and low branches for easy climbing.LiNeBrEaKAs she walked across the grounds, she heard weird noises --phantom cell phone rings, police sirens and church bells --that turned out to be her imagination.LiNeBrEaKShe threw ropes into the tree and pulleyed up the platform. Then came supplies: food and water, sleeping bag and pillow, a 5-gallon bucket to act as a toilet and a 5-gallon bucket of sawdust to compost the waste.LiNeBrEaKThe first thing she did when daylight arrived was call her parents and tell them what she'd done. She grew up in Salem, in a house of liberal Democrats, and both parents served on the Salem City Council. Her mom lobbied for seniors and people with disabilities in the state Capitol for years, and Zimmer-Stucky participates in the abortion rights movement at the University of Oregon campus.LiNeBrEaKBut she knew she was breaking the law when she climbed the tree.LiNeBrEaKHer dad sighed that "Oh-Jasmine-what-have-you-done" sigh when she told him, she would say later.LiNeBrEaKThen he asked: Do you need anything?LiNeBrEaKFrom Tuesday morning until Friday afternoon, she stayed on the platform. She slept under a waterproof bag, wrote in her journal, doodled, napped and talked to people who stopped below, calling, "Hello, down there!"LiNeBrEaKThe cops came by. So did old friends, her seventh-grade teacher with a card signed by the class, even a girl she used to baby-sit. Zimmer-Stucky wrote down the name of everyone who visited so she could send a thank-you note later.LiNeBrEaKShe waved to honking cars, did radio interviews with conservative talk-show hosts who mocked her, read Marc Acito's "How I Paid for College: A Novel of Sex, Theft, Friendship and Musical Theater," awoke when the wind whipped the tarp and endured a group of detractors throwing water balloons.LiNeBrEaKWhat went through her mind was the message she wanted to convey. "My main concern is we would go out there and be misunderstood," she would say later. "People would think we were just angry crazy radicals --far, far left --and punks, which is not the case at all. We are very dedicated and very educated people who care very much about this issue."LiNeBrEaKWhen she came down at last, she gave a short speech on the steps of the Capitol. She told the crowd she would always remember "the trains running along 12th Street all hours of the night, the feeling of the wet tarp that occasionally dropped water on my face when I was sleeping, the feel of the bark with the bright-green lichen, and the soft five-needle bundles that helped protect me from the wind."LiNeBrEaKAfter the rally, she walked inside and delivered to the governor's office a stack of postcards in opposition to the BLM's logging plan. Only time will tell if the proposal becomes practice.LiNeBrEaKEven if it does, she will never know with any real certainty if sitting in the tree for a few days had an effect one way or the other. She thinks it did. She hopes so.LiNeBrEaKLarry Bingham: 503-221-8262; larrybingham@news.oregonian.com	PROTESTS and DEMONSTRATIONS (90%); FORESTRY and LOGGING (90%); LOGGING INDUSTRY (89%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (78%); WOMEN (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (73%); LAND USE PLANNING (72%); FORESTRY and LOGGING TRADE (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); TRESPASSING (63%); CRIMINAL TRESPASS (63%)  	OUT OF THE WOODS MARKETING (58%); EAGLE CREEK (56%)  	FOREST SERVICE (56%)  				SALEM, OR, USA (71%); PORTLAND, OR, USA (56%) OREGON, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Sunday Oregonian All Rights Reserved  																
The Sunday Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Sunrise Edition	Explorer with a cause to take on Poles, Everest  	PAT GRAHAM, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  	Sports; Pg. D04  	1236 words  	SUMMARY: Eric Larsen will try to do it all in a year, putting a spotlight on global warmingLiNeBrEaKExplorer with a cause to take on Poles, EverestLiNeBrEaKPAT GRAHAMLiNeBrEaKThe prospect of encountering polar bears, cracking ice and frostbite doesn't horrify Arctic explorer Eric Larsen.LiNeBrEaKNeither does going nearly 60 days without a shower.LiNeBrEaKPutting up with team members who chew with their mouths open?LiNeBrEaKThat's a hardship he doesn't want to handle when he attempts to ski to the North and South Poles and climb Mount Everest --all within 365 days. LiNeBrEaKLarsen says the trio of endeavors has never been accomplished in one year. To improve his chances of success he's assembled a crack crew: explorers who won't wither in whiteouts, won't panic if they fall through thin ice into bone-chilling water, won't munch too loudly on energy bars.LiNeBrEaK"Imagine 60 days with somebody who chews with their mouth open or snores," Larsen said, smiling. "When you're stuck in a tent, scared, hungry and cold, it's easy to see the bad side come out."LiNeBrEaKLarsen's adventure will begin when he heads for the South Pole with Hernan Maquieira in November 2009. Next up will be the North Pole with Darcy St. Laurent, Mark Wood and Lisa Strom.LiNeBrEaKFor the Mount Everest excursion, he's enlisted Aron Ralston, the mountaineer renowned for amputating his right arm with a dull blade in 2003 after it was pinned by a half-ton boulder at the bottom of a canyon in Utah.LiNeBrEaKRalston said that ordeal has made him a more focused climber --and person.LiNeBrEaKTrauma a "blessing"LiNeBrEaK"This trauma has turned into such a blessing for me in my life," said Ralston, who gives motivational speeches between rafting trips and climbing expeditions. "It's been the biggest miracle of my life. It's the transformation of my life --from being this fun-seeking kid in my 20s, my life and happiness all built around my self-centered desires. Now, my fulfillment comes from causes."LiNeBrEaKLarsen's undertaking fits that description. He wants to raise awareness of global warming and the effects it's having on melting ice caps.LiNeBrEaKHis motto? Think snow.LiNeBrEaKHis mission? Saving the last frozen places left on the planet.LiNeBrEaKLarsen isn't content with just trekking to the world's top, bottom and highest summit. He wants to film and blog about every frozen step. He's bringing video cameras, digital recorders, satellite phones, a Palm Pilot and a computer, which will help him tell his tale --and add 25 pounds to his load.LiNeBrEaK"I feel like the job of an explorer in the 21st century is not going out to conquer these places but protecting them and telling a story," Larsen said. "They are going to be forever changed unless we act now."LiNeBrEaKPutting his plan in motion will cost nearly $750,000, and Larsen is still scrambling to find backing in a troubled economy.LiNeBrEaKThe adventure will start at the South Pole with Maquieira, an Argentinian-born explorer who lives in Switzerland. Each will pull a sled loaded with 300 pounds of food, fuel and supplies on a journey across nearly 733 miles of tortured ice that Larsen predicts could take up to 65 days.LiNeBrEaKAntarctica is home to some of the nastiest conditions on the planet. Even though it will be summer there, temperatures of minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit and wind gusts of 100 mph await.LiNeBrEaKThe biggest fear is frostbite to the face, fingers and toes. That and going crazy while wandering into whiteouts.LiNeBrEaKSo, how does an explorer prepare for such vast whiteness?LiNeBrEaK"Sit in a bathtub full of ice and stare at a white sheet of paper for 10 hours, that would help," said Larsen, who hopes to have reached the South Pole by January 2010. "You can ultimately never really prepare."LiNeBrEaKBut he can get ready for the physical demands. Larsen has been dragging tires hooked up to a harness down a gravel road to simulate pulling a sled. He used to get stares in his small town of Grand Marais, Minn.LiNeBrEaKNot anymore.LiNeBrEaK"People used to think, 'That guy is weird.' Now, they just wave," Larsen said.LiNeBrEaKStalked by polar bearLiNeBrEaKAfter all, this isn't his first extreme adventure. He's already reached the North Pole, falling through cracks in the ice and coming dangerously close to an encounter with a polar bear.LiNeBrEaK"He was stalking me," said Larsen, whose partner fired a flare to scare the bear away. "That was a nerve-racking experience."LiNeBrEaKNow he's headed back.LiNeBrEaKLarsen will make his return to the North Pole some time around the end of February 2010 to begin a nearly 550-mile trek with Wood, a former member of the British Army turned outdoor guide; St. Laurent, a search-and-rescue technician from Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Strom, a dogsled and Arctic guide.LiNeBrEaK"I'm going through scenarios and possible obstacles in my mind, and I am thinking about the trip every day," Strom said in an e-mail from Sweden. "How it will be, how the weather will treat us, how difficult will it get and so on."LiNeBrEaKA few hazards are certain: the risk of hypothermia, heavy fog that makes navigating a challenge and those pesky polar bears.LiNeBrEaKThen there's the drifting ice. Unlike the South Pole, which is on a continent, the North Pole is reached by crossing the frozen ice of the Arctic Ocean. The shifting ice can make the journey much longer. Larsen had to scrap a trip to the North Pole in 2005 because his group traveled for two weeks and ended up farther south than where they started.LiNeBrEaKA year later, starting from a different point, he succeeded in crossing the ice and reaching the North Pole.LiNeBrEaKLarsen and his brigade will leave from a similar spot in the vicinity of northern Ellesmere Island, weaving their way toward the North Pole, going to bed each night hoping the ice doesn't crack underneath their tent. They're hoping to be across by early May 2010.LiNeBrEaKTo pass the lonely hours, Larsen will bring an iPod loaded with music like Modest Mouse, U2 and Death Cab for Cutie. He may even download some language lessons, learning Spanish along the way.LiNeBrEaK"Why not? I've got the time," he said.LiNeBrEaKBoth polar expeditions will be unsupported, meaning help is a long helicopter ride away.LiNeBrEaKThat's why Larsen carefully chose his team members, making them fill out a 50-question survey to see how they handle stress and solve problems.LiNeBrEaKMake a decision --fastLiNeBrEaK"Whether you live or die depends on how well you can communicate and cooperate," Larsen said. "On Day 45, you can't be arguing about where the tent should go. You need to be able to make a decision quickly --someone might have fallen through the ice and be soaked and need to get in the tent now."LiNeBrEaKThe last stage of his journey will be to Mount Everest. If everything goes as planned, that leg should begin in September 2010 and end in late October.LiNeBrEaKRalston was recruited as a guide because of his mountaineering experience. The two recently climbed a peak in Argentina, and another just outside of Aspen, Colo.LiNeBrEaK"He's a great travel companion --very safety conscious, very levelheaded," Larsen said.LiNeBrEaKTrustworthy. Steady. Reliable.LiNeBrEaKThat's Ralston these days. He's careful and cautious on his climbs.LiNeBrEaKAll because of those days spent trapped in the desert, pinned by the boulder.LiNeBrEaKRalston retells his tale quite often, recruited by corporations to give motivational speeches about his harrowing ordeal. He's currently turning his book, "Between a Rock and a Hard Place," into a docudrama.LiNeBrEaK"What I've found is that in situations of acute awareness, you really appreciate your life more," Ralston said.LiNeBrEaKLarsen has learned similar lessons from his Arctic explorations.LiNeBrEaKNot to mention gaining an appreciation for people who don't chew with their mouths open.

LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has offered only scattered clues as to where he stands on the most pressing public lands and endangered species issues.LiNeBrEaKIn reading the tea leaves, however, environmental groups are optimistic, timber industry and land-rights groups are wary, and an influential lawmaker is excited about having an ally in the White House.LiNeBrEaK"This guy is a quick study and I'm sure he will find competent people," said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who as chairman of a House Appropriations interior subcommittee oversees nearly $28 billion in annual funding for the Interior Department, the U.S. Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. "We will be able to work with him. Anything will be better than Bush."LiNeBrEaKWhen it comes to the environment, Obama has focused his attention almost exclusively on global warming and clean energy. There are few references on his campaign Web site to on-the-ground issues, especially those specific to the West.LiNeBrEaKObama received an 86 out of a possible 100 in the environmental scorecard for members of Congress published by the League of Conservation Voters. He was also a co-sponsor of a bill that would have protected about 58 million acres of federal lands. The Bush administration had sought to open up those roadless lands to development.LiNeBrEaKAsked about public lands and endangered species issues, Tommy Vietor, an Obama transition spokesman, said, "President-elect Obama believes there is only one president at a time, and thus isn't commenting on many of these issues at this time."LiNeBrEaKEven so, some hints about where Obama is coming from can be gleaned from those reviewing natural resource and environmental issues during the transition.LiNeBrEaKDan Hayes, who is leading the effort at the departments of Interior and Energy, is a former deputy interior secretary in the Clinton administration who has a background in water and greenhouse gas issues. John Leshy is a former Interior Department solicitor who has ties to one of the most ardent environmentalists on Capitol Hill, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think Barack Obama has done a lot of thinking about endangered species and forest issues," said Bill Arthur, a deputy national field director for the Sierra Club based in Seattle. "That's not his job. What is important is who he appoints around him."LiNeBrEaKArthur said there have been encouraging signs from members of the transition team who have indicated an Obama administration would reverse Bush administration initiatives and bar mountaintop-removal mining in Appalachia and block oil and gas leasing in southern Utah's Red Rock area.LiNeBrEaKAnother Bush initiative that almost certainly will face scrutiny is a rule that would allow individual federal agencies to decide whether their actions violated the Endangered Species Act, rather than consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the act.LiNeBrEaKBudgets trimmedLiNeBrEaKThe new administration also faces more fundamental issues. The budgets of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service have been sharply trimmed in recent years. The Forest Service budget has been sliced by a third, while at the same time more than half its budget is now spent in the fight against catastrophic wildfires.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama indicated his administration would "aggressively pursue" a fire prevention, mitigation and land and forest management plan to reduce fire risks.LiNeBrEaKThe Forest Service manages almost 200 million acres across the country.LiNeBrEaK"It's a very anxious time," said Forest Service Chief Gail Kimbell. "But I think the Forest Service is well prepared to take on the issues the Obama campaign has been discussing."LiNeBrEaKKimbell acknowledged that budget issues, particularly the firefighting costs, have taken a toll. But she said the Forest Service is well aware that climate change has created an extended drought that has stressed trees and left them susceptible to such things as the mountain bark beetle. That has led to a fire season that lasts from January to November.LiNeBrEaKDead and dying trees should be removed and the forests thinned, even if that means felling some of the older trees, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change has hit us with the increased severity of wildfire and the cost of fighting them," Kimbell said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are hopeful the new administration will reverse what they see as eight years of setback after setback.LiNeBrEaK"I am 54 years old and I have actively worked on environmental issues for 25 years," Arthur said. "I'm not naive or myopic. There will always be some cold showers when it comes to these issues. But I see an administration coming in that believes change is not just needed, it is vital."LiNeBrEaKTimber industry uncertainLiNeBrEaKLands-rights groups say they'll be watching the new administration closely.LiNeBrEaK"So far he has picked Clinton administration people for his transition team and I don't think that bodes well for us," said Chuck Cushman, who heads the American Land Rights Association based in Battle Ground, Wash. "We could have our work cut out for us."LiNeBrEaKThe timber industry also is uncertain how it will fare under the Obama administration. However, Tom Partin, who heads the American Forest Resource Council in Portland said that the industry should work with Obama, especially on forest health issues.LiNeBrEaKAs the Montana primary approached in May, Obama, in perhaps his most succinct statement on public lands issues, answered questions from the Flathead Beacon newspaper in Kalispell.LiNeBrEaKHe said he believed that sustainability --using resources in a way that provides for the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs --was the most important factor in managing federal lands.

The Times West Virginian (Fairmont, Virginia)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Snowy winter ahead: Local experts say winters stay pretty constant in area  	Mike Bowen, The Times West Virginian, Fairmont  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1015 words  	Nov. 23--FAIRMONT -- Its something we hear about nearly every day.LiNeBrEaKIs the weather really changing or, as many put it, getting warmer?LiNeBrEaKIt comes in many different forms, from commercials and lectures to movies by former vice presidents, but global warming is on the lips of nearly everyone.LiNeBrEaKThis year typified those thoughts as 60- and 70-degree days in late November had some thinking winter would never arrive. LiNeBrEaKBut cold weather did, as always, and brought with it snow and Marion County school children's first snow day of the school year last week.LiNeBrEaKIs the area's weather really changing?LiNeBrEaKFairmont street director Joe Feltz is someone who keeps a close eye on the weather.LiNeBrEaKIt's his job to send out the city's fleet of salt and cinder trucks when the snow and ice start to threaten.LiNeBrEaK"What we do when we're getting ready to make our cinder and salt purchases is go back and look at weather in the previous years," Feltz said. "We look at the storms in the last five years or so, and we buy our supplies based off of that.LiNeBrEaK"It's stayed pretty much the same," Feltz said of the city's orders for salt and cinders. "We haven't seen a lot of change."LiNeBrEaKMike Roncone, Marion County supervisor for the state Division of Highways, said that when deciding on how much salt and cinders are needed, they like to base it on what the division used the previous year. Future weather forecasts still remain a factor, but the load has been pretty constant for the past few years.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the latest technology, the DOH uses to study weather patterns and analyze previous year's data, Roncone pointed to the Old Farmer's Almanac as predicting a bad winter.LiNeBrEaK"Let's put it this way, last year was a mild winter," Roncone said. "But we still have to treat the roads if we have an inch of snow or a foot. The almanac says this is going to be a bad year. We'll just have to wait and see what happens."LiNeBrEaKThe Farmer's Almanac predicts an "exceptionally cold December with above normal snowfall" over the course of the winter.LiNeBrEaK"We've been busy already," Roncone said about the area's recent winter weather. "We've been running three shifts now for about a week and will continue to run three throughout the winter."LiNeBrEaKWest Virginia might not be in danger of being inundated by rising seas because of melting polar ice caps like some scientists warn some coastal cities may face down the road. But just because the state is landlocked doesn't mean that it is immune from the effects.LiNeBrEaKScientists define global warming as an overall increase in world temperatures, which may be caused by heat being trapped by greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKBut where has that left the area?LiNeBrEaKAccording to billing statements from Dominion Hope, the company that supplies most North Central West Virginias with natural gas, the average temperatures per month have gone up slightly from 2006 to 2008.LiNeBrEaKMeteorologists from Accuweather agree.LiNeBrEaK"It looks like temperatures are slowly turning upward across the U.S. as a whole," said a meteorologist from Accuweather.com. "There hasn't been any extreme shifts in either direction, but instead a gradual increase over the past several years."LiNeBrEaKAccuweather, established in 1962, bills itself as the world's weather authority. It provides local forecasts for everywhere in the United States and more than 2 million locations worldwide. Its headquarters in State College, Pa., is home to the greatest number of forecast meteorologists in one location anywhere in the world.LiNeBrEaK"I get an updated forecast online, so I know what to expect in the next few days," Feltz said. "We try to leave nothing to luck, that's our motto around here. We're on call to Dec. 6, so whenever it starts to get bad, we get out to treat the streets."LiNeBrEaKDecember of 2007 showed a vast rise in temperatures in the area. During the second week of the month, the surrounding areas were drenched by a huge rainstorm that caused a mass of flooding in Marion County only to see snow fly within a week.LiNeBrEaKIf you're looking for proof on rising temperatures in the school system, you won't find it.LiNeBrEaKEach one of West Virginia's 55 counties have a limited number of "snow days" built into the curriculum.LiNeBrEaKSchool is called off for a variety of reasons during the winter months not just because of snow. Icy roads as well as extremely cold temperatures are also culprits in giving area children the day at home.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Marion County exceeded the allotted snow days by early January. By state law, school cannot begin before Aug. 26 or be in session beyond June 10.LiNeBrEaKBecause the allotted days were used up early, four "out of school environment days" had to be spent getting children into the classroom to make up for the missed days.LiNeBrEaKThe school system already experienced its first cancellation of classes Nov. 18.LiNeBrEaKWest Virginia's ski resorts have reported plenty of early snow and cold temperatures already this year.LiNeBrEaKIn previous years, the resorts usually don't open until after Thanksgiving. But this year Snowshoe Mountain opened the season on Friday, Nov. 22, after getting 31 inches of snow recently.LiNeBrEaKSpokeswoman Laura Parquette said the resort has seen more snow already this year than some resorts saw all of last season.LiNeBrEaKThe reality is West Virginia is a temperate state with hot summers and cold winters. While the overall average temperatures may be creeping up as the years go by, it's hard to tell.LiNeBrEaK"In the last several years, we've had the freak snowstorms that wiped us out, but in reality, it's pretty much unchanged," Feltz said. "Other than the snow last October, we've been pretty quiet on getting hit early."LiNeBrEaKAnd what's forecast for the coming week?LiNeBrEaKYou guessed it ... cold with plenty of chances for snow.LiNeBrEaKE-mail Mike Bowen at mbowen@timeswv.com	WEATHER (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (77%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (70%)  				General  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (56%)  	WEST VIRGINIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081123-TF-Snowy-winter-ahead-1123  	TF  													
The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Climate change affects forest: Conference studies peril, potential for profit in Adirondack Park  	Brian Nearing, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1034 words  	Nov. 23--TUPPER LAKE -- What if we looked at the Adirondacks as more than just a 6-million-acre forest? What if we also viewed it as a kind of living factory in the fight against global warming, a mechanism capable of sucking up tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every day?LiNeBrEaKIn an era increasingly defined by the search for ways to control carbon, how much is the Adirondack region worth to the state, the nation or even the planet? And could that value somehow turn into cash that both protects the forest and supports the people who live there? LiNeBrEaKThose were among the questions raised at a conference last week on how climate change is altering the Adirondacks. More than 190 people crowded into The Wild Center, a natural history museum devoted to the region, to hear about both challenges and solutions.LiNeBrEaK"It is easy to get gloomy. Our landscape is at risk," said Jerry Jenkins, a Washington County botanist who co-authored an Adirondack climate report released by the center and the Wildlife Conservation Society.LiNeBrEaK"The Adirondacks are warmer and wetter, with longer springs and falls and shorter winters. We have new birds, less snow, different seasons and colors, new diseases," said Jenkins, who has studied climate change for more than 20 years. "Thus far, these are not threatening. If the climate models are right, the warning signs of larger changes could be very threatening."LiNeBrEaKThe Adirondacks are the southernmost outpost of a colder boreal climate found in Canada, Jenkins said. It is winter that is receding most rapidly, with average winter temperature rinsing 5 degrees over the past century -- more than double the rise in spring and summer temperatures.LiNeBrEaKFrosts arriving a week later in the fall and departing a week earlier in the spring have added some two weeks to the growing season, said Tom Tucker, whose family has farmed since the 1860s in Gabriels, Franklin County, a hamlet about 20 miles north of Lake Placid.LiNeBrEaKEven if CO2 emissions are brought down now, global temperatures will rise, up to another 6 degrees by the end of the century because of a lag in climatic systems. A hotter Adirondacks might not be helpful to Tucker's signature potato crop, which prefers cool temperatures.LiNeBrEaKEven the best scenario will bring the Adirondacks a climate more akin to the mountains of West Virginia, and lead to severe declines in classic Adirondack trees like hemlock, white pine, sugar maple and white ash, Jenkins said. During the winter, the number of days with snow cover will be cut by a third to a half.LiNeBrEaKIf emissions keep climbing unchecked, temperatures could jump by 8 to 11 degrees -- moving the Adirondacks into the temperature zones currently found in the North Carolina mountains, or even the highlands of northern Georgia.LiNeBrEaKThat could leave only the highest Adirondack peaks with traces of snow, ending the region's tradition of winter sports like skiing, ice climbing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. Iconic animals like the moose and loon would retreat north, and up to half of Adirondack forest species of trees, plants, animals and insects could gradually disappear.LiNeBrEaK"We have to do all that we can to limit the change to 6 degrees or less," Jenkins said.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the Adirondack region is doing a bit to preserve itself. As trees grow, they take in CO2 like a sponge, producing growth trapping carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere. An acre of forest, depending on its age, can sequester up a little more than a ton of CO2 a year.LiNeBrEaKThat means the Adirondacks each year store about 7 million tons of CO2. While that sounds like a lot, it's just 3 percent of the 200 million tons emitted each year by New York state.LiNeBrEaKStill, it is an invaluable service that cannot be duplicated mechanically. On a per-acre basis, the Adirondack Park is among the nation's five largest carbon "sinks," areas where CO2 is absorbed rather than emitted, according to a conference report issued by Colin Beier, a researcher at State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, and Dan Spada, natural resources analysis supervisor with the Adirondack Park Agency.LiNeBrEaK"We are wrestling with this: How does the forest owner, the forest industry, get paid for the carbon that they sequester? That is hard," said Ross Whaley, co-chairman of The Wild Center conference. Whaley served as chairman of the Adirondack Park Agency during the Pataki administration, and now represents the Adirondack Landowners Association. About half of the land within the park is privately owned.LiNeBrEaKFurther complicating this is the concept called "additionality," which Whaley explained as the idea that any theoretical value of forest carbon sequestration should reflect only the additional CO2 absorbed by the forest each year, and not the long-term carbon that has already been locked into the trees.LiNeBrEaKWhaley said the state could offer financial incentives, possibly in the form of tax breaks, for forest owners who manage their property to contain carbon.LiNeBrEaKAnd forests also must be looked at as a resource for replacing fossil fuels when possible. Harvesting some trees for use as locally-used heating fuel, a concept known as biomass, could actually result in a net reduction of CO2 by reducing the need for higher-carbon oil or electric heat, especially if more-efficient centralized heating systems that use pellets or wood chips could service more densely-populated hamlets.LiNeBrEaKThe average Adirondack resident emits about 17. 5 tons of CO2 annually, mostly through heating or vehicle travel over the huge park. While that is less than the national CO2 per capita average of 23. 6 tons, primarily due to a lack of industry in the park, it is still more than the average person in Germany (12. 3 tons) or France (8. 7 tons).

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	Warm, wet winter predicted  	SUSAN HYLTON World Staff Writer  	News; Pg. A3  	325 words  	Tulsa and much of the four-state region are probably in store for a warmer- and wetter-than-normal winter this year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. How sure are they? About 50 percent sure for the warmer temperatures and about 40 percent sure for the above-average precipitation.  LiNeBrEaKBut before hope springs eternal that Tulsa will be spared another ice storm, think again. More precipitation and higher temperatures can result in a higher possibility of "freezing-rain situations," said forecaster Glenn Wiley of the National Weather Service in Tulsa. It's the colder temperatures that create snow. But milder temperatures overall on more days from December through February, coupled with reduced fuel costs, may spell lower heating bills, which doesn't disappoint anyone. Deputy Director Michael Halpert of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center said the predictions are based on an extensive system of computer models, statistical tools and trends. While the prediction does include great variability, the four-state region Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas does appear to be the hot and wet spot on the agency's three-month outlook. In other areas of the country, there is only a 33. 3 and 17 percent probability of warmer and wetter winters than average. Halpert said the minimum increase would be 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit for the average winter temperature. Tulsa's average winter temperature is 39. 3 degrees. The increased winter precipitation would be something more than 5. 98 inches, which is the average in Tulsa. Halpert said El Ni&Atilde;&plusmn;o and La Ni&Atilde;&plusmn;a conditions are not present in the Pacific Ocean, which allows scientists to use water temperatures to gauge climate trends. "So there's a lot of variability, but when it's all said and done, the middle of the country has the greatest likelihood of experiencing greater-than- average temperatures," Halpert said.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Final Home Edition	Misleading photo  		Opinion; Pg. G2  	261 words  	Recently, the Tulsa World carried a press release photo of a smokestack releasing big quantities of black smoke and steam. The accompanying article implied that this had something to do with carbon dioxide and global warming ("Permit for coal plant blocked," Nov. 14). The fact is carbon dioxide is invisible. Take a look at you breath. You are exhaling carbon dioxide. It is not black. And it is not harmful. In fact, it is essential to all plant and animal life. Smokestack emissions from coal-fired power plants consist of soot, oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur and mercury vapor as well as carbon dioxide. Soot is the black particulate matter derived from incomplete combustion of coal. Oxides of nitrogen are reddish gases and very corrosive. Oxides of sulfur are colorless and are the raw material for sulfuric acid which we use in our automobile batteries. Mercury vapor is colorless and very toxic when inhaled.

More precipitation and higher temperatures can result in a higher possibility of "freezing-rain situations," said forecaster Glenn Wiley of the National Weather Service in Tulsa.LiNeBrEaKIt's the colder temperatures that create snow.LiNeBrEaKBut milder temperatures overall on more days from December through February, coupled with reduced fuel costs, may spell lower heating bills, which doesn't disappoint anyone.LiNeBrEaKDeputy Director Michael Halpert of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center said the predictions are based on an extensive system of computer models, statistical tools and trends.LiNeBrEaKWhile the prediction does include great variability, the four-state region -- Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas -- does appear to be the hot and wet spot on the agency's three-month outlook. In other areasLiNeBrEaKof the country, there is only a 33. 3 and 17 percent probability of warmer and wetter winters than average.LiNeBrEaKHalpert said the minimum increase would be 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit for the average winter temperature. Tulsa's average winter temperature is 39. 3 degrees.LiNeBrEaKThe increased winter precipitation would be something more than 5. 98 inches, which is the average in Tulsa.LiNeBrEaKHalpert said El Nino and La Nina conditions are not present in the Pacific Ocean, which allows scientists to use water temperatures to gauge climate trends.LiNeBrEaK"So there's a lot of variability, but when it's all said and done, the middle of the country has the greatest likelihood of experiencing greater-than- average temperatures," Halpert said.LiNeBrEaKSusan Hylton 581-8381LiNeBrEaKsusan.hylton@tulsaworld.com	WEATHER (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); TRENDS (89%); OCEANOGRAPHY (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); EL NINO and LA NINA (77%); CLIMATOLOGY (77%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (63%)  	NATIONAL OCEANIC and ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (84%)  		Energy  		TULSA, OK, USA (94%) OKLAHOMA, USA (97%); ARKANSAS, USA (79%); MISSOURI, USA (79%); PACIFIC OCEAN (78%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Tulsa World   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081123-TU-Warm-wet-winter-predicted-1123  	TU  													
The Washington Post 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Bulldog Edition	'Living Shoreline' May Stall Erosion  	Garry Mitchell; Associated Press  	A-SECTION; Pg. A20  	644 words  	 Crews keep building high sand barriers to protect this fragile strip of land from erosion, and nature keeps washing them away,  as  when Hurricane Gustav in September erased a 10-foot-tall berm, a wall of sand that stretched for more than three miles.LiNeBrEaKNow marine scientists are turning to nature itself as the solution in an experiment to mend eroded shorelines. LiNeBrEaKBy planting tons of oyster shells to form angular breakwaters near Dauphin Island, they hope to show that aquatic life drawn to the shells can create a "living shoreline," preventing coastal erosion better than do ugly bulkheads, blunt seawalls or feeble berms that inevitably have to be rebuilt.LiNeBrEaK"Bulkheads are horrible, and people build them out of ignorance," said Just Cebrian, who is directing the project at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab.LiNeBrEaKScientists in a growing number of states are pursuing living shorelines where once they might have watched or even helped as walls were built to hold back the sea.LiNeBrEaKNorth Carolina has had more than 30 demonstration projects, including some using oyster shells. Virginia, Maryland and Delaware have been requiring alternatives to bulkheads and seawalls for some time. Projects also have been completed in Pensacola, Fla., and Biloxi, Miss.LiNeBrEaK"The issue is certainly gaining traction," said Tracy Skrabal of Wilmington, N.C., regional manager for the North Carolina Coastal Federation.LiNeBrEaKTaxpayers are funding the Sea Lab's living shoreline project with a $1. 5 million fisheries restoration grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005.LiNeBrEaKThat is less than half the price of the recently demolished berm, built in 2005 with sand pumped from Mississippi Sound. That $3. 6 million barrier replaced a $1 million version that was damaged by Tropical Storm Isidore in 2002. That first sand wall had been completed in June 2000 as an emergency project initiated after Hurricane Georges in 1998.LiNeBrEaKThese man-made fixes are necessary in part because of man's interference, according to a 2007 U.S. Geological Survey report, which blamed dredging along with storms and rising sea levels for carving away at barrier islands.LiNeBrEaKThe Army Corps of Engineers dredged a 45-foot-deep shipping channel through the mouth of Mobile Bay, past Dauphin Island. While port officials discount the dredging's impact, the channel -- a necessity for the nation's 10th-largest port -- interrupted the westward drift of sand that otherwise would naturally replenish Dauphin Island.LiNeBrEaKThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said recently that officials have not  decided whether to replace the latest berm.LiNeBrEaKBulkheads and seawalls hold back damaging waves, but they also tend to alter or destroy natural habitat, according to scientists advocating the living shoreline option. Bulkhead walls create a "bathtub effect" that eliminates fringe wetlands and shallows that harbor young fish that move into the Gulf of Mexico, said Scott Douglass, a University of South Alabama coastal engineer.LiNeBrEaKSea Lab scientists said oyster shells placed in brackish waters with good tidal flow will rapidly become colonized by a multitude of marine creatures, including oysters, algae, worms, barnacles, crabs, small minnows and fish.LiNeBrEaKCarl Ferraro, a natural resource planner with the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, said the living shorelines technique cannot  be used in some spots.LiNeBrEaK"It won't generally work in very deep water where you have a significant drop right at the shoreline," he said.LiNeBrEaKIt is also impractical for certain commercial or industrial settings where a bulkhead would be required because of deep water, Ferraro said.LiNeBrEaKStill, scientists are eager to try it most everywhere else.LiNeBrEaK"All resources agencies would like to see folks starting to use living shorelines," Ferraro said.

The Washington Post 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Bulldog Edition	Rushed Regulations;  Agencies ignore a White House deadline on rule changes. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06  	471 words  	ACKNOWLEDGING "the historical tendency of administrations to increase regulatory activity in their final months," White House Chief of Staff  Joshua B. Bolten issued a directive to federal agencies in May to release any final regulations before Nov. 1. The administration billed this as a bit of "good government." We would agree, were it not for new rules with broad implications that continue to churn their way to adoption long after Mr. Bolten's    deadline. LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department wants to revise the application of the Endangered Species Act. The Environmental Protection Agency wants to do the same  with the Clean Air Act. If what's being proposed goes through,  air quality in and around national parks, and threatened plant and animal species, would be imperiled. President-elect Barack Obama might be saddled withLiNeBrEaKpolicies that run counter to his environmental vision.LiNeBrEaKInterior's action on the Endangered Species Act was the result of listing the polar bear in May as "threatened" under that law  because of climate change. The statute was never intended to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet and melting the Arctic ice habitat of polar bears. So Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne proposed stripping the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and other agencies of their roles in consulting with federal departments on building projects that are "likely to adversely affect" a listed species. The rationale that their experience complying with the Endangered Species Act gives agencies enough expertise to determine for themselves whether a project is likely to harm a species, not just polar bears, is flawed. Without those protective services in the consultative loop, there will be no check against the ambitions of agencies that want to complete projects -- and no safeguard for threatened and endangered species in the agencies' path.LiNeBrEaKOver at the EPA, construction of coal-fired power plants and other polluting facilities  would be allowed  near national parks and wilderness areas under a revised method of measuring air quality, according to documents  obtained by Post writer Juliet  Eilperin. This most certainly could lead to more plants spewing more pollutants, clouding the air and degrading the parks. Ms.  Eilperin also reported that there is vigorous resistance among EPA regional administrators to this change.LiNeBrEaKWhich brings us back to Mr. Bolten. In his May directive, Mr. Bolten noted that exceptions would be made to the Nov. 1 deadline in "extraordinary circumstances," which were not defined. Given that neither the EPA's nor the Interior Department's rule change is needed for the  continued functioning of the republic for the next 60 days,  Mr. Bolten should hold true to his good-government instincts and order the EPA and Interior to stand down.

The Washington Post 	November 23, 2008 Sunday   Bulldog Edition	Energy Dept. Wants To Cut Short Research On Carbon Dioxide;  Project Aims to Predict Effects of Warming 	Jeff Barnard; Associated Press  	A-SECTION; Pg. A10  	797 words  	For more than a decade, the federal government has spent millions of dollars pumping elevated levels of carbon dioxide into small groups of trees to test how forests will respond to global warming in the next 50 years.LiNeBrEaKSome scientists believe they are on the cusp of receiving key results from the time-consuming experiments.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Energy, however, which is funding the project, has told the scientists to chop down the trees, collect the data and move on to new research. That plan has upset some researchers who have spent years trying to understand how forests may help stave off global warming and who want to keep the project going for at least a couple of more years. LiNeBrEaK"There has been an investment in these experiments, and it's a shame we are going to walk away from that investment," said William Chameides, an atmospheric scientist at Duke University, where one of the experimental forests is located. "There is no question that ultimately we want to cut the trees down and analyze the soil. The question is whether now is the time to do it."LiNeBrEaKRonald Neilson, a U.S. Forest Service bio-climatologist in Corvallis, Ore., said the experiments should continue because they still have potential to answer key questions about how rainfall and fertility affect how much carbon a forest will store long-term -- essential to understanding how forests may soften the blow of climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut the Energy Department, following the advice of a specially convened panel of experts, believes that chopping down the trees and digging up the soil will allow the first real measurements of how much carbon the leaves, branches, trunks and roots have been storing, said J. Michael Kuperberg, a program manager with the agency.LiNeBrEaKEnding the experiments will also allow the funding to be devoted to new research that will look at the effects of higher temperatures, changes in rainfall, and variations in soil fertility, Kuperberg said.LiNeBrEaK"What we are trying to do here is balance the time to get optimal results out of the existing experiment with our desire for a new generation of experiments that we feel is more likely to realistically represent future climate scenarios," Kuperberg said.LiNeBrEaKThe research program, Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE), consists of rings of tall white plastic pipes with holes along their length that emit once-liquefied carbon dioxide in carefully metered doses. The loblolly pines planted in 1994 at Duke in North Carolina are located behind gates several miles from campus.LiNeBrEaKThere are also experiments at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and the Harshaw Experimental Forest in Wisconsin. The carbon dioxide levels around the trees are about 50 percent higher than current levels -- the amount expected 40 to 50 years from now.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research has informed those managing the experiments that their current research will be phased out by 2011. They are to get the definitive measurements on how tree growth, which represents stored carbon, was influenced, and should design new experiments to get rolling by 2012.LiNeBrEaKThe panel found that the current experiments had a useful life of 10 to 12 years, and in a few more years the results would become invalid, in part because the trees were nearly taller than the pipes delivering the carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKResults so far indicate that elevated levels of carbon dioxide make forests grow more quickly, said Ram Oren, associate professor of ecology at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences and principal investigator on the experiments there.LiNeBrEaKBut unless forests are on fertile ground -- hard to come by because of development -- growth will be in leaves, needles, and fine roots, which die off and decompose in a year or two, releasing the carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere, Oren said.LiNeBrEaKThe Duke experiment recently began looking at fertility, and a couple of more years would give researchers better data on how forests react differently to drought and plentiful rainfall, he said.LiNeBrEaK"To stop an experiment that cost $55 million, $10 million before it reaches its real conclusion makes no sense to me," Oren said.LiNeBrEaK"If we stop these experiments now, it could cost many years to get back to this point, time we may not have," Kevin Lee Griffin, associate professor of environmental sciences at Columbia University, wrote in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKRich Norby, who oversees the tree experiment at Oak Ridge, said he had thought it had run its course, but emerging trends indicate the new wood growth from increased carbon dioxide tapers off due to limitations of nitrogen -- fertilizer -- in the soil.LiNeBrEaK"This comes up in all sorts of long-term experiments -- when is the right time to say, 'Enough,' " Norby said. "There's no good answer to that."

Yakima Herald-Republic (Washington)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Cow power-- Digester makes dairy man a believer: Dan DeRuyter's digester turns manure into marketable products, including electricity. It's a major investment, but the payoff in green energy and greenbacks has made him a believer  	Leah Ward, Yakima Herald-Republic, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1209 words  	Nov. 23--OUTLOOK -- Here in the heart of dairy country, where thousands of cows munch, lactate and poop away their days, an unlikely experiment is under way in the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaK"My goal is to sell 100 percent of what comes out of the back end of a cow," says Dan DeRuyter of George DeRuyter and Sons dairy, a sprawling operation founded by Dutch immigrants four generations ago.LiNeBrEaKHe's not there yet.LiNeBrEaKBut DeRuyter believes that in a couple of years, the $3. 8 million digester will prove itself by making manure into many marketable products -- he's already producing and selling electricity. LiNeBrEaKAt a time when the appeal for rural living is growing in the Lower Yakima Valley, which has the state's highest concentration of large dairies, digesters offer at least a partial solution to the air, water and odor complaints associated with milk cows.LiNeBrEaKDigesters, which break down manure and convert it into methane gas burned to produce power, have their critics. They say what's been dubbed "cow power" isn't as environmentally friendly as advocates say.LiNeBrEaKWhile digesters have taken off in other big dairy producing states in the Midwest and Northeast, the industry in Washington state has been slow to adopt them.LiNeBrEaKFive years ago, experts thought they'd see two to three new projects coming online a year. But the state only has three digesters, including one in Lynden in Whatcom County and another in Monroe. A fourth is under construction in Skagit County. DeRuyter is the first to install one in Central Washington.LiNeBrEaKThe slow start stems from a combination of hurdles, especially the relatively low prices dairies get for the electricity they generate.LiNeBrEaK"It's still such a big investment in money and management time for farmers," said Daryl Maas, co-owner with his brother of Farm Power Northwest, which is building the state's fourth digester in Mount Vernon.LiNeBrEaKBut state policymakers are on board and recently identified digesters as one way that agriculture can help reach ambitious goals set by the Legislature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Legislature has said that by 2020, the state's greenhouse gas emissions -- mainly carbon dioxide -- should be reduced to 1990 levels. By 2035, emissions are supposed to be 25 percent below 1990 levels and 50 percent lower by 2050.LiNeBrEaKWashington State University researchers say that if half of the 250,000 dairy cows in the state were on a farm with anaerobic digestion -- anaerobic meaning without oxygen -- as much as 25 megawatts of renewable "green" electricity could be generated annually. That could serve 25,000 people.LiNeBrEaKThe DeRuyter digester in Outlook produces enough electricity for about 600 homes. The captured gas could also be used to power motor vehicles or farm equipment.LiNeBrEaKThe green energy translates to lumps of coal that don't have to be mined and burned, reducing the carbon footprint that many scientists agree causes climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut it turns out that electricity isn't a digester's biggest selling point.LiNeBrEaKWhile digesters were initially billed as profitable energy producers, the biggest source of revenue for dairy digesters has turned out to be industrial food waste, such as leftovers from juice and vegetable processors. Combining food waste with manure is called co-digestion.LiNeBrEaKThe revenue comes from so-called tipping fees that food processors pay dairies to take their organic waste, such as skins from apples, grapes or potatoes.LiNeBrEaK"When you add tipping fees, the return on a project changes for the better," said Richard Shumway, a WSU economist in Pullman.LiNeBrEaKUsing that food waste has the added benefit of keeping the material out of landfills, experts say, and may be a less expensive alternative than landfills for the Yakima Valley's many fruit and vegetable processing plants.LiNeBrEaKAt the Darryl VanderHaak digester in Lynden, tipping fees amount to about $111,767 annually, the highest source of revenue, followed by electric sales at $97,088. The dairy also sells leftover digested fiber, which is used by nurseries as a replacement for peat moss. Tax and carbon credits also bring in more money.LiNeBrEaKCarbon credits represent the value of methane emissions avoided at the dairy by capturing the gas from the manure.LiNeBrEaKDeRuyter and VanderHaak sell their carbon credits on the Chicago Climate Exchange, a marketplace for buyers and sellers. Companies with significant greenhouse gas emissions can compensate for their carbon pollution by purchasing credits -- also called offsets -- from green operations.LiNeBrEaKSo far, greenhouse gas emissions aren't regulated, so participating in the market is voluntary in the United States. But there are buyers of the environmental benefits of digesters waiting to do deals.LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest is The Climate Trust, a Portland-based nonprofit. Peter Weisberg, offset project analyst, recently told a group of dairy producers and digester developers in Sunnyside that it's only a matter of time before the government begins regulating greenhouse gas emissions. He thinks dairy digesters are poised to profit.LiNeBrEaK"As markets mature, there's going to be a huge growth in demand for digester projects," Weisberg said.LiNeBrEaKBack at the DeRuyter dairy, Dan DeRuyter leads a tour for a group of curious scientists, students and digester developers. They see a complex that includes an engine room with two 900-horsepower engines, a 300-by-90-foot concrete digester -- think industrial-size stomach that's mostly underground -- and a variety of machines that separate solids from the watery manure. Digesters need lots of solids.LiNeBrEaKInside the digester, bacteria work their magic by breaking down the manure, creating a reaction that produces methane. The bacteria also destroy the pathogens -- such as E.coli -- that can thrive in manure.LiNeBrEaKThere are still byproducts after digestion: an effluent that's sprayed into a lagoon and a clean fiber -- like cellulose from all that digested alfalfa -- used both for bedding for the animals and a substitute for peat moss.LiNeBrEaKThe effluent is a mix of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, which have value as fertilizer but can pose risks to groundwater if they are discharged improperly. DeRuyter sprays the material on his winter crops.LiNeBrEaKResearchers at WSU, meanwhile, are looking at ways to chemically convert the nitrogen and phosphorus to commercial fertilizer.LiNeBrEaKEnergy Justice Network, a national organization that opposes what they call "factory farms," calls digesters "a Trojan horse that pretends to solve a waste management problem while enabling factory farms to invade the community."LiNeBrEaKWhile the digester can't hide the fact that DeRuyter's some 4,500 cows produce a lot of odoriferous offshoots, many of the visitors remark that the air smells noticeably better than it would at a regular dairy.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully my neighbors are happier," says DeRuyter.

Yakima Herald-Republic (Washington)  	November 23, 2008 Sunday 	Some say oil dependency isn't their problem to fix  	Leah Ward, Yakima Herald-Republic, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	610 words  	Nov. 23--Rural counties in Washington state aren't happy with the prospect of being asked to help reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKA state advisory committee comprised of 13 representatives from the Legislature, city and county governments, and Native American tribes narrowly recommended last month that the Legislature add a new goal to the state's Growth Management Act.LiNeBrEaKThe goal would require local governments to consider ways to reduce greenhouse gases and dependence on foreign oil in land use and planning activities. LiNeBrEaKThe recommendation on foreign oil was the most controversial of many adopted by the committee, which was charged by the 2008 Legislature with studying ways local governments can address climate change.LiNeBrEaKOther recommendations include incentives for developers to build higher density housing in communities served by public transportation and for cities and counties to build more bike paths and sidewalks.LiNeBrEaK"This isn't about us. This is about our grandchildren's future and the kind of environment we are going to leave them with," Rep. Sharon Nelson, D-Seattle, told skeptical county officials at a recent meeting in Yakima of the Washington Association of Counties.LiNeBrEaKSeveral county officials at the meeting, including Benton County Commissioner Leo Bowman, said rural counties can't afford "more mandates" and should be getting credit for agriculture and timber, which naturally absorb harmful carbon dioxide and prevent it from entering the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThe committee -- known as the Land Use and Climate Change Advisory Committee -- was loosely split along Democrat and Republican lines, with Democrats in the majority.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Linda Evans-Parlette, R-Wenatchee, a voting member of the committee, said in a recent telephone interview that the goal is laudable at the national level.LiNeBrEaK"But compelling local governments to address foreign oil demand in growth management plans is nonsensical," she said. "Nothing Washington cities and counties do will affect oil markets."LiNeBrEaKThe cost of climate change initiatives at the local level wasn't addressed specifically but the advisory committee recommended "more flexible" uses of existing funds.LiNeBrEaKFor example, state dollars could be bonded for long-term projects that promote concentrated development and reduce greenhouse gases. A tax on vehicle emissions was also mentioned as a possibility.LiNeBrEaKA final report by the committee is being prepared by the state Department of Community, Trade and Economic Development and is expected to be published Dec. 1. CTED could introduce legislation during the 2009 legislative session based on the recommendations.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Chris Marr, D-Spokane, who has made climate change his signature issue, said he expects to lead the effort in the Senate.LiNeBrEaKYakima County Commissioner Mike Leita, who is not on the advisory committee, said the effort could result in unnecessary legislation.LiNeBrEaK"We don't need a whole bunch of new legislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil," Leita saidLiNeBrEaKLeita also said Yakima County is already taking steps to reduce negative environmental effects. He mentioned the long-term goal to connect the Yakima Greenway to the Naches trail and a rails-to-trails conversion along U.S. Highway 12, northwest of Yakima.

He didn't exactly go in with a real mandate from the people, but Bush is leaving with a mandate from the people. There is certainly a message in that.LiNeBrEaKIt was not from lack of foresight or poor management that GM made SUVs rather than small, fuel-efficient cars.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday   Home Final Edition	Eating meat is destructive to the planet  		EDITORIAL and COMMENT; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. 11A  	352 words  	I write to express my gratitude for, as well as my dissatisfaction with, the Nov. 9 Dispatch story "Rush to deregulate." Thanks for devoting attention to the issue of modern-day, large-scale livestock farming and its impact on the environment -- an issue that has gone underreported in the media for far too long. LiNeBrEaKBut I fear that what was left unwritten is far more urgent than what was written. Dispatch readers should know that, according to a 2006 United Nations report, the global meat industry is the single largest contributor to global warming, surpassing even the transportation industry. Let me reiterate that point: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N., intensively feeding and raising animals for human consumption produce more greenhouse gases than all of the cars, trucks, SUVs and planes combined.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the report, "Livestock's Long Shadow," meat production and consumption are affecting global ecosystems on a tremendous scale. For instance, these large livestock farms -- a more pleasant way of saying factory farms -- emit methane and nitrous oxide, which are greenhouse gases 23 and 296 times, respectively, more potent than carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas our cars, trucks and other vehicles emit.LiNeBrEaKCoupled with vast consumption of natural resources, pesticide use, land erosion, deforestation and millions of tons of waste annually, these gases make the meat industry arguably the most urgent threat to the environment. This means that eating meat is an environmental issue.LiNeBrEaKAnd consumers who want to "go green" would do the planet (and themselves) the most good by taking on this inconvenient truth: limit or refrain from eating factory-farmed meat. LiNeBrEaKUnsurprisingly, even in the midst of the green movement, such an appeal remains unpopular and often goes ignored, even by those who are considered pioneers of the movement (Al Gore doesn't give any attention to these issues in his film or book). After all, if there is ever an inconvenient truth, it is that a lifetime of meat-eating does more damage to Earth than a lifetime of Hummer-driving.LiNeBrEaK\ BRAD ROWE \ Dublin	FACTORY FARMS (90%); DEREGULATION (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); ANIMAL SLAUGHTERING and PROCESSING (90%); ANIMAL FARMING and BREEDING (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (77%); GREEN MARKET (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); METHANE (77%); AGRICULTURE (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (76%); FOOD and BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION (75%); SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (74%); CONSUMPTION (74%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (72%); PESTICIDES (72%); DEFORESTATION (72%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (70%) Letters  		UNITED NATIONS (57%); FOOD and AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS (56%)  			AL GORE (53%)  	COLUMBUS, OH, USA (76%) EARTH (79%); OHIO, USA (76%) UNITED STATES (76%)  	November 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  							Letter  									
The Destin Log (Florida)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Dolphins Recycle begins at Destin Elementary: ?We have to start with this generation'  	Jennifer Rich, Destin Log, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	461 words  	Nov. 22--When someone with an agenda starts a paper trail, big things can happen.LiNeBrEaKAnd that is exactly what the Destin Elementary Parent Teacher Organization is planning to do with their new Dolphins Recycle program. LiNeBrEaK"Schools are in the top three consumers of paper," PTO mom and Dolphins Recycle coordinator Renee Falduto told The Log.LiNeBrEaKWithin the PTO, the organization felt the need for a platform to teach their students about responsible living, so Falduto volunteered and went to work researching how schools make the largest contribution to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Paper that is not recycled, that is sitting in a landfill, is giving off dioxin that eventually results in global warming," Falduto said.LiNeBrEaKPrincipal Marti Gardner said that DES is proud to be the first school in the district to pilot a recycling program.LiNeBrEaKShe hopes to see the small project that is beginning in their school grow and become contagious.LiNeBrEaK"I am (excited) and especially that it was brought forth by our parents," Gardner said. "We have to start with this generation."LiNeBrEaKThe PTO and the dedicated kids behind them are not alone in pulling off the effort to curtail paper consumption.LiNeBrEaKThe City of Destin picks up paper collected from multiple bins at DES, strategically placed in the halls and at the copy machines.LiNeBrEaKThe program's slogan says it all in the acronym START -- Students Taking Action and Recycling Trash.LiNeBrEaKThrough their awareness, the PTO hopes to encourage students to bring in waste paper from home.LiNeBrEaKLocal businesses can also get in on the deed by calling Falduto to coordinate a drop off plan for their excess paper.LiNeBrEaKAll paper collected is taken to the Northwest Florida Daily News, where the "trash" actually earns money to support the Newspapers in Education program.LiNeBrEaKDolphins Recycle is teaching sustainable living to our students, cleaning up the environment and providing teaching tools to DES teachers through the education program.LiNeBrEaKFalduto said that Himes Signs, Home Depot and Wal-Mart contributed the resources used around the school.LiNeBrEaKDES is accepting newspapers, magazines, glossy brochures, phone books, scrap paper and workbooks. They hope to start collecting plastic bottles next.LiNeBrEaKFalduto has plans to approach Superintendent Dr. Alexis Tibbetts with the idea of spreading the effort to other schools in Okaloosa County. "We're happy to be the grass roots of this project," Gardner said.

The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Staying power: Few renewal objections likely  	Dave DeWitte, The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	802 words  	Nov. 22--I n its first 33 and a half years of operation, Iowa's only nuclear power plant has generated more electricity than excitement.LiNeBrEaKAfter some operational issues that brought heightened scrutiny in the early 1980s, the Duane Arnold Energy Center north of Palo has received passing marks from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in recent years.LiNeBrEaKIt has been upgraded from its original output of 535 megawatts to 613 megawatts. LiNeBrEaKNow, federal regulators are trying to figure out if the plant will be good for another 20 years.LiNeBrEaKFPL Energy, which took over as the plant's majority owner in January 2006, filed an application on Sept. 30 to renew its operating license, slated to expire in 2014, until 2034. The application began a license renewal process that is expected to take 22 months, require public input and cost its owners $20 million.LiNeBrEaKThe intense scrutiny by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, involving about 24,000 inspection hours by the agency, is intended to answer many questions. Perhaps the largest of them: "Can this plant go another 20 years safely?" The answer is an emphatic "yes" from Rich Anderson, site vice president of Duane Arnold Energy Center for FPL Energy. WhileLiNeBrEaKthe public's natural reaction might be that the plant has run down considerably over 33 years, Anderson says the plant has actually improved over the years through the installation of better equipment, improved industry practices and predictive maintenance plans that identify issues before they become problems.LiNeBrEaK"The plant's being maintained to a high state of performance," Anderson said.LiNeBrEaKThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission has already approved about 49 nuclear plant license extensions, and has 17 pending, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Two of the extensions were approved at plants in Florida owned and operated by FPL Energy.LiNeBrEaKWhile protesters greeted the plant's opening in 1975 because of concerns about possible radioactive releases, objections to the plant's renewal likely will be few.LiNeBrEaKOut of the three environmental organizations that have been most active on Iowa energy issues in the past year, none has decided to object to the license extension application yet.LiNeBrEaKOne reason: The front-burner issue in environmental protection is now global warming. Nuclear power plants don't emit greenhouse gases, andtherefore don't contribute much to the problem.LiNeBrEaK"The facility is there. It's been functioning successfully, and it seems to be well-managed," said attorney Carrie LaSeur, executive director of Plains Justice, an Iowa based public interest law center based in Mount Vernon. The group probably won't fight the extension because its resources are heavily committed to fighting applications for coalburning power plants that are heavy emitters of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKLaSeur does have concerns about the extension. Perhaps the largest is that spent nuclear fuel rods keep piling up in what she grimly called a "nuclear waste dump." The U.S. Department of Energy has so far not been able to provide a promised permanent underground repository for spent nuclear fuel. If it eventually succeeds in opening the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, nuclear industry officials say that site won't be able to hold all of the projected nuclear waste needs.LiNeBrEaKBeginning in 2003, the operators of Duane Arnold Energy Center began moving bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in metal canisters from underwater storage on an upper floor of the nuclear power plant into specially designed thick concrete bunkers outside the building.LiNeBrEaKLocal Sierra Club activists Wally Taylor and Pamela Mackey Taylor say the group is undecided, but they don't consider nuclear power the answer to the nation's clean energy challenges. They say nuclear power is a non-renewable fuel that will run out in about a century, and that it generates greenhouse gases in the mining, processing and transportation that true renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power do not.LiNeBrEaKThe Iowa Environmental Council hasn't weighed in on the issue, said Nathaniel Baer, the group's energy program director.LiNeBrEaKDuane Arnold Energy Center was a vital power lifeline to the Cedar Rapids area during the June floods, which knocked out two coal-burning power plants in Cedar Rapids. It provides 10 percent of the power consumed in Iowa, enough to power about 480,000 homes, FPL officials say.LiNeBrEaK&acirc;[#x20ac]" Contact the writer: (319) 398-8317 or david.dewitte@gazcomm.com	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); NUCLEAR PLANT SAFETY (90%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); LICENSES and PERMITS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (85%); CLIMATE CHANGE (85%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); NUCLEAR WASTE (78%); HAZARDOUS WASTE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); APPROVALS (77%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%); LAWYERS (60%)  		NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (84%)  		Environment/Recycling/Waste  		IOWA, USA (94%); FLORIDA, USA (78%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Gazette   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081122-CR-Staying-power-1122  	CR  													
Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	HT Leadership Summit: Report on the session with Gary Samore, Vali Nasr and Karl Inderfurth  	Tushar Srivastava Tushar Srivastava, Hindustan Times, New Delhi  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	635 words  	Nov. 22--NEW DELHI -- When Barack Obama takes office, he will face a sea of troubles, a complex set of difficult security challenges, especially in the middle-east, but he will be armed with less power and resources than any American President since the end of Cold War.LiNeBrEaKThis was the essence of the case argued by Gary Samore, Vice President, Director of Studies and Maurice R Greenberg Chair, Council of Foreign Relations, speaking at the HT Leadership Summit on Friday. LiNeBrEaKSamore along with Karl Inderfurth, professor, practice of international affairs and director, international affairs, George Washington University and Vali Nasr, professor, international politics, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University were in  New Delhi to participate in the Summit and speak on "In search of order: America after Bush".LiNeBrEaKSamore felt that at top of Obama's long foreign policy to do list will be working with the G20 to limit global recession and reform the international financial system, ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on favourable terms, halting nuclear weapon programmes in Iran and North Korea, reviving the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, defeating the jehadi terrorist threat plus dealing with global threats like climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Obama is likely to face a world of disorder. No matter how popular he is in the streets of Europe, the boardrooms of Europe and America have fundamental differences over how to run and reform the international financial systems. Obama's charm and appeal does not extend to Russia which remains in a sour and bellicose anti-American mood," Samore said.LiNeBrEaK"Obama's election has brought hopes for dramatic changes in US policy in the Middle East, which may be unrealistic. In Iraq, the unresolved political conflicts and rivalries among the different sectarian and ethnic groups will make it difficult for Obama to withdraw all US combat forces. Similarly, American intervention in Afghanistan is not likely to end soon," he said.LiNeBrEaK"Iran will present a special challenge and it remains to be seen whether Obama can assemble a strong international coalition to increase pressure on Iran if it refuses a genuine American offer to improve bilateral relations. Obama will inherit good bilateral relations with all major Asian powers," Samore said.LiNeBrEaK"The feel good factor in the Middle East is coming down because of the meltdown. Indian Muslims have been a big part of this feel good factor. The meltdown could impact Indian Muslims who have been benefited by the "Dubai factor". The impact of meltdown in the Middle East would be tangible -- job cuts to could impact them directly as many are employed there -- and psychological -- it could impact the way they vote," Nasr said.LiNeBrEaK"To pursue order in today's world -- whether it be in the security realm, the political, the economic, energy or the environment -- we must have partners. And America -- in many respects -- has not been very "partner friendly" during the Bush years. America needs -- and must now reach out to international partners," Inderfurth said.LiNeBrEaKWhat order should we be in search of after Bush? America should strive for a strengthened international order -- return to the international fold on the issues of due process and the rights of defendants and the use of torture, a new economic order, a new energy and environmental order and fourthly, need to envision a new nuclear order, he added.

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Obama to face 5 key foreign policy problems: Gary Samore  	Pramitpal Chaudhuri, Hindustan Times, New Delhi  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	473 words  	Nov. 22--NEW DELHI -- Gary Samore, vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations, believes the incoming Obama administration faces five key foreign policy challenges, the topmost being global economic crisis, reports Pramitpal Chaudhuri. LiNeBrEaKThe incoming Obama administration faces five key foreign policy challenges, says Gary Samore, vice-president of the Council for Foreign Relations. Uppermost will be handling the present global economic crisis, followed by ending the twin wars of Iraq and Afghanistan. He will also have to decide what to do about the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea, try to solve the West Asian peace process and the problem of climate change.LiNeBrEaKObama's biggest asset in handling these problems, says Samore, is that "he is not Bush." Samore is unconcerned by Obama's inexperience with the ways of Washington. "He has surrounded himself with extremely experienced people." Samore, a veteran of the administrations of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and the two Bushes, says that most US presidents learn quickly. "Within two years Bill Clinton knew more about foreign policy than his advisors," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama will seek to end the two wars on "favourable terms" for the US. But Samore made it clear he doubted the next US president will be able to fulfill his election promise of withdrawing in 16 months, or even the 2011 date of the status of forces agreement. "We're stuck there for a while. The real issue is reducing casualty rates to a tolerable level."LiNeBrEaKAfghanistan is more problematic. Victory there will be much harder for the US. The country has no history of central government and there will always be a temptation to cut deals with the local warlords, he said. Which is why it will be important to first reassert US military preeminence in the country first. The other side of the problem is Pakistan "which has an ineffective government" and is struggling with the Pakistan Taliban.LiNeBrEaKIran and its nuclear ambitions are another grave concern for the US. The present strategy of Bush will continue, says Obama. Under this, the focus will be to get a great power consensus on how to tackle Iran, probably considering tighter economic sanctions.

The New York Post 	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	WATERLOGGED - BROLIN STINKER ALL WET  	Linda Stasi, TV Critic   	All Editions; Pg. 61  	448 words  	"Lost City Raiders"  LiNeBrEaK[No stars]  LiNeBrEaKTonight at 9 on Sci Fi  LiNeBrEaK'Lost City Raiders' is a combination of the two worst movies in recent history  LiNeBrEaKSCI Fi proudly proclaims that their movie tonight is nothing less than " 'The DaVinci Code' meets 'Waterworld.' "   LiNeBrEaKAnd let me assure you - Sci Fi is not just bragging.  LiNeBrEaKYes, "Lost City Raiders" is, in fact, a combination of two of the worst movies in recent history melded into the worst TV movie in recent and probably even future history.  LiNeBrEaKThe movie is a hilariously awful concoction about how, in 2048, global warming has caused the melting of the polar ice caps - which somehow caused giant underground explosions which released bazillions of gallons of hot water causing all but 10 percent of the earth's surface to flood.  LiNeBrEaKComing to save the day is the Kubiak family - Pa Kubiak (James Brolin) and his two sons, Jack (Ian Somerhalder) and Thomas (Jamie Thomas King). They make their living salvaging artifacts from underwater cities. But when the "New Vatican" comes-a-callin', Jack has no choice but to put finances aside and go answerin' that call.  LiNeBrEaKYou'd think that the old Vatican was underwater, but a bit later the old Vatican seems not to be underwater so much as it is on the water - like a Venetian Vatican. None of it makes a bit of sense.  LiNeBrEaKPa (I swear) Kubiak and the boys must find the lost scepter of Moses that is buried with Richard the Lionheart. (Who knew? I thought Moses had a staff!) Anyway, this scepter holds the key (it actually is a key) to reversing "the rising," which is what this water disaster has been dubbed.   LiNeBrEaKThe Kubiaks' quest is not an easy one. They are interrupted by a lot of Germans, a German Cardinal, a not-German mad priest, a mad realtor and a serving wench who wants to be a wench with a wrench (a mechanic on a boat). But she's bad luck.  LiNeBrEaKA guy who sounds like Blackbeard warns the Kubiaks in one of the primo scenes in the movie, "Beware mister - this girly is bad luck!"  LiNeBrEaKTo which Girly replies, "It was a giant glacial tsunami! Not my fault!" Haven't you always wanted to say that?  LiNeBrEaKThere's also a German marine biologist/love interest for Jack with big boobs.  LiNeBrEaKWhat isn't evident is a tight housing market. Now you'd think that if all the humans on earth had to be crowded into 10 percent of the land, it would get pretty crowded.  LiNeBrEaKBut apparently not. Where would the animals graze and crops grow? Don't know, but there is leather and rubber aplenty for the Kubiak family's hipster wear. (In 2048 folks will dress suspiciously like they do in 2008.)  LiNeBrEaKSo do they save the day? I'm not telling, but I will say, though, that I still can't figure out where all the water goes when it starts draining.

New Haven Register (Connecticut)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Liberal-themed coffee shop donates 10% of sales to causes  	Mary E. O'Leary, New Haven Register, Conn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	481 words  	Nov. 22--NEW HAVEN -- At Blue State Coffee, you can order a latte and know a portion of the cost will aid a variety of progressive causes. LiNeBrEaKYale University sophomore Drew Ruben and his father, Marshall Ruben, plan to open the 50-seat coffee shop at 82B-84 Wall St., the former home of Ciao Bella, Phil's Barbershop and Breadstar bakery.LiNeBrEaKDrew Ruben, 19, got into the political and entrepreneurial adventure last year when the pair opened their first store on Thayer Street in Providence, R.I., in the heart of Brown University.LiNeBrEaKThe New Haven version will open "sometime before Barack Obama's inauguration," Drew Ruben said. There is a definite liberal theme to the place. The Rhode Island shop sells dog treats in the shape of President George Bush.LiNeBrEaKA member of the Yale College Democrats, Drew Ruben interned for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California this past summer and had worked on U.S. Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign since February.LiNeBrEaKThe City Plan Commission this week recommended the Board of Zoning Appeals grant the use variance Blue State Coffee needs. There is a long history of commercial uses for this Wall Street address, which caters mainly to pedestrian traffic from Yale.LiNeBrEaKWith 10 percent of its sales going to select causes, based on a vote of its customers, Blue State Coffee so far has donated $65,000 to four groups.LiNeBrEaKMore than half went to Stop Global Warming, a nonpartisan effort that demands solutions now; ActBlue, a place to contribute to Democratic candidates; National Even Start Association, which advances early-childhood education; and People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group.LiNeBrEaK"Every time you drink a cup of our premier-quality, perfectly roasted, fairly-traded coffee, you're contributing to a positive movement for change in this country," reads a message on Blue State's Web site.LiNeBrEaKIts blog has reminders to vote, congratulations to Obama on his win and references to an interview with Craig Robinson, the president-elect's brother-in-law. Drew Ruben said Robinson was a regular at Blue State until he left Brown to coach basketball at Oregon State University.LiNeBrEaKIn New Haven, the shop will be competing with home-grown coffee shops and national brands within blocks of its Wall Street home. Blue State also aims to buy locally produced baked goods and possibly offer soups, salads and sandwiches.LiNeBrEaKPhil's Barber Shop has moved a few doors down on Wall Street, but it was unclear if the other stores will open elsewhere.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday   Sunrise Edition	Mars all wet --underground  	JOHN JOHNSON Jr., LA Times-Washington Post Service  	Wire News  	392 words  	SUMMARY: Glaciers   | Scientists find ice covered by surface rubble near the planet's equatorLiNeBrEaKMars all wet --undergroundLiNeBrEaKJOHN JOHNSON Jr.LiNeBrEaKIn a discovery that partly answers the question of where all the water went on Mars, scientists have found vast, debris-covered glaciers much nearer the equatorial region than anyone had expected, according to a report Friday in the journal Science. LiNeBrEaKThe glaciers, estimated to contain at least as much water as Lake Huron and possibly as much as the entire Great Lakes, were found by ground-penetrating radar on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.LiNeBrEaK"We have found a big chunk of the missing water that people have known must be there," said Ali Safaeinili, a member of the radar team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge, Calif.LiNeBrEaKUntil now, the only deposits of ice have been seen at the poles.LiNeBrEaKHow did the ice get there? The best guess, said John W. Holt, a researcher for the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas, is that climate change was brought on by changes in Mars' rotational axis over time.LiNeBrEaKBecause Mars doesn't have a large moon to keep its axis relatively stable, as the Earth does, the planet can tilt dramatically, redistributing the sun's heat and energy and shifting the poles around.LiNeBrEaKThese icy deposits may have lain hidden in their current state for as long as 200 million years, Holt said.LiNeBrEaKScientists had previously noticed rocky debris "aprons" that seemed to flow away from steep hills as if something underground was lubricating their movements. But there was no proof what was going on until the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Italian-built radar confirmed the presence of large ice structures.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery could be one of the most significant for those who want to see a manned mission to Mars, a goal that was announced by President George W. Bush in 2004 but has since been quietly de-emphasized by NASA.LiNeBrEaKKnowing that astronauts could obtain water in the more temperate regions would probably make the mission more feasible.LiNeBrEaKIt is still unclear, however, whether the water is accessible from the surface. Holt said the radar measurements indicated that it could be covered by as much as 30 feet of debris.LiNeBrEaK"If you could get a backhoe in there, you could get at it," said Jeffrey Plaut, a geologist at JPL. "You'd have to figure out how to get a backhoe to Mars."

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday   Sunrise Edition	Environmentalists optimistic, industry wary of Obama  	LES BLUMENTHAL  	Wire News  	1134 words  	SUMMARY: Issues   | Environmentalists are optimistic but other interests are waitingLiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists optimistic, industry wary of ObamaLiNeBrEaKLES BLUMENTHALLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON --Here's the question: What does a community organizer from Chicago who spent four years in the Senate before being elected president know about spotted owls, endangered salmon, mountain bark beetles, Western water rights, old-growth forests and the maintenance backlog in the national parks?LiNeBrEaKThe answer: Probably not much. LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has offered only scattered clues as to where he stands on the most pressing public lands and endangered species issues.LiNeBrEaKIn reading the tea leaves, however, environmental groups are optimistic, timber industry and land-rights groups are wary, and an influential lawmaker is excited about having an ally in the White House.LiNeBrEaK"This guy is a quick study and I'm sure he will find competent people," said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who as chairman of a House Appropriations interior subcommittee oversees nearly $28 billion in annual funding for the Interior Department, the U.S. Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. "We will be able to work with him. Anything will be better than Bush."LiNeBrEaKEnergy, warming focusLiNeBrEaKWhen it comes to the environment, Obama has focused his attention almost exclusively on global warming and clean energy. There are few references on his campaign Web site to on-the-ground issues, especially those specific to the West.LiNeBrEaKObama received an 86 out of a possible 100 in the environmental scorecard for members of Congress published by the League of Conservation Voters. He was also a co-sponsor of a bill that would have protected about 58 million acres of federal lands. The Bush administration had sought to open up those roadless lands to development.LiNeBrEaKAsked about public lands and endangered species issues, Tommy Vietor, an Obama transition spokesman, said, "President-elect Obama believes there is only one president at a time, and thus isn't commenting on many of these issues at this time."LiNeBrEaKEven so, some hints about where Obama is coming from can be gleaned from those reviewing natural resource and environmental issues during the transition.LiNeBrEaKDan Hayes, who is leading the effort at the departments of Interior and Energy, is a former deputy interior secretary in the Clinton administration who has a background in water and greenhouse gas issues. John Leshy is a former Interior Department solicitor who has ties to one of the most ardent environmentalists on Capitol Hill, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think Barack Obama has done a lot of thinking about endangered species and forest issues," said Bill Arthur, a deputy national field director for the Sierra Club based in Seattle. "That's not his job. What is important is who he appoints around him."LiNeBrEaKArthur said there have been encouraging signs from members of the transition team who have indicated an Obama administration would reverse Bush administration initiatives and bar mountaintop-removal mining in Appalachia and block oil and gas leasing in southern Utah's Red Rock area.LiNeBrEaKAnother Bush initiative that almost certainly will face scrutiny is a rule that would allow individual federal agencies to decide whether their actions violated the Endangered Species Act, rather than consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the act.LiNeBrEaKBudgets trimmedLiNeBrEaKThe new administration also faces more fundamental issues. The budgets of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service have been sharply trimmed in recent years. The Forest Service budget has been sliced by a third, while at the same time more than half its budget is now spent in the fight against catastrophic wildfires.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama indicated his administration would "aggressively pursue" a fire prevention, mitigation and land and forest management plan to reduce fire risks.LiNeBrEaKThe Forest Service manages almost 200 million acres across the country.LiNeBrEaK"It's a very anxious time," said Forest Service Chief Gail Kimbell. "But I think the Forest Service is well prepared to take on the issues the Obama campaign has been discussing."LiNeBrEaKKimbell acknowledged that budget issues, particularly the firefighting costs, have taken a toll. But she said the Forest Service is well aware that climate change has created an extended drought that has stressed trees and left them susceptible to such things as the mountain bark beetle. That has led to a fire season that lasts from January to November.LiNeBrEaKDead and dying trees should be removed and the forests thinned, even if that means felling some of the older trees, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change has hit us with the increased severity of wildfire and the cost of fighting them," Kimbell said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are hopeful the new administration will reverse what they see as eight years of setback after setback.LiNeBrEaK"I am 54 years old and I have actively worked on environmental issues for 25 years," Arthur said. "I'm not naive or myopic. There will always be some cold showers when it comes to these issues. But I see an administration coming in that believes change is not just needed, it is vital."LiNeBrEaKTimber industry uncertainLiNeBrEaKLands-rights groups say they'll be watching the new administration closely.LiNeBrEaK"So far he has picked Clinton administration people for his transition team and I don't think that bodes well for us," said Chuck Cushman, who heads the American Land Rights Association based in Battle Ground, Wash. "We could have our work cut out for us."LiNeBrEaKThe timber industry also is uncertain how it will fare under the Obama administration. However, Tom Partin, who heads the American Forest Resource Council in Portland said that the industry should work with Obama, especially on forest health issues.LiNeBrEaKAs the Montana primary approached in May, Obama, in perhaps his most succinct statement on public lands issues, answered questions from the Flathead Beacon newspaper in Kalispell.LiNeBrEaKHe said he believed that sustainability --using resources in a way that provides for the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs --was the most important factor in managing federal lands.LiNeBrEaK"If we're going to have timber industries operating on public lands, then we should make sure that old-growth forests aren't destroyed but it's that second-growth" that's harvested, he said.LiNeBrEaKObama also told the newspaper that it was important to designate additional wilderness areas for permanent protection, but that a balance needed to be struck by competing interests on federal lands. He also said his administration would "listen rather than dictate" in working with state and local officials.LiNeBrEaK"What I want is to be able to pass onto our children and grandchildren the same extraordinary gift that we received from our parents and grandparents," Obama said.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday   Final Edition; All Editions	Pelosi ally in place on top priorities  	Joe Frolik, Plain Dealer Associate Editor  	OPINION; Pg. A7  	371 words  	She's the boss: Speaker Nancy Pelosi was officially neutral in the war between John Dingell of Michigan and Henry Waxman of California for chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. But no one doubts she helped Waxman behind the scenes to remove an old nemesis - and cement her power on Capitol Hill. Six years ago, Pelosi tried to take out the pro-gun, pro-Big Three Dingell in a primary. As speaker, she feuded with him on global warming. Now Pelosi has a longtime ally to walk point on health care, energy and environment - all top priorities of President-elect Barack Obama. Next question: Will Waxman and Pelosi try to push the White House further and faster than it might prefer? LiNeBrEaKSetting the tone: Even as House Democrats were veering left, their former colleague Rahm Emanuel was wooing Republicans on the Hill. The next White House chief of staff has a reputation for hardball politics, but he pledged cooperation and even gave his cell phone number to GOP leaders. Emanuel's charm offensive follows Obama's promise to have Republicans in his Cabinet and his efforts to protect Sen. Joe Lieberman from retribution in the Democratic caucus.LiNeBrEaKGearing Up I: Presumably eager to deter potential challengers - and silence talk of his political demise - Sen. John McCain has told key supporters he'll seek a fifth term in 2010. Given Arizona's changing demographics, there's been talk that McCain might be a prime Democratic target in 2010. But he may get help on that front from the guy who just beat him: Obama has reportedly offered Gov. Janet Napolitano, Arizona's most popular Democrat, a Cabinet job.LiNeBrEaKGearing Up II: McCain may be focused on 2010 - when the GOP will have 19 Senate seats to defend - but other GOP hopefuls are already thinking about 2012. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is in Des Moines today to address a meeting of Iowa religious conservatives. Mike Huckabee, who won this year's caucus, was back in the Hawkeye State last week on a book tour.LiNeBrEaKDo read: One-time (when he served in the Clinton White House) deficit hawk Matt Miller on his new embrace of red ink.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Protecting the climate one step at a time  	SCOTT TURNER  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 3  	631 words  	DISAPPOINTMENT CREPT over me like one of those brown clouds of polluted air that float daily over parts of Asia.LiNeBrEaKUsually I stroll the two miles to work on relatively green and quiet side streets. The tree- and garden-rich landscape multiplies the benefits of walking, reducing my stress and improving my mood.LiNeBrEaKOn Veterans Day, I sauntered down the neighborhood s busiest thoroughfare to count cars on a morning when parents were not taking their kids to school. I expected observe a fair number of carpooling commuters. LiNeBrEaKI was wrong. The study tally was 167 vehicles, with just 13, or less than 8 percent, containing more than a single occupant. Eleven bikers peddled past and eight walkers ambled by.LiNeBrEaKFumes on the main drag were displeasing, and the noise disrupting, making it an unpleasant contrast to my usual route.LiNeBrEaKBiking, walking, carpooling and using public transportation improve our world and us. Striving for a cleaner-energy lifestyle helps break a petroleum habit that threatens our national security and our children s future.LiNeBrEaKAlmost 60 percent of the oil used in the United States is imported, and most of the world s reserves are concentrated in unfriendly countries. Coal, gas, oil or nuclear fuels are finite   use them and lose them. From causing smog to acid rain to the greenhouse effect, burning fossil fuels without limit injures the planet.LiNeBrEaKOn the home front, our family has mobilized its resources   energy, human and infrastructure   to battle petroleum addiction.LiNeBrEaKThe first attack was on gasoline consumption. I stopped motoring to work and we quit driving the kids to school. They take the bus. In addition, my work ID serves as a RIPTA pass, thanks to my employer, so I take the bus if I can t walk. We estimate these changes cut our gas use almost 50 percent.LiNeBrEaKNext, we dealt with heating oil. Our home s previous occupant bought 2,500 gallons of oil per year. She was elderly and frail and kept the traditional thermostat at 72 degrees.LiNeBrEaKA trio of plumbers told us that a programmable thermostat would not work in our home. So we adjusted the one there, finding that a steady 62. 5 degrees maintained the downstairs near 66 degrees and the upstairs at about 68.LiNeBrEaKAfter that we shut down the primary route of heat loss by insulating the back room, which we also close off at night.LiNeBrEaKAn energy-reduction firm helped us obtain a low-interest loan to install energy-efficient windows. We open shades to let sunshine in, otherwise the drawn material helps keep out cold. Ceiling fans cool us in summer and re-circulate heat in winter, and we avoid using the fireplace, as it sucks warm air out of the house.LiNeBrEaKLast year we purchased just over 1,000 gallons of oil, or 60 percent less than was once used during the heating season in our home.LiNeBrEaKThen to support sustainability, we signed up with a nonprofit that matched our electrical use to local renewable resources such as solar and wind. While this increased our electric bill somewhat, it challenged us to use less energy, so we switched to compact fluorescent bulbs, and wash clothes in cold water.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, we buy as many locally grown and produced products as possible. Buying local, particularly from sustainable farms, saves on energy used to grow, package and ship food. It also helps local farmers stay in business, and the food is fresher, tastier and more nutritious.LiNeBrEaKI understand that many people can t afford an extra purchase today, but several actions, such as lowering the thermostat, cost nothing.LiNeBrEaKIf you marshal your resources to cut oil dependency and start walking to work, choose a route with less traffic, fewer fumes and reduced racket. The trees and quiet will leave you feeling more at ease.LiNeBrEaKScott Turner is a Providence-based nature writer. His columns appear here each Saturday ( scottturnerster@gmail.com).

Richmond Times - Dispatch (Virginia)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Businesses team up to go green: Coalition of firms has goal of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 percent  	Rex Bowman, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	423 words  	Nov. 22--Some of Roanoke's leading businesses yesterday announced they plan to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 20 percent over five years.LiNeBrEaKCalling themselves the Clean and Green Business Coalition, representatives of the group gathered at the Orvis store in downtown Roanoke to challenge other businesses in the Roanoke Valley to cut emissions, recycle more waste and reduce their energy use. LiNeBrEaKThe coalition includes a dozen businesses -- including Southwest Virginia's biggest employer, the Carilion Clinic -- plus Virginia Western Community College.LiNeBrEaK"We're trying to lead by example," said coalition co-Chairman Stan Breakell, CEO of construction contractor Breakell Inc.

LiNeBrEaK The coalition includes a dozen businesses - including Southwest Virginia's biggest employer, the Carilion Clinic - plus Virginia Western Community College.LiNeBrEaK "We're trying to lead by example," said coalition co-Chairman Stan Breakell, CEO of construction contractor Breakell Inc.

However, it would have also been nice to read they recognize the debt owed to the U.S., and intend to pay the American taxpayers back some of the billions of dollars spent over the past five and a half years to get them there.LiNeBrEaKHeck, I would have been happy if they had just put something in this vote to pitch in money to help finance the next three years it may take before the withdrawal of all our troops. LiNeBrEaKNo amount of money can ever replace the lost lives of American soldiers in this war or make the grief of their families any less. But at least the money Iraq can certainly afford to pay back out of the oil revenues they are now enjoying thanks to this country, could be put to good use to help the veterans who did make it back with lost limbs and worse. It could also be used to reduce the huge budget deficit this war helped make that future generations of our country will inherit.LiNeBrEaK-- Renee Biggs, Universal CityLiNeBrEaKHang them highLiNeBrEaKAs a visitor from Australia to your fair city, may I say how surprised I am that, with a dry, sunny climate such as yours; I see no provision to dry laundry in the sunshine.

The article states that "450 biology or biological anthropology professors" took the survey. That is hardly "98% of Texas scientists."LiNeBrEaKThe fact that these professors do not want us to teach strengths and weaknesses of a scientific theory is scary. In my mind, this is saying they don't want to teach their students to think, just to accept the "facts" as presented in a class.LiNeBrEaKI urge everyone to not accept the mantra that evolution is the only scientifically defensible theory.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Western guvs talk energy, climate with Obama team: Policy ? Huntsman, others want new administration's help  	Judy Fahys, The Salt Lake Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	718 words  	Nov. 22--Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. , a Republican, and Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, personally delivered the West's energy-policy priorities Friday to the incoming administration.LiNeBrEaKIn a meeting with John Podesta, co-chairman of President-elect Barack Obama's transition team, the two governors told how Washington can help update the systems that deliver energy to Americans while reducing the pollution blamed for global climate change and greening the economy with clean-energy jobs.LiNeBrEaK"The transformation we are talking about is broad-based and will require new policies, incentives, market mechanisms and private-public partnerships to be in place by the end of next year," Huntsman said. "We plan to work with the new administration and Congress in addressing the multitude of energy challenges ahead." LiNeBrEaK"Western states are the country's energy breadbasket, but energy efficiency has also got to play a much bigger role," Schweitzer said. "That includes everything from manufacturing more fuel-efficient vehicles to changing regulatory structures so they reward utilities for achieving reduced energy usage among their customers."LiNeBrEaKHuntsman and Schweitzer were delivering the message on behalf of the Western Governors Association, a group composed of the chief executives of 19 states and three U.S.-flag islands in the Pacific. And their bipartisan effort comes at a time, two weeks after Americans voted to send to Washington a new team, that has highlightedLiNeBrEaKthe need for greater energy security, creating green jobs, promoting alternative energy and tackling climate change.LiNeBrEaKThis week, Obama praised the governors for their leadership and pledged his administration's help. It was a reversal from the soon-to-be-departing Bush administration, which snubbed efforts to deal with climate change.LiNeBrEaK"When I am president, any governor who's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House," Obama said in a video address to a meeting hosted by California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaKAlso this week, Sen. Barbara Boxer promised to introduce cap-and-trade legislation in the Senate. And, in the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee replaced its longtime leader, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan congressman with a strong allegiance to the auto industry, with a strong advocate of dealing with climate change, Rep. Henry Waxman of California.LiNeBrEaKBack home in Utah, constituents had mixed reviews of Huntsman's involvement in the Western governors' energy initiative.LiNeBrEaKThe Utah Farm Bureau Federation, with 500 assembled for its annual conference in Layton, heard a presentation on how efforts to control greenhouse gasses by shutting down coal-fired power plants would have a "negligible" impact on reducing global warming while having a devastating impact on the state's economy.LiNeBrEaK"The governor is ahead of himself," said Randy Parker, the farm bureau's chief executive officer. "He is out of line."LiNeBrEaKBut Brigham Young University political science professor Byron Daynes was encouraged that the governors chose energy and the climate crisis as a high-priority item for the new president.LiNeBrEaK"It was as if they were waiting for the right time, the right president to come along" to seek support for their strategies, he said.LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.comLiNeBrEaKHigh-priorityLiNeBrEaKWestern states provide the nation:LiNeBrEaK94% of onshore oil reservesLiNeBrEaK66% of coal reservesLiNeBrEaK91% wet natural gas onshoreLiNeBrEaK82% dry natural gas onshoreLiNeBrEaK100% installed solar thermal generationLiNeBrEaK100% installed geothermal generationLiNeBrEaK77% installed wind generationLiNeBrEaK82% installed, grid connected photovoltaic solar generationLiNeBrEaKGovernors urge quick actionLiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&raquo;They suggest seven priorities, including cutting greenhouse gasses, adopting a market approach, stepping up energy efficiency, reducing oil imports, encouraging energy research, aiding low-income consumers and promoting green jobs.LiNeBrEaKSee the letter:LiNeBrEaKwww.westgov.org/wga/testim/obama-energy11-20-08.pdf	ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); TALKS and MEETINGS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (77%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (76%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (76%); JOB CREATION (75%); PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (74%); POWER PLANTS (73%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (72%); AUTOMAKERS (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); ECONOMIC NEWS (70%); LEGISLATION (68%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (67%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (66%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  				Energy  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); JON HUNTSMAN (94%); BRIAN SCHWEITZER (92%); JOHN PODESTA (58%); ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (52%); JOHN DINGELL (52%); BARBARA BOXER (52%); HENRY WAXMAN (51%)  	UTAH, USA (95%); WEST USA (93%); MONTANA, USA (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	November 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081122-ST-Western-guvs-talk-energy-climate-with-Obama-team-1122  	ST  													
San Jose Mercury News (California)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Local fight against global warming: Activitists push for 'Cool Cities  	Sharon Noguchi, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	609 words  	Nov. 22--They came with the goal of saving the planet and left Saturday with a handy tool kit of ideas that began with how to approach City Hall. About 40 foot soldiers in the battle against global warming got their marching orders at a workshop in Mountain View offered by the Sierra Club and two other environmental organizations.LiNeBrEaKWhy fight at City Hall against carbon dioxide emissions? Because about 45 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions come from transportation, and 28 percent from electricity generation and natural gas burning to heat and power buildings, according to Bay Area air quality officials. And cities and counties make the rules that shape that energy consumption. LiNeBrEaK"Technology alone is not enough to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions. We have to pay attention to how much we drive our fuel-efficient cars," said Stephanie Reyes of Greenbelt Alliance, a workshop co-sponsor. In California, vehicle miles traveled has increased at nearly twice the rate of population growth.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, you can't solve global warming by simply driving a Prius.LiNeBrEaKHigh on the list of planet-friendly ideas is more of the "right" kind of development: high-density, walkable communities, affordable housing, retail and commercial nestling alongside houses.LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club's 2-year-old Cool Cities campaign aims to change the way many people live, with less sprawl and more transit near housing.LiNeBrEaK"This is the major social movement of the early 21stLiNeBrEaKcentury -- fighting climate change," said Matt Vander Sluis of the statewide Planning and Conservation League, another workshop sponsor. San Jose, a leader among cities in the fight, aims to reduce per-capita emissions by 50 percent within 15 years. California has passed a law ordering greenhouse-gas emissions to be rolled back to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKBut setting goals is one thing; achieving them is another. Palo Alto, lauded for its "green" building policies, a few years ago approved a housing project called by some at the workshop "an abomination" -- upscale housing at the former Rickey's Hyatt site on El Camino Real, a major transit corridor. Neighbors fearing traffic beat back the original proposal for a hotel and more affordable units, which was just the kind of development that planet-protectors advocate.LiNeBrEaKWorkshop organizers suggested the way to fight nimby-ism and enforce anti-greenhouse-gas rules is to embed targets in cities' general plans and regions' transportation plans, which are legally binding rules. If all that sounds high on the policy-wonk scale, there was more: The eco-activist primer is full of details on how to harness and strengthen environmental laws. Pointers include: Get eight cities this year to pass ordinances. Create three micro teams. Bird-dog general-plan processes.LiNeBrEaKThe most effective measures will be the most difficult to achieve -- require homeowners to install energy-saving measures such as weatherstripping and insulation, before selling a home, said Margie Suozzo, co-chair of the Cool Cities core team.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think cities realize how much power they have," said David Marsland, San Jose Cool Team member.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Workshop to help residents fight climate change  	By Joshua Melvin DAILY News staff writer  	NEWS  	244 words  	A workshop to be held in Mountain View today will give residents the tools to get their leaders to act on climate change, organizers said. LiNeBrEaKThe Building Climate-Friendly Communities workshop, hosted by the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter, the Greenbelt Alliance as well as the Planning and Conservation League, will offer presentations on various green topics.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Julio Magalhaes, global warming program director, there will be presentations on recent developments in the California Environmental Quality Act, green building standards and land-use planning. The goal is for participants to leave with an understanding of green developments. That information can then be used to lobby local leaders for change.LiNeBrEaKMagalhaes said on Friday that 80 people had said they were coming, which is higher than expected. At least 10 percent of those are city staff members.LiNeBrEaKThe workshop is part of a larger effort that began in 2006 to get cities to begin reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, Magalhaes said. Part of achieving that goal is having citizens push their leaders to include measures in the general plan or create ordinances which combat pollution.LiNeBrEaK"Citizens can show leaders that they are concerned and want action," he said.LiNeBrEaKE-mail Joshua Melvin at jmelvin@dailynewsgroup.comLiNeBrEaKIF YOU GO:LiNeBrEaKWhat: Workshop on ways to encourage local leaders to address environmental issuesLiNeBrEaKWhere: Mountain View City Council Chambers, 500 Castro St.LiNeBrEaKWhen: Today, 9 a.m. to 12: 30 p.m.	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); GREEN BUILDING (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); EMISSIONS (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); CITY GOVERNMENT (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (68%); CITIES (68%)  		SIERRA CLUB (84%)  				CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	November 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved

St. Petersburg Times (Florida)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Obama energy policy: Cure for oil addiction?  	Asjylyn Loder, St. Petersburg Times, Fla.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1011 words  	Nov. 22--The election silenced the cries of "Drill, baby, drill." Plunging oil prices have stilled the hand wringing over energy security. With all eyes on the economy, veterans of past oil shocks may wonder if Americans will once again forget about weening the nation off suddenly cheap oil.LiNeBrEaKThis time, though, looks different. LiNeBrEaKNearly 30 states, including Florida, are forging plans to boost renewable energy and slash greenhouse gases. Business leaders nationwide have called for a clear, nationwide policy. A political consensus has emerged in Washington that something must be done.LiNeBrEaK"We go from shock to trance," President-elect Barack Obama said in an interview with 60 Minutes that aired last Sunday night. "--Prices go back down, and suddenly we act like it's not important, and we start, you know, filling up our SUVs again. And, as a consequence, we never make any progress. It's part of the addiction, all right. That has to be broken. Now is the time to break it."LiNeBrEaKIn the span of two years and one election cycle, the dramatic remaking of energy policy has gone from long odds to a near certainty. Once the luxury we couldn't afford, it's now billed as the opportunity we can't afford to miss.LiNeBrEaK"All of us who are paying attention and watched this election believe that we will have federal renewable-energy legislation," said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. "I actually believe it will be one of the first things that move, because I believe it will be part of a larger energy and economic stimulus package, because it will promote green industry and green jobs."LiNeBrEaK"It may be a little harder, politically," Obama told 60 Minutes, "but it's more important."LiNeBrEaKThe business lobby, once a reliably monolithic opponent to clean-energy rules, has fragmented. Where some businesses still flatly oppose climate legislation, some have shifted gears to support "reasonable" goals. Others, like Florida Crystals, have joined forces with the environmental community in calling for strong renewable targets.LiNeBrEaK"The traditional stereotype was that the business community opposes policies that would cap greenhouse gas emissions. That doesn't exist anymore," said Susan Glickman, the southern region director for the Climate Group, which works with Fortune 500 companies like IBM, Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola to build an economic case for taking action against the greenhouse gases believed to cause climate change.LiNeBrEaKOrganizations like the U.S. Climate Action Partnership and the Chicago Climate Exchange have already engaged willing businesses in efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Solar and wind companies have forged powerful lobbies in states with strong renewable targets, like Texas, New Jersey and Colorado. Large banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup earlier this year established the first "carbon principles" to help measure the risks companies face from climate change and climate legislation.LiNeBrEaKEven the chairman of Chevron, one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, supports a clear and realistic policy on carbon dioxide, the gas believed to cause climate change. Instead of debating whether the United States should regulate greenhouse gases, the debate now centers on how deep the cuts should be.LiNeBrEaK"Getting certainty in policy and certainty in carbon costs is a real positive for everybody," said David Parker, a utility analyst with Robert W. Baird in Tampa. "If Obama can bring some certainty to energy policy in the U.S., I don't necessarily see it as a negative, and I don't think the markets do, either."LiNeBrEaKThe promise of new investment and "green" jobs has a powerful attraction, especially in Florida. Unemployment has risen to 7 percent. Construction and manufacturing workers have been especially hard hit.LiNeBrEaKObama's energy plan calls for the creation of 5-million jobs through an investment of $150-billion over the next decade. Military veterans would get job training under his "Green Vet" initiative. America's idle manufacturing workers will go back to work building wind turbines, hybrid cars and solar panels, he promised. Carpenters, plumbers and electricians will retrofit homes to be more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaKOne study estimated that Florida could create more than 120,000 new jobs by investing in clean energy.LiNeBrEaKGov. Charlie Crist last year launched Florida's efforts to control carbon. He called for the state's utilities to get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy by 2020 and proposed a carbon cap-and-trade system to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKNot everyone sees what Crist has called the "gold in green."LiNeBrEaKBarney Bishop, president and chief executive of Associated Industries of Florida, a business lobbying group that has strongly opposed carbon caps, derided green jobs as a "fantasy." He pointed to a study from the National Association of Manufacturers that said carbon cap legislation could cost Florida up to 117,000 jobs, result in a loss of $11-billion in gross state product by 2020, and decrease Florida's household income by $3,000 a year. The study predicted that electric rates would increase 135 percent by 2030.LiNeBrEaKReducing carbon emissions will cost Floridians money, Bishop said. "Anybody that thinks otherwise is on some pretty good drugs."LiNeBrEaKBishop, though, is a realist. He doesn't believe there's much of a climate crisis. Even if he did believe in global warming -- and he's not saying he does -- he's not sure that industry's carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit. Still, he supports a "realistic" renewable-energy policy, as long as it includes nuclear power.

The Times-Tribune (Scranton, Pennsylvania)  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Former Prep, Duke star offers athletes perspective on sports  	Ashley Teatum, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.  	SPORTS  	904 words  	Nov. 22--Steve Vacendak can tell you a lot about perspective.LiNeBrEaKPerspective, he says, is the "nature of the way you put your mind to doing certain things."LiNeBrEaKHe knows from experience that life looks different from the perspective of a high school basketball player, a Duke University player, a professional in the American Basketball Association, a Division III coach, a Division I athletics director and an executive director for an environmental preservation and education company.LiNeBrEaKVacendak shared his experiences as all of these, as well as his thoughts on the changing atmosphere of sports -- in the professional and the college world -- in his visit to the University of Scranton on Friday. LiNeBrEaKThe Scranton native talked to sports psychology and ethics students during the day, and after, met with a group of coaches and student athletes in the John J. Long, S.J., Center. He stressed the importance of being a well-rounded athlete -- one who completes his education, works hard and doesn't have "tunnel vision."LiNeBrEaK"I think that there are many things that have changed in athletics," said Vacendak, sitting on a couch in the Long Center. "Athletes, especially on a national level, seem to want to bring attention to themselves and promote themselves. ... That person is seen as a role model, and young men and women on other levels want to emulate that. I think that's unfortunate because the athletes I was fortunate to play with were men that I thought were there for the right reasons. They wanted to compete.LiNeBrEaK"They wanted to represent their institutions and do well for themselves, but they weren't in it for themselves."LiNeBrEaKHis various discussions throughout the day prompted a return to many memories at the college and professional levels of basketball. Vacendak started his career as a 7-year-old when he played for St. Paul's in Green Ridge. He went on to play for Scranton Prep, then Duke University. And if you ask him, he can name each coach he's had along the way, including his seventh- and eight-grade mentor, "Coach Gerrity," who Vacendak planned to visit this weekend.LiNeBrEaKWhile at Duke, Vacendak played in two NCAA Final Fours, but was on the team for three. He laughed when asked about "freshman ineligibility," noting that the one time he did not play during the Final Four was his first year of college.LiNeBrEaK"Freshmen are so impatient," he said. "It might not be a bad thing (to have it again). That would at least guarantee them one more year of school."LiNeBrEaKWhen Vacendak graduated Duke, he had the opportunity to play with the San Francisco Warriors, and was offered a first-round contract. He offered to the group of students an astounding figure for a starting salary for first-round draft picks: $15,000.LiNeBrEaK"Guys were really fighting for their jobs," he said to the shocked class. "They needed to feed their families. They were very competitive."LiNeBrEaKAnd instead of taking the offer, he turned it down to attend law school.LiNeBrEaK"The reason a (student) athlete should be admired should not only be because they do something well, but also because they're able to do that and everything else that expected of a student," Vacendak said.LiNeBrEaKVacendak earlier admitted to the group of Dr. Jack O'Malley's sports psychology students that Division III -- the division the university competes in -- has "as close a marriage of ideals and perspective and all the things that are good about athletics."LiNeBrEaKDivision III may not be as competitive as Division I, but these schools emphasize both athletics and education.LiNeBrEaK"All of my teammates graduated in four years," Vacendak said. "Then if we happened to have an opportunity to play pro basketball, fine. The money has changed all that, and the media has influence in playing up these images. It's like a feeding frenzy, and the NBA and other pro sports take advantage of this because that's how they get recognition."LiNeBrEaKFollowing a large chunk of time devoted to athletics, Vacendak simply fell into his current position in life as executive director of NC Beautiful, a North Carolina private non-profit that works to not only preserve the state's environment, but also educate people, especially students, about the ways in which they can cause change.LiNeBrEaK"I was kind of minding my own business and I was approached by the board of directors to apply for the job of executive director," Vacendak explained. "They were I need of certain type of leadership, and although I didn't have an environmental background, I've always appreciated the outdoors. I also had some name recognition that would help the organization get some stature. They wanted to grow in the State of North Carolina.LiNeBrEaK"In addition, I think the opportunity to bring together a lot of different constituencies to work together to implement the mission of the org was central to what they saw in my abilities to do with the organization," he added.LiNeBrEaKAnd although North Carolina is where Vacendak lives, "I still consider Scranton home. Coming back here is so special. It's always nice to visit.LiNeBrEaK"It's really nice to come home."

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	burned, but not Defeated  		AT HOME; Pg. R8  	1226 words  	LITTLE MORE THAN a year ago, Skip Stiles and Margie Mulholland roused their children from bed and fled a fire that would destroy their home.LiNeBrEaKDespite heavy losses, the two gave thanks that their family was alive and unhurt. They vowed to rebuild. They promised to make their home safer, better.LiNeBrEaKTelltale smudges of smoke on the front porch of 1121 Graydon Ave. remind what happened early Nov. 5, 2007. Not much else.LiNeBrEaKStiles and Mulholland have turned their home from charred black to eco-friendly green. LiNeBrEaKA cool-white, fiber-cement siding reflects light and acts as a fire barrier in ways their wooden shingles never could.LiNeBrEaKInside, insulation pads the walls where none hung before. Heating and cooling the 1916 home used to cost a "few hundred'' each month, Stiles said. When the family moves back in January, a geo-thermal heat pump will slice the cost to less than $30 a month, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe couple is picking out counters. One is made with recycled Budweiser brown- and Heineken green-colored glass embedded in a durable resin. It will sit on cabinets constructed from fast-growing plants and emit little or no formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.LiNeBrEaKAll around, an energy-recovery ventilation system will control humidity and preheat or cool incoming air the family breathes. It does so by harnessing building energy.LiNeBrEaK"Both of us are pretty committed to this stuff,'' said Stiles, who serves on the state's Commission on Climate Change and advises Gov. Tim Kaine on how to cut Virginia's emissions.LiNeBrEaK"This is my dream house now,'' said Mulholland, an associate professor in Old Dominion University. "I just think it's so important.''LiNeBrEaKThe home also serves as a learning lab. Neighbors, Norfolk Environmental Commission members and U.S. Green Building Council faithful from Hampton Roads have trooped through.LiNeBrEaKInspectors and trades workers are getting an education, too. Norfolk Plumbing owner Jeff Hux and staff learned how to plumb the home so it could eventually use "gray water'' from sinks and showers to flush toilets or water the yard.LiNeBrEaK"We researched ways how to cut their usage,'' Hux said.LiNeBrEaKSales people pitch what Stiles and Mulholland don't want. Three tried to sell them high-efficiency heat pumps, not the geo-thermal system they wanted.LiNeBrEaK"It's not plug-and-play,'' Stiles said of renovating green.LiNeBrEaKThe couple's home is only the second existing residence in Virginia to be renovated to meet green-building standards by EarthCraft House, an independent third-party rating firm.LiNeBrEaK"This is Cadillac, top of the line,'' said Bob Congdon, a technical inspector for EarthCraft, of the couple's home.LiNeBrEaKHere are some of its features:LiNeBrEaKAtriumLiNeBrEaKTo brighten the interior of the home, the couple added a pair of remote-operated skylights in a rear stairwell to complement one at the front of the house. When open, the skylights will create an updraft, allowing warm air to rise and escape.LiNeBrEaKContractor Nick Shawyer called it an atrium ventilation system and a likely energy saver.LiNeBrEaK"I'm hoping when other people are running their air conditioning, (they've) got the windows open,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKCabinetry and flooringLiNeBrEaKOdd as it may seem, Stiles and Mulholland are covering their floors and cabinets with a type of grass. They call it bamboo. And though it grows in China, and requires considerable energy to bring it stateside, it gets high marks in green building.LiNeBrEaKBamboo is a rapidly renewable resource because it grows to maturity in 5&frac12; to 6 years of age, well within the 10 years needed to receive a U.S. Green Building Council blessing.LiNeBrEaKThe bamboo to be used in the couple's home also will help preserve indoor air quality there. Some has no urea-formaldehyde added to the adhesives, according to its importer, Teragren of Bainbridge Island, Wash.LiNeBrEaKInsulationLiNeBrEaKInsulation is the unsung hero of green living.LiNeBrEaKStiles and Mulholland encapsulated their home with it to stop outdoor air from blowing in and conditioned air from seeping out.LiNeBrEaKThey used tiny bubbles of foam, shredded newspape and rigid foam boards that outperform a similar thicknesses of batts of fiberglass insulation, a less costly product, said Steve Tetreault, owner of The Drying Co. in Williamsburg.LiNeBrEaKTetreault sprayed one-half inch of dense, impermeable foam on the interior of the couple's gutted walls. He then applied 3 inches of cellulose, a mix of recycled newspapers and new wood fiber. Together they achieved an R-value of about R-15, he said. (R-value represents resistance to heat loss.) A similar thickness of fiberglass batts provide a value of R-13, Shawyer said.LiNeBrEaKTetreault also insulated wide band boards between floors with foam to prevent air leaks. He attached rigid foam boards with a value of R-10 to the exterior basement walls to stop humidity. Under the attic rafters, he sprayed a half inch of foam and 10 inches of cellulose for a value that exceeds R-30, Shawyer said.LiNeBrEaKGeo-thermal heat pumpLiNeBrEaKIf Stiles and Mulholland want to make heads swivel at holiday parties, they need utter one sum : $28.LiNeBrEaKThat's how much they'll spend per month, on average, to heat and cool their 3,700-square-foot home, said Ed Battelle with Virginia Service Co. in Virginia Beach.LiNeBrEaKStiles and Mulholland have their geo-thermal heat pump to thank. When running, it will harness ground temperature to control indoor air temperatures. It works by piping water in and out of five wells, each 200 feet deep, in the couple's backyard, Battelle said.LiNeBrEaKIn the winter, the Earth's stable temperatures warm the water in the pipe, which transfers heat to the home. In the summer, the home's heat is absorbed by the water and piped into the wells, where the heat dissipates.LiNeBrEaKThe system also will pre-heat the home's hot water, lessening the load of a planned solar hot water system, Stiles said.LiNeBrEaKA tax savings of at least $2,000 is possible for the geo-thermal system, Battelle said. That would reduce the difference in cost for a geo-thermal heat pump and a new air-to-air heat pump in the home to about $8,000, he said.LiNeBrEaKDisposalLiNeBrEaKShawyer has tried to cut waste by using materials more effeciently.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, his crews used two studs instead of three when framing corners. The California-corner technique eliminates dead space that is hard to insulate .LiNeBrEaKShawyer also separates his trash. Crews dump brick, block, glass, metals, porcelain, tile and untreated wood in a bin bound for Waterway Recycling in Chesapeake.LiNeBrEaKThere, woods are ground into mulch. Brick and block are recycled. Drywall and insulation go to a landfill.LiNeBrEaKSo far, Shawyer's crews have recycled 8&frac12; tons of material and trashed 7&frac34; tons.LiNeBrEaK"Who knew there was this big recycling place?'' Shawyer said.LiNeBrEaKOne of his roofing crew did and passed the word.LiNeBrEaKJeanne Mooney, (757) 446-2043, jeanne.mooney@pilotonline.comLiNeBrEaKabout the coverLiNeBrEaKCover design by Luis Vilches, The Virginian-PilotLiNeBrEaKCover photo by Genevieve Ross insulationLiNeBrEaKStiles and Mulholland's home uses tiny bubbles of foam, shredded newspaper and rigid foam boards that outperform similar thicknesses of batts of fiberglass insulation. atriumLiNeBrEaKThe couple added remote-operated skylights in a stairwell to complement a skylight at the front of the house.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	November 22, 2008 Saturday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Massive glaciers discovered on Mars may solve puzzle  	JOHN JOHNSON JR.  	FRONT; Pg. A12  	353 words  	By John Johnson Jr.LiNeBrEaKLos Angeles TimesLiNeBrEaKIn a discovery that partly answers the question of where all the water went on Mars, scientists have found vast, debris-covered glaciers much nearer to the equatorial region than anyone had expected, according to a report Friday in the journal Science. LiNeBrEaKThe glaciers, estimated to contain at least as much water as Lake Huron and possibly as much as all of the Great Lakes combined, were found by ground-penetrating radar on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.LiNeBrEaK"We have found a big chunk of the missing water that people have known must be there," said Ali Safaeinili, a member of the radar team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge, Calif.LiNeBrEaKScientists analyzing Martian topography have seen lots of evidence of water-caused erosion , but the only deposits of ice had been seen at the poles.LiNeBrEaKOne of the glaciers has been estimated as being the size of Los Angeles and as much as half a mile thick.LiNeBrEaKHow did the ice get there? The best guess, said John W. Holt, a researcher for the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Texas, is that climate change was brought on by changes in Mars' rotational axis over time. Because Mars doesn't have a large moon to keep its axis relatively stable, as the Earth does, the planet can tilt dramatically, redistributing the sun's heat and energy and shifting the poles around.LiNeBrEaKThe icy deposits may have lain hidden in their current state for as long as 200 million years, Holt said.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery wasn't a complete surprise. Scientists had previously noticed rocky debris "aprons" that seemed to flow away from steep hills as if something underground was lubricating their movements.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery could be one of the most significant yet for those who want to see a staffed mission to Mars. That goal was announced by President George W. Bush in 2004 but has since been de-emphasized by NASA.LiNeBrEaKbig as the Great LakesLiNeBrEaKThe glaciers, found near the equatorial region of the planet, are estimated to hold as much water as Lake Huron and perhaps as much as all of the Great Lakes, above. One glacier may be as large as Los Angeles.

The Washington Times 	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Waxman warned to protect Big 3;  Energy panel could limit emissions 	By Tom LoBianco, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A02  	586 words  	House Minority Leader John A. Boehner congratulated Rep. Henry A. Waxman upon his election as the new chairman of the House energy panel, and then warned the California Democrat not to let his state stiffen car-emission standards because of the damage that it likely would do to the nation's ailing carmakers.LiNeBrEaK"This change would effectively bar the American auto manufacturers from competing in the largest market in America, unless they make substantial changes in manufacturing that would increase costs to consumers, making the 'Big 3' even less competitive - and making their collapse even more likely," Mr. Boehner, Ohio Republican, wrote in his letter to Mr. Waxman. LiNeBrEaKMr. Boehner, who recently won another term as leader of the House Republicans, repeated a familiar point in his letter: Tougher environmental restrictions likely will cost jobs and further harm the nation's economy.LiNeBrEaK"Mr. Waxman has a different perspective on this issue than Mr. Boehner, but he will give his views full consideration," said Karen Lightfoot, a spokeswoman for Mr. Waxman.LiNeBrEaKMr. Waxman's intra-party coup Thursday that unseated Rep. John D. Dingell, Michigan Democrat, signaled a more liberal, pro-environment tilt for the key House Energy and Commerce Committee in the upcoming session of Congress, observers say.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental and industry groups largely lauded Mr. Waxman's selection this week, and his congressional colleagues said the move marks a "sea change" from the past eight years in Washington.LiNeBrEaKBut House Republican leaders criticized House Democrats for upending Congress' informal system of seniority, which largely dictates the ascension to power, by choosing the more junior Mr. Waxman.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia lawmakers have bristled since the Environmental Protection Agency blocked the state's efforts to impose carbon-emission standards tougher than the federal regulations. Mr. Waxman co-sponsored legislation earlier this year which would have granted the state a waiver, allowing it to impose the tougher standards.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that a special committee investigating global warming would continue its work for two more years.LiNeBrEaK"I think we do have a need for one more term, because our work is not finished," Mrs. Pelosi said Friday morning. "We do not have the climate-change legislation that I had hoped we might be closer to, at least at this point. The committee serves a tremendous intellectual resource purpose for me to get the scientific basis for how we go forward, and it is a big problem. It is as big as the world, literally and figuratively."LiNeBrEaKMrs. Pelosi first impaneled the global warming committee in 2007, shortly after ascending to the speaker's seat. It was widely perceived then as an attempt to do an end run around Mr. Dingell, a longtime champion of the auto industry.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental measures, including cap-and-trade measures to reduce carbon emissions and plans to spend $150 billion on "green" energy projects, are expected to be leading policy initiatives.LiNeBrEaKThe select committee, chaired by Massachusetts Democrat Edward J. Markey, released its final report Friday, squarely pinning the blame for global warming on man-made causes.LiNeBrEaK"The scientific debate on the cause of global warming is over," the committee report reads. "A clear scientific consensus now holds that global warming is happening, that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are largely responsible, and that failure to dramatically reduce those emissions in the coming decades will result in catastrophic impacts."

The Washington Post 	November 22, 2008 Saturday   Regional Edition	Rushed Regulations;  Agencies ignore a White House deadline on rule changes. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A14  	471 words  	ACKNOWLEDGING "the historical tendency of administrations to increase regulatory activity in their final months," White House Chief of Staff  Joshua B. Bolten issued a directive to federal agencies in May to release any final regulations before Nov. 1. The administration billed this as a bit of "good government." We would agree, were it not for new rules with broad implications that continue to churn their way to adoption long after Mr. Bolten's   deadline. LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department wants to revise the application of the Endangered Species Act. The Environmental Protection Agency wants to do the same  with the Clean Air Act. If what's being proposed goes through,  air quality in and around national parks, and threatened plant and animal species, would be imperiled. President-elect Barack Obama might be saddled withLiNeBrEaKpolicies that run counter to his environmental vision.LiNeBrEaKInterior's action on the Endangered Species Act was the result of listing the polar bear in May as "threatened" under that law  because of climate change. The statute was never intended to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet and melting the Arctic ice habitat of polar bears. So Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne proposed stripping the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and other agencies of their roles in consulting with federal departments on building projects that are "likely to adversely affect" a listed species. The rationale that their experience complying with the Endangered Species Act gives agencies enough expertise to determine for themselves whether a project is likely to harm a species, not just polar bears, is flawed. Without those protective services in the consultative loop, there will be no check against the ambitions of agencies that want to complete projects -- and no safeguard for threatened and endangered species in the agencies' path.LiNeBrEaKOver at the EPA, construction of coal-fired power plants and other polluting facilities  would be allowed  near national parks and wilderness areas under a revised method of measuring air quality, according to documents  obtained by Post writer Juliet  Eilperin. This most certainly could lead to more plants spewing more pollutants, clouding the air and degrading the parks. Ms.  Eilperin also reported that there is vigorous resistance among EPA regional administrators to this change.LiNeBrEaKWhich brings us back to Mr. Bolten. In his May directive, Mr. Bolten noted that exceptions would be made to the Nov. 1 deadline in "extraordinary circumstances," which were not defined. Given that neither the EPA's nor the Interior Department's rule change is needed for the  continued functioning of the republic for the next 60 days,  Mr. Bolten should hold true to his good-government instincts and order the EPA and Interior to stand down.

Wyoming Tribune-Eagle  	November 22, 2008 Saturday 	Energy--producing farms might be way to keep landowners working  	Bill McCarthy, Wyoming Tribune-Eagle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	618 words  	Nov. 22--CHEYENNE -- Growing energy won't replace crops like corn or wheat as a staple for feeding the nation, but it may help keep the farmer on the farm and the rancher on the ranch.LiNeBrEaKThe Rocky Mountain Farmers Union is holding a panel discussion at 9: 30 a.m. today at Little America Hotel and Resort that Laramie County farmers and ranchers may find helpful. LiNeBrEaK"We want to create incentive--based approaches" to producing and transmitting energy on private land, said Tony Frank, the Union's director of renewable Energy Development.LiNeBrEaKFrank will be on the panel today and said incentive--based approaches mean income for landowners.LiNeBrEaKThe panel will also include Robert "Mac" McLellan, a senior vice president at Tri--State Generation and Transmission Association, and Bob Mailander of the Colorado governor's energy office.LiNeBrEaKThe discussion is open to the public and is part of the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union annual convention, which began yesterday and continues today.LiNeBrEaKThere will also be a presentation and panel discussion on the difficulties in livestock production, particularly industrial meat production in light of a controversial report issued by the Pew Foundation.LiNeBrEaKBob Martin, executive director of the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, and Bernard E. Rollin, a professor and bioethicist at Colorado State University as well as a commission member, will be joined by local livestock producers.LiNeBrEaKFrank said on the energy front the organization has distributed $330,000 to 68 agricultural producers in the region through its newly formed Carbon Credit program.LiNeBrEaKThe program allows landowners to earn income by storing carbon in their soil.LiNeBrEaKCarbon credits are sold on the Chicago Climate Exchange.LiNeBrEaKThey are earned by conservation tillage, long--term grass seeding practices, native rangeland enhancement, forestry and with methane capture projects.LiNeBrEaKWhile the credit price is low at the moment, Frank said, it is expected to rise once the federal government gets into carbon management.LiNeBrEaKBut Frank adds that is only one of many programs.LiNeBrEaKThe Union's Cooperative and Economic Development Center works with farmers and ranchers and rural communities throughout the Rocky Mountain region to support energy projects.LiNeBrEaKIt also works to help agriculture producers save money on the energy they use.LiNeBrEaKMark Bowman is on the board of an organization called 25x25.LiNeBrEaKHe is also a wheat, corn and alfalfa producer from Wray, Colo.LiNeBrEaKThe goal of 25x25 is to get 25 percent of America's energy from renewable resources like wind, solar and biofuels by the year 2025.LiNeBrEaK"We've got the resources," Bowman said, "and we can do it."LiNeBrEaKWith some leadership on energy issues, he said, "there is a lot to be optimistic about."LiNeBrEaKWhether farmers and ranchers believe in global warming, and whether it is man made, is beside the point, he added. "There are new opportunities in rural America."LiNeBrEaKMike McCoy, a senior engineer with Tri--State Generation and Transmission Association, said the association is also a resource for landowners.LiNeBrEaKThe association, which supplies power to co--ops in Wyoming and other states, works to help ranchers conserve and get into renewables.LiNeBrEaKIt also negotiates transmission right--of--ways and through modern computer graphics can show landowners what their property would look like with electric lines.

Centre Daily Times (Pennsylvania)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Penn State scientists sequence genome of woolly mammoth  	Anne Danahy, Centre Daily Times, State College, Pa.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	801 words  	Nov. 21--Scientists at Penn State have become the first to sequence the genome of an extinct species, using hair from the woolly mammoth to create a map of the long-dead animals' DNA.LiNeBrEaKWebb Miller, professor of biology and computer science and engineering, and Stephan C. Schuster, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology, led the project. A report on it will be in today's issue of Nature magazine.LiNeBrEaKTheir project also marks the first time an animal genome has been sequenced from hair, not blood or bone. Schuster said hair is like a "biological plastic" that preserves the DNA. LiNeBrEaKThe research has led to a better understanding of the evolution of the woolly mammoth, which separated into two groups 2 million years ago. One subpopulation died off about 45,000 years ago and the other became extinct about 10,000 years ago, according to the university.LiNeBrEaKThe work also opens the door to the possibility that the woolly mammoth could live again at some point in the future.LiNeBrEaKAmong the team's findings is that the woolly mammoths weren't very varied, genetically speaking.LiNeBrEaK"We discovered that individual woolly mammoths were so genetically similar to one another that they may have been especially susceptible to being wiped out by a disease, by a change in the climate, or by humans," Schuster said.LiNeBrEaKAlex Greenwood, a biology professor at Old Dominion University who also studies ancient DNA, called the research "an amazing achievement."LiNeBrEaKScientists hope the knowledge gained will help them stop other animals from becoming extinct.LiNeBrEaK"If you want to understand extinction genetically, you need to be able to sequence over some range of times and geography individuals of a species that actually went extinct," Miller said.LiNeBrEaKIn particular, Miller and Schuster have been studying the Tasmanian devil, a small dog-sized marsupial native to Australia. An infectious facial cancer is putting the species at risk of extinction.LiNeBrEaK"We have begun to understand how important biological diversity is for maintaining a species. So we take a lack of biodiversity as a sign of imminent extinction," Schuster said.LiNeBrEaKBy identifying animals that are more beneficial to breed, Schuster said the work will help maintain the species. In this case, Tasmanian devils that are resistant to the cancer can be selected for breeding.LiNeBrEaKThe woolly mammoth project has been several years in the making and the source of the mammoth hair might surprise some: eBay.LiNeBrEaKSchuster cautioned that while mammoth hair is sold on eBay, it is important to obtain it in an appropriate way, with scientific verification, so as not to support the destruction of something that otherwise could be a source of knowledge.LiNeBrEaKNatives of Siberia, he explained, have the right to collect material from the surface of the permafrost. One of the things they collect is woolly mammoth hair that comes to the surface over time.LiNeBrEaKThe project involved sequencing 4 billion DNA bases. Of those, 3. 3 billion are confirmed as belonging the mammoth. The remaining DNA bases could also contain DNA from bacteria, insects or other organisms.LiNeBrEaKOnce researchers at Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard finish an ongoing project to map the DNA of the African elephant, a relative of the woolly mammoth, work can begin to confirm the origin of the remaining DNA bases, Penn State researchers said.LiNeBrEaKThe research also raises the possibility of reincarnating the woolly mammoth. Schuster says that it should be possible to someday re-create any extinct creature "within the last 100,000 years" as long as it got trapped in permafrost and had hair.LiNeBrEaK"By deciphering this genome we could, in theory, generate data that one day may help other researchers to bring the woolly mammoth back to life by inserting the uniquely mammoth DNA sequences into the genome of the modern-day elephant," Schuster said in a news release.LiNeBrEaK"This would allow scientists to retrieve the genetic information that was believed to have been lost when the mammoth died out, as well as to bring back an extinct species that modern humans have missed meeting by only a few thousand years."LiNeBrEaKBut for now, Miller said he is more interested in preventing the extinction of large mammals than resurrecting any extinct species.LiNeBrEaKBesides, he said, when that becomes possible, we could bring back Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe or other, more interesting, animals.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Rail-like bus service proposed at AC Transit  	By Denis Cuff CONTRA COSTA TIMES  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Commuting; Contra Costa; News; Local  	755 words  	Call it a bus service that acts like a railway: spacious vehicles arriving every four or five minutes to zip riders along on lanes reserved exclusively for them.LiNeBrEaKThe payoff: more riders, less smog and global warming gases, and an overhaul of the image of public transit buses, from slow and creaky to speedy and cool.LiNeBrEaKThe Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District is rolling toward key decisions in the next two years on its plan to build a $234 million bus rapid transit system along a 17-mile route to connect downtown Berkeley, Oakland and San Leandro. LiNeBrEaKBut bus rapid transit, known as BRT for short, still faces hurdles as the board gears up to make final decisions on the project and its precise route in 2010.LiNeBrEaKSome residents of Berkeley fiercely oppose bus rapid transit, saying it would steal scarce parking spaces and open the door for higher-density development in or near residential neighborhoods.LiNeBrEaK"Bus rapid transit is a terrible idea" said Mary Oram of Berkeley. "AC Transit is trying to shove BRT on us in an area where it doesn't fit. I want to live in Berkeley, not in San Francisco."LiNeBrEaKSeveral project opponents told the AC Transit board Wednesday they will continue to fight bus rapid transit, even though Berkeley voters decided by a 3-to-1 ratio Nov. 4 against a ballot measure that would have required a citywide referendum on limiting lanes to buses.LiNeBrEaKIn another hurdle, AC Transit needs approval from city governments in Berkeley, Oakland and San Leandro to use their streets for bus rapid transit.LiNeBrEaKTo minimize the loss of parking in a few areas, the transit district already has agreed to scrub plans for bus-only lanes along some of the route and instead route the express buses into regular traffic.LiNeBrEaKOne such area is a portion of East 14th Avenue in San Leandro. Talks continue among staffers at the three cities and AC Transit over the route alignment and how much should be limited to buses.LiNeBrEaK"There are places where bus-only lanes don't work," said Jim Cunradi, AC Transit's bus rapid transit manager. "But you need to have enough of the route as bus-only lanes to make the project function at a high level   to provide fast, reliable bus service."LiNeBrEaKMuch of the proposed route would run from downtown Berkeley along Telegraph Avenue to International Boulevard in Oakland, and on East 14th Street in San Leandro to the Bay Fair BART station.LiNeBrEaKSome 49 stations would be built on elevated street medians where passengers could buy tickets at self-service machines for quick loading onto buses.LiNeBrEaKAbout $161 million of the $234 million cost is already lined up from state and local funds, including bridge toll money and sales tax. But AC Transit also needs to land a $72 million federal grant.LiNeBrEaKToward that end, the AC Transit Board agreed Wednesday to seek proposals for contractors to spend up to $250,000 to come up with a branding identity for the project   including a logo, decals, colors and perhaps a name.LiNeBrEaKBus rapid transit critics complained it is premature to spend the $250,000 to polish the image of a project not yet approved.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's outrageous to pay that much," said Joyce Roy, an unsuccessful AC Transit board candidate in this month's election.LiNeBrEaKAC Transit managers said they need to develop a brand to compete for the federal grant and to help explain the project to the public.LiNeBrEaKCritics contend that AC Transit instead ought to run frequent "rapid" buses along busy routes without restricting lanes to buses only. Under this proposal, passenger loading could be speeded up if AC Transit set up a way for passengers to buy bus tickets in advance at local stores, they said.LiNeBrEaKCunradi said dropping the plan for bus-only lanes would sacrifice speedy and reliable service.LiNeBrEaKRelying on stores to sell tickets is unreliable, he said, because stores are closed many hours when buses run.LiNeBrEaKCunradi agreed parking space losses are a serious issue. To offset the impact, the transit district will consider developing parking lots or garages, or installing parking meters on commercial side streets so the spaces turn over faster, he said.LiNeBrEaKGreg Harper, an AC Transit board member from Emeryville, said the fear of denser development is an underlying fear that has fueled opposition to bus rapid transit.LiNeBrEaKHarper conceded that denser development might occur, but he said it is up to cities, not the transit district, to make land-use decisions.LiNeBrEaK"It's our job to create transit opportunities," he said, "not to limit them."LiNeBrEaKReach Denis Cuff at 925-943-8267 or www.actransit.org/.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Detroit Free Press Brian Dickerson column: How climate change felled the mighty John Dingell  	Brian Dickerson, Detroit Free Press  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	648 words  	Nov. 21--He dreamed of going out the way every politician dreams of going out -- gracefully, on his own terms, with the taste of victory fresh in his mouth.LiNeBrEaKAs things turned out, John Dingell's fall from power looked more like King Kong's roaring tumble from the top of the Empire State Building.LiNeBrEaKAnd for those who like their political symbolism laid on with a trowel, it was fitting that Dingell's ouster as chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee capped a week in which lawmakers bearing torches and pitchforks all but chased the Detroit Three's CEOs up the runways of their Gulfstream jets. LiNeBrEaKIronically, Dingell was probably as excited about the ascendency of Barack Obama as any Michigan Democrat (even if he did back Obama's rival, Hillary Clinton, in the primaries).LiNeBrEaKHe sensed the tide was finally turning in his lifelong crusade for national health insurance, and imagined that he might end his storied career by spearheading passage of the universal heath care legislation his father first introduced in 1943.LiNeBrEaKSorry about that, Mr. Chairman. I guess this just wasn't the week to be known as the congressman from General Motors.LiNeBrEaKThe wresting of the torchLiNeBrEaKWhat does Dingell's defeat by California Democrat Henry Waxman signify?LiNeBrEaKLet me count the metaphors:LiNeBrEaKThere's generational change: Dingell had been a member of the House for nearly two decades when Waxman was elected to Congress as a member of the Watergate Class of 1974.LiNeBrEaKThere's shifting population: California now boasts 53 congressional seats, 10 more than when Waxman first came to Washington. Michigan's congressional delegation has shrunk to 15 -- a decrease of four seats -- in the same interval.LiNeBrEaKThere's cultural evolution: Dingell's district includes the working-class suburbs of Taylor, Woodhaven and Flat Rock; Waxman's comprises Beverly Hills, West Hollywood and Santa Monica.LiNeBrEaKAnd, of course, there's policy: Dingell has spent the better part of his career protecting the auto industry from the environmentalists Waxman has championed.LiNeBrEaKLeading the climate-change chargeLiNeBrEaKDingell has been losing ground on all these fronts, and in that sense his defeat in Thursday's leadership showdown with Waxman may have been what the social scientists call overdetermined.LiNeBrEaKBut if I had to single out one factor, it would be the newly fortified Democratic majority's determination to enact legislation that dramatically alters the incentives and penalties for consuming oil -- and the judgment of congressional leaders and key figures in the nascent Obama administration that Dingell was not the guy they wanted leading the charge.LiNeBrEaKThat judgment may yet prove shortsighted. Dingell has a long record of helping domestic automakers beat back tougher fuel economy standards, and many environmentalists saw his late enlistment in the crusade against global warming as a strategic move to protect Detroit's interests.LiNeBrEaKBut Dingell also has been a masterful coalition-builder. And, in order to succeed, any legislative initiative to wean Americans from fossil fuels will have to gore plenty of oxen outside the industrial Midwest.LiNeBrEaKPassing meaningful climate-change legislation will entail securing significant concessions from a host of well-defended industries: housing and manufacturing, mining and agriculture, energy and transportation.LiNeBrEaKThe whole country is about to discover whether Waxman has the chops to negotiate that gauntlet as skillfully as Dingell has.LiNeBrEaKContact BRIAN DICKERSON at 248-351-3697 or bdickerson@freepress.com	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); LEGISLATORS (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (88%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (76%); POLITICAL PARTIES (76%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (75%); PRIMARY ELECTIONS (73%); AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (71%); GOVERNMENT HEALTH INSURANCE (71%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (71%); NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (67%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (66%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (65%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (65%); HEALTH INSURANCE (53%); HUMANITIES and SOCIAL SCIENCE (50%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (55%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (55%)  		GMP (PAR) (55%); GMB (BRU) (55%); GM (NYSE) (55%) NYSE:GM  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (55%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (55%) General  	JOHN DINGELL (96%); BARACK OBAMA (92%); HENRY WAXMAN (83%); HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (56%)  	DETROIT, MI, USA (79%) MICHIGAN, USA (93%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	November 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Detroit Free Press   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081121-DE-Detroit-Free-Press-Brian-Dickerson-column-1121  	DE  													
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Changing of the guard in Congress;  Dingell's fall, Waxman's rise, Stevens' farewell show power shift 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A3  	445 words  	WASHINGTON -- Age and seniority gave way in Congress on Thursday, a transformational shift for an institution where tremendous power has traditionally been built on sheer longevity, accumulated and savored with the passage of years. LiNeBrEaKThe farewell speech of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 85, a 40-year member, came on the same day that House Democrats deposed Rep. John Dingell, D-Dearborn, 82, a 53-year member, from his chairmanship. It was one of those moments when lawmakers could almost hear an era ending.LiNeBrEaKNot only Stevens and Dingell found themselves treated like old bulls put out to pasture. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who turned 91 on Thursday and has amassed 56 years in Congress, had already voluntarily relinquished the chairmanship of his Appropriations Committee before his colleagues could ease him out.LiNeBrEaKThe abrupt change in status for the three lawmakers sent this fact swirling around Capitol Hill -- their combined age of 258 exceeds the age of the United States itself.LiNeBrEaKRep. Henry Waxman, 69, D-California, defeated Dingell on a 137-122 vote in the Democratic Party caucus, capping a bruising intraparty fight. Waxman has been in the House since 1975. He is an avid environmentalist and booster of health care programs -- and a home-state ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.LiNeBrEaKDingell has been the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel for 28 years and is an old-school supporter of Detroit's automakers. His battles with Waxman over clean air issues date to the Reagan administration. Recently, Waxman complained the committee has been too slow to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKDingell comes from an era of autocratic committee chairmen and has had to adapt to a House in which power is consolidated around Pelosi.LiNeBrEaK"Congressman Dingell has been a dear friend and a valuable, trusted colleague of mine over the years, and I am saddened that his Democratic colleagues voted today to remove him from his position," said Rep. Vern Ehlers, R-Grand Rapids.LiNeBrEaKRep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Holland said Dingell's ouster "is bad for Michigan, bad for the auto industry and significantly diminishes our delegation's influence in Congress."LiNeBrEaKThe careers of other very senior lawmakers also were coming to a close, including that of Sen. John Warner, 81, the Virginia Republican elected 30 years ago; Sen. Pete Domenici, 76, the New Mexico Republican who spent 36 years in the Senate, and Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, 84, a 36-year veteran of the House.LiNeBrEaKYounger lawmakers say they are being inspired to assert themselves, spurred in some respects by the success of President-elect Barack Obama, a first-term senator who this year battered the seniority system on his way to the White House.

Hernando Today (Brooksville, Florida)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Dry Winter Expected  	Tony Holt, Hernando Today, Brooksville, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	370 words  	Nov. 21--WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The area has not escaped the threat of another drought.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, it is expected to become reality again by the end of the winter. LiNeBrEaKThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Thursday it was predicting a drier-than-normal winter for the Southeast, including Florida.LiNeBrEaK"It does look like a drought could develop in the Tampa area," said Michael Halpert, the deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.LiNeBrEaKThe annual Winter Outlook predicts the meteorological winter, which lasts from December through February.LiNeBrEaKThe Climate Prediction Center also is calling for warmer-than-normal temperatures for the central part of the U.S.LiNeBrEaKThere is no strong indication the upcoming winter will be cooler or warmer than normal for Tampa and the rest of Florida, Halpert said.LiNeBrEaK"It's definitely going to be dry, but temperature-wise, it doesn't look like there's any strong symbol showing it will be cool or warm," he said.LiNeBrEaKMeteorologists have admitted this winter is a difficult one to predict due to the absence of La Nina or El Nino in the Pacific Ocean. They have had to look at climate patterns over the Arctic and North Atlantic regions to anticipate the upcoming weather trends across the country, according to a NOAA media release.LiNeBrEaKThe Winter Outlook does not include a snowfall forecast. Such a forecast is dependent upon winter storms, which are not predictable more than several days in advance.LiNeBrEaKWhile the tropical storm season brought rain to the region, it was not enough to prevent another drought from occurring, said Don Ruths, of the Florida Division of Forestry.LiNeBrEaK"We're not in a drought right now, but the conditions are dry enough where we're at the tipping point," he said.

Hindustan Times (New Delhi)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	'My dream is to sing with Asha'  	Nikhil Taneja, Hindustan Times, New Delhi  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	893 words  	Nov. 21--The next six months will witness a virtual influx of top class acts from the international music stratosphere.LiNeBrEaKLive Earth kicks off on December 7 at the city's Andheri Sports Complex. The chart killers who have been confirmed for the mega rock show are Bon Jovi, Anoushka Shankar and Will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. Pink Floyd's Roger Waters (again, yah!) and oi, Leonardo DiCaprio are expected to attend.LiNeBrEaKAfter that, Iron Maiden arrives in February, Anastasia around June, Def Leppard and Whitesnake who had cancelled their India concerts will arrive "sometime soon." LiNeBrEaKWill.i.am (that's the way he spells it) of the Black Eyed Peas was interviewed by rocked-out-of-his-skull Nikhil Taneja.LiNeBrEaK'The future of the world..is in India'LiNeBrEaKAre you clued into the Indian music scene at all?LiNeBrEaKNot much but I would really like to develop an international act here. Latin music has a Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. Americans have Fergie and Beyonce. Australians have Natalie Imbruglia. But there's no big youth Indian music star, which is unfortunate. There is so much talent there but no one knows that.LiNeBrEaKWhen you come to Mumbai this year, will you sign any Indian artiste for your music label?LiNeBrEaKI'm actually looking to help produce and develop a big international Indian act.LiNeBrEaKSnoop Dogg collaborated for a song in a Bollywood movie this year. Are you planning something similar?LiNeBrEaKI don't have any singles yet, but I am planning to do something with a friend when I get to India. I have invited my friend Sophie (Choudhary) to sing some songs with me on stage.LiNeBrEaKAny studio collaborations likely?LiNeBrEaKIt's really my dream to sing with Asha Bhosle. I would love it.. love it, love it, love it. She is a legend.LiNeBrEaKHave Indian melodies ever inspired you?LiNeBrEaKWe have used some traditional Indian music in our song Don't funk with my heart (sings the tune). There is no reason why Indian music should be confined to India. It should be heard across the world.LiNeBrEaKWhat makes India such an important destination that it has been chosen as the venue for the Live Earth concert?LiNeBrEaKIndia is very important because it is literally the centre of the world. Everything is around you guys.. South-East Asia, Middle East and east Europe on top.LiNeBrEaKHow can music raise awareness about the Live Earth cause of climate change?LiNeBrEaKMusic can really help save the planet. It can raise issues. Songs can touch people much more than speeches of politicians.LiNeBrEaKPlease elaborate..LiNeBrEaKIf a  politician were to speak in India in his or her own language, the message won't be clear. But if I compose a song on an issue and it is a beautiful song.. and if someone sings it in India, the message has carried through, inspiring people to change.LiNeBrEaKIs that the reason for your video &acirc;[#x20ac]"&acirc;[#x20ac]"  Yes we can -- used for the Barack Obama election campaign?LiNeBrEaKThe motivation for the video was  Barack Obama's speech in New Hampshire earlier this year.  The video had a  phenomenal impact.. it wasn't even up for sale. People passed it around the Internet.LiNeBrEaKYou recently released another video, A New day, after Obama won.LiNeBrEaKUntil a couple of months ago, Africans, Mexicans, Cubans, Indians, all nationalities outside of Europe, were stuck at the bottom in America. But Barrack Obama has promised to execute a concept in which America will go from bottom to the top, not just in corporations and finances.. but also in politics.LiNeBrEaKIn the animation movie, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, you've done the voice-over for a hippo and sung Big and chunky. Ever thought you'd write a song for a hippo?LiNeBrEaK(Laughs) No, I never thought that. I wrote and composed the song on the spot because I thought it was a great moment in the movie.LiNeBrEaKYou are now acting in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Is acting a tough call?LiNeBrEaKOh, acting is really hard. I've been such a big fan of X-Men that it's unbelievable that I got the role. Music is always easy for me though.. since I'm just letting out what's inside  me. (Laughs) I find interviews the hardest, actually.LiNeBrEaKYou are now an established solo act. How do you keep that apart from the Black Eyed Peas music?LiNeBrEaKThough I've have released a solo album, I'm now more into multi-media as an artiste. I  make content that comes out of the music culture and spread it through the Internet. I have a network online, I blog and talk about issues.LiNeBrEaKSince Fergie and you have both gone solo, there are rumours about Black Eyed Peas breaking up. You've even called your next album The E N D.LiNeBrEaKI know about the rumours but The E N D really signifies change. It has been the end of corruption in America, the negativity in the world against America is ending..even the music industry has changed. E N D stands for Energy Never Dies.  The record should come out in March or April next year.LiNeBrEaKWhere do you think India stands in the changing scenario globally?LiNeBrEaKAmerica was a dominating force from 1900 till today. But I believe from 2000 and beyond, India will play a huge role in shaping human civilisation. The future of the world lies right there, in India.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 21, 2008 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	EPA rules to weaken protection due today;  Obama can't easily reverse them, but Congress can 	DINA CAPPIELLO, Associated Press  	A; Pg. 25  	323 words  	WASHINGTON - Animals and plants in danger of becoming extinct could lose the protection of government experts who make sure that dams, highways and other projects don't pose a threat, under regulations the Bush administration is set to put in place before President-elect Obama can reverse them. LiNeBrEaKThe rules must be published today to take effect before Obama is sworn in Jan. 20. Otherwise, he can undo them with the stroke of a pen.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department rushed to complete the rules in three months over the objections of lawmakers and environmentalists who argued that they would weaken how a landmark conservation law is applied.LiNeBrEaKA Nov. 12 version of the final rules has changed little from the original proposal, despite the more than 250,000 comments received since it was first proposed in August.LiNeBrEaKRules can be reviewedLiNeBrEaKThe rules eliminate the input of federal wildlife scientists in some endangered species cases, allowing the federal agency in charge of building, authorizing or funding a project to determine if it is likely to harm endangered wildlife and plants.LiNeBrEaKCurrent regulations require independent wildlife biologists to sign off on these decisions before a project can go forward, at times modifying the design to better protect species.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations also bar federal agencies from assessing emissions of the gases blamed for global warming on species and habitats, a tactic environmentalists have tried to use to block new coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKTina Kreisher, an Interior spokeswoman, could not confirm whether the rule would be published before the deadline.LiNeBrEaK"We started this; we want to finish this," Kreisher said.LiNeBrEaKIf the rules go into effect before Obama takes office, they will be difficult to overturn since it would require the new administration to restart the rule-making process. Congress, however, could reverse the rules through the Congressional Review Act - a law that allows review of new federal regulations.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 21, 2008 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	2025 forecast: Al-Qaida may be on the wane;  Intel agencies say terror group has been unable to attract support 	SCOTT SHANE, New York Times  	A; Pg. 3  	402 words  	WASHINGTON - A new study of the global future by U.S. intelligence agencies suggests that al-Qaida could soon be on the decline, having alienated Muslim supporters with indiscriminate killing and inattention to the practical problems of poverty, unemployment and education. LiNeBrEaKWhile not contradicting intelligence assessments suggesting that al-Qaida remains a major threat with a strong presence in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the report says that the group "may decay sooner" than many experts have assumed because of severe weaknesses: "unachievable strategic objectives, inability to attract broad-based support and self-destructive actions."LiNeBrEaK"The appeal of terrorism is waning," said Mathew J. Burrows, head of long-range analysis in the office of the director of national intelligence and a lead author of "Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World." Burrows said polls and anecdotal evidence strongly suggested disillusionment among Muslims with al-Qaida and its methods and goals since the 2001 terrorist attacks.LiNeBrEaKThe predicted decline of al-Qaida is one of the few bright spots in the generally gloomy report, which describes a decline in the United States' world dominance as China, India and other powers assert themselves.LiNeBrEaKBy 2025, it predicted, "the U.S. will find itself as one of a number of important actors on the world stage," playing "a prominent role in global events" but not a decisive one as in the past.LiNeBrEaK`Without precedent'LiNeBrEaKThe report said the global shift from West to East in terms of wealth and economic power "is without precedent in modern history." Of a projected population increase of 1. 2 billion worldwide by 2025, onlyLiNeBrEaK3 percent will take place in Western countries, it said.LiNeBrEaKThe report describes a world riven by increased conflict over scarce food and water supplies and threatened by rogue states and terrorists, widening gaps between rich and poor and an uneven impact of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe report said Russia's emergence as a world power was "clouded" by persistent corruption and lagging investment in its critical energy industry. It also noted, without naming a specific country, that a government in Eastern Europe "could be effectively taken over and run by organized crime."LiNeBrEaKThe Global Trends reports are produced every four years by the National Intelligence Council, which represents all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, in part to inform long-term thinking by new administrations.

The Houston Chronicle 	November 21, 2008 Friday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Waxman claims energy panel post bid for energy post;  New chairman has been critic of oil industry 	DAVID IVANOVICH, STEWART POWELL, HOUSTON CHRONICLE WASHINGTON BUREAU, STAFF  	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	816 words  	WASHINGTON - California Democrat Henry Waxman, a longtime critic of the oil industry and a fierce advocate for climate change legislation, will soon take the gavel at the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee.LiNeBrEaKIn a bitterly contested intraparty vote, Waxman, 69, Thursday ousted the 82-year-old dean of the House, John Dingell of Michigan, as chairman of the committee, which originates much of Congress' energy and environmental legislation.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's new role adds another worry for an oil and gas industry already confronting a severe recession, plunging crude prices and a Democratic administration committed to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaK"Houston has a problem," said Kevin Book, an oil and energy policy analyst with FBR Capital Markets. "But it had a problem anyway."LiNeBrEaKDuring his 34 years representing Los Angeles on Capitol Hill, Waxman championed the Community Right to Know law, which allows local residents to learn what chemical plants are releasing into the air.LiNeBrEaKHe pushed for investigations of the oil companies. And with the start of the Iraq war, Waxman made Halliburton a household name with his relentless criticisms of the company's multibillion-dollar contracts from the Pentagon.LiNeBrEaKIn a statement by e-mail Thursday evening, Halliburton spokeswoman Cathy Mann said the company believes "the time is right for a fresh start on energy, now that the U.S. campaigns are over."LiNeBrEaK"Halliburton always has and will continue to support U.S. governance that helps the country meet its energy challenges and achieve a prosperous economy and secure energy future," she said.LiNeBrEaKPelosi's goalsLiNeBrEaKWaxman, speaking to reporters after his 137-122 victory in the House Democratic caucus, said his colleagues voted for a change in the committee leadership in hopes of getting action on health care, environmental protection and energy policy.LiNeBrEaK"We are at a unique moment in history," said Waxman, who currently is the No. 2 Democrat on the panel. "We have an opportunity that comes only once in a generation."LiNeBrEaKHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made clear what she expects Waxman to accomplish - "progress toward making America energy independent, making health care available to all Americans and addressing the greatest challenge of our time, global warming."LiNeBrEaKDingell, a tireless defender of Detroit's auto industry, has been the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee for 28 years. He has been in the House for 52 years, its longest-serving member.LiNeBrEaKHe downplayed the effect the chairmanship change would have on energy policy in the new Congress.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has called energy "the most important issue that our future economy is going to face," and Dingell predicted that energy policy will be shaped largely from the White House.LiNeBrEaK"I think probably what would have emerged either under Dingell or Waxman ... would have been quite similar, because the White House is going to play a major role in setting the energy policy of this country," Dingell said.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, Waxman is widely expected to be more aggressive than his predecessor in pursuing legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions - legislation that would affect refineries, petrochemical makers and power plants.LiNeBrEaKDingell recently released a "discussion draft" on a bill that would let companies purchase and trade credits for carbon emissions. In general, such arrangements set limits for emissions and allow companies exceeding the caps to buy credits from companies with lower emissions.LiNeBrEaKBut he has clashed with Pelosi and Waxman over California's rules to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaK'Troubling sign'LiNeBrEaKWhile some cast Waxman as an ideologue - House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio called Waxman's victory a "troubling sign" that Democrats will be "pulled leftward by radical special interests" - environmentalists hailed the news.LiNeBrEaK"This isn't about some extreme agenda," said Steven Biel, global warming campaign director for Greenpeace. "This is about a legislator with a track record of getting things done. America needs to start getting results in terms of clean energy and global warming."LiNeBrEaKRep. Joe Barton of Ennis, who is likely to retain his post as ranking Republican on the committee, vowed to work with Waxman "in a constructive way - when at all possible."LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials reacted cautiously to Waxman's victory. "We're happy to work with whomever is chairman of the committee," said Judy Penniman, a spokeswoman for the oil industry's Washington-based trade group, the American Petroleum Institute.LiNeBrEaKBut the oil patch has long expressed its preference with its pocketbook.LiNeBrEaKOver the last two election cycles, Dingell has received $96,000 from donors in the oil and gas sector and Waxman $2,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which compiles campaign finance data.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's election to the panel chairmanship has exposed a fissure in the Democratic caucus.

It would be horrible if Tuvalu sinks into the sea because of carbon dioxide emitted from our unhappy economic life," said Endo, who runs the nonprofit organization Tuvalu Overview, which offers lectures and exhibitions on Tuvalu and organizes eco-tours there. LiNeBrEaKHis photographs capture people in their ordinary activities, surrounded by nature. He believes Japanese people could change their lifestyle if only they could take a lesson from the simple, happy life led by the islanders.LiNeBrEaKHis photographs are being displayed until Dec. 11 at Shinozaki Bunka Plaza in Edogawa Ward, Tokyo, near the west exit of Shinozaki Station on the Toei Shinjuku Line.LiNeBrEaKTuvalu, consisting of four low-lying reef islands and five atolls that lie about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, could disappear if the ocean continues to rise due to global warming.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, the average sea level could go up as much as 59 cm in 2100 compared with 2000.LiNeBrEaKEndo said people in Tuvalu began to feel the environmental impact of rising sea levels about 10 years ago. There is more flooding at high tide, for example, which leaves groundwater and crops damaged by salt, he said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironment groups such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature warn global warming could have serious consequences, including frequent floods and storm surges, for low-lying Pacific islands, and the extreme weather could devastate the fishing and agriculture that dominates their economies.LiNeBrEaKBefore starting the NPO, Endo was a typical salaryman, working long hours in a competitive environment.LiNeBrEaKAfter graduating from the architecture department of Osaka University of Arts, he landed a job at Taisei Corp., one of Japan's most prominent general contractors.LiNeBrEaKHe said he wanted to make environment-friendly buildings, as he had also studied environmental issues in school, but his colleagues told him there was no money in this.LiNeBrEaKHe learned about Tuvalu a few years after joining Taisei.LiNeBrEaKIn 1992, he read a newspaper article about the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, which described global warming and its influence on Tuvalu.LiNeBrEaK"I always loved nature, so I was sad to know such a beautiful country may disappear because of global warming," he said.LiNeBrEaKSince then, he became deeply concerned about Tuvalu. In 1997, he quit his job because it conflicted with what he really wanted to do, which was to address environmental problems.LiNeBrEaKHoping to help Tuvalu, which does not have a strong industry, raise revenues to protect its environment, Endo made a business proposal to the Tuvalu government in 1996, and he made his first trip there in 1998 to enter his bid.LiNeBrEaKUnder the proposal, the Tuvalu government would charge companies, such as television stations, to use the country's Internet domain name ".tv."LiNeBrEaKDuring that first trip, he visited an uninhabited island with a Tuvaluan friend. While he had brought along two water bottles and a sandwich, his friend had only a hatchet.LiNeBrEaK"After my friend landed, he climbed up a palm tree and got us a coconut. Then he caught a fish from the sea, steamed it with palm leaves, washed the burned part off in the sea, and gave it to me. It was all simple and delicious."LiNeBrEaKIt was at that moment Endo realized he did not need a lot to enjoy life.LiNeBrEaK"I was working in a high-rise building in Shinjuku, wearing expensive suits. It was like a TV drama featuring trendy young people, and after the visit to Tuvalu I wondered what meaning there was to such a life."LiNeBrEaKThough the Tuvalu government did not adopt his business proposal, Endo continued to care about the island nation.LiNeBrEaKHe has traveled between Tuvalu and Japan numerous times, organizing events and activities to tell people in Japan about global warming and its impact on Tuvalu.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the situation for Tuvalu is grave, the people in Endo's photographs are happy, with big smiles and shining eyes.LiNeBrEaK"They know how to enjoy life without depending on money," he said.LiNeBrEaKEven time does not seem to matter for them.LiNeBrEaKFrom August to last month, Endo visited Niutao Island, 20 hours by boat from the main Funafuti Island. He said there is no set timetable for the vessels operating between the two islands, so he just had to wait until one showed up.LiNeBrEaK"I was lucky I could come back as scheduled," he laughed. "When Tuvaluans on Niutao Island visit Funafuti, what matters to them is to arrive there, but not what time they arrive."LiNeBrEaKIt will take him a long time to photograph 10,000 islanders because he spends time with each one to get to know them first.LiNeBrEaKHowever, he said he will continue taking their pictures so he can show the Japanese people their simple and happy life coexisting with nature.LiNeBrEaK"I want more Japanese to realize that just living a life is already a beautiful thing," he said.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Clinton would bring name recognition to post where star power is a potent weapon  	By Warren P. Strobel, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1197 words  	WASHINGTON _ She's been a mother, a lawyer and a first lady, an aggrieved wife, a U.S. senator and a nearly victorious candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now Hillary Clinton appears set to take on a new role: secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKThe New York Times reported Friday afternoon on its Web site that she will accept the job, and that it's been offered to her. Neither her office nor the transition office of President-elect Barack Obama would confirm the report, though insiders in both camps acknowledged that the job negotiations between the two were "on track."LiNeBrEaKThe junior senator from New York appears to bring much to the job, assuming she is nominated and confirmed, not the least of which is instant international name recognition.LiNeBrEaKWhether it's flying into war-torn foreign capitals, trying to convince Arabs and Israelis that she means what she says, or presiding over international conferences, star power is a potent weapon, as the last two secretaries of state, Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, well knew. LiNeBrEaKHowever, Clinton has never _ at least publicly _ been a global visionary or foreign policy intellectual, leaving it unclear how she would steer America's role in the world or act as steward of U.S. alliances.LiNeBrEaKA 2007 article she wrote as a presidential candidate for Foreign Affairs magazine was filled with familiar calls to rebuild alliances and restore U.S. leadership, but was spare on details.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, it remains to be seen where Clinton and the long-underfunded State Department would fit in an Obama administration where, it appears, much foreign policy will be run out of the White House and Vice President-elect Joseph Biden is a heavyweight on international affairs.LiNeBrEaKThere's another, bigger wild card: Never before has a secretary of state had a former president for a spouse. The role of Bill Clinton, with his network of international friends and financial connections, could be a study in tightrope-walking.LiNeBrEaKClinton and Obama fought bitterly over national security issues during the Democratic presidential primaries.LiNeBrEaKClinton attacked Obama's willingness to talk to leaders such as Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or Venezuela's Hugo Chavez as naive. Obama seemed to mock the depth of her experiences, saying his worldview was based on more than "what world leaders I went and talked to in the ambassador's house, who I had tea with."LiNeBrEaKNow, Obama seems certain to have the final say.LiNeBrEaKIf she's confirmed by the Senate as the 67th secretary of state, Clinton will settle into her formal office on the State Department's seventh floor to find her inbox crowded with problems from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, global warming to global financial meltdown.LiNeBrEaKNone, however, might be as urgent or treacherous as Iran.LiNeBrEaKA report last week by the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Iran continues to enrich uranium that could be used to fuel a nuclear weapon, in defiance of the U.N. Security Council, and has stymied international inspections.LiNeBrEaKUnder the most dire scenario, Iran could have the material for a nuclear weapon, if not a working device itself, sometime soon after 2010.LiNeBrEaKIn her Foreign Affairs essay, Clinton harshly criticized the Bush administration's refusal to engage with adversaries such as Iran. "True statesmanship requires that we engage with our adversaries, not for the sake of talking but because robust diplomacy is a prerequisite to achieving our aims," she wrote.LiNeBrEaKYet Iran's multi-headed government has refused a steady stream of sweeteners offered by Europe and the U.S. to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment, often seeking to string out negotiations in an apparent play for time.LiNeBrEaKIf Iran doesn't comply, Clinton wrote, "all options must remain on the table."LiNeBrEaKIn an April television interview, Clinton was much less diplomatic. If Iran launched a nuclear strike on Israel, she said, she would "totally obliterate them."LiNeBrEaKThe comment illustrates Clinton's tough, almost pugnacious style, which she would need in the new job.LiNeBrEaKThe next secretary of state seems likely to be less burdened by Iraq that Rice and Powell were, leaving more time and energy for other problems, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.LiNeBrEaK"Getting out of Iraq will enable us to play a constructive role in a renewed Middle East peace process," Clinton wrote.LiNeBrEaKAs a senator and before, Clinton has been known as a strong supporter of Israel. But she has also pledged greater involvement in Middle East peace negotiations than President George W. Bush played in his early years.LiNeBrEaKAnd while Rice fell far short of achieving a deal in a renewed bid that began a year ago, she leaves talks in place where Clinton could pick up.LiNeBrEaKDIPLOMATIC MANEUVERSLiNeBrEaKThe news that Sen. Hillary Clinton was President-elect Barack Obama's choice to become secretary of state emerged in a dizzying series of news reports based on sightings, leaks, counter-leaks, rumors, qualified confirmations from the Obama transition team _ but still nothing firm and authoritative from either Clinton or Obama. A partial review of how the news emerged:LiNeBrEaKThursday, Nov. 13: Andrea Mitchell of NBC News reports that Obama is considering Sen. Hillary Clinton as a potential secretary of state. News reporters see her motorcade outside Obama's Chicago headquarters that night.LiNeBrEaKSaturday, Nov. 15: The Associated Press reports that former President Bill Clinton's foreign deals could cause complications if Obama picks Hillary Clinton. This becomes the prime point of media speculation for days.LiNeBrEaKSunday, Nov. 16: Bill Clinton, speaking at an economic conference in Kuwait, says that his wife would be a "really great" secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKMonday, Nov. 17: The Guardian, a London newspaper, reports that Hillary Clinton has decided to accept the post of secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKWednesday, Nov. 19: Bill Clinton offers concessions about opening previously private data about his donors to the Obama camp if that will help Hillary Clinton become secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKWednesday, Nov. 19: The Associated Press reports that Clinton engaged lawyers to help Obama "vet her candidacy."LiNeBrEaKThursday, Nov. 20: The New York Times reports that Bill Clinton is said to agree to conditions set by Obama's transition team regarding potential conflicts of interest if Hillary Clinton becomes secretary of state. It also reports of growing tensions between the Clinton and Obama camps over all the leaks.LiNeBrEaKFriday, Nov. 21: Senate Democratic leaders, The New York Times reports, have discussed giving Clinton an "undefined leadership role" in the Senate if she doesn't become secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKFriday, Nov. 21: The New York Times, citing "two confidants," reports on its Web site in the afternoon that Clinton will accept the position. Neither Clinton's office nor Obama's camp would confirm or deny the report.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	How Arctic melting could benefit shippers, oil companies  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1205 words  	WASHINGTON _ With global warming melting the Arctic's eons-old ice at an alarming rate, shipping and oil companies are looking ahead at how to exploit the new open waters.LiNeBrEaKFor the past 30 years, the summer Arctic icepack has been shrinking. In 2007, the melt reached record levels. This past summer, the ice shrank to the second smallest area on record. LiNeBrEaKAnd while much of the discussions so far have been focused on dealing with global warming and on preserving habitat and protecting polar bears and walruses, another change is looming. When will commercial interests be able to develop the once-impregnable region?LiNeBrEaKScientists say the Arctic's seas could be essentially free of ice in the summertime by mid-century. LiNeBrEaK"I'm convinced, based on models and observations, the trend is one of accelerated ice loss, and we're probably looking at a scenario, even with the best efforts to mitigate (global warming), that we'll continue to see loss," said Richard Spinrad, director of research for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.LiNeBrEaKAlready, shipping has increased within the Arctic Circle to serve the oil and gas industry.LiNeBrEaKThe recent increase has been the result of a spike in commodity prices, not to capitalize on retreating sea ice, said Lawson Brigham, a former Coast Guard captain and climate scientist who made many voyages into the Arctic and around Antarctica.LiNeBrEaKThe pull is strong in a world dependent on petroleum. In July, the U.S. Geological Survey issued the first public estimate of the petroleum resources north of the Arctic Circle. Its findings: 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.LiNeBrEaKBrigham is helping plan for the changes ahead as chairman of the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment of the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum of eight Arctic nations.LiNeBrEaK"We don't profess to know exactly how industry will move ahead, but we know there's an increase of ships in the Arctic Ocean, and maybe that increase hasn't been matched by policy responses from safety and environmental standpoint, so that's what we're working on," he said.LiNeBrEaKBrigham was the captain of the icebreaker Polar Sea in 1994 when it teamed in a scientific expedition with Canada's Louis S. St. Laurent to make the first ocean-to-ocean surface voyage over the North Pole. "There was a lot more ice there than there is today," he said. "Quite an extraordinary difference in 14 years."LiNeBrEaKExcept for some cruise ships and icebreakers, the traffic in the Arctic now is regional _ mostly ships going in and out to provide transportation for the oil and gas industry, he said.LiNeBrEaKOil companies have been looking at Alaska's arctic waters as a new frontier.LiNeBrEaKAnd in the past two years, the Bush administration has leased large parts of those waters _ the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.LiNeBrEaKShell was the main buyer of the Chukchi leases in February, spending $2. 1 billion.LiNeBrEaK"Shell, like many other national and international oil companies, is actively assessing Arctic opportunities," said Shell spokeswoman Darci Sinclair.LiNeBrEaKConservation groups and Native communities challenged the Minerals Management Service's approval of a permit for Shell to drill exploratory wells in the Beaufort Sea. On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that the MMS did not conduct the "hard look" at environmental impacts required by law and canceled the permit.LiNeBrEaK"We're very concerned about the aggressiveness the Bush administration has shown about oil and gas leasing in polar bear habitat," said Mike Daulton, the legislative director of the National Audubon Society.LiNeBrEaKAlaska's oil mostly is produced on land. The U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates Alaska's offshore waters hold 26. 6 billion barrels of oil that are technically recoverable, and that nearly 90 percent of it is in the Arctic.LiNeBrEaKShell wants to drill in open water during the summer and fall seasons.LiNeBrEaK"We can only conduct exploratory drilling in open water conditions because of the mobile nature of our drill rigs," Sinclair said. "From season to season, as we drill exploratory wells, those wells will be capped over the winter and revisited when the open water allows."LiNeBrEaK"In the event the project moves in to the development and production stages, we envision putting in place a permanent structure that can withstand moving sea ice," she said. "We have yet to decide what that structure would look like."LiNeBrEaKThere's also competition. Russia has claimed a vast territory in the Arctic Ocean by declaring that the undersea Lomonosov Ridge is its continental shelf, setting up a dispute with the U.S., Canada and other Arctic nations.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S., Russia and other nations agreed earlier this year to use the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea to sort out competing claims. The U.S. can't bring any claims, however, because the Senate hasn't ratified it.LiNeBrEaKDevelopment hasn't proved easy so far for Russia's national energy company, Gazprom, in the Shtokman gas field near Murmansk, even in open water of the Barents Sea, said William Chandler, an energy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.LiNeBrEaK"If there weren't almost insurmountable technical and financial challenges to get that stuff, why isn't it happening?" Chandler said.LiNeBrEaKRussia also has problems on land, where ice roads needed for development in the Western Siberian basin are melting earlier, leaving less time for exploration and development, Chandler said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Navy Cmdr. Andrew Garlington, who works on maritime security policy, said the Navy is planning for increased use of the Arctic.LiNeBrEaK"But let me give you a caution," Garlington said. "When you hear ice-free waters in the Arctic, that doesn't mean it's free of all ice. That just means it's less than 10 percent coverage. It's still a very dangerous and dynamic environment up there."LiNeBrEaKThe Coast Guard also is looking north and working with Canada and Russia on oil spill response plans.LiNeBrEaKThe Northwest Passage between Baffin Bay and the Beaufort Sea was navigable for a period starting late last August, and also the year before. But Michael Storgaard, a spokesman for A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world's biggest shipping company, said it's shallow with many narrow straits, not fully mapped in detail and lacking large-scale rescue and repair facilities.LiNeBrEaK"For now, we do not see any immediate commercial possibilities in connection with the Northwest Passage," he said. "Our view is also that it will be some time, perhaps even decades, before we see a more consistent commercial utilization."LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKDetails on Arctic sea ice by the National Snow and Ice Data Center: http://tinyurl.com/5p7p2rLiNeBrEaKPictures and information from the North Pole: http://tinyurl.com/3r394LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental report card on the Arctic: http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/	GLOBAL WARMING (91%); MARINE MAMMALS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); OCEANS (89%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (89%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); MARINE SHIPPING (78%); TRENDS (77%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS (76%); RESEARCH (74%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (74%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (71%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (70%); CRUISES (70%); MARINE PASSENGER TRANSPORT (70%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (69%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (66%); ARMED FORCES (65%)  		NATIONAL OCEANIC and ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (55%); UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY (54%)  			MICHAEL MCMAHON (70%)  	ALASKA, USA (79%); ARCTIC OCEAN (79%) ARCTIC (99%); UNITED STATES (95%); ANTARCTICA (79%); CANADA (67%)  	November 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	20081121-BC-ENV-ARCTIC-ADV23  	WA  	PHOTOS (from MCT Photo Service, 202-383-6099): ENV-ARCTICLiNeBrEaKARCHIVE GRAPHIC on MCT Direct (from MCT Graphics, 202-383-6064): 20080725 Arctic oil	WASHINGTON   											
Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Nevadans support House panel change  	Steve Tetreault  	A; Pg. 11A  	611 words  	STEPHENS WASHINGTON BUREAULiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Two Nevadans joined a Democratic coup Thursday that dethroned a longtime leader of the House's energy committee in favor of a new chairman who they said will be friendlier to the state on renewable energy and nuclear waste.LiNeBrEaKRep. Henry Waxman of California could not be more different from Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, the lawmaker he will replace as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev. LiNeBrEaKDingell was a leading supporter of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository and prodded the Department of Energy to move faster to complete the project.LiNeBrEaKWaxman, said Berkley, "has been a steadfast supporter of Nevada's position on Yucca Mountain, and he will be a partner with Nevada in stopping this project."LiNeBrEaKWaxman, a Beverly Hills liberal, is more supportive of renewable energy, while Dingell had built a reputation as an ardent proponent of automakers who populate his Detroit-area district. LiNeBrEaK"I was an unapologetic supporter of Waxman," Berkley said after the 137-122 secret ballot vote by Democrats who will serve in the new Congress gathering in January.LiNeBrEaKTwo of Nevada's three House representatives in the new Congress will be Democrats. Besides Berkley, Reppresentative-elect Dina Titus also voted for Waxman, who she said is a supporter of the casino industry.LiNeBrEaKTitus was unavailable on Thursday evening. She said in a statement that Waxman's election "is a win for Nevada and our nation as we move forward to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and explore renewable technologies to create new jobs and protect our environment."LiNeBrEaKThe 57-member Energy and Commerce panel is one of the most important House committees, with jurisdiction over energy, the environment, consumer protection, telecommunications and health care programs such as Medicaid and the popular State Children's Health Insurance Program.LiNeBrEaKThe switch from Dingell to Waxman could help President-elect Barack Obama on Capitol Hill with one of his favored issues: trying to curb global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But Waxman's combative stance on climate change and other issues could alienate Republicans and moderate Democrats, making the bipartisan support Obama will need harder to get.LiNeBrEaKWaxman, 69, is an environmentalist and booster of health care programs and a home state ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He was the candidate of change in a year dominated by that theme. He likened the first years of the Obama administration to a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get things done in Washington.LiNeBrEaK"The argument we made was that we needed a change for the committee to have the leadership that will work with this administration and members in both the House and the Senate in order to get important issues passed in health care, environmental protection, in energy policy," Waxman said after the vote.LiNeBrEaKDingell, 82, has been the top Democrat on the panel for 28 years and is an old-school supporter of carmakers and other big industries such as electric utilities.LiNeBrEaKHis battles with Waxman over clean air issues date to the Reagan administration and recently were revived as Waxman complained that the committee has been too slow to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKDingell's defenders said he had done nothing to deserve being dumped, pointing to a long list of accomplishments and the panel's busy work load over the past two years, including successfully enacting an energy bill that would raise automobile fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Lebanon Daily News (Pennsylvania)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Just for spite?  	Lebanon Daily News, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	545 words  	Nov. 21--There is still sentiment for a bailout of the Big Three automakers in Washington -- just as long as someone else takes the initiative. The lame-duck Bush administration wants Congress to grab the reins, while Congress is ready to head home for the holidays in the expectation that the White House will propose a bailout or take the blame for what happens if it doesn't. Should nothing be accomplished, there will be plenty of blame to go around, and Detroit can share it with Washington. LiNeBrEaKThe Big Three's top executives arrived in Washington Tuesday -- by private jet -- to beg for at least a $25 billion handout in taxpayer money. If the chieftains of General Motors, Chrysler and Ford had humbly accepted blame for their current plight, they might have won more sympathy than they did, but Rick Wagoner, the chief of floundering GM, and his colleagues portrayed themselves as victims of the global economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKWhat the crisis did was lay bare the flimsy financial underpinnings of an industry burdened by overhead and unable to move its gas guzzlers off the lots. For this reason, the CEOs must go as part of any bailout agreement, and they must go unaccompanied by big bonuses or stock options.LiNeBrEaKFor his part, United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger talks as if he is Manny Ramirez, the slugging outfielder dealing from strength in pursuit of a new contract. Gettelfinger also blames the economy, not his union, but he will receive no sympathy from congressmen whose constituents don't enjoy the salaries and benefits of autoworkers and whose employers won't be getting federal bailouts if they go under. If the automakers declare bankruptcy, a likelihood if a bailout agreement isn't reached, the UAW contracts will be at the mercy of a bankruptcy court.LiNeBrEaKGettelfinger should consider that fact and acknowledge painful economic realities, as many working Americans do every day.LiNeBrEaKIt is significant that Senate Banking Chairman Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, after chastising the auto executives Tuesday for producing gas-guzzlers, asserting that hybrid electric-gas cars made "no economic sense" and refusing to acknowledge that their giant vans and SUVs fueled global warming, argued for the bailout. As Dodd observed, while Detroit is responsible for its predicament, its collapse will cost jobs in not only the auto industry but in many ancillary industries, such as auto supplies. It will also mean that America may lose a huge share of its dwindling manufacturing infrastructure. Yes, foreign-car manufacturers will pick up much of the slack, but America is already losing much of its financial base, as well as its identity, to nations that are economic rivals.LiNeBrEaKDetroit doesn't deserve America's sympathy, but nixing a bailout amounts to cutting off the nation's nose to spite the Big Three.

Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Goal: more jobs, less gas  	Andy Mead and Jack Brammer, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	999 words  	Nov. 21--Gov. Steve Beshear unveiled what he called Kentucky's first-ever comprehensive energy plan Tuesday, setting a goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gases while increasing jobs over the next couple of decades.LiNeBrEaKBeshear said his plan will protect the environment while positioning Kentucky as an energy leader. By 2025, he said, greenhouse gas emissions could be 20 percent lower than they were in 1990 and energy consumption could be 18 percent lower than currently projected.LiNeBrEaKBeshear stopped short of calling for removal of the state's ban on nuclear power plants, but factored nuclear energy into some of the plan's long-range projections. He pointed out that there are more than 100 nuclear plants in the United States, and most states surrounding Kentucky have at least one. LiNeBrEaK"I don't think there's any question that it's going to be a part of this country's energy future," the governor said. "The question is whether it's going to be part of Kentucky's future."LiNeBrEaKHe said he would talk to lawmakers and the public about whether a ban on nuclear facilities in Kentucky should be lifted. Under state law, the Public Service Commission can't consider a nuclear plant unless a permanent disposal site is in place to accept spent radioactive fuel.LiNeBrEaKThe governor sees a lot of coal in Kentucky's future, but there also is solar and wind energy, conservation, and perhaps a scheme using the carbon that usually spews into the air when coal is burned to speed the growth of algae, which would in turn produce a diesel-like fuel.LiNeBrEaKThe 150-page plan, Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky's Future, lays out seven strategies that range from increasing energy efficiency to producing liquid fuels from coal.LiNeBrEaKMany of the strategies are based on highly speculative research. For example, Beshear calls for capturing and storing, perhaps deep underground, the carbon emissions of half the coal burned in 2025.LiNeBrEaKAs many as 40,000 jobs could be created in fields related to energy production and conservation, Beshear predicted.LiNeBrEaKAt least some of the plan's success depends on what the federal government does in coming years. Many of its methods and goals are parallel to ideas expounded by President-elect Barack Obama, Beshear said.LiNeBrEaKGov. Ernie Fletcher, who preceded Beshear in office, also had produced what he called a comprehensive energy plan. Asked about that Thursday, Beshear characterized his predecessor's plan as "more piecemeal."LiNeBrEaK"I don't recall any comprehensive prior plan that sought to encompass the whole energy picture," he said.LiNeBrEaKBeshear said his administration drew up the policy without consulting with coal companies or environmental groups. It now is meeting with those groups, as well as legislators and university experts, to gain support for the plan.LiNeBrEaKSome parts of the plan will be submitted to the General Assembly in January as proposed legislation, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe plan drew a range of reactions.LiNeBrEaKHouse Majority Leader Rocky Adkins, a coal company employee who has been the legislature's premier energy advocate, said he was upset that the governor did not seek legislative input in developing the plan.LiNeBrEaKHe said Energy Secretary Len Peters "relayed to me that they did not want any outside influences in the development of the plan and just wanted to give it their best shot and then open it up to everyone," said Adkins, D-Sandy Hook.LiNeBrEaKState Sen. Robert Stivers, who has worked on previous energy legislation, said he thought it was "odd to unveil a plan and then ask for input." Stivers, R-Manchester, said he was made aware of the plan in an e-mail news release and had not had time to study it.LiNeBrEaKDoug Doerrfeld,, an executive committee member for the environmental group Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, said Beshear's plan "is putting too many eggs in the coal basket."LiNeBrEaKDoerrfeld -- and the Cumberland chapter of the Sierra Club -- also turned thumbs down on the idea of nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaK"The best nuclear reactor is 93 million miles away, and it's called the sun," Doerrfeld said.LiNeBrEaKBill Caylor, president of the Kentucky Coal Association, said he welcomed diverse sources of energy, including nuclear. But, he added, the large coal-fired plants now providing most of Kentucky's electricity will be around for a long while.LiNeBrEaK"We've always said that coal is the bridge to the future. The debate is how soon that future is going to come," he said.LiNeBrEaKAt the University of Kentucky's Center for Applied Energy Research, director Rodney Andrews said Beshear had presented "a comprehensive energy plan that addresses key issues."LiNeBrEaKHe said the state's ban on nuclear plants should be lifted. "It can be done safely, as we have seen in other states," he said.LiNeBrEaKOthers questioned the soundness of the plan because it emphasizes turning coal into liquid gas.LiNeBrEaKTom FitzGerald, director if the Kentucky Resources Council, said that process won't work without an effective way of dealing with carbon emissions. He also called for a "significant reduction from current levels of the unnecessary damage inflicted on coalfield communities from radical mining methods."LiNeBrEaKBeshear noted that he is releasing his plan, which would prove costly, as the state faces severe budget shortfalls. But, he said, how the state and the nation address energy issues is central to any economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKBeshear and Peters said their plan is based on existing technology. Still, much of that technology has never been used on a large scale in the United States.LiNeBrEaKThe plan itself will change, the governor said. "This is a living document."LiNeBrEaKReach Andy Mead at (859) 231-3319 or 1-800-950-6397, Ext. 3319.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Despite lopsided loss, Miami maintains bright future  	By Greg Cote, McClatchy Newspapers  	SPORTS  	767 words  	ATLANTA _ Everything was running away from the Miami Hurricanes here Thursday night. The winning streak. The national ranking. The conference championship. The major-bowl dreams. And just about any Georgia Tech player who happened to carry the football.LiNeBrEaKRun-run-running away from the Canes.LiNeBrEaKEverything was in Miami's control, and then nothing was. LiNeBrEaKEverything was right there in the Canes' hands, within grasp, until those Yellow Jackets runners weren't.LiNeBrEaKThat's when everything else slipped away, too.LiNeBrEaKThe totality of Miami's defeat is what struck you. Not that they lost; heck, Georgia Tech had the same 7-3 record going in and was a slight favorite at home, in temperatures that dipped into the high 30s.LiNeBrEaKNo, the slap was that 23rd-ranked Miami never really showed up in any substantive way in this 41-23 loss, one whose final margin was misleadingly close.LiNeBrEaKIt wasn't UM's offense that ended the five-game winning streak, turned a driver's-seat path to the ACC title into a steep off-road climb and dashed hopes of a January bowl.LiNeBrEaKIt was the utter helplessness of the Canes' proud run defense in this ESPN featured game. It was a collapse, broadcast coast to coast. A national autopsy revealing any and all weaknesses.LiNeBrEaKNot since FSU rolled over The U for 310 ground yards Oct. 4 _ Miami's last time losing before Thursday _ had an opponent slashed through this year's UM defense like this. Only this was worse. Much.LiNeBrEaKSomewhere, smashmouth alumni like Ray Lewis, Russell Maryland and Cortez Kennedy had to be watching their TVs in disbelief, anger or maybe just head-shaking silence. If there are chairs in heaven, Jerome Brown surely was kicking them over.LiNeBrEaKTech would rush for 464 yards, a surreal number. That included a 58-yard touchdown run, a 32-yard scoring run, and other runs of 54, 40, 35, 29, 29, 27 and 20 yards.LiNeBrEaKWas it cold here of the sort we don't know on South Beach or in the Gables? Yeah. It was cold enough to make you wonder where Al Gore's global warming was when you needed it.LiNeBrEaKBut uncomfortable weather can't excuse UM's defensive performance. Nothing could.LiNeBrEaKThis was the second-most rushing yards ever allowed by UM, the most since Auburn piled up 536 in 1944. Weren't they wearing raccoon caps to games back then? Fedoras? (Something officially qualifies as ancient history if it happens before even I was born!)LiNeBrEaKYou know how sometimes one play stands as the signature of a game? Even though you couldn't know it at the time?LiNeBrEaKThat play Thursday happened near the middle of a still-scoreless first quarter, on a 1st-and-25 for Georgia Tech from its own 42. Tech's Jonathan Dwyer took a pitch right, turned the corner with a stiffarm that flattened safety Anthony Reddick, and barreled 35 yards. Reddick lay in Dwyer's wake, left merely to watch and hope to catch the license plate number. Just afterward the spigot was turned on Tech's scoring, and began to gush.LiNeBrEaKGeorgia Tech was not running up the score, by the way. Running up the gut of Miami's defense, that's all.LiNeBrEaKCoach Randy Shannon did not single out his run defense for blame (he was being benevolent), but spread the criticism to suggest a team that maybe needed the attitude adjustment that might result from such a loss.LiNeBrEaK"I think it'll wake guys ups," Shannon said. "You have success, and the team started getting lax a little bit. So I think it'll wake us up, wake these young guys up."LiNeBrEaKThis was the Canes' biggest game in a while, which has to dishearten a UM fan as much as the final margin.LiNeBrEaKMiami entered in control of its fate as far as reaching the ACC title game Dec. 6 in Tampa, and thus reaching the Orange Bowl Classic.LiNeBrEaKMiami entered ranked again for the first time in more than two years and in a position to stake its claim to a national audience that The U was back all the way or at least gaining on its glorious past, narrowing the gap.LiNeBrEaKIt is getting there, a faith that should remain even though Thursday shook it. UM is getting there, and Thursday didn't erase that.LiNeBrEaKThat is the hardest but most important thing to remember today.LiNeBrEaKThe season doesn't stop being a significant improvement over last year because of one cold game.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Teacher holds class from bottom of sea  	Kathleen McGrory, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1064 words  	Nov. 21--Sixty-three feet below the ocean's surface, the science teacher was giving his morning lesson.LiNeBrEaK"Hi, and welcome to Aquarius for our third and final broadcast from this mission," Mark Tohulka told his third-period marine biology students, who watched via webcam from their classroom at MAST Academy on Virginia Key.LiNeBrEaKAs the teacher continued his talk, he saw a pair of curious fish swim by.LiNeBrEaKOn a weeklong mission aboard Aquarius, the world's only undersea research station, Tohulka helped with research, blogged, answered student e-mails and beamed live webcasts to classrooms across the country. LiNeBrEaKCall him the first school teacher to live underwater.LiNeBrEaK"Science is all about exploring and discovery," Tohulka said upon his return to dry land this week. "Sometimes, there are questions that require extraordinary means to answer -- like traveling to space or living under water. I want my students to see what is possible."LiNeBrEaKTohulka's students showed plenty of interest, asking dozens of questions when they joined him in a chatroom: Some -- like "Have you done any fish surgeries?" -- he didn't answer.LiNeBrEaKBut to "How's the food?" he said this: Taste buds don't work too well under water, so many of the scientists doused their vacuum-packed meals with hot sauce. They also ate plenty of chocolate -- calories aren't a concern when you're losing that much energy in the water.LiNeBrEaKTohulka typed responses to some questions and addressed others during his presentation during class. There were glitches -- large gaps invaded the video feed -- but that's to be expected when the undersea research station is 3 1/2 miles off the coast of Key Largo.LiNeBrEaK"I couldn't believe that they were down there at the research station and I was up here at school," said Alain Pierre-Louis, 17, a student in Tohulka's marine research class. "It was amazing."LiNeBrEaKAquarius, owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, sits in a sand patch in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Roughly the size of a school bus, it holds six bunks, a microwave, a trash compactor, a shower and toilet. Scientists can live there for up to 10 days.LiNeBrEaKResearchers have been diving to the station for more than 14 years to study global climate change, disease pathogens and the coral reef ecosystem, among other things.LiNeBrEaKOn the event of the 100th mission, the Aquarius research team decided to do something a little different.LiNeBrEaK"By embedding a teacher in the science mission, we could give the teacher the experience of being part of the science team," chief scientist Ellen Prager said. "We gave them the real research experience, which quite frankly, a lot of students don't get."LiNeBrEaKEnter Tohulka, 51, curious for years about living under water. He got his taste in 1995, as part of a diving education program that enabled him to spend one night in an underwater laboratory.LiNeBrEaKSince then, Tohulka has integrated undersea research into lesson plans. In his marine biology classes, Tohulka asks his students to design underwater habitats for humans.LiNeBrEaKSo when Tohulka heard about the Aquarius plan, he got excited fast, spending hours crafting the perfect proposal.LiNeBrEaKHis students were rooting for him.LiNeBrEaK"He wanted it so badly," said Emily Cava Northrop, 17. "We were all really hoping he would be picked."LiNeBrEaKTohulka found out in August he had been selected from a competitive field.LiNeBrEaKThree months later, he and a team of scientists began five days of intense training involving numerous diving exercises -- and equipment failure drills conducted without diving masks.LiNeBrEaK"Much of the training had to do with dealing with our problems under water," he said. "The Aquarius is deep enough that we have a decompression obligation. If there's a problem, you can't surface immediately."LiNeBrEaKWhen the mission ended Tuesday, Tohulka underwent 17 hours of decompression, meant to eliminate extra nitrogen from the body to prevent the bends.LiNeBrEaKDuring the week he was underseas, Tohulka also worked with members of the Aquarius team to prepare himself for his research assignment: to study the behavior of fish on Conch Reef.LiNeBrEaKTohulka isn't the only South Florida science teacher going to great lengths to bring science to life for their students.LiNeBrEaKLast spring, two Miami-Dade teachers trained like astronauts in a zero-gravity flight out of Cape Canaveral. Two more are preparing for flights in December.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, teachers in Broward County are connecting their students with researchers in Antarctica with the help of video conferencing technology.LiNeBrEaKTohulka's mission began Nov. 12 and lasted a week.LiNeBrEaKThe team spent mornings diving and observing fish on the reef. They then returned to Aquarius, where Tohulka blogged and chatted with students.LiNeBrEaK"It was really neat to have a network connection under water," he said. "I could hook up my MacBook and open e-mails."LiNeBrEaKTohulka even made a few calls via a phone line in the underwater lab to several classrooms -- including his own.LiNeBrEaKSenior Roda Buenconejo said she and her classmates followed Tohulka's mission on his blog and live video feeds.LiNeBrEaK"There was more space than I thought there would be," she said. "It looked pretty comfortable."LiNeBrEaKAt night, Tohulka would sit at the galley tables and watch fish feed on plankton. Repeat customers included a 4 1/2 -foot goliath grouper.LiNeBrEaK"We saw a lot of the same fish every day," he said. "A lot of them use the station as their territory."LiNeBrEaKPrager, the chief scientist, said she was thrilled by how many students participated.LiNeBrEaKFunds permitting, she hopes to bring more teachers to Aquarius.LiNeBrEaKTohulka is looking forward to sharing more of his experience with his students. He'll be back in the classroom next week.LiNeBrEaK"I would hope that they see me as pretty close to an average Joe who has had the opportunity to do some things that are definitely out of the ordinary," he said. "They can do things like this, too."LiNeBrEaKThe students are psyched.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be really exciting to hear him talk about it all," said Northrup, who now wants to be an aquanaut. "He made history and we were able to watch it."

LiNeBrEaK   So you may as well give in, bundle up and head outdoors. This year there's a bounty of ice-skating options for both the wobbly newcomers and the swanlike veterans who can do a figure eight in their sleep. LiNeBrEaK  The American Museum of Natural History is temporarily complementing the tables and chairs on its Arthur Ross Terrace with a new 150-by-80-foot rink, above, filled with synthetic ice, the kind that doesn't melt during those eerily warm late fall days. The rink, which opens on Saturday, sits next to the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and at its center is a 17-foot stainless steel polar bear decorated with pine boughs and twinkling lights. Why a polar bear instead of a sparkly dead tree?  The bear is a potent symbol of climate change, said Brad Harris, the museum's senior director of visitor services, and there happens to be an exhibition on the topic.  LiNeBrEaK  A second new entrant to the city's ice-skating scene is an 8,000-square-foot rink that opens the day after Thanksgiving on Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. At Seaport Ice, as the new rink is called, skaters can take in the requisite tree as well as live music. LiNeBrEaK  And New York City's parks remain a reliable source of ice follies. Wollman Rink at Prospect Park in Brooklyn opens on Wednesday; Lasker Rink at the north end of Central Park in Manhattan is already open;  and the Pond at Bryant Park is open, among others. LiNeBrEaK  So wave your white flag and sign up for skating lessons, because no matter what it feels like outside, winter is coming, along with its many redeeming rituals.

LiNeBrEaK  Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Few direct links, but because of her years in the Clinton administration, she has ties to many of the people involved in the transition. LiNeBrEaK  In her own words: On California's efforts on climate change: ''Especially in times like these, we must be extraordinarily mindful of the economic effects of our actions. We know that the economic crisis we will face from unmitigated climate change could dwarf anything we have ever seen. That alone is a compelling enough reason to take swift action. But there's another reason also, which is that developing a new clean energy economy that drives and rewards investment and innovation, creates jobs and serves as the engine for sustainable economic growth is exactly what we need at a time like this.'' (Speech at University of Rhode Island, Nov. 12)LiNeBrEaK  Used to work as: A lawyer and administrator with decades of policy and enforcement experience, primarily in addressing air pollution.   At the E.P.A. in the 1990s, she was an assistant administrator for air and radiation.

The New York Times 	November 21, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	In Europe, Refinements to a Subsidy System Often Faulted for Big Problems  	By JAMES KANTER  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 5  	747 words  	European Union governments agreed Thursday to overhaul the way the trade bloc distributes tens of billions of euros in subsidies to farmers. LiNeBrEaK  But some critics said the measures did not go far enough and risked skewing markets further.LiNeBrEaK  The measures, which cover a period from now to 2013, represent the biggest reform of European farming policy in five years. They are aimed at revamping the decades-old system in which farmers automatically earn money for farm products whether there is demand for products or not. The system has been criticized before the World Trade Organization for blocking potential farm imports from outside Europe.LiNeBrEaK  Critics said the changes, which were hashed out Thursday morning after all-night talks in Brussels, were only a partial shift in policy rather than a wholesale reform of the 43 billion euro ($54 billion) subsidy system. LiNeBrEaK  ''I regret what has been conceded in order to secure a deal,'' said the British environment secretary, Hilary Benn. ''We want to see further changes for the benefit of farmers, consumers and the environment and will continue to press for this.''LiNeBrEaK  The Common Agricultural Policy absorbs more than 40 percent of the annual European Union budget of more than 100 billion euros, or $125 billion, although the bloc's 13 million farmers represent only about 3 percent of its population.LiNeBrEaK  France, which receives the biggest slice of European Union farm subsidies, worth about 9 billion euros a year, has opposed a radical overhaul of the system, saying rising food prices underscore the need for a robust program of regional support for farmers. LiNeBrEaK  But Britain has led arguments that freer trade is the best way to tackle food crises linked to sharply increased prices over the past year.LiNeBrEaK  European officials said even incremental changes in the policy would free farmers to produce more food based on market demand and allow the union to redirect money to preserving the countryside, protecting the environment and revitalizing rural areas.LiNeBrEaK  The reforms are ''all about equipping our farmers for the challenges they face in the upcoming years, such as climate change, and freeing them to follow market signals,'' said Mariann Fischer Boel, the union's commissioner for agriculture and rural development. ''I'm pleased we managed to find a compromise.''LiNeBrEaK  The measures also are positive for European trade relations, although the system still could distort markets by affecting prices and the way farmers work, said Indhira Santos, a research fellow specializing in European agriculture at the Bruegel research organization.LiNeBrEaK  ''On paper these reforms make the European system more compatible with global trade rules,'' Ms. Santos said. ''In practice  -- although these changes might mean the payments are marginally less distorting  -- there's really little difference because most of the money still goes to the same people.''LiNeBrEaK  Food prices in the European Union are significantly higher than they would be without the subsidies, Ms. Santos said, in contrast to farm supports in the United States, which had less of an impact on domestic food prices.LiNeBrEaK  But Jack Thurston, the co-founder of Farmsubsidy.org, which campaigns for budgetary transparency in European farm spending, said the reforms' significance would be lessened because most of the international trade friction around European farming concerned tariffs, rather than quotas or spending.LiNeBrEaK  Among the measures agreed to early Thursday morning was an increase in annual milk production quotas each year ahead of a planned abolition of the quota system in 2015.LiNeBrEaK  European governments also agreed formally to abolish the so-called set-aside, which required some farmland to be kept out of production. LiNeBrEaK  The changes also reduce direct payments to midsize farmers  -- from an Irish cattle farmer to an Italian olive grower  -- and to very big landowners like the queen of England, grain barons in northern France and the owners of landholdings in formerly communist countries in Eastern Europe.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Fischer Boel, the agriculture commissioner, had sought to reduce direct payments to the biggest subsidy recipients by up to 9 percent. But governments scrapped that plan, agreeing instead to reductions of 4 percent for payments above 300,000 euros a year.LiNeBrEaK  ''The changes will not get the queen, the duke of Westminster, or Prince Albert of Monaco off of the front pages of newspapers for being the major beneficiaries of these payments,'' said Mr. Thurston of Farmsubsidy.org.

The New York Times 	November 21, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Global Forecast by American Intelligence Expects Al Qaeda's Appeal to Falter  	By SCOTT SHANE  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 14  	815 words  	A new study of the global future by American intelligence agencies suggests that Al Qaeda could soon be on the decline, having alienated Muslim supporters with indiscriminate killing and inattention to the practical problems of poverty, unemployment and education.LiNeBrEaK  While not contradicting intelligence assessments suggesting that Al Qaeda remains a major threat with a strong presence in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the report says that the group ''may decay sooner'' than many experts have assumed because of severe weaknesses: ''unachievable strategic objectives, inability to attract broad-based support and self-destructive actions.''LiNeBrEaK  ''The appeal of terrorism is waning,'' said Mathew J. Burrows, head of long-range analysis in the office of the director of national intelligence and a lead author of ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World.'' Mr. Burrows said polls and anecdotal evidence strongly suggested disillusionment among Muslims with Al Qaeda and its methods and goals since the 2001 terrorist attacks. LiNeBrEaK  The predicted decline of Al Qaeda is one of the few bright spots in the generally gloomy report, which describes a decline in the United States' world dominance as China, India and other powers assert themselves. LiNeBrEaK  ''Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful actor, the United States' relative strength -- even in the military realm -- will decline and U.S. leverage will become more constrained,'' the report said. LiNeBrEaK  By 2025, it predicted, ''the U.S. will find itself as one of a number of important actors on the world stage,'' playing ''a prominent role in global events'' but not a decisive one as in the past.LiNeBrEaK  The report said the global shift from West to East in terms of wealth and economic power ''is without precedent in modern history.'' Of a projected population increase of 1. 2 billion worldwide by 2025, Western countries would account for only 3 percent, it said.LiNeBrEaK  ''We're projecting a multipolar world,'' C. Thomas Fingar, chairman of the National Intelligence Council and the government's top intelligence analyst, said Thursday at a briefing on the report. ''The unipolar moment is over, or certainly will be over by 2025.''LiNeBrEaK  The previous report in the Global Trends series, completed in 2004, anticipated continued American dominance through 2020, though it recognized that the emergence of China and India as powers would transform the geopolitical landscape.LiNeBrEaK  The new report describes a world riven by increased conflict over scarce food and water supplies and threatened by so-called rogue states and terrorists, widening gaps between rich and poor and an uneven impact of global warming. It said the chance of the use of nuclear weapons, while remaining ''very low,'' would rise in the next two decades as nuclear technology spreads. LiNeBrEaK  The report said Russia's emergence as a world power was ''clouded'' by persistent corruption and lagging investment in its critical energy industry. It also noted, without naming a specific country, that a government in Eastern Europe ''could be effectively taken over and run by organized crime.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Fingar acknowledged that the report, in the works for months, did not fully reflect the severity of the global economic crisis. But he said intelligence officials chose not to delay the report, judging that the long-term impact of the economic downturn would not be clear for months.LiNeBrEaK  The Global Trends reports are produced every four years by the National Intelligence Council, which represents all 16 American intelligence agencies, in part to inform long-term thinking by new administrations. The reports project various possible sequences of events in the future; the new publication notes, between dire forecasts, that ''bad outcomes are not inevitable.''LiNeBrEaK  Even if Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups gradually lose support, the remaining violent extremists may have access to increasingly lethal technology, including biological weapons, the report found.LiNeBrEaK  The comments on Al Qaeda's future are based in part on the work of David C. Rapoport, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied the cycles of terrorist activity in the past, including those associated with anarchism, Marxism and nationalism.LiNeBrEaK  The report said the global Islamic terrorist movement was likely to outlast Al Qaeda itself, with other groups likely to emerge and supplant it. But it expects a future of frustration and attrition for Al Qaeda, which Osama bin Laden built during the 1990s.LiNeBrEaK  The intelligence agencies noted that Al Qaeda had focused almost exclusively on terrorism, a contrast with groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, which have transformed themselves into political movements.LiNeBrEaK  ''Al Qaeda has not achieved broad support in the Islamic world,'' the report said. ''Its harsh pan-Islamist ideology and policies appeal only to a tiny minority of Muslims.''

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	A 'project' runway no more at Sea-Tac: An Alaska Airlines flight to Denver inaugurates Sea-Tac Airport's third runway, a project that took 16 years and some $1. 1 billion to build. It should save time and money.  	John Gillie, The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	803 words  	Nov. 21--A wave of applause erupted from the crowd of public officials, engineers, contractors, airline executives and Port of Seattle staffers Thursday afternoon as Alaska Airlines Flight 674 lifted off from Sea-Tac Airport's new runway.LiNeBrEaKThat applause was a long time in coming. LiNeBrEaKThe runway, Sea-Tac's third, was 16 years in the making. The takeoff, the runway's first, represented the culmination of a long political, technical and financial struggle to get the runway built.LiNeBrEaKIn the end, the 8,500-foot-long strip of 17-inch-thick concrete cost nearly $130,000 a foot to build, some $1. 1 billion in all. It cost nearly three times the original estimates and took nearly 10 years longer than predicted to navigate the political minefield laid by its opponents, to earn court and environmental agency approvals, and to build.LiNeBrEaKIn the final analysis, said public officials who spoke at the ceremonies Thursday, the angst and the expense could be worth it.LiNeBrEaKThe runway is designed to cut arrival delays by up to 80 percent and save airlines millions of dollars in fuel previously consumed while planes slowed their arrival to accommodate the airport's limited bad weather capacity.LiNeBrEaKThe new runway, designated 16 Right and 34 Left based on its compass orientation, is far enough separated from the airport's parallel eastern runway to allow two streams of traffic to land during low visibility. The earlier two runways are too close to legally allow planes to land simultaneously on them when weather conditions obstruct vision.LiNeBrEaK"This is a significant success for the Port of Seattle," said John Creighton, Port of Seattle Commission president. "The runway is expected to save over 5 million gallons of fuel for airlines and over 50,000 tons of greenhouse gases per year. Most importantly, it will reduce delays and save millions of dollars for airlines as well as time for passengers."LiNeBrEaKU.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters and Federal Aviation Administration acting Administrator Bobby Sturgell praised the people who got the runway built. The two had had an extraordinary day. They began in the nation's capital, where they dedicated a new runway at Dulles Airport. They flew to Chicago, where they opened a new runway at O'Hare Airport, and then crossed the country to open the third runway at Sea-Tac.LiNeBrEaKThe runway at Dulles was a comparative bargain. It cost $356 million and is 900 feet longer than Sea-Tac's. But the runway terrain there was relatively flat and didn't require the relocation of homes, creeks and roadways as did the one at Sea-Tac.LiNeBrEaKThe third Sea-Tac runway was built on a mountain of fill 130 feet high at its deepest, covering what had been a valley west of the airport. The Port of Seattle razed 400 homes and spent millions reconstructing lakes and creeks west of the airport. The port also acquired a wetland miles away near the Green River and improved it for bird life. The wild areas near the airport are designed not to be attractive to birds because of the danger they pose to jets.LiNeBrEaKThe port said the environmental payoff from the airport construction is just becoming evident. Last week, coho salmon swam up Miller Creek at the foot of the runway and spawned.LiNeBrEaKGov. Christine Gregoire complimented those involved on their tenacity. With a similar resolve, she said, the community can solve two more of its more difficult transportation problems, replacement of the Highway 520 floating bridge across Lake Washington and replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct on the Seattle waterfront.LiNeBrEaKAfter Peters officially radioed the Sea-Tac tower granting permission to open the third runway and the Alaska flight took off for Denver -- a feat visible on big screens flanking the podium inside the airport -- the new runway saw its first official landing, United Flight 197. That flight arrived from Dulles, where it had used the new runway there to take off.LiNeBrEaKThe new runway will be the airport's third for only a few months before a maintenance project closes down Sea-Tac's longest runway, 16 Left. That runway, parts of which were built in 1947 when the airport opened, will be closed from April through September for a complete rebuilding. That $83 million project will replace all the paving and lighting systems and install new taxiway lights with a street-style red light/green light system to keep planes from wandering onto the runway when it's being used.LiNeBrEaKJohn Gillie: 253-597-8663	AIRLINES (93%); AIRPORT RUNWAY CONSTRUCTION (90%); AIRPORTS (90%); DELAYS and POSTPONEMENTS (89%); APPROVALS (73%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (73%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (73%); CLIMATE CHANGE (73%); CIVIL AVIATION (73%)  				Trade/Transportation  	MARY PETERS (52%)  	SEATTLE, WA, USA (94%); CHICAGO, IL, USA (79%) WASHINGTON, USA (95%); ALASKA, USA (94%); ILLINOIS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	November 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The News Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081121-TC-A-project-runway-no-more-at-Sea-Tac-1121  	TC  													
The Oakland Tribune (California)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Area mayors: Bay will be electric-car capital  	Kelly Rayburn, The Oakland Tribune, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	619 words  	Nov. 21--SAN FRANCISCO -- The mayors of the Bay Area's three largest cities pledged Thursday to make the region the electric-car capital of the country, unveiling plans to work with a Palo Alto startup to build the infrastructure needed to bring more electric cars to the road.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement came as the country faces an economic crisis and as the domestic automobile industry hopes for billions in aid from the federal government in order to stay afloat. LiNeBrEaKOakland Mayor Ron Dellums said the challenges facing the auto industry and the economy in general, as well as the challenges posed by climate change and oil dependence, all have short-term answers but that long-term solutions are needed to confront them adequately.LiNeBrEaK"Our being here to challenge ourselves to come together to create in this region an electric-vehicle capital of America is absolutely extraordinary," he said.LiNeBrEaKDellums, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed unveiled a nine-point strategy to bring more zero-emissions cars to the region.LiNeBrEaKThe mayors were joined at a news conference Thursday by business and academic leaders, a representative from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's office, state Sen.-elect Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, environmental activist Robert Kennedy Jr. and Shai Agassi, CEO of the Palo Alto-based startup Better Place, which plans to build a $1 billion network for electric cars in the Bay Area.LiNeBrEaKBetter Place intends to follow aLiNeBrEaKbusiness model it has used in Israel, Denmark and Australia to provide electric-car drivers with stations across the region where they will be able to charge and replace batteries. Better Place hopes to have the network completed by 2012.LiNeBrEaKAgassi said electric vehicles are the cars of the future -- and he hoped that automakers in Detroit will jump on board.LiNeBrEaK"We need to stop the conversation of whether this is Detroit versus the Silicon Valley, whether this is Michigan against California, and we need to start thinking about this as the next generation of the car," Agassi said. "On the 100th anniversary of the Ford Model T, it's about time we change from car 1. 0 to car 2. 0."LiNeBrEaKThe policies the mayors outlined include speeding up the permit and installation processes for charging outlets; providing incentives for employers who install charging systems in their workplaces; developing standard regulation polices across the region; and establishing programs to purchase electric vehicles for use by city and state employees.LiNeBrEaKReed said cities would play a key role in putting electric cars on the road, even if private companies will take the lead in making them.LiNeBrEaK"While the private sector can build the vehicles, the public sector has an enormously important role to make sure that have we the infrastructure for somebody who buys the vehicle to be able to drive it, to be able to recharge it," he said. "When your battery runs a little low, what are going to do? We're part of that answer."LiNeBrEaKNewsom said the push for more electric vehicles is personal.LiNeBrEaK"I don't believe that halfway is good enough," Newsom said. "I'm a guy who's driving a hybrid, but I don't feel particularly good about that. I believe that the big game-changer is electric vehicles and plug-in technology."LiNeBrEaKReach Kelly Rayburn at 510-208-6435 or krayburn@bayareanewsgroup.com	ELECTRIC VEHICLES (93%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (89%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (87%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); VEHICLE TRAFFIC (72%); PRESS CONFERENCES (71%); EMISSIONS (69%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (67%); PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES (57%); ANNIVERSARIES (50%)  				Automobiles/Highways  	ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (55%)  	SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (94%); SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (94%); DETROIT, MI, USA (92%); SAN JOSE, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); MICHIGAN, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%); ISRAEL (79%)  	November 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Oakland Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081121-OX-Area-mayors-Bay-will-be-electric-car-capital-1121  	OX  													
Omaha World - Herald (Nebraska)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Nebraska winter to test plug-in hybrid car  	Nancy Gaarder, Omaha World-Herald, Neb.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	565 words  	Nov. 21--A plug-in hybrid car, considered one way to help reduce global warming emissions and dependence on foreign oil, is being tested in Nebraska and will get a chance to prove itself against harsh Midwestern winters.LiNeBrEaKThe Omaha Public Power District has put a converted Toyota Prius on the road, becoming the first utility in the state to do so, said spokesman Mike Jones. The Nebraska Public Power District also plans to test one. LiNeBrEaKPlug-in hybrids are just what the name says: hybrid gasoline-electric cars that are equipped with a cord so that they can be plugged into a regular outlet overnight for recharging. Conventional hybrid cars recharge their batteries using energy from the car as it is being driven.LiNeBrEaKOPPD bought a conventional hybrid for about $22,000 and then had it adapted for about $11,000, Jones said.LiNeBrEaKMarc Nichols, division manager for sustainable energy and environmental stewardship at OPPD, said most testing of plug-ins has been on the West Coast. This pilot project by OPPD will provide an understanding of how the cars perform in frigid weather.LiNeBrEaKAdditionally, the utility will gain general familiarity with plug-ins, which, if they become popular, could generate additional demand for electricity. In that sense, the electric industry could become a fuel provider for the transportation industry, Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKThe vehicle can be plugged into an ordinary household outlet. OPPD is keeping the plug-in at its garage and having various employees drive it. The car has been on the road since October, but for now, it's too early to draw a conclusion about it, Jones said.LiNeBrEaK"Time will tell," he said. "Some people have questioned how they perform, but we don't know. That's the reason we wanted to test it."LiNeBrEaKThe potential benefit of a plug-in over a conventional hybrid is that it can be driven farther on pure electrical power because it can draw a charge both from being plugged in and from its battery backup, said Jana Hartline, environmental communications manager for Toyota. Plug-in vehicles are not yet available commercially.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the car being tested by OPPD does not recharge itself while being driven. The modified OPPD car switches to its gasoline engine after using up its battery power.LiNeBrEaKAccording to OPPD, the car is supposed to be able to travel about 30 miles without using gasoline. OPPD estimates the battery uses about 40 cents worth of electricity to charge.LiNeBrEaKThe car operates on a 187-pound battery fitted in the spare tire well and travels mostly on electric power at speeds below 25 mph, said Steve Anderson, manager of transportation and construction equipment.LiNeBrEaKWhen traveling above 25 miles per hour, climbing hills or accelerating, the car needs a boost from its regular engine, he said.LiNeBrEaKHartline said Toyota plans to roll out a plug-in model late next year for testing by universities and governments across the country. Chevrolet has a version, the Volt, that it plans to launch in 2010.LiNeBrEaK--Contact the writer: 444-1102, nancy.gaarder@owh.com	AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (93%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (78%); HYBRID VEHICLES (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (77%); ENERGY DEMAND (77%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (76%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (72%); TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (71%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (68%)  	OMAHA PUBLIC POWER DISTRICT (58%); NEBRASKA PUBLIC POWER DISTRICT (57%)  		NYSE:TM  	General  		NEBRASKA, USA (94%); MIDWEST USA (90%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Omaha World - Herald   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081121-OM-Nebraska-winter-to-test-plug-in-hybrid-car-1121  	OM

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   Sunrise Edition	Waxman, Congress and Detroit  	The Oregonian  	Editorial; Pg. B06  	461 words  	SUMMARY: The House promotes a tougher chairman, but it must also find a way to help automakersLiNeBrEaKWaxman, Congress and DetroitLiNeBrEaKM aybe the events of the past couple of days regarding Congress and the Detroit automakers signal the dawning of reality for both. LiNeBrEaKThe House Democratic leadership on Thursday ousted John Dingell, D-Mich., from his longtime post as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, where he had used his power to shield the American automakers from pressure to do such things as increase fuel efficiency to help the environment. His replacement, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is, as the expression goes, all about helping the environment, especially through the mechanism of fuel-efficiency standards.LiNeBrEaKWaxman is considered an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who also is a Californian and a strong supporter of efforts to combat global warming on the automotive front and elsewhere. He also is likely to be more aligned with President-elect Barack Obama's views about global warming and other environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKAll in all, Waxman's successful effort to unseat Dingell is for the best. Probably even for Detroit.LiNeBrEaKAmong the many things that have left the American auto industry in its present state has been its clear unwillingness and evident inability to produce more environmentally friendly vehicles. Dingell's supporters have pointed out that, as a supporter of the Endangered Species Act and other landmark environmental advances, he is not without credentials in this area. But he has also been a chief abettor of Detroit as it dodged its responsibilities.LiNeBrEaKNow, it turns out that fuel economy and environmental friendliness are selling points just when Detroit could use a few. Dingell's protection probably delayed that moment of realization. Waxman's ascension to the committee chairmanship helps give Congress the backbone to both push Detroit in the right direction while also moving to save the industry.LiNeBrEaKThis is where the House needs to come to its own realization, because the other thing House leaders did Thursday was sidetrack the Detroit bailout package on grounds that nothing now on the table has a chance of being approved. The move could be an abandonment of Detroit or recognition that, sometime soon, Congress must find a plan that will pass. We hope it's the latter.LiNeBrEaKThe nation needs a stronger domestic auto industry in the long term --one that produces environmentally safer products that burn less gasoline, or maybe none at all.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Obama may ease stand on environment, Whitman says  	David M. Brown, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	528 words  	Nov. 21--The nation can expect environmental regulations to start tightening soon after President-elect Barack Obama takes office in January, former Environmental Protection Agency chief Christine Todd Whitman predicted Thursday in Pittsburgh. LiNeBrEaKBut because of the ongoing financial crisis pummeling the U.S. and global economies, Obama probably will be forced to scale back or delay some of his campaign promises on a cleaner environment and other issues, said Whitman, the Republican former New Jersey governor who led the EPA during President Bush's first term.LiNeBrEaK"Clearly, one of the greatest challenges the Obama administration faces is finding that balance" between the expectations of supporters and what's possible under the circumstances, Whitman told about 200 participants at a symposium presented by Duquesne University's School of Business and Beard Center for Leadership in Ethics.LiNeBrEaKObama is expected to instruct the EPA to use the 1990 Clean Air Act as a guideline for setting carbon dioxide emissions limits on power plants and manufacturers. This would be a departure from the position taken by Bush. He declined to curb CO2 emissions even after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the Clean Air Act gives the EPA authority to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"I think (Obama) will tell EPA to exercise the authority that the Supreme Court determined that it had to regulate carbon," Whitman said in an interview. "You probably won't see an administration bill on carbon or climate change in the first year or two. You may not see it in this Congress, though you might see it in the next one.LiNeBrEaK"But there will effectively be a cap on carbon if they get the EPA to move forward," she said.LiNeBrEaKObama has called for annual targets that would aim to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and then by an additional 80 percent by 2050. The president-elect and many others believe carbon emissions are pollutants that contribute to global climate change.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama "made several very far-reaching promises and set some very high goals for himself -- some of which may have to be scaled back. There is no question about it given the current fiscal crisis we're facing in this country," Whitman said.LiNeBrEaKObama fully realizes he will have to modify some of his plans, even if it is just the time frame he put on certain goals, Whitman believes.LiNeBrEaK"He really set the tone for it on election night, when he said we may not get this done right away. He may not get it done even in this term but 'we're going to get it done.' That's what people really want to hear," she said. "That's really the responsible way to approach it given he's facing this uncertain world that we have."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   SOONER EDITION	AL-QAIDA LOSING ITS APPEAL, STUDY SAYS;  INTELLIGENCE REPORT ALSO FORECASTS WANING OF U.S. POWER IN THE WORLD 	Scott Shane, The New York Times  	WORLD; Pg. A-4  	612 words  	WASHINGTON -- A new study of the global future by U.S. intelligence agencies suggests that the al-Qaida terror network could soon be on the decline, having alienated Muslim supporters with indiscriminate killing and inattention to the practical problems of poverty, unemployment and education.LiNeBrEaKWhile not contradicting intelligence assessments suggesting that al-Qaida remains a major threat with a strong presence in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the report says the group "may decay sooner" than many experts have assumed because of severe weaknesses: "unachievable strategic objectives, inability to attract broad-based support and self-destructive actions." LiNeBrEaK"The appeal of terrorism is waning," said Mathew J. Burrows, head of long-range analysis in the office of the Director of National Intelligence and a lead author of "Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World." Mr. Burrows said polls and anecdotal evidence strongly suggested disillusionment among Muslims with al-Qaida and its methods and goals since the 2001 terrorist attacks.LiNeBrEaKThe predicted decline of al-Qaida is one of the few bright spots in the generally gloomy report, which describes a decline in U.S. world dominance as China, India and other powers assert themselves. "Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful actor, the United States' relative strength -- even in the military realm -- will decline and U.S. leverage will become more constrained," the report said.LiNeBrEaKBy 2025, it predicted, "the U.S. will find itself as one of a number of important actors on the world stage," playing "a prominent role in global events," but not a decisive one as in the past.LiNeBrEaKThe report said the global shift from West to East in terms of wealth and economic power "is without precedent in modern history." Of a projected population increase of 1. 2 billion worldwide by 2025, only 3 percent will occur in Western countries, it said.LiNeBrEaK"We're projecting a multipolar world," C. Thomas Fingar, chairman of the National Intelligence Council and the government's top intelligence analyst, said yesterday at a briefing on the report. "The unipolar moment is over, or certainly will be over by 2025."LiNeBrEaKThe previous report in the Global Trends series, completed in 2004, anticipated continued U.S. dominance through 2020, though it recognized that the emergence of China and India as powers would transform the geopolitical landscape.LiNeBrEaKThe new report describes a world riven by increased conflict over scarce food and water supplies and threatened by rogue states and terrorists, widening gaps between rich and poor and an uneven impact of global warming. It said the chance of the use of nuclear weapons, while remaining "very low," would rise in the next two decades as nuclear technology spread.LiNeBrEaKThe report said Russia's emergence as a world power was "clouded" by persistent corruption and lagging investment in its critical energy industry. It also noted, without naming a specific country, that a government in Eastern Europe "could be effectively taken over and run by organized crime."LiNeBrEaKMr. Fingar acknowledged that the report, in the works for months, did not fully reflect the severity of the global economic crisis. But he said intelligence officials chose not to delay the report, judging that the long-term impact of the economic downturn would not be clear for months.LiNeBrEaKThe Global Trends reports are produced every four years by the National Intelligence Council, which represents all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, in part to inform long-term thinking by new administrations. The latest report project various possible sequences of events in the future, noting that "bad outcomes are not inevitable."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   SOONER EDITION	PROPOSAL WOULD DROP CLIMATE FROM SPECIES RISKS  		NATIONAL; NATIONAL BRIEFS; Pg. A-5  	382 words  	WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is finalizing changes to the Endangered Species Act that would ensure that federal agencies will not have to take global warming into account when assessing risks to imperiled plants and animals. LiNeBrEaKThe proposed rule changes, which were obtained by The Washington Post, are under review by the Office of Management and Budget and are close to being published in the Federal Register.LiNeBrEaKThe main purpose of the new regulations, which were first unveiled in August, is to eliminate a longstanding provision of the Endangered Species Act that requires an independent scientific review by either the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of any federal project that could potentially affect a protected species.LiNeBrEaKTobacco funds misused?LiNeBrEaKDespite the promises of politicians and policymakers, states and counties have spent the lion's share of the landmark 1998 tobacco settlement on things that have nothing to do with public health or smoking, even as once-falling teen smoking rates have stagnated.LiNeBrEaKOf the $61. 5 billion divided among 46 states between 2000 and 2006, only 30 percent was spent on health care, according to federal Government Accountability Office data analyzed by The Associated Press. Less than 4 percent went to anti-smoking efforts.LiNeBrEaK2 senatorial milestonesLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., turned 91 yesterday. The longest-serving member of the Senate was honored with a party in the Capitol's historic Senate Appropriations Committee parlor.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this month, Mr. Byrd announced he would give up his chairmanship of the appropriations panel in the new Congress that convenes in January.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, on the Senate floor, "Uncle Ted" Stevens, the chamber's longest-serving Republican, delivered his swan song address. The Alaska lawmaker, 85, made only a passing reference to his felony convictions and the loss this week of his bid for a seventh Senate term.LiNeBrEaKMukasey collapsesLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Attorney General Michael Mukasey collapsed and lost consciousness during a speech in Washington last night and was rushed to a hospital.LiNeBrEaKThe Justice Department said in a statement that Mr. Mukasey, 67, was "conscious, conversant and alert" but would remain overnight at George Washington University Hospital.

Post and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Soaring water demand alarming  	Bo Petersen, The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	487 words  	Nov. 21--Demand for water in South Carolina rose nearly 1,000 percent in the last 40 years -- three times more than surrounding states. The National Wildlife Federation has sounded a conservation alarm with that finding. LiNeBrEaKThe state is thought to be in relatively good shape compared with its neighbors -- abundant with rivers and lakes and not so industrialized. But water use rose far more than the 60 percent increase in population between 1960 and 2000, said Amanda Staudt, federation climate scientist.LiNeBrEaK"This increase reflects in part that South Carolina water use was quite low in 1960," she conceded. But "the biggest contributor to this increase is the use of water for thermoelectric power generation, which accounts for 80 percent of the freshwater usage in the state."LiNeBrEaKThe federation released the report Thursday, joining a series of environmental groups calling for state control of who withdraws how much water from its rivers and lakes, as well steps to reduce electricity consumption and shift to clean energy alternatives -- to save water as well as combat climate warming.LiNeBrEaKAn attempt to permit large-scale water withdrawals is now stalled in the state Legislature by lobbyists for both environmental and manufacturing interests.LiNeBrEaKLewis Gossett, S.C. Manufacturers Alliance president, on Thursday had not seen the study. But he said the key is how much water is available, not how much you use.LiNeBrEaK"We can see the need for a water plan, but it needs to be science-based. That's where our disagreement is. Our great concern is, don't throw out the baby with the bath water -- don't destroy economic growth with an overly restrictive plan," he said.LiNeBrEaKIncreasing demand for water in the rapidly developing Southeast, exacerbated by recent droughts, is beginning to cause water shortages, pushing the region into Western-style legal "water wars."LiNeBrEaKThe report joins a number of studies raising an alarm that the situation will continue to worsen as water supplies diminish to factors such as saltwater intrusion and drier conditions spurred by climate warming.LiNeBrEaKSouth Carolina is suing North Carolina over proposed water withdrawals out of its Catawba basin. The lawsuit is now being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court; it's in the early stage of collecting depositions and other information.LiNeBrEaKThe Catawba flows from that state and joins South Carolina rivers, eventually providing nearly half the water that flows into the Marion-Moultrie lakes, the source of drinking water for most of the Lowcountry.

A09  	269 words  	WASHINGTON ? Democrats steered the House toward more aggressively tackling global warming and other environmental problems Thursday, toppling veteran Michigan Rep. John Dingell, a staunch supporter of Detroit automakers, from an important energy panel in favor of California liberal Rep. Henry Waxman. LiNeBrEaKThe switch could help President-elect Barack Obama on Capitol Hill with one of his favored issues: trying to curb global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But Waxman?s combative stance on climate change and other issues also could alienate Republicans and moderate Democrats, making it harder to get the bipartisan support Obama will need.LiNeBrEaKWaxman is an avid environmentalist and booster of health care programs. He defeated Dingell on a 137-122 vote in the Democratic Party caucus, capping a bruising intraparty fight.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy and Commerce panel is one of the most important House committees, with sweeping jurisdiction over energy, the environment, consumer protection, telecommunications and health care programs such as Medicaid and the popular State Children?s Health Insurance Program.LiNeBrEaKWaxman was the candidate of change in a year dominated by that theme. He likened the first years of the Obama administration to a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get things done in Washington.LiNeBrEaKWaxman, 69, has a lengthy congressional r&eacute;sum&eacute; of aggressive investigations and legislative action.LiNeBrEaKDingell?s reputation for putting Detroit?s auto interests above all else didn?t help his campaign to keep his job ? especially as automakers seeking a bailout have been taking a public-relations pounding on Capitol Hill.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   All Editions	Playtime's in danger of being over for good;  Experts say children not getting enough of it 	By DAVID CRARY, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Wire Services  	NEWS; Pg. A25  	768 words  	NEW YORK ? In one classroom, a group of preschool teachers squatted on the floor, pretending to be cave-dwelling hunter-gatherers. Next door, another group ended a raucous musical game by placing their tambourines and drums atop their heads.LiNeBrEaKSilly business, to be sure, but part of a most serious agenda: to spread the word that America's children need more time for freewheeling play at home and in school. LiNeBrEaK"We're all sad, and we're a little worried. ? We're sad about something missing in childhood," psychologist and author Michael Thompson told 900 early childhood educators from 22 states packed into an auditorium last week.LiNeBrEaK"We have to fight back," he declared. "We're going to fight for play."LiNeBrEaKAfter his keynote speech at New York's 92nd Street Y, the teachers dispersed into dozens of workshops, some lighthearted, some scholarly ? but all supporting the case that creative, spontaneous play is both vital and endangered.LiNeBrEaKIt's not a brand-new cause ? two years ago it was endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. But social changes and new demands on kids' spare time confront free-play advocates with an ever-moving target.LiNeBrEaKAmong the speakers at last week's Wonderplay conference Y was Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a Temple University psychologist who contends that lack of play in early childhood education "could be the next global warming."LiNeBrEaKWithout ample opportunity for forms of play that foster innovation and creative thinking, she argues, America's children will be at a disadvantage in the global economy.LiNeBrEaK"Play equals learning," she said. "For too long we have divorced the two."LiNeBrEaKSome of the factors behind diminished play time have been evolving for decades, others are more recent. Added together, they have resulted in eight to 12 fewer hours of free play time per week for the average American child since the 1980s, experts say.LiNeBrEaKAmong the key factors, according to Thompson:LiNeBrEaK* Parents' reluctance to let their kids play outside on their own, for fear of abduction or injury, and the companion trend of scheduling lessons, supervised sports and other structured activities that consume a large chunk of a child's non-school hours.LiNeBrEaK* More hours per week spent by kids watching TV, playing video games, using the Internet, communicating on cellphones.LiNeBrEaK* Shortening or eliminating recess at many schools ? a trend so pronounced that the National PTA has launched a "Rescuing Recess" campaign.LiNeBrEaK* More emphasis on formal learning in preschool, more homework for elementary school students and more pressure from parents on young children to quickly acquire academic skills.LiNeBrEaK"Parents are more self-conscious and competitive than in the past," Thompson said. "They're pushing their kids to excel. ? Free play loses out."LiNeBrEaKThe consequences are potentially dire, according to Thompson. He contends that diminished time to play freely with other children is producing a generation of socially inept young people and is a factor behind high rates of youth obesity, anxiety, attention-deficit disorder and depression.LiNeBrEaKMany families turn to organized sports as a principal non-school activity, but Thompson noted that this option doesn't necessary breed creativity and can lead to burnout for good young athletes and frustration for the less skilled.LiNeBrEaKVivian Paley, a former kindergarten teacher at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and now an author and consultant, argues that the most vital form of play for young children involves fantasy and role-playing with their peers.LiNeBrEaK"They're inventing abstract thinking, before the world tells them what to think," Paley said in her speech to the conference. "It gets them thinking, 'I am intended to have my own ideas.' "LiNeBrEaKShe worried that preschools, in the drive to prepare students for the academic challenges ahead, are reducing the opportunity for group fantasy play ? and thus reducing children's chances to learn on their own about fairness, kindness and other social interactions.LiNeBrEaK"The theater of the young receives the least attention from those planning the curriculum of our nation's schools," Paley said. "This very activity is being dismantled in our schools to make room for early phonics. ? Preschoolers are being asked to practice being first graders."LiNeBrEaKFretta Reitzes, director of the 92 Street Y's youth and family center, which serves more than 6,000 children, says many of the parents she sees are struggling to find the right balance for their kids' schedules, asking "How much is too much?"LiNeBrEaKPreschool teachers need to lead by example, Reitzes said.LiNeBrEaK"Bringing play back into the lives of children, it's not just OK," she said. "It's really good for them."

Sacramento Bee (California)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	State emissions plan debated at Sacramento hearing  	Jim Downing, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	459 words  	Nov. 21--Business and environmental groups argued Thursday over whether California's plan to fight global warming will be a boon or a burden for the economy and low-income communities. LiNeBrEaKMore than 200 people from around the state signed up to testify at the final public hearing on the Air Resources Board's proposal for cutting climate-warming emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, as required under a 2006 state law.LiNeBrEaKThe strategy, first released in June, would get most of those cuts by mandating large improvements in energy efficiency as well as rapid expansion of the state's renewable power capacity. It also calls for a market for buying and selling the right to produce greenhouse gases -- a so-called cap and trade system.LiNeBrEaKThe air board is scheduled to approve a final version of the framework at its meeting Dec. 11-12 in Sacramento. State regulators will spend the next two years filling in the details, with most policies taking effect in 2012 or later.LiNeBrEaKBy cutting power and fuel bills and fostering a green-tech industry, the plan should ultimately deliver billions of dollars in net economic benefit, according to the state's analysis.LiNeBrEaKBut the transition to a lower-carbon economy carries uncertain costs -- a point several business leaders emphasized Thursday.LiNeBrEaK"They don't tell us how we get there," said Edwin Lombard, a board member of the California Black Chamber of Commerce, in an interview.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups, along with some business and venture capital interests, argue that efficiency improvements have been shown to pay off quickly.LiNeBrEaK"This is not an experiment. This is pretty straightforward stuff," said James Fine, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund, in an interview.LiNeBrEaKThe cap-and-trade proposal also drew criticism Thursday. Groups representing low-income and minority groups have united to oppose it altogether, arguing that a market would tend to concentrate polluting industries in their communities. At noon Thursday, about 100 activists rallied outside the air board headquarters.LiNeBrEaKThe crafting of the state's plan is being watched across the country and may serve as a model for federal greenhouse-gas strategies. Indeed, air board Chairwoman Mary Nichols is rumored to be a candidate to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Jim Downing, (916) 321-1065.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Emissions plan calls for tougher rules, fees;  State's goal is return to 1990 levels by 2020 	Michael Gardner, U-T SACRAMENTO BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1163 words  	SACRAMENTO -- A draft blueprint to stem global warming counts on businesses and everyday Californians to accept a mix of tough regulations and new fees, perhaps as much as $1. 5 billion a year collected on targeted products and water bills.LiNeBrEaKThe state Air Resources Board spent yesterday drawing praise and protest for its groundbreaking initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming. LiNeBrEaKRegulators now will refine the plan before they gather next month for a final vote on the blueprint, which would require a gradual rollback in emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020, an approximately 25 percent cut.LiNeBrEaKTheir vast proposals include allowing businesses to buy and sell emission credits, imposing fees on water use and requiring utilities to generate 33 percent of electricity from renewable sources. Vehicles are major targets: The plan lays out a framework for pursuing strict limits on tailpipe emissions.LiNeBrEaKSpecifics, including detailed regulations, financial incentives and fees, will still need to be hammered out among regulators and lawmakers in time for a 2012 launch.LiNeBrEaKThe air board hearing was just one in a string of developments over recent days that signal a willingness to confront the global warming threat even during a worldwide economic slump.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., yesterday introduced legislation calling for the federal government to invest $15 billion annually in clean energy, a move she said would reduce reliance on oil and coal while stimulating job growth.LiNeBrEaKBoxer also proposed a national "cap and trade" program that would limit industry emissions. To encourage compliance and investment in clean technology, companies that come in under the cap would be provided pollution credits that then could be sold to other businesses. Those companies could use the newly bought credits to comply with emissions standards. California already is pushing that idea as part of the air board plan.LiNeBrEaK"By investing in clean energy technologies and reducing our dependence on foreign oil, we also have a recipe for economic recovery," Boxer said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKBoxer's package is similar to proposals advanced by President-elect Barack Obama, who addressed world leaders gathered in Beverly Hills this week for a two-day global warming summit organized by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaKIn remarks delivered by video Tuesday, Obama unequivocally committed to pursuing remedies. "Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all," the Democrat said.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger, a Republican who has gained international recognition for aggressively attacking global warming, said he's eager to join forces.LiNeBrEaK"We in California are ready to go and do everything that it takes in order to help his administration to follow through with his environmental vision," the governor said.LiNeBrEaKTops on California's agenda: obtaining federal permission to regulate vehicle tailpipe exhaust to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Bush administration and automakers have resisted regulations, but officials in Sacramento are convinced Obama will act swiftly to grant authority to the state.LiNeBrEaKAdding to California's optimism is the ouster of an automaker ally, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Replacing him is Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, a staunch advocate of policies aimed at reducing global warming.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia estimates that about 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to the automobile. Vehicle regulations over time would account for 18 percent of the reduction in emissions, according to one state analysis of the air board plan.LiNeBrEaKThe air board's draft plan also refers to "feebate" strategies that could be implemented to further cut vehicle emissions. The proposal calls for rewarding buyers of fuel-efficient cars with rebates. To discourage taking home gas-guzzlers, fees would be added to the purchase of large vehicles.LiNeBrEaKJust how far and fast California goes remains a work in progress as the state board grapples with its broader plan while trying to answer complaints that it costs too much.LiNeBrEaKWithout a comprehensive strategy, regulators say, even slight increases in temperatures could trigger catastrophic climatic disruptions that threaten crops, water supplies and the environment.LiNeBrEaKCritics this week were supplied some ammunition by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Its analysis found that some of the air board's economic impact figures "are inconsistent and incomplete," and it criticizes the air board for selecting strategies first and then doing the financial study "after the fact."LiNeBrEaKMoreover, the air board has failed to lay out specifically how much compliance could cost and when businesses could expect to recoup those investments -- an important consideration for companies struggling to adjust, the analysis pointed out.LiNeBrEaKRon Roberts, an air board member and San Diego County supervisor, said gyrations over cost are premature, given that the board plans to work on cushioning the impact between now and 2012.LiNeBrEaK"We have a long way to go," he said. "This really is a first step."LiNeBrEaKRoberts said regulators must act even with the country in a slump.LiNeBrEaK"The economic meltdown is temporary," he said. "What we're really confronted with is an environmental meltdown that cannot be ignored."LiNeBrEaKBut an array of business representatives fear higher costs passed on to them for electricity, gas and goods.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to really hurt us. This is the wrong time," said Marco Polo Cortes, president of the San Diego County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaKThe air board is studying a water fee to raise between $100 million and $500 million annually. The thinking is that it takes a lot of energy, thus high greenhouse gas emissions, to move water to farms, businesses and homes. Such a fee is not unprecedented. For example, the state collects 19 cents a month from San Diego Gas and Electric Co. customers, some of which is plowed back into programs to encourage conservation. The new water fee could be used to accomplish similar goals, regulators say.LiNeBrEaKAn additional $300 million to $1 billion could be raised by taxing certain products associated with high emissions, such as refrigerants and insulation. A share of the money could go to a rebate plan to encourage consumers to buy energy-efficient appliances. Removing one old refrigerator could save the same amount of emissions generated by a car in a year, air board officials say.LiNeBrEaKHIGHLIGHTS OF THE AIR BOARD'S DRAFT BLUEPRINTLiNeBrEaKGreenhouse gases: Roll back emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a 25 percent cut.LiNeBrEaKEmission credits: Allow low-polluting businesses to sell credits to businesses that are not.LiNeBrEaKNew fees: On water use and products known for high greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy: Require utilities to generate 33 percent of electricity from renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKAuto emissions: Push for federal approval of state tailpipe emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKIncentives: Rebates for buyers of fuel-efficient cars, fees on the purchase of gas-guzzlers.

The Salem News (Beverly, Massachusetts)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	At local churches, bells toll for environment  	Cate Lecuyer, The Salem News, Beverly, Mass.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	538 words  	Nov. 21--BEVERLY -- Church bells over the weekend and next week will ring 350 times all across Beverly and the world -- and it has nothing to do with services.LiNeBrEaKRather, it's an international, interfaith effort to raise awareness about the environmental state of our planet.LiNeBrEaK"We've been given the planet by God to care for, and we haven't done a very good job," said the Rev. Manny Faria at St. Peter Episcopal Church on Ocean Street. LiNeBrEaKAfter the Sunday service, 35 children from the parish will each ring the steeple bell 10 times, from about 11: 30 a.m. to noon. The Second Congregational Church on Cabot Street will also ring its bells 350 times tomorrow, tolling 50 times every half-hour, from 9: 30 a.m. until 12: 30 p.m.LiNeBrEaKThe magic 350 number is, according to the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, "the parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that our planet can sustain without causing cataclysmic and irreversible damage to life as we know it."LiNeBrEaKWe're currently at 385 parts per million and climbing. The global effort is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 350 before the planet warms to the point of irreversible destruction, according to the campaign.LiNeBrEaK"God's creation is dying, and if we don't do something about it, people are going to suffer," said the Rt. Rev. Bud Cederholm, bishop suffragan of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. "We're going to partner with government and partner with industries to make a difference."LiNeBrEaKCederholm helped organize the bell-ringing campaign among Episcopal churches, which are heavily involved with the movement, but it stretches across denominations. Chimes will sound from churches of Unitarian and Methodist, Catholic and Protestant denominations, as well as from synagogues and mosques.LiNeBrEaK"It's really an interfaith movement that has begun," Cederholm said.LiNeBrEaKThe movement also extends beyond religion and is part of a global grassroots campaign to combat climate change by organizing events around the number 350 -- from demonstrations by schoolchildren in India, to a local art contest in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.LiNeBrEaKIn terms of the bell-ringing effort, the goal is to get 350 churches to chime anytime between this Sunday, which is the Feast of Christ the King, and next Sunday, which is the first Sunday of Advent.LiNeBrEaKBut only a handful of churches that are participating have registered on www. 350.org, and some have started early. The Tabernacle Congregational Church in Salem rang its bells on Nov. 2.LiNeBrEaKThe movement is gathering steam, and when church bells "start ringing like crazy," Faria said he hopes people will take the time to reflect on the last eight years during which the U.S. government did little to take on global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, people are going to hear these bells and stop and think," he said. "What better way for a wake-up call than to ring bells?"

Brian Schweitzer will meet this morning with President-elect Barack Obama's top transition leader to deliver a bipartisan energy proposal from Western governors.LiNeBrEaKThe plan, supported by 14 Western governors, includes what Huntsman labeled a "road map" for the new administration and includes a so-called cap-and-trade program, goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing renewable energies, and suggestions for weaning the country off foreign sources of oil. LiNeBrEaKHuntsman, a Republican and chairman of the Western Governors Association, is scheduled to meet in Washington with John Podesta, co-chairman of Obama's transition team, to present a four-page letter that the Utah governor said outlines principles that should be incorporated into national energy policy.LiNeBrEaK"It will serve as a useful tool," Huntsman said in an interview Thursday. "There's a lot of thinking going on about energy policy and what it will look like, how it will impact the states, how states will respond, for example, of initiatives coming out of Washington. And we hope that this is a helpful reminder that the West does feel passionate about energy."LiNeBrEaKHuntsman declined to share the plan publicly Thursday, but said one key component is a cap-and-trade program that would legislate mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions and provide for a trading system for companies polluting moreLiNeBrEaKthan others. Discussions of such a system generally call for a permitting process that would give an incentive to companies to pollute less.LiNeBrEaKWhile such a program has hit resistance with some Republican factions, including Utah's Republican-majority Legislature, Huntsman says there will ultimately have to be a price put on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK"You have to value carbon if you're going to take climate issues seriously," Huntsman said. "That either supposes you're going to have a carbon tax or you're going to have a cap-and-trade program. It has to be one or the other."LiNeBrEaKAn Obama White House may be receptive to some of the ideas Huntsman and his fellow governors are pushing.LiNeBrEaKObama said in a message to the Bi-Partisan Governors Global Climate Summit in Los Angeles that governors have shown "true leadership in the fight to combat global warming" and that he supports a cap-and-trade program.LiNeBrEaK"Any change won't be easy and it won't come overnight," Obama said in the taped message.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	Waxman win boosts state clout in D.C.;  GLOBAL WARMING;  Avid environmentalist to lead panel with jurisdiction over climate change, energy	Zachary Coile, Chronicle Washington Bureau  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1086 words  	 Los Angeles Rep. Henry Waxman's stunning overthrow Thursday of legendary Michigan Rep. John Dingell to take over one of the House's most powerful committees may be bad news for Detroit and its struggling auto industry, but it's a clear sign of California's growing clout in Washington.LiNeBrEaKAfter years battling the Bush administration and Dingell over the state's efforts to set the nation's toughest limits on greenhouse gases, Californians now control both House and Senate committees that will be writing climate-change legislation. They will have key allies in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, and President-elect Barack Obama, who just this week pledged rapid action on global warming. LiNeBrEaK"It just signals the sea change we're facing," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, who plans to start moving climate-related bills in January. "It's a good sea change, it's momentous."LiNeBrEaKWaxman's victory as the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee rocked Capitol Hill, upending the House's traditional seniority system by ousting the 82-year-old Dingell, the dean of the House, who was just months away from becoming the chamber's longest-serving chairman. LiNeBrEaKOver 28 years as the panel's top Democrat, Dingell racked up a long list of accomplishments, passing the Endangered Species Act and expanding health care for children. But critics saw him as too industry-friendly, accusing him of shielding automakers from stronger fuel-economy standards and opposing tougher air pollution limits on power plants.LiNeBrEaKClashed with DingellLiNeBrEaKWaxman, 69, an avid environmentalist who has clashed with Dingell for three decades over issues from the Clean Air Act to climate change, saw an opening after Obama's victory this month. The committee has jurisdiction over three top elements of Obama's agenda - health care, energy and global warming - and Waxman made the case to his colleagues that Dingell would be a roadblock to enacting the new president's policies.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers inside the Cannon caucus room, where Thursday's vote of the party caucus took place, said Dingell urged Democrats to remember his legislative accomplishments, while his allies urged members to respect seniority. Waxman responded by laying out his policy disagreements with Dingell over the years, casting himself as a change agent more in line with Obama.LiNeBrEaK"You could almost feel the votes move in the room" during Waxman's speech, said Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez, who helped run his fellow Californian's bid for the job.LiNeBrEaKAt the end of voting, Waxman had prevailed, 137-122. LiNeBrEaKOutside the hearing room, Waxman told a crowd of reporters, "The prevailing view in the caucus, and the argument we made, was that we needed a change for the committee. ... We have an opportunity that maybe only comes once in a generation."LiNeBrEaKDingell was gracious in defeat, issuing a statement pledging to work closely with Waxman on the committee. "Well, this was clearly a change year, and I congratulate my colleague Henry Waxman on his success today," he said.LiNeBrEaKA major factor in Dingell's defeat was the sense among many Democrats, particularly the party's liberal wing, that he had been slow to address climate change. Dingell released a 461-page draft climate change bill last month, but many members believed Waxman would be more aggressive.LiNeBrEaKDingell antagonized California lawmakers by floating a draft bill last year to prevent states from enforcing tough limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles - limits that were later blocked by President Bush's Environmental Protection Agency anyway. He also clashed with Pelosi over the creation of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming last year and over her push to raise fuel-economy standards, although Dingell ultimately backed the increase.LiNeBrEaKPelosi was officially neutral in the race between Dingell and Waxman, but many of her top allies worked behind the scenes for Waxman, and lawmakers on both sides of the fight noted that she did nothing to discourage him from the challenge. LiNeBrEaKAfter the vote, Pelosi issued a statement calling Dingell a "giant of the Congress" while also predicting that Waxman would make progress on issues like energy independence, health care and global warming. She said the caucus "will move forward from this vote with unity."LiNeBrEaKBitter raceLiNeBrEaKBut the race was bitter, and there are certain to be hard feelings, especially among Dingell supporters. Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a senior member of the committee, called Waxman's challenge "highly inappropriate." LiNeBrEaKCapitol Hill watchers said Waxman's election may represent a new high-water mark for California's power in the Congress, rivaling the power Texas enjoyed starting in the mid-1990s, when former Republican Reps. Dick Armey and Tom DeLay were top House leaders and the state held several key chairmanships.LiNeBrEaKBesides Pelosi's position as speaker - arguably the second-most powerful job in Washington - Californians chair four House committees: Education and Labor Miller; Foreign Affairs Rep. Howard Berman, D-Los Angeles; Veterans Affairs Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego and now Energy and Commerce Waxman. In addition to Boxer's committee post, Sen. Dianne Feinstein chairs the Senate Rules Committee and is a top Senate appropriator - and she is in line to possibly chair the Intelligence Committee.LiNeBrEaKTim Ransdell, executive director of the California Institute for Federal Policy Research, said the state's clout is probably higher now than earlier this decade, when California had six Republican committee chairs in the House: Appropriations Jerry Lewis of Redlands in San Bernardino County, Rules David Dreier of San Dimas in Los Angeles County, Ways and Means Bill Thomas of Bakersfield, Armed Services Duncan Hunter of Alpine in San Diego County, Education and Workforce Howard "Buck" McKeon of Santa Clarita in Los Angeles County and Resources Richard Pombo of Tracy. LiNeBrEaKWaxman had to give up his chairmanship of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the House's top investigative panel, where he'd led high-profile probes into steroids use in sports and contractor abuses in Iraq. But Ransdell said Waxman had picked the right time to shift committees.LiNeBrEaK"Oversight is a committee whose job is largely to be a thorn in the side of the administration," he said. "He spent several years trying to uncover bad things that happened in a Republican administration. Now he doesn't have the task of doing that in a friendly administration."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	Bloom and gloom - warning from plankton;  Warming Arctic seas alter plant's life cycle, imperil food chain 	David Perlman, Chronicle Science Editor  	Main News; Pg. A1  	711 words  	Vanishing Arctic sea ice brought on by climate change is causing the crucially important microscopic marine plants called phytoplankton to bloom explosively and die away as never before, a phenomenon that is likely to create havoc among migratory creatures that rely on the ocean for food, Stanford scientists have found. LiNeBrEaKA few organisms may benefit from this disruption of the Arctic's fragile ecology, but a variety of animals, from gray whales to seabirds, will suffer, said Stanford biological oceanographer Kevin R. Arrigo. LiNeBrEaK"It's all a question of timing." Arrigo said. "If migratory animals reach the Arctic and find the phytoplankton's gone, they'll have missed the boat."LiNeBrEaKPhytoplankton throughout the world's oceans is the crucial nutrient at the base of the food web on which all marine life depends; when it's plentiful, life thrives and when it's gone, marine life is impossible.LiNeBrEaKArrigo and his colleagues gathered 10 years of observations from six NASA satellites to study changes in the evidence of chlorophyll - a key to measuring the annual abundance and disappearance of phytoplankton blooms - at the surface of the oceans. The satellite network has also recorded the yearly appearance and disappearance of vast expanses of sea ice and the increasing areas of open ocean all around the Arctic, an indication of how climate change is taking hold in the northern reaches of the globe. LiNeBrEaKA report of their findings is to appear in the current issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters.LiNeBrEaKUnwelcome changesLiNeBrEaKThe annual deep freeze that has covered much of the northern seas with ice around the polar regions was once a regular event, but what has been normal for millennia in the High Arctic is no longer the case. As global climate change has warmed the world's oceans, warmer water has moved into the frigid Arctic, causing changes in the once-regular appearance and disappearance of sea ice over vast areas.LiNeBrEaKThe result is a shift in when explosive blooms of phytoplankton appear and disappear, Arrigo's team has found. LiNeBrEaK"It's a complex system," Arrigo said in an interview, "but as the changes in ice cover throw the timing of phytoplankton abundance off, then the birds and animals whose brains have long been programmed to migrate north at specific times of the year will have missed the boat if there's no nourishment for them when they get there."LiNeBrEaKEvery spring and summer, phytoplankton in the Arctic blooms richly in explosive pulses, nourished by nitrogen and phosphorous in the seawater, and when those chemicals are consumed, the blooms end, Arrigo said.LiNeBrEaKLower sea iceLiNeBrEaKThe summer of 2007 experienced "by far the lowest sea ice cover ever recorded," Arrigo and his colleagues said. The ice cover was an unprecedented 23 percent lower than the previous low recorded only two years earlier, according to a recent report from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. LiNeBrEaKAs a result of all that open water, "primary production" of phytoplankton in the open ocean of the Arctic reached a peak of more than 10 million tons last year, compared with only 700,000 tons in 2006, Arrigo found. LiNeBrEaKMost of the explosive increase in plant production was due to the longer growing season made possible by the increasing extent of ice-free open ocean - particularly in the shallower waters of the continental shelves that surround the entire north polar region. LiNeBrEaKBut plankton is short-lived, and when its chemical nutrients run out and the plants disappear, the marine life that depends on it is threatened.LiNeBrEaK "Continued reductions in Arctic sea ice and the associated increase in primary production of phytoplankton are almost certain to impact marine ecosystems ... and could precipitate profound ecological shifts," Arrigo wrote in his team's report.LiNeBrEaKSome fish and other creatures in the far north that serve as prey for animals higher in the food chain may benefit from increases in phytoplankton, but many migratory animals like gray whales and all the seabirds that shuttle to the Arctic at fixed times are bound to lose out if the timing of the phytoplankton cycle changes, Arrigo said.LiNeBrEaKHis colleagues in this report are Gert van Dijken, the project's technical expert, and Sudeshna Pabi, a geophysics graduate student at Stanford.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Who's in the running for Obama administration jobs?  	The Associated Press  	BREAKING; World  	834 words  	Posted: 11: 13 AM-LiNeBrEaKIt's Washington's favorite parlor game during a presidential transition: trying to figure out who'll land a top spot in the new administration. President-elect Barack Obama is weighing an array of Washington insiders and outsiders, including some Republicans, for Cabinet and other top positions, according to Democratic officials.LiNeBrEaKJust like the stock market, names rise and fall weekly, some zooming to the top, others dropping out of contention. Hillary Rodham Clinton suddenly is considered the top prospect for secretary of state, although other names remain in the mix. It looks like Eric Holder, former deputy attorney general, is on track to become attorney general. LiNeBrEaKSome of those who are the subject of speculation already have been chosen by Obama to serve as part of his transition team.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Western guvs talk energy, climate with Obama team  	By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune  	POLITICS; News; State  	649 words  	Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. , a Republican, and Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, personally delivered the West's energy-policy priorities Friday to the incoming administration.LiNeBrEaKIn a meeting with John Podesta, co-chairman of President-elect Barack Obama's transition team, the two governors told how Washington can help update the systems that deliver energy to Americans while reducing the pollution blamed for global climate change and greening the economy with clean-energy jobs.LiNeBrEaK"The transformation we are talking about is broad-based and will require new policies, incentives, market mechanisms and private-public partnerships to be in place by the end of next year," Huntsman said. "We plan to work with the new administration and Congress in addressing the multitude of energy challenges ahead." LiNeBrEaK"Western states are the country's energy breadbasket, but energy efficiency has also got to play a much bigger role," Schweitzer said. "That includes everything from manufacturing more fuel-efficient vehicles to changing regulatory structures so they reward utilities for achieving reduced energy usage among their customers."LiNeBrEaKHuntsman and Schweitzer were delivering the message on behalf of the Western Governors Association, a group composed of the chief executives of 19 states and three U.S.-flag islands in the Pacific. And their bipartisan effort comes at a time, two weeks after Americans voted to send to Washington a new team, that has highlighted the need for greater energy security, creating green jobs, promoting alternative energy and tackling climate change.LiNeBrEaKThis week, Obama praised the governors for their leadership and pledged his administration's help. It was a reversal from the soon-to-be-departing Bush administration, which snubbed efforts to deal with climate change.LiNeBrEaK"When I am president, any governor who's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House," Obama said in a video address to a meeting hosted by California Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.LiNeBrEaKAlso this week, Sen. Barbara Boxer promised to introduce cap-and-trade legislation in the Senate. And, in the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee replaced its longtime leader, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan congressman with a strong allegiance to the auto industry, with a strong advocate of dealing with climate change, Rep. Henry Waxman of California.LiNeBrEaKBack home in Utah, constituents had mixed reviews of Huntsman's involvement in the Western governors' energy initiative.LiNeBrEaKThe Utah Farm Bureau Federation, with 500 assembled for its annual conference in Layton, heard a presentation on how efforts to control greenhouse gasses by shutting down coal-fired power plants would have a "negligible" impact on reducing global warming while having a devastating impact on the state's economy.LiNeBrEaK"The governor is ahead of himself," said Randy Parker, the farm bureau's chief executive officer. "He is out of line."LiNeBrEaKBut Brigham Young University political science professor Byron Daynes was encouraged that the governors chose energy and the climate crisis as a high-priority item for the new president.LiNeBrEaK"It was as if they were waiting for the right time, the right president to come along" to seek support for their strategies, he said.LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.com High-priorityLiNeBrEaKWestern states provide the nation:LiNeBrEaK94% of onshore oil reservesLiNeBrEaK66% of coal reservesLiNeBrEaK91% wet natural gas onshoreLiNeBrEaK82% dry natural gas onshoreLiNeBrEaK100% installed solar thermal generationLiNeBrEaK100% installed geothermal generationLiNeBrEaK77% installed wind generationLiNeBrEaK82% installed, grid connected photovoltaic solar generation Governors urge quick actionLiNeBrEaK&raquo;They suggest seven priorities, including cutting greenhouse gasses, adopting a market approach, stepping up energy efficiency, reducing oil imports, encouraging energy research, aiding low-income consumers and promoting green jobs.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Guv carries climate message to White House  	By Thomas Burr The Salt Lake Tribune  	POLITICS; News; State  	495 words  	Washington &raquo; Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer meet this morning with President-elect Barack Obama's top transition leader to deliver a bipartisan energy proposal from Western governors. LiNeBrEaKThe plan, supported by 14 Western governors, includes what Huntsman labeled a "road map" for the new administration and includes a so-called cap-and-trade program, goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing renewable energies, and suggestions for weaning the country off foreign sources of oil.LiNeBrEaKHuntsman, a Republican and chairman of the Western Governors Association, is scheduled to meet in Washington with John Podesta, co-chairman of Obama's transition team, to present a four-page letter that the Utah governor said outlines principles that should be incorporated into national energy policy.LiNeBrEaK"It will serve as a useful tool," Huntsman said in an interview Thursday. "There's a lot of thinking going on about energy policy and what it will look like, how it will impact the states, how states will respond, for example, of initiatives coming out of Washington. And we hope that this is a helpful reminder that the West does feel passionate about energy."LiNeBrEaKHuntsman declined to share the plan publicly Thursday, but said one key component is a cap-and-trade program that would legislate mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions and provide for a trading system for companies polluting more than others. Discussions of such a system generally call for a permitting process that would give an incentive to companies to pollute less.LiNeBrEaKWhile such a program has hit resistance with some Republican factions, including Utah's Republican-majority Legislature, Huntsman says there will ultimately have to be a price put on carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaK"You have to value carbon if you're going to take climate issues seriously," Huntsman said. "That either supposes you're going to have a carbon tax or you're going to have a cap-and-trade program. It has to be one or the other."LiNeBrEaKAn Obama White House may be receptive to some of the ideas Huntsman and his fellow governors are pushing.LiNeBrEaKObama said in a message to the Bi-Partisan Governors Global Climate Summit in Los Angeles that governors have shown "true leadership in the fight to combat global warming" and that he supports a cap-and-trade program.LiNeBrEaK"Any change won't be easy and it won't come overnight," Obama said in the taped message. "I promise you this: any governor that wants to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House."LiNeBrEaKHuntsman, who will lead a delegation of governors to China in the spring to promote their proposals, said three things drove the WGA plan: affordability, energy independence and sustainability.LiNeBrEaKAnd he said that the proposal is unique in that it brings together governors of big and small states, of different political parties and with real, on-the-ground experience.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think anyone brings all these together as part of one plan," Huntsman said.LiNeBrEaKtburr@sltrib.com	ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (91%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); LEGISLATORS (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); US PRESIDENTS (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); INTERVIEWS (73%)  					BARACK OBAMA (95%); JON HUNTSMAN (94%); BRIAN SCHWEITZER (91%); MICHAEL MCMAHON (82%); JOHN PODESTA (57%)  	UTAH, USA (95%); WEST USA (94%); MONTANA, USA (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%); CHINA (79%)  	November 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  																
Seattle Times (Washington)  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	Washington State Academy of Sciences launched  	Sandi Doughton, Seattle Times  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	662 words  	Nov. 21--When the federal government needs the best scientific information on any subject, it turns to the National Academy of Sciences.LiNeBrEaKNow, the state of Washington will be able to do the same with a group of local luminaries.LiNeBrEaKThe Washington State Academy of Sciences inducts its founding class of 104 members today, signaling the group's readiness to weigh in on anything from the coastal impacts of rising sea levels to the Puget Sound region's infamous traffic snarls. LiNeBrEaK"We want to bring the best scientific talent to bear on issues of importance to the state of Washington," said retired University of Washington zoologist Gordon Orians, the group's president.LiNeBrEaKMore than 30 states have science academies, but nearly all are small organizations devoted mainly to science education, Orians said. "In this sense, we're pioneers."LiNeBrEaKThe Washington group is modeled after the National Academy of Sciences, established by President Lincoln in 1863 to "investigate, examine, experiment and report upon any subject of science or art." The organization has assessed the science of stem cells, genetic engineering, climate change and virtually every other major scientific controversy of modern times.LiNeBrEaK"An increasing number of public-policy questions require scientific input," UW computer scientist and founding board member Ed Lazowska said in an e-mail. "WSAS is a place for the governor and the legislature to turn for this advice when they need it."LiNeBrEaKNo specific subject has been picked for the state academy to evaluate, but many of the questions leaders are grappling with could benefit from sound scientific advice, Orians said. Those include where to locate wind farms, what global warming will mean for Washington, how to improve the health of Native Americans and the dangers posed by toxic pollutants.LiNeBrEaKEveryone in Washington who has been elected to one of three national academies -- science, engineering and medicine -- was invited to be a founding member. They include two Nobel laureates (Lee Hartwell of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Edmond Fischer of the UW), a former astronaut (Bonnie Dunbar, president of the Museum of Flight), a former pharmaceutical executive (Tachi Yamada, now leader of the Global Health Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), a rocket designer (George Mueller, of Rocketland Kistler Corp. in Kirkland), and an ex-head of the National Cancer Institute (Richard Klausner). More than half are from the UW.LiNeBrEaKCreated by the Legislature in 2005, the group will respond to requests from state agencies or other organizations to analyze scientific and technical issues, review existing data, and issue reports, said Guy Palmer, director of Washington State University's School for Global Animal Health and a member of the founding board. Reports will be peer-reviewed to ensure they are accurate and unbiased.LiNeBrEaK"This is not a group that makes policy," he said. "We want to make sure we get the best science into the hands of people who do make policy."LiNeBrEaKBut first, the organization needs a budget. Launched with $340,000 in state seed money, the goal is to become self-sustaining. Members will volunteer their time, but agencies will cover the administrative costs for each analysis. Orians estimates studies will cost at least $100,000 each.LiNeBrEaKWith the state facing a $5 billion budget shortfall, that could be a tough sell, agreed Dunbar, also a member of the founding board.LiNeBrEaK"But in the end," she said, "if you have good studies upfront, you will save money in the long run."LiNeBrEaKSandi Doughton: 206-464-2491LiNeBrEaKor sdoughton@seattletimes.com	SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (91%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); LEGISLATORS (89%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); BIOLOGY (78%); MATH and SCIENCE EDUCATION (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (74%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (73%); RESEARCH (72%); GENETIC ENGINEERING (66%); CANCER (66%); NOBEL PRIZES (62%); ONCOLOGY (61%); FOUNDATIONS (60%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (51%); WIND ENERGY (50%); COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS (50%)  		NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (91%); UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON (57%)  		General  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (56%)  	SEATTLE, WA, USA (92%) WASHINGTON, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	November 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Seattle Times   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	20081121-SE-Washington-State-Academy-of-Sciences-launched-1121  	SE  													
THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	INDICTMENTS  		EDITORIAL; Pg. B7  	1404 words  	NEWS ABOUT GONZALES, CHENEY SHOULD BE PAGE 1LiNeBrEaKI was discouraged to find out what priorities the Seattle P-I had in the Wednesday issue. Having read about the corruption and greed of the treasonous Bush regime for the past eight years (Vice President Dick Cheney being perhaps the worst of the bunch), I find the article about Cheney and former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales being indicted tucked under the continued front-page article about Theo Chocolate on Page A8. The indictments should have been given top priority on the front page in my opinion and in a much longer article that gave more information. I had to go on the Internet for that. Is it a wonder that newspapers are losing their subscriber base and their credibility?LiNeBrEaKMike HickeyLiNeBrEaKSeattle LiNeBrEaKSHOULD SMALL INVESTOR WORRY ABOUT INDICTMENT?LiNeBrEaKI saw a little blurb about Vice President Dick Cheney and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales being indicted and wondered what that was all about. It was buried in the back pages and didn't receive the coverage given to Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. Nonetheless, my curiosity was piqued and, going online, I find that Cheney is invested in Vanguard Group, which is affiliated with private prisons in Texas. I wonder whether those of us who have our meager funds with Vanguard have to worry about a similar indictment. Of course, Cheney and Gonzales used their influence to squash any investigations of corruption. The rest of us don't have any influence. We just give them our money and hope for the best - which has been disappointing of late. Perhaps I'm in the wrong fund. Investment in Texas prisons would have been a better choice but I didn't know which fund that was and wouldn't have been aware that it was a money-maker with big-time involvement. Investment in oil and KBR had the same type of involvement and I missed out on those, too.LiNeBrEaKA. F. HagenLiNeBrEaKSeattleLiNeBrEaK\ 'HAVE FAITH IN THE EARTH'LiNeBrEaKFUTURE OF SHARED PLANET IS EVERYONE'S BUSINESSLiNeBrEaKI'm writing in response to Rabbi Anson Laytner and the Rev. Michael Denton's guest column regarding global warming ("Have faith in the Earth," Wednesday). The future of our shared planet is everyone's business. Laytner and Denton mentioned writing to our elected officials to take action. Let's add to this that we let businesses know that we must have Earth-friendly products and processes. Good businesses do listen. And we can let elected officials know that we'll vote only for those who work to develop and carry out policy to address climate change.LiNeBrEaKEmily EastonLiNeBrEaKSeattleLiNeBrEaKINFRASTRUCTURELiNeBrEaKINTELLIGENCE PROVIDED BY THE NEW ADMINISTRATIONLiNeBrEaKRich Lowry's Wednesday column, probably unintentionally, makes good arguments for President-elect Barack Obama's plan to give some of the fiscal stimulus funds to "infrastructure rebuilding." Lowry notes that similar efforts in the past have failed because: (1) By the time the money is spent, the recession has passed, (2) "Generally, infrastructure projects cannot be undertaken quickly enough for timely stimulus," (3) "... did not involve substantial amounts of money," (4) They "paved anything that stood still ... spending went to wasteful projects." Lowry summarizes: If the investment in infrastructure isn't applied intelligently, it will fund only pork-barreling members of Congress.LiNeBrEaKThe key words for success: money, intelligence, prompt. The Obama administration can provide the intelligence.LiNeBrEaKJack BallardLiNeBrEaKPort LudlowLiNeBrEaKWARLiNeBrEaKLET ELECTED OFFICIALS KNOW THE KILLINGS HAVE TO STOPLiNeBrEaKOver the weekend, two more members of the U.S. military were killed while serving in Iraq. There have now been 4,201 killed in Iraq. And there will be more to die in wars I don't want waged in my name. On Monday evening, I stood on a busy street corner in Lake Forest Park along with 12 of my fellow peace activists. We stood with candles and signs while honoring another fallen soldier. We mark the deaths of our troops as we roll over to another hundred dead. We also have stood vigil every Saturday since four months before the start of "shock and awe." And we will continue to stand.LiNeBrEaKWe need your help. Let your representatives and President-elect Barack Obama know in no uncertain terms that you voted for them to stop the madness that is known as the war on terrorism.LiNeBrEaKGabrielle LavalleLiNeBrEaKLynnwoodLiNeBrEaK\ STATE FINANCESLiNeBrEaKADDING GOVERNMENT JOBS WILL COST TAXPAYERS TOO MUCHLiNeBrEaKThe real story behind the rising jobless rate is the thousands of Washington families that will be suffering as the holidays approach. Our state will be facing an ever-increasing budget shortfall, which now is said to be $5 billion. It is disheartening to see that during these unprecedented times, the government has added 6,000 more jobs. Government should be shedding jobs just like the private sector is. These additional government employees are a burden placed squarely on the backs of hard-working Washington families and represent a total lack of government leadership.LiNeBrEaKGordon TaggeLiNeBrEaKChelanLiNeBrEaK\ EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACTLiNeBrEaKEFCA LEVELS PLAYING FIELD FOR WORKERSLiNeBrEaKBased on his letter in Tuesday's P-I, I can only surmise that Brett Gaspers hasn't in fact read the text of the Employee Free Choice Act. If he had taken the time to read the legislation he would know that EFCA does not "take away an employee's right to a secret ballot in electing whether to start a union at his or her workplace." Under EFCA, if one-third of workers prefer to have a secret ballot election at their workplace, they are free to ask the federal government to hold an election. EFCA merely gives workers the additional choice of unionizing via majority sign-up. According to the AFL-CIO, secret ballot NLRB elections may sound egalitarian, but in reality they are skewed heavily in the employer's favor because "the employer controls the voters' paychecks and livelihood, has unlimited access to speak against the union in the workplace while restricting pro-union speech and has the freedom to intimidate and coerce the voters." Under the proposed legislation, if a majority of workers sign cards indicating they want to form a union, the will of that majority will be honored and the employer will be legally required to recognize and bargain with the union rather than dragging their heels in a long, drawn-out, management-controlled election process. As previously stated, however, if at least a third of the work force wants to hold an election instead, they may do so.LiNeBrEaKThe Employee Free Choice Act is about leveling the playing field for workers, not restricting their rights.LiNeBrEaKJeff V. ManzolliLiNeBrEaKRedmondLiNeBrEaK\ COLUMBIA BASINLiNeBrEaKHYDROELECTRIC DAMS MEAN COAL-FIRED PLANTS NOT NEEDEDLiNeBrEaKNorthwest scientists are now testing carbon sequestration by attempting to inject and trap it underground in the thick basalt deposits beneath the Columbia Basin. Those scientists suggest that the research is especially important for the sequestration of the carbon dioxide emitted from large-scale coal-fired power plants. There is little or no need for this type of carbon sequestration research in the Columbia Basin because the many productive hydroelectric dams on Columbia Basin rivers have eliminated the need for ever constructing large-scale coal-fired power plants in that region.LiNeBrEaKKen SchlichteLiNeBrEaKTumwaterLiNeBrEaK\ GAY RIGHTSLiNeBrEaKREPUBLICANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION 8LiNeBrEaKIn S. Joel Hastings' Nov. 12 guest column ("Gays and lesbians get left behind"), he twists the facts to suggest that Republicans aren't responsible for the passage of Proposition 8 in California. Although it's true that is was black Californians who voted primarily for Barack Obama who tipped the scales in favor of Proposition 8, one shouldn't deduce that "the true lesson of this election is that party labels do not predict one's personal beliefs on marriage and marriage equality," as Hastings wrote.LiNeBrEaKTo the contrary, it was the anti-choice, anti-gay, religious Republican right wing that financed the scandalous - and effective - media campaign that misled voters. Regarding the 70 percent of blacks voting primarily in favor of Prop. 8, it had much more to do with the anti-gay intolerance and bigotry promoted in their churches than their political affiliations.LiNeBrEaKSorry, Joel, but no matter how you parse out the vote on Prop. 8, the blame still falls on the Republicans who financed the pro-Prop. 8 victory. Although I applaud Hastings' efforts to promote tolerance and marriage equality within the Republican Party, he is still consorting with the enemy.LiNeBrEaKRobb MillerLiNeBrEaKSeattle	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (89%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (76%); INTERNET and WWW (74%); MUTUAL FUNDS (73%); PRISONS (66%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%); INDICTMENTS (92%)  	VANGUARD GROUP INC (55%)  				DICK CHENEY (93%); ALBERTO GONZALES (92%); TED STEVENS (55%); BARACK OBAMA (50%)  	WASHINGTON, USA (94%); TEXAS, USA (92%); EARTH (90%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	November 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Newspaper  	2008 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   							LETTER  			LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

The city's transit authority, which is also considering cutting service in an effort to save money, says it needs to raise rates by 23 percent to keep operating deficits under control. The service cuts would not eliminate service in any areas, but could create longer waits and more crowded buses and trains. A final decision will be made after a series of public hearings.

Henry Waxman, a California Democrat and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ousted Rep. John Dingell on Thursday as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, giving a lift to President-elect Barack Obama's plans to tackle climate change and promote alternative energy. Waxman, who won 137-122 in a secret ballot, told Democrats he was best-suited to deliver on Obama's agenda. "We needed a change in order to get important issues passed," he said after the vote. "This is an opportunity that maybe comes only once in a generation." An advocate of government regulation and known for his high-profile hearings as chairman of the House oversight committee, Waxman has tangled for decades over health and environmental issues with Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who ardently defends his state's automobile industry. While he has helped pass many landmark health and consumer bills, Dingell, first elected in 1955, has opposed attempts for years to require stricter mileage requirements for cars and trucks. He also worked against tougher pollution rules. Both men addressed colleagues before the vote in the ornate Cannon House Office Building caucus room. "It was like Zeus and Thor in there throwing lightning bolts," said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., a Waxman ally.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   Final Edition	Study says Mexican emigration down 42 percent in two years  	Wire Reports  	News; Pg. A6  	732 words  	MEXICO CITY Mexican emigration has dropped 42 percent over the last two years, a government study released Thursday showed, confirming that America has become less appealing amid an economic downturn and stepped up raids against illegal migrants. About eight of every 1,000 Mexicans emigrated between February and May of this year, according to the survey conducted by the National Statistics and Geography Institute. That's a 42 percent drop from the same period in 2006. In all of 2007, an estimated 814,000 Mexicans emigrated, compared to 1. 2 million in 2006. The figure which was reached through household surveys includes all Mexicans who left the country, and did not break down legal and illegal migration. A summary of the investigation did not delve into the reasons for the drop.  LiNeBrEaKBut experts say America's economic troubles and tighter border security have deterred many Mexicans from risking the journey to the United States, a trip that often means long desert treks, dodging bandits and bribing corrupt police. European Union announces interest in Arctic region's riches BRUSSELS, Belgium The European Union's executive body said Thursday that the bloc should try to obtain its fair share of oil, gas, minerals and fish exposed by the melting of the Arctic ice cap. The move is likely to irk Russia, Canada, the United States and Norway, which are issuing new territorial claims in the polar region. The European Commission said the 27-nation union, which has three member states in the polar region Denmark, Finland and Sweden should particularly get involved in offshore oil and gas exploitation. Denmark controls the semiautonomous territory of Greenland. The melting of polar ice due to global warming is opening new shipping lanes and exposing valuable natural resources. Colombian police use tear gas on pyramid scheme supporters BOGOTA, Colombia Police tear-gassed protesters Thursday as a crackdown on illegal investment schemes exposed class divisions in Colombian society. Rather than see President Alvaro Uribe as their savior, many investors were taking the other side. Thousands of angry investors gathered in the capital to protest the shutdown of DMG, Colombia's largest pyramid scheme, on suspicion of laundering drug money. Several hundred were tear-gassed as they blocked a main street in support of DMG founder David Murcia, who was deported from Panama on Thursday on money laundering and bribery charges. Six other DMG officials face similar charges. Uribe suggested that the pyramid schemes not only launder the profits of drug trafficking they also have links to leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries. Several thousand DMG investors gathered Thursday outside a soccer stadium in Bogota to register for a government plan to repay investors what little it can of their money using cash seized in the company's offices. Murcia's company raked in tens of millions of dollars annually by offering extraordinary interest rates, as high as 300 percent returns over six months, to some 200,000 investors. DMG had a system of prepaid credit cards that enabled many investors to double their investments many times over before police closed 59 DMG offices across Colombia this week. Researchers shed light on final resting place of Copernicus WARSAW, Poland Researchers said Thursday they have identified the remains of Nicolaus Copernicus by comparing DNA from a skeleton to hair retrieved from one of the 16th-century astronomer's books. The findings could put an end to centuries of speculation about the exact resting spot of Copernicus, a priest and astronomer whose theories identified the Sun, not the Earth, as the center of the universe. Polish archaeologist Jerzy Gassowski told a news conference that forensic facial reconstruction of the skull, missing the lower jaw, his team found in 2005 buried in a Roman Catholic Cathedral in Frombork, Poland, bears striking resemblance to existing portraits of Copernicus. The reconstruction shows a broken nose and other features that resemble a self-portrait of Copernicus, and the skull bears a cut mark above the left eye that corresponds with a scar shown in the painting. Copernicus was known to have been buried in the 14th-century Frombork Cathedral where he served as a canon, but his grave was not marked. The bones found by Gassowski were located under floor tiles near one of the side altars.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	November 21, 2008 Friday   Final Edition	Lawmaker pushes tax credit for geothermal pumps  	MICK HINTON World Capitol Bureau  	News; Pg. A16  	381 words  	OKLAHOMA CITY Rubbing his hands to warm up in the blustery weather Thursday, House Speaker Chris Benge urged a 5 percent tax credit for homeowners and businesses that install geothermal heating pumps. The Tulsa Republican made his proposal in front of a Habitat for Humanity-built home that features a geothermal unit. Vowing that he didn't stage the event to occur in the cold, Benge said the weather was appropriate for the topic nevertheless.  LiNeBrEaKThe home's owner, Kim Willison, said she had seen her utility bills cut by more than half. The single mother of two said she is trying to help support her daughter, who is in college, and hopes to be able to send her son, who is 15, to college, too. Dan Ellis, president of ClimateMaster, an Oklahoma City marketer of the heat pumps, said a 5 percent state tax credit coupled with a new federal tax credit for geothermal unit installation could make it feasible for businesses and homeowners to install them. Ellis said that in Oklahoma, the temperature of the Earth at a depth of 10 feet is 62 degrees. If that warmth was piped into a home or business, a structure would need only a small amount of energy from a conventional heating source to reach an ideal temperature of 72 degrees. "In the summertime, we take the heat you want to get rid of. Instead of trying to push it into the outdoor air, which may be 100 degrees, it is a lot easier to make the heat flow downhill, so to speak," Ellis said. Benge said that although gasoline prices have dropped dramatically over the past few months, Oklahoma and the U.S. need to move forward with an energy plan. "History tells us that whenever gasoline prices drop, the OPEC nations begin to capture more of the market globally," he said. When prices go up again, the U.S. will be too dependent on the Mideast unless alternative energy sources have been found at home, he said. Jeff Vanhoose, a commercial general contractor, said the downside of geothermal units is that they cost 50 percent more to install. Vanhoose estimated that the federal tax credit would mean that in five to seven years, a company could recoup the cost of installing a thermal unit. With an additional 5 percent from the state, the project would become more feasible.

USA TODAY 	November 21, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Waxman wins powerful energy post;  Unseats Dingell by 'lightning bolts' 	Ken Dilanian  	NEWS; Pg. 5A  	685 words  	WASHINGTON -- Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat and ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, ousted Rep. John Dingell on Thursday as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, giving a lift to President-elect Barack Obama's plans to tackle climate change and promote alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKWaxman, who won 137-122 in a secret ballot, told Democrats he was best suited to deliver on Obama's agenda. "We needed a change in order to get important issues passed," he said after the vote. "This is an opportunity that maybe comes only once in a generation." LiNeBrEaKAn advocate of government regulation and known for his high-profile hearings as chairman of the House oversight committee, Waxman has tangled for decades over health and environmental issues with Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who ardently defends his state's automobile industry.LiNeBrEaKWhile he has helped pass many landmark health and consumer bills, Dingell, first elected in 1955, has opposed attempts for years to require stricter mileage requirements for cars and trucks. He also worked against tougher pollution rules.LiNeBrEaKBoth men addressed colleagues before the vote in the ornate Cannon House Office Building caucus room. "It was like Zeus and Thor in there throwing lightning bolts," said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., a Waxman ally.LiNeBrEaKWaxman, 69, elected during the Watergate class of 1974, saluted Dingell's service as he spoke to waiting reporters afterward. Dingell, 82, left without comment.LiNeBrEaKDingell later released a statement congratulating Waxman that began, "Well, this was clearly a change year."LiNeBrEaKMiller and Virginia's Jim Moran, another Waxman backer, said freshmen elected in 2006 and newcomers elected this month were decisive in handing Waxman a narrow victory.LiNeBrEaKDingell also was hurt by the automakers being on the Hill this week seeking a bailout, Moran said.LiNeBrEaK"I think it was the phenomenon of Obama's message that you've got to change the way we do business in Washington," Miller said. "If you're going to move forward, you've got to get rid of some of the impediments."LiNeBrEaKNeither Pelosi nor Obama took a public position on the battle, but both hew closer to Waxman's views on environmental and energy policy than Dingell's. Pelosi has clashed with Dingell in the past -- including in the current Congress when she bypassed his committee to craft a Democratic plan to address global warming. Obama this week tapped Waxman's longtime chief of staff, Phil Schiliro, to be the White House congressional liaison.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's victory bypasses the decades-old seniority system among House Democrats. Seniority "should not be a grant of property rights to be chairman for three decades," Waxman said after the vote.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, a Dingell ally, countered: "The concept of seniority has been buried today." Waxman went public with his campaign to unseat Dingell just after the election, but waged it mostly in private. Dingell announced a whip team that held regular conference calls with members of the news media, and Dingell used a radio interview to call Waxman "an anti-manufacturing left-wing Democrat."LiNeBrEaKAccording to a text released by his office, Waxman told Democrats, "I opposed John when he tried to double the amount of pollution from cars and I won. John blocked me in 1992 from passing a global-warming bill, and he's opposed climate-change bills for the last 16 years."LiNeBrEaKEven for Waxman supporters, it wasn't easy to vote against an iconic figure like Dingell, Moran said, knowing how hurt he would be by losing.LiNeBrEaK"For the Democratic caucus to reject him like that," Moran said, "that was a tough, poignant moment."

USA TODAY 	November 21, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	BCS isn't game for executive privilege  	Michael Hiestand  	SPORTS; Pg. 3C  	396 words  	TV sportsLiNeBrEaKUsually how sports are organized and scheduled is entwined with their TV contracts.LiNeBrEaKBut just because the Bowl Championship Series this week inked a lucrative new TV deal to put four of its five games on cable ESPN -- with the fifth, the Rose Bowl, also possibly heading to ESPN -- don't assume this opens any new possibility that college football will join the sports world and settle its championship with a playoff. LiNeBrEaKBCS officials have been straightforward since last spring that their sport, like figure skating, will continue to crown its champions with a system that involves subjective scoring. And despite recent pleas for a playoff from President-elect Barack Obama, BCS officials say the sport won't have any sort of playoff at least through the ESPN TV deal -- which lasts through the BCS games played in 2014.LiNeBrEaKDon't blame the president-elect, who was courageous to even suggest U.S. presidential power could overturn a system that is immune to the powers of fans and even TV networks. Perhaps when the new administration settles in -- and somehow, say, gets NATO, the Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the U.N. to join some sort of anti-BCS coalition -- the First Fan could take another run at the issue. USC coach Pete Carroll, on Fox Sports Radio Thursday, sounded like he still had hopes in executive privilege: "Everybody in the country would want (a playoff). ... Maybe the U.S. President has enough power to pull this thing together somehow."LiNeBrEaKIt probably wouldn't be much harder than ending global warming.LiNeBrEaKP.S. In an otherwise conventional discussion of college football head coaching opportunities for African-Americans on last Saturday's ESPN GameDay, Chris Fowler had an odd take. In noting that coaching hires can involve boosters, Fowler noted that "among those behind-the-scenes financial backers of big universities, there may not be, you know, that many people who voted for Obama." Huh? Let's hope "voting for Obama" -- or, for that matter, not voting for Obama -- doesn't become some kind of weird cultural shorthand for accusing somebody of prejudice.LiNeBrEaKSays ESPN's Josh Krulewitz: "The political reference was an unnecessary addition to the valid point he was making about the lack of diversity in college football coaching."LiNeBrEaKSaid Fowler on Thursday: "It was a mistake to say that line. And it distracted from discussion, because it was too vague."

Waxman has complained that the committee has been too slow to address environmental issues such as global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The argument we made was that we needed a change for the committee to have the leadership that will work with this administration and members in both the House and the Senate in order to get important issues passed in health care, environmental protection, in energy policy," Waxman said after the vote.LiNeBrEaKSaid Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., who spoke on Waxman's behalf in the closed-door caucus: "The next two years are critical . It's not personal. It's about the American people demanding that we embrace change and work with the president on critical issues of climate change and energy and health care."LiNeBrEaKWaxman, 69, is an accomplished legislator. He chaired the Energy and Commerce health and environment subcommittee for 16 years and won a series of piecemeal expansions of the Medicaid health care program for the poor that added many children to the program. He's also taken on tobacco companies.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy and Commerce panel is one of the most important House committees, with sweeping jurisdiction over energy, the environment, consumer protection, telecommunications and health care programs such as Medicaid .LiNeBrEaKWaxman has been the top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for the past 12 years. Since Waxman became chairman of that panel two years ago, it has taken the Bush administration to task over global warming and allegations that it muzzled government scientists. It also has investigated the White House's political operation, the use of steroids in sports and abuses behind the financial collapse.LiNeBrEaKDingell, 82, is an ally of automakers and electric utilities. He's considered one of the House's premier legislators, with a lengthy track record on health, consumer issues and the environment .LiNeBrEaKDingell's defenders said he had done nothing to deserve being dumped, pointing to the panel's busy workload over the past two years, including successfully enacting an energy bill that raised automobile fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020.LiNeBrEaK"I think it was highly inappropriate," said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va. "There was no obvious reason for it other than the desire for another person to chair the committee."LiNeBrEaKvoted inLiNeBrEaKRep. Henry Waxman is a veteran lawmaker with a history of focusing on health care and environmental issues. voted outLiNeBrEaKRep.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	November 21, 2008 Friday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Al-Qaida's appeal waning, new U.S. study concludes  	SCOTT SHANE  	FRONT; Pg. A6  	486 words  	By Scott ShaneLiNeBrEaKThe New York TimesLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKA new study of the global future by American intelligence agencies suggests that al-Qaida could soon be on the decline, having alienated Muslim supporters with indiscriminate killing and inattention to the practical problems of poverty, unemployment and education. LiNeBrEaKWhile not contradicting intelligence assessments suggesting that al-Qaida remains a major threat with a strong presence in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the report says that the group "may decay sooner" than many experts have assumed because of severe weaknesses: "unachievable strategic objectives, inability to attract broad-based support and self-destructive actions."LiNeBrEaK"The appeal of terrorism is waning," said Mathew Burrows, head of long-range analysis in the office of the director of national intelligence and a lead author of "Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World." Burrows said polls and anecdotal evidence strongly suggested disillusionment among Muslims with al-Qaida and its methods and goals since the 2001 terrorist attacks.LiNeBrEaKThe predicted decline of al-Qaida is one of the few bright spots in the generally gloomy report, which describes a decline in the United States' world dominance as China, India and other powers assert themselves.LiNeBrEaK"Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful actor, the United States' relative strength - even in the military realm - will decline and U.S. leverage will become more constrained," the report said.LiNeBrEaKBy 2025, it predicted, "the U.S. will find itself as one of a number of important actors on the world stage," playing "a prominent role in global events" but not a decisive one as in the past.LiNeBrEaKThe report said the global shift from West to East in terms of wealth and economic power "is without precedent in modern history." Of a projected population increase of 1. 2 billion worldwide by 2025, only 3 percent will take place in Western countries, it said.LiNeBrEaK"The unipolar moment is over, or certainly will be over by 2025," C. Thomas Fingar, chairman of the National Intelligence Council and the government's top intelligence analyst, said Thursday at a briefing on the report.LiNeBrEaKThe previous report in the Global Trends series, completed in 2004, anticipated continued American dominance through 2020, though it recognized that the emergence of China and India as powers would transform the geopolitical landscape.LiNeBrEaKThe new report describes a world riven by increased conflict over scarce food and water supplies and threatened by rogue states and terrorists, widening gaps between rich and poor and an uneven impact of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe report said Russia's emergence as a world power was "clouded" by persistent corruption and lagging investment in its critical energy industry.LiNeBrEaKAmerican powerLiNeBrEaKThe United States will remain a world power but its dominance will decline by 2025 as China, India and other nations rise, the intelligence study says.

The Washington Times 	November 21, 2008 Friday 	The killer frost for global warming  	By Wesley Pruden, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; PRUDEN ON POLITICS; A04  	757 words  	Turn up the heat, somebody. The globe is freezing. Even Al Gore is looking for an extra blanket. Winter has barely come to the northern latitudes and already we've got bigger goosebumps than usual. So far the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports 63 record snowfalls in the United States, 115 lowest-ever temperatures for the month. Only 44 Octobers over the past 114 years have been cooler than this last one.LiNeBrEaKThe polar ice is accumulating faster than usual, and some of the experts now concede that the globe hasn't warmed since 1995. You may have noticed, in fact, that Al and his pals, having given up on the sun, no longer even warn of global warming. Now it's "climate change." The marketing men enlisted by Al and the doom criers to come up with a flexible "brand" took a cue from the country philosopher who observed, correctly, that "if you've got one foot in the fire and the other in a bucket of ice, on average you're warm." On average, "climate change" covers every possibility. LiNeBrEaKThis is similar to the science practiced by Dr. James Hansen at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the source of much of the voodoo that Al Gore has been peddling since the doctor showed up at a Senate hearing in 1988 and told ghost stories that Al swallowed whole. Only last month Dr. Hansen's institute announced that October was the hottest on record, and then said "uh, never mind." The London Daily Telegraph calls this "a surreal blunder [that] raised a huge question mark about the temperature records that underpin the worldwide alarm over global warming."LiNeBrEaKIn this account, the institute had to make the humiliating climb-down after two leading skeptics of the global-warming scam, Anthony Watts, an American meteorologist, and Steve McIntyre, a Canadian computer analyst, discovered that temperature readings from September had been carried over and repeated for October.LiNeBrEaKWe should sigh, shrug and give the scientists at NASA the benefit of the doubt that this was a mistake and not a deliberate howl at the moon. A spokesman for the institute explains that readings borrowed from Russia, which had been described as 10 degrees higher than normal for October, distorted the figures but, after all, the data had been obtained from others. So we should blame someone else.LiNeBrEaKThis is the science we're expected to take on faith. The false figures - we must be generous and not say "faked" - were supplied by the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change. These are the most widely quoted readings, and consistently show higher temperatures than other "data sets." Would the United Nations lie? (No giggling, please.)LiNeBrEaKThis sets a new standard for hubris, arrogance and haughty self-importance. Skeptics of the global-warming scam, even those with unquestioned academic and real-world credentials, are treated as ignorant pariahs by pundits, presidential candidates and other politicians who know better, or ought to.LiNeBrEaKThis is not the first time, writes Christopher Booker in the Daily Telegraph, that Dr. Hansen's methodology has been sharply questioned. Two years ago, Messrs. Watts and McIntyre, the bloggers who caught the October fiasco, forced him to withdraw his published findings on surface temperatures in the United States, to correct his claim that the hottest decade of the 20th century was the 1990s. It was the 1930s, when the much-maligned sport utility vehicle was still a truck and Detroit made economical cars everybody wanted.LiNeBrEaKMan's notion that his science can realign the stars, adjust the orbit of planets and reorganize the universe leads him to say silly things and assert goofy claims. Saying silly things and asserting goofy claims is usually harmless as entertainment, so long as the claims are subjected to rigorous analysis and debate. But contrarian arguments about global warming, climate change and freezing heat are not tolerated by the scientists with an uneasy grip on the research money.LiNeBrEaKIt's clear now that the earth has been cooling for the past decade, to the sorrow of the special pleaders and despite everything Al can do about it. The solar cycle peaked, the sun is quieter, the sunspots have faded and everybody but Al is cooling off.LiNeBrEaKEven the United Nations says so. The director of the U.N.'s panel on climate change concedes that nature has overwhelmed everything man can do and it might even be another decade before man can rally and the warming resumes. Until then, like it or not, nature rules the cosmos.LiNeBrEaK* Wesley Pruden is editor emeritus of The Washington Times.

The Washington Post 	November 21, 2008 Friday   Met 2 Edition	Rep. Dingell Loses Energy Post;  Waxman to Head Key Panel; Change Is Blow to Automakers 	Paul Kane; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	1079 words  	If beleaguered U.S. automakers did not have enough problems, Michigan Rep. John D. Dingell, their greatest congressional champion, was dethroned yesterday as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee by Rep. Henry A. Waxman of California, an advocate of stiff measures against global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe race pitted young Democrats against old, environmentalists against union backers and coastal liberals against Midwestern moderates in an early test of where the power in the 111th Congress will lie. Waxman's 137 to 122 victory demonstrated that the older, more industrial Democratic coalition is on its way to becoming a minority inside a new majority, a reality Dingell acknowledged after the vote.LiNeBrEaK"Well, this was clearly a change year, and I congratulate my colleague Henry Waxman on his success today," Dingell said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKWaxman's victory also signaled the rise of a younger, more environmentally conscious party eager to support the policies of President-elect Barack Obama. Waxman's supporters said his win probably would mean a smoother ride through Congress for Obama's energy agenda, which focuses on spending $150 billion on research for producing renewable fuels and 1 million new plug-in hybrid cars. LiNeBrEaK"It's the mantra of the Obama election. People want change," said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), who had rallied support for Waxman since he announced his bid the day after Obama's victory. "He'll work best with the new administration."LiNeBrEaKDingell, 82, who was first elected to represent his Dearborn-based district in 1954, is set to become the longest-serving House member in history in February. He has been chairman or ranking Democrat of the energy committee since 1981, at times feuding with fellow Democrats, including Waxman, over efforts to impose fuel-efficiency standards on cars.LiNeBrEaKWaxman, 69, was elected to represent Beverly Hills in the post-Watergate class of 1974 and is the current chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He gained the support of as many as two-thirds of Democrats elected in the past two years, according to some of his allies, and had the backing of the nearly three dozen California Democrats, as well as key lawmakers in East Coast delegations.LiNeBrEaKIn a two-hour closed-door meeting, junior members did not hesitate to take on Dingell, according to sources in the room. Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), who was elected in 2006 and was born in 1957, Dingell's third year in office, accused Dingell of burying key pieces of environmental legislation.LiNeBrEaK"The success of the next president is connected to this Congress," Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) told his colleagues, urging a vote for Waxman, according to a participant in the meeting. Cummings, 57, is considering challenging 74-year-old Rep. Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.) to replace Waxman as the oversight committee chairman.LiNeBrEaKDingell's support came mostly from the "Old Bulls" -- more than a dozen committee chairmen; Rust Belt Democrats, whose supporters are manufacturing-union members; and the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members support a seniority system that was weakened by Waxman's victory.LiNeBrEaK"It's just been buried," Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), the 78-year-old chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said of the seniority system.LiNeBrEaK"Seniority is important, but it should not be a grant of property rights to be chairman for three decades or more," Waxman told reporters after the vote.LiNeBrEaKSome moderate to conservative Democrats viewed the vote as a rebuke by the caucus's liberal wing. "I cannot believe we did what we just did," said Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (S.D.), incoming chairman of the "Blue Dog" caucus of fiscally conservative Democrats.LiNeBrEaKDespite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's public neutrality, Rangel accused her of tacitly supporting Waxman because her closest allies in the House ran his campaign and she did not intervene to stop his bid.LiNeBrEaK"Not playing a role is playing a role," Rangel said, suggesting that reporters were "crazy" if they doubted that Pelosi worked behind the scenes for Waxman.LiNeBrEaKDingell's defeat was the latest blow to elder statesmen on Capitol Hill. Earlier this month, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), who turned 91 yesterday and is the longest-serving senator in history, stepped down under pressure as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, citing Obama's election as the proper time to yield his power.LiNeBrEaK"It just signals the change, the sea change that we're facing. And it's a good sea change. It's momentous," Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate's environment committee, said upon the news of Waxman's victory.LiNeBrEaKDingell has worked on some environmental legislation, helping pass the Clean Air Act of 1990 and the raising of fuel-efficiency standards on the auto industry last year. But he has resisted previous efforts to raise fuel-efficiency standards, and environmentalists view him as an impediment to progress.LiNeBrEaKPelosi circumvented Dingell last year in creating a temporary global warming committee chaired by Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a close ally.LiNeBrEaKYounger Democrats saw those intra-party fights about environmental policy as a thing of the past. "This had a lot more to do with where the caucus is going in terms of public policy," said Rep. Jackie Speier (Calif.), elected earlier this year to replace the late Tom Lantos.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans said Democrats veered sharply to the left with Waxman. "This decision sends a troubling signal from a Majority that has promised to govern from the center. They moved away from Chairman Dingell because he is committed to approaching energy and environmental issues in a manner that protects American jobs," House Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKPelosi vowed that "House Democrats will move forward from this vote with unity." But bitter feelings lingered among Dingell supporters. At a Democratic meeting a few hours after the Waxman vote, Rep. Bart Stupak (Mich.), one of Dingell's closest friends, accused Waxman supporters of shutting Dingell allies out of an advisory committee that on Wednesday recommended that the full caucus approve Waxman as chairman.LiNeBrEaKThe vote may cause other senior lawmakers to begin grappling with their own political mortality.

The Washington Post 	November 21, 2008 Friday  Correction Appended  	New Rule Would Discount Warming as Risk Factor for Species  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A03  	507 words  	Regional EditionLiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration is finalizing changes to the Endangered Species Act that would ensure that federal agencies would not have to take global warming into account when assessing risks to imperiled plants and animals. LiNeBrEaKThe proposed rule changes, which were obtained by The Washington Post, are under review by the Office of Management and Budget and are close to being published in the Federal Register.LiNeBrEaKThe main purpose of the new regulations, which were first unveiled in August, is to eliminate a long-standing provision of the Endangered Species Act that requires an independent scientific review by either the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of any federal project that could affect a protected species. Under the administration's proposal, individual agencies could decide on their own whether a project would harm an imperiled species.LiNeBrEaKThe latest version of the rule goes further than the language Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne issued in August by explicitly excluding climate change from the factors that would trigger an interagency consultation. The move is significant because the administration has listed polar bears as a threatened species under the act on the grounds that their sea-ice habitat is shrinking, but Kempthorne has repeatedly argued that this move should not trigger a federal curb on greenhouse gas emissions linked to the melting of sea ice.LiNeBrEaKThe rule states: "Federal agencies are not required to consult on an action when . . . the effects of such action are manifested only through global processes and (i) cannot be reliably predicted or measured at the local scale, or (ii) would result at most in an extremely small, insignificant local impact, or (iii) are such that the potential risk of harm to species or habitat are remote."LiNeBrEaKJohn Kostyak, director of wildlife conservation and global warming at the National Wildlife Federation, said not only would the rule block federal officials from considering a carbon cap to help preserve the polar bear's habitat, "you have to question whether this is going to stop us from looking at the loss of snowpack and its impact on salmon."LiNeBrEaKThe interagency consultations matter, Kostyak argued, because they sometimes avert federal projects that might have a devastating effect on vulnerable species, as in the case of a limestone mine that was blocked in 2004 because it would have harmed the Florida panther's habitat.LiNeBrEaK"The agencies that are pushing these projects through are inherently biased, because they want to get these projects through at a minimal cost and they don't like delays associated with endangered species," he said.LiNeBrEaKInterior Department spokeswoman Tina Kreisher said the administration is close to issuing a final rule but is still reviewing the language for potential changes. Interior has classified the proposal as "a minor rule," which means the government has determined that it would not have a major economic impact. It will take effect 30 days after being published in the Federal Register.

The Wisconsin State Journal  	November 21, 2008 Friday 	10 percent of MGE customers buy green energy  	Ken Singletary, The Wisconsin State Journal  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	455 words  	Nov. 21--About nine years ago, Madison Gas and Electric began offering wind-generated power to its customers, recognizing that there could be considerable demand among Madison-area residents for such renewable energy. LiNeBrEaKThat turned out to be the case, and next year renewable energy is estimated to be about 12 percent of the utility's output.LiNeBrEaKCustomers sign up for the renewable energy and pay a premium for it, but the higher cost doesn't appear to deter them; of all investor-owned utilities in the country, MGE says it has the highest percentage of customers -- about 10 percent -- who buy green energy.LiNeBrEaKAnd Madison-area customers haven't stopped there. According to MGE, its customers also want to track their carbon emissions from electricity, natural gas and vehicle fuels, thought to be components in global warming. The utility unveiled an innovative Web site Thursday that allows people to do just that.LiNeBrEaKThe custom-made site is "what we think is one of the first tools in the country to allow people to register to take a look at their carbon footprint," said Steve Kraus, an MGE spokesman.LiNeBrEaKThe free site calculates carbon use based on electricity and natural gas information the utility has on its customers, who supplement that information with the type of vehicle and the miles they drive, and how often they fly. People who aren't MGE customers also can use the site by inputting their utility usage.LiNeBrEaKSite visitors will be able to track their carbon emissions and participate in discussion groups, giving the site a social-networking component in which people can trade information and support. The site also will profile eight to 10 local customers as they track and try to reduce their carbon use.LiNeBrEaKAlso sponsoring the site are UW-Madison's Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment, and 1,000 Friends of Wisconsin, an environmental group.LiNeBrEaK"What you do to reduce your carbon footprint happens to be good for just about everything," said Steve Hiniker, executive director of the 1,000 Friends group, noting that people who walk or ride bicycles instead of driving get more exercise and save money.LiNeBrEaKThe Madison library system will feature the site on its home page, said director Barbara Dimick, "because we think there's going to be a lot of individual interest in this type of thing."
