Tulsa World (Oklahoma)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Official says state crafting own greenhouse gas plan: Lacking a global-warming "climate action plan," Oklahoma focuses on carbon output.  	Susan Hylton, Tulsa World, Okla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	897 words  	Dec. 28--Oklahoma does not have a "climate action plan" to address global warming, but a top environmental official maintains that the state is at the forefront of reducing its carbon output because of its advances in the alternative fuel and wind industries.LiNeBrEaK"We decided to focus our resources on more practical measures that enable Oklahoma to position itself as a leader in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions," said Oklahoma Secretary of the Environment J.D. Strong. LiNeBrEaKHarlan Hentges, the legal counsel for the Oklahoma Sustainability Network, has another take on why the state isn't pursuing a specific plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions:LiNeBrEaK"Oklahoma is following its leaders, and some of them have taken the position that climate change isn't real and isn't caused by human beings and you can't do anything about it."LiNeBrEaKThirty-two states have a climate action plan or one in the works to address their state's contributions to global warming in anticipation of federal regulations on greenhouse gases in the near future.LiNeBrEaKThose plans recommend policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Some policies, such as educating homeowners on how to use energy more efficiently, are not quantified. But many other policy recommendations are quantified for their estimated greenhouse gas reduction as well as the projected cost savings.LiNeBrEaKArkansas, for example, estimates reducing greenhouse gases by 58. 9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2025 with the addition ofLiNeBrEaKnuclear power.LiNeBrEaKOklahoma is among 18 states, including Texas, that are not being assisted by the Center for Climate Strategies.LiNeBrEaKStrong said, "It was one path of many that states could take to demonstrate their desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and have a positive impact on global warming; it's certainly not the only way to get there.LiNeBrEaK"Our preference so far has been to see what kind of regulatory caps we're going to have at the national level, and, in the meantime, take interim steps to reduce our carbon in the state."LiNeBrEaKGov. Brad Henry's Oklahoma Bioenergy Center is set to become a national leader in biofuel research, Strong said.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps most promising is switchgrass, a perennial native grass that was once abundant on Oklahoma's tallgrass prairies. Researchers believe that ethanol derived from switchgrass is much more efficient than corn-produced ethanol.LiNeBrEaKA switchgrass crop pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, is disease-resistant and can thrive under poor growing conditions.LiNeBrEaKHentges, however, said that switchgrass has a long way to go before it becomes a usable fuel.LiNeBrEaK"The economy of Oklahoma is built on burning fossil fuels," he said. "Any policy to address climate change would require them to do a lot of new things, and they don't want anybody to force them to do these things."LiNeBrEaKStrong said tax incentives to help spur Oklahoma's wind energy industry would help catapult the state to the forefront of the wind energy industry.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Energy predicts that Oklahoma will the second-largest producer of wind energy by 2030. It current rank is No. 10, according to the American Wind Energy Association.LiNeBrEaKThose states with climate action plans support emissions reporting, cap-and-trade programs and low-emission standards for fuels, vehicles and appliances.LiNeBrEaKOklahoma has participated in a greenhouse gas inventory, which shows that emissions increased by 22 percent from 1990 to 1999.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide, the byproduct of burning fossil fuels, was the biggest contributor, representing 72 percent of the greenhouse gases in 1990 and 70 percent in 1999.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired power plants are the biggest source of carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKGovernment energy statistics show that coal has the highest carbon content, and natural gas has the lowest. Strong said natural gas plants may come more into play if pollution control technology at coal-fired plants proves to be cost-prohibitive.LiNeBrEaKStrong said American Electric Power-Public Service Company of Oklahoma would test its carbon-capture technology next year at its coal-fired plant in West Virginia. The carbon would be stored underground or used for enhanced oil-recovery activities.LiNeBrEaKThe technology will be initiated at AEP-PSO's operation in Oologah in late 2011.LiNeBrEaK"We recognize that it's really inevitable that we're going to see climate change regulation at the national level," Strong said. "You're talking a global problem. We really expect the next Congress to pass legislation that will set hard caps on how much carbon can be emitted."LiNeBrEaKAnother measure to reduce carbon is the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's adoption of "demand side management" rules, which Strong said is the first step in regulating energy efficiency of the utilities they regulate.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is for utilities to not just earn a profit from the amount of electrons they sell, but to earn some profit from selling less electricity and helping customers become more efficient," Strong said.LiNeBrEaKSusan Hylton 581-8381 susan.hylton@tulsaworld.com	EMISSIONS (92%); GLOBAL WARMING (91%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); BIOMASS (89%); BIOFUELS (89%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ALCOHOLS (77%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); ETHANOL (77%); ENERGY RESEARCH (77%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (65%); ETHYL ALCOHOL MFG (60%); LAWYERS (55%)  	Government  	BRAD HENRY (52%)  	OKLAHOMA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081228-TU-Official-says-state-crafting-own-greenhouse-gas-plan-1228  	Newspaper  	TU  	2008 Tulsa World   															
Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	Sen. Warner: 'I walk out, holding my head high ...'  	Dale Eisman, The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	2425 words  	Dec. 28--WASHINGTON -- The first thing John Warner insists everyone remember about his 30 years as a U.S. senator -- about his whole life, really -- is that he's been lucky.LiNeBrEaK"Hard work and good luck -- put that down!" he barked during an interview early this month, brandishing a short wooden pointer for emphasis. "I had a lot of good luck."LiNeBrEaKWork and luck and sometimes a dash of bluster have sustained Warner through a political career that spans four decades, the terms of seven presidents, six other Virginia senators and 11 governors.LiNeBrEaKA second-choice nominee after the Republican Party's original candidate died in a plane crash, Warner won his seat in 1978 by the narrowest margin in Virginia history. But when he retires next month at 81, he will have cast more Senate votes -- 10,728 -- and received more votes -- 5. 36 million in five elections -- than any other Virginian. LiNeBrEaKAs a presidential appointee and later a senator, he served through Watergate and Vietnam, eras of runaway inflation and a "hollow" military, the Iran-Contra scandal, the fall of the Soviet Union, the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and the horror of Sept. 11.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate is where he wanted to be from his first days in politics in the 1960s. It provides "the freedom to do pretty much as you please," tackling issues at home and around the world, he said. Senators can travel anywhere "and be well-received by foreign governments, executive branches or parliamentary leaders, because there's only 100 of you. ...LiNeBrEaK"This is a front-row seat on the greatest show on Earth."LiNeBrEaKon being independent ...LiNeBrEaKInside the Senate, Warner is best known as a consensus-builder.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, as the Senate headed toward a partisan showdown over judicial appointments, Warner joined a moderate "gang of 14" senators who brokered a deal to secure confirmation of several controversial GOP nominees but preserved the Democrats' right to use Senate rules to block others.LiNeBrEaK"I remember how skillfully John brought people to the table and pushed them to achieve a result," said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican. Warner's involvement in a group of mostly junior senators like herself "gave us a gravitas" that was vital, she added.LiNeBrEaKWarner had less success with his last big bid at bipartisanship, this year's failed effort to secure passage of "cap and trade" legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. However, his support is widely credited with getting the bill out of committee and onto the Senate floor, setting the stage for future debates on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"John Warner is very, very adept at governing," said Jim Webb, a Democrat and Virginia's other U.S. senator. "That requires -- as much as possible -- showing respect for people with all different points of view and understanding that some of these issues are long-term issues, so you're going to be dealing with people with whom you disagree."LiNeBrEaK"I never have seen him just offer to cut a deal -- he will almost always propose some kind of change," Webb added. Warner always anticipates how other senators might object to a bill and how it might be tweaked to satisfy them, he said.LiNeBrEaKCollins calls Warner, with his statesman-gray hair and perfectly tailored suits, "everyone's image of what a senator should be."LiNeBrEaKHe "kind of took me under his wing," when she came to the Senate in 1997, Collins said. Warner counseled her to take her time in making up her mind on big issues, to talk to other senators and outsiders she trusted, and not to be intimidated by party leaders.LiNeBrEaKIndependence has been central to Warner's own Senate career, sometimes imperiling him.LiNeBrEaKHe was personally and politically close to Ronald Reagan, but infuriated Reaganites by refusing in 1987 to back Reagan nominee Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. In 1994, he effectively threw Virginia's other Senate seat to the Democrats, refusing to back Republican nominee and Iran-Contra figure Oliver North. Incumbent Chuck Robb won the race.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, Warner showed his independence by backing a package of state tax hikes championed in 2004 by then-Gov. Mark Warner, the man who will succeed him next month.LiNeBrEaK"I remember the day he came to Richmond" to deliver his endorsement, Mark Warner said. "He just said, 'Mark, I think I'm going to come down and say a few things.' ... That was the day he got up, as only John Warner could do, and said: 'Politics be damned. ' It's time to put Virginia first."LiNeBrEaK"He hasn't changed as much as the Senate has changed," said Susan Magill, a former chief of staff. In their early years, Warner "was seen as one of the more conservative Republicans. I don't think that's the case anymore. ... The Democrats are more liberal and the Republicans are more conservative. There are fewer people in the middle."LiNeBrEaKon the military ...LiNeBrEaKWarner's life has been entwined with the American military.LiNeBrEaKHe joined the Navy when he was 17 and served in the final months of World War II.LiNeBrEaKTrained as a radioman, young Warner flirted with a career in the Navy; as World War II ended, officers volunteered to help him gain admission to the Naval Academy.LiNeBrEaKHis father, a Washington physician, had other ideas. He rang up the president of Washington and Lee University, his alma mater, "and he said, 'Frank, my little boy is home from the Navy and he wants to come to Washington and Lee,'" the senator recalled. "And they had a talk, and he put the phone down, and he said, 'The president says for you to get on down and sign up.' That's it.LiNeBrEaK"That's the way America treated the World War II generation. I'm not saying it's just John Warner. That was the way America opened its arms ... I wasn't any great hero. I'd just done what I was supposed to do."LiNeBrEaKThe memory of those days, and the similarly warm welcome he got when returning from duty as a Marine officer in Korea, has influenced Warner's entire career. He is still perplexed at how much of America lost faith in the military in the Vietnam era and is grateful that divide has not reappeared as the nation fights an unpopular war in Iraq.LiNeBrEaKWarner witnessed the birth of the all-volunteer military while serving in the Pentagon and has championed it as a legislator. He sponsored or backed dozens of military pay and benefit increases, including Tricare for Life, the 2001 reform that essentially saw the Defense Department pick up the tab for lifetime medical care for those who serve 20 years or more.LiNeBrEaK"There's not a person in the U.S. military today whose life has not been touched in a positive way by John Warner," Sen. Jim Webb said.LiNeBrEaKWebb was wounded as a Marine platoon leader in Vietnam and came home to an assignment on Warner's staff in the Navy secretariat in the early 1970s. As a young officer far down the chain of command, Webb was surprised when the undersecretary took a personal interest in his welfare. Warner even helped him find a civilian job when he decided to leave the Corps.LiNeBrEaK"He did everything he could," Webb said. "It was just his style."LiNeBrEaKon the Senate ...LiNeBrEaKFrom his first days in office, Warner immersed himself in the place, his courtly manner hiding a passion for the work.LiNeBrEaKHe went more than two years without missing a vote. His 15-hour workdays, he admits today, figured heavily in his divorce in 1982 from actress Elizabeth Taylor -- the Angelina Jolie of her day.LiNeBrEaKWarner has "a very, very strong sense of this place" and its role in the American scheme of government, said Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat who came to the Senate with Warner and whose career has paralleled the Virginian's.LiNeBrEaK"This is a unique place. There are some who come here and don't understand it," Levin said. They are frustrated by its arcane traditions and unending debates. Warner was never among them.LiNeBrEaKThese days, Warner worries for the Senate's future.LiNeBrEaKWhen he came to the Senate, "85 or 90 percent of the senators brought their families to Washington, maintained a home here," he said. "We were all part of a bigger family. And we worked together. We got to know each other. We traveled together."LiNeBrEaKThat forged bonds that produced compromises vital to governing, he said.LiNeBrEaKNow, the Senate meets for maybe three days during most weeks, so members can go home and raise money on the weekends. "And if you're not raising it for yourself ... the leadership is asking you to go out and raise it for your colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Frankly, I don't know where it ends."LiNeBrEaKon his office full of momentos ...LiNeBrEaKFriends in the Senate call Warner "the squire," a title that fits his Old South gentility and hints at their affection for him. Even as movers tagged its furnishings for packing this month, his office across Constitution Avenue from the Capitol had the look and feel of a country gentleman's study.LiNeBrEaKVirtually every inch of the walls was decorated with military memorabilia and art, including some of Warner's own floral still lifes. On the mantle, a bust of Winston Churchill looked on as Warner greeted visitors; one end table boasted a small statue of Harry Truman in his World War Iuniform.LiNeBrEaKEven in such surroundings, Warner himself dominated the room.Reflecting on his career this month, he stretched out in a well-worn office chair, spinning stories about items in his collection.LiNeBrEaKOne of his favorite paintings hung over the office sofa. "It's been in our family over 100 years," he said. "That's Ben Franklin working on the Treaty of Paris. It was the first treaty that the 13 colonies, now the United States, had with a foreign nation."LiNeBrEaKIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan dispatched Warner to France for ceremonies marking the treaty's bicentennial.LiNeBrEaK"So I saddled up and went over there for about four or five days -- a fascinating trip; the French really laid on a memorial -- and I took a photograph of that painting with me," he said. At the Court of Versailles, he showed the photo to a curator and asked if he might visit the room where Franklin had worked.LiNeBrEaK"He said, 'Oh, Monsieur, follow me,' and I walked down there, and that room hasn't changed one bit. ... I think the draperies are the same."LiNeBrEaKStaffers could fill volumes with other tales, not all of them entirely flattering to Warner, and the senator occasionally enjoys telling one on himself.LiNeBrEaKHis home in Alexandria, he acknowledged, still contains a nightstand he appropriated from the mothballed battleship New Jersey while secretary of the Navy. Warner took it from a cabin used by legendary World War II Adm. William "Bull" Halsey, taping a note inside one drawer with instructions that it be returned to the Navy after his death.LiNeBrEaKon Iraq ...LiNeBrEaKRoughly half of Warner's Senate career has been spent as chairman or ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which shapes and oversees the military's annual budget.LiNeBrEaKThere, Warner helped secure funding for eight aircraft carriers, all built at Northrop Grumman's Newport News shipyard.LiNeBrEaKHe co-authored the law that let the military close roughly one-fourth of its bases after the Cold War. And he helped draft congressional resolutions that authorized both Persian Gulf wars.LiNeBrEaKThe current war in Iraq weighs on him, he acknowledged.LiNeBrEaKHe was an early supporter of toppling Saddam Hussein, but his questions about the Bush administration's strategy for occupying Iraq and launching a democratic government there have grown increasingly pointed in the five years since the invasion.LiNeBrEaKWhen the military disclosed that Iraqi prisoners had been mistreated by Americans running the Abu Ghraib prison, Warner chaired hearings in 2004 that examinedthe abuse in embarrassing detail. As insurgents inflicted heavy casualties on U.S. troops in 2006, Warner returned from a trip to Iraq to declare the war effort was "drifting sideways."LiNeBrEaKNot long after that, Warner reflected on the unseen toll everywar takes on those who fight,recalling his struggles in Korea to cope with the deaths of his comrades.LiNeBrEaK"We lost two guys who over a period of time were sleeping in my tent,"he said, closing his eyes and rubbing his temples at the memory. Warner had the grim job of gathering and shipping home the men's belongings.LiNeBrEaK"You don't forget those things," he said.LiNeBrEaKSecurity in Iraq is better these days, but Warner remains concerned about the Iraqi government's slow progress in taking responsibility for the country's security.LiNeBrEaK"We just moved into a situation we had not prepared our military toaddress. ..." he said. "We underestimated this conflict -- no doubt about it."LiNeBrEaKon the future ...LiNeBrEaKWarner knows he could have been re-elected, probably without opposition, but he decided last year that it was time to move on. By the end of another term, he would be nearly 88.LiNeBrEaKHis health is good, he said, though he had a pacemaker implanted this year after several bouts with an irregular heartbeat. Doctors have cautioned him to expect the normal problems that go with an octogenarian's life.LiNeBrEaK"I feel very strongly, and I've seen it here, where individuals havestayed on, and their health hasimpaired their ability to do the work," he said. "I didn't want that to happen."LiNeBrEaKHe's looking forward to tending his garden, painting a bit more, and spending time with his wife, Jeanne.LiNeBrEaKThe Warners wed in 2003, after dating for several years. They met 30 years earlier, when Jeanne was married to Paul Vander Myde, a naval officer who admired the senator. He died in 2000.LiNeBrEaKTwice divorced, Warner had renounced any future marriages and seemed to enjoy life as one of Capitol Hill's most eligible bachelors.LiNeBrEaKHe showed up regularly on the society pages of The Washington Post through the 1980s and '90s, most famously as an escort for television anchorwoman Barbara Walters.LiNeBrEaKBut soon after he began seeing Jeanne, friends sensed Warner'swanderings had ended. He acknowledges now that she "settled" him.LiNeBrEaK"That's all I'll say."LiNeBrEaKHe hinted that he'll have a relationship with the University of Virginia, where he went to law school and where he went last year to announce his retirement.LiNeBrEaKHe'd also like to stay active on the edges of the federal government, Warner suggested, sharing some of what he's learned about the military and the nation's intelligence community.LiNeBrEaK"I walk out, holding my head high, as able as I've ever been," he said. "I kind of hope that I fade away into history."LiNeBrEaKDale Eisman, (703) 913-9872 dale.eisman@pilotonline.com	LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); LEGISLATION (88%); ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (75%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (75%); INTERVIEWS (73%); CLIMATE CHANGE (71%); US PRESIDENTS (78%); IMPEACHMENT (68%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (62%); AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS (54%); EMISSIONS (50%)  	Education  	JOHN WARNER (96%); MARK WARNER (94%); BILL CLINTON (55%); SUSAN COLLINS (51%); JIM WEBB (50%)  	VIRGINIA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081228-VP-Sen-Warner-I-walk-out-holding-my-head-high-1228  	Newspaper  	VP  	2008 Virginian-Pilot   	NYSE:NOC, NYSE:WPO  														
Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 28, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: McDonnell Courts Independents  	Christina Nuckols, The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	617 words  	Dec. 28--Call up gubernatorial candidate Bob McDonnell's Web site (www.bobmcdonnell.com) and the first thing you learn is that he "worked effectively with Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine" as attorney general.LiNeBrEaKMcDonnell is a conservative Republican, but he must appeal to independent voters to win next year. He's vigorously cultivating an independent streak, emphasizing his record of building bipartisan coalitions on transportation and law enforcement issues. LiNeBrEaKHis campaign chief says it's a coincidence, but McDonnell's maverick moment comes at a time when the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity is picking fights with House Republican leaders.LiNeBrEaKAFP is a conservative advocacy group with ties to McDonnell's campaign manager. Phil Cox is on a leave of absence from his consulting job with the organization, based in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKThe group's Virginia chapter recently got in an arm-wrestling contest with Speaker Bill Howell over rules that allow House subcommittees to kill bills without recorded votes.LiNeBrEaKSome House Republicans are furious at state director Ben Marchi for challenging a rule used to smother bills they viewed as embarrassing or politically risky. Other GOP delegates, who had been lining up support to change the rule, are equally furious that Marchi swooped in and got credit when the caucus voted to require recorded voting.LiNeBrEaKMarchi says he got involved because AFP favors open government, but subcommittee voting is pretty inside baseball for an organization that generally focuses on broader tax and energy policies.LiNeBrEaKAFP describes itself as a grassroots citizens group, but the chairman of its foundation, David Koch, is co-owner of Koch Industries, which owns oil refineries and fertilizer plants. Fortune magazine estimated his net worth this year at $19 billion. The president of AFP and its foundation is Tim Phillips, a former political adviser to McDonnell who now pulls down a steady income topping $200,000 annually, according to tax records.LiNeBrEaKAt the national level, AFP is battling to block proposals that would give the Environmental Protection Agency power to regulate greenhouse gases. The group's position paper warns that would give the EPA oversight over lawn mowers and fork lifts, but doesn't mention oil refineries would be covered too.LiNeBrEaKIn Virginia, the group advocates offshore drilling for oil and gas. It opposes new spending on pre-kindergarten, a smoking ban in restaurants, and restrictions on payday lenders. It helped defeat plans to raise taxes for road projects in Hampton Roads.LiNeBrEaKMcDonnell and AFP agree on most issues, but Marchi notes that they parted ways over transportation. McDonnell backed 2007 legislation, later ruled unconstitutional, that would have created a regional taxing authority in Hampton Roads to fund roads.LiNeBrEaK"We gave him a hard time," Marchi said. "It was unfortunate the attorney general went in that direction."LiNeBrEaKNow McDonnell is devising a road plan he'll roll out next year. He's previously favored locally imposed taxes over regional levies, but Marchi said that won't appease his group.LiNeBrEaKAs McDonnell swings closer to the swing voters, he may end up yanking the chain of some of his closest allies.LiNeBrEaKChristina Nuckols is an editorial writer for The Virginian-Pilot.

There are fewer people in the middle."LiNeBrEaKWarner's life has been entwined with the American military.LiNeBrEaKHe joined the Navy when he was 17 and served in the final months of World War II.LiNeBrEaKTrained as a radioman, young Warner flirted with a career in the Navy; as World War II ended, officers volunteered to help him gain admission to the Naval Academy.LiNeBrEaKHis father, a Washington physician, had other ideas. He rang up the president of Washington and Lee University, his alma mater, "and he said, 'Frank, my little boy is home from the Navy and he wants to come to Washington and Lee,'" the senator recalled. "And they had a talk, and he put the phone down, and he said, 'The president says for you to get on down and sign up.' That's it.LiNeBrEaK"That's the way America treated the World War II generation. I'm not saying it's just John Warner. That was the way America opened its arms ... I wasn't any great hero. I'd just done what I was supposed to do."LiNeBrEaKThe memory of those days, and the similarly warm welcome he got when returning from duty as a Marine officer in Korea, has influenced Warner's entire career. He is still perplexed at how much of America lost faith in the military in the Vietnam era and is grateful that divide has not reappeared as the nation fights an unpopular war in Iraq.LiNeBrEaKWarner witnessed the birth of the all-volunteer military while serving in the Pentagon and has championed it as a legislator. He sponsored or backed dozens of military pay and benefit increases, including Tricare for Life, the 2001 reform that essentially saw the Defense Department pick up the tab for lifetime medical care for those who serve 20 years or more.LiNeBrEaK"There's not a person in the U.S. military today whose life has not been touched in a positive way by John Warner," Sen. Jim Webb said.LiNeBrEaKWebb was wounded as a Marine platoon leader in Vietnam and came home to an assignment on Warner's staff in the Navy secretariat in the early 1970s. As a young officer far down the chain of command, Webb was surprised when the undersecretary took a personal interest in his welfare. Warner even helped him find a civilian job when he decided to leave the Corps.LiNeBrEaK"He did everything he could," Webb said. "It was just his style."LiNeBrEaKFrom his first days in office, Warner immersed himself in the place, his courtly manner hiding a passion for the work.LiNeBrEaKHe went more than two years without missing a vote. His 15-hour workdays, he admits today, figured heavily in his divorce in 1982 from actress Elizabeth Taylor -- the Angelina Jolie of her day.LiNeBrEaKWarner has "a very, very strong sense of this place" and its role in the American scheme of government, said Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat who came to the Senate with Warner and whose career has paralleled the Virginian's.LiNeBrEaK"This is a unique place. There are some who come here and don't understand it," Levin said. They are frustrated by its arcane traditions and unending debates. Warner was never among them.LiNeBrEaKThese days, Warner worries for the Senate's future.LiNeBrEaKWhen he came to the Senate, "85 or 90 percent of the senators brought their families to Washington, maintained a home here," he said. "We were all part of a bigger family. And we worked together. We got to know each other. We traveled together."LiNeBrEaKThat forged bonds that produced compromises vital to governing, he said.LiNeBrEaKNow, the Senate meets for maybe three days during most weeks, so members can go home and raise money on the weekends. "And if you're not raising it for yourself ... the leadership is asking you to go out and raise it for your colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Frankly, I don't know where it ends."LiNeBrEaKFriends in the Senate call Warner "the squire," a title that fits his Old South gentility and hints at their affection for him. Even as movers tagged its furnishings for packing this month, his office across Constitution Avenue from the Capitol had the look and feel of a country gentleman's study.LiNeBrEaKVirtually every inch of the walls was decorated with military memorabilia and art, including some of Warner's own floral still lifes. On the mantle, a bust of Winston Churchill looked on as Warner greeted visitors; one end table boasted a small statue of Harry Truman in his World War Iuniform.LiNeBrEaKEven in such surroundings, Warner himself dominated the room.Reflecting on his career this month, he stretched out in a well-worn office chair, spinning stories about items in his collection.LiNeBrEaKOne of his favorite paintings hung over the office sofa. "It's been in our family over 100 years," he said. "That's Ben Franklin working on the Treaty of Paris. It was the first treaty that the 13 colonies, now the United States, had with a foreign nation."LiNeBrEaKIn 1983, President Ronald Reagan dispatched Warner to France for ceremonies marking the treaty's bicentennial.LiNeBrEaK"So I saddled up and went over there for about four or five days -- a fascinating trip; the French really laid on a memorial -- and I took a photograph of that painting with me," he said. At the Court of Versailles, he showed the photo to a curator and asked if he might visit the room where Franklin had worked.LiNeBrEaK"He said, 'Oh, Monsieur, follow me,' and I walked down there, and that room hasn't changed one bit. ... I think the draperies are the same."LiNeBrEaKStaffers could fill volumes with other tales, not all of them entirely flattering to Warner, and the senator occasionally enjoys telling one on himself.LiNeBrEaKHis home in Alexandria, he acknowledged, still contains a nightstand he appropriated from the mothballed battleship New Jersey while secretary of the Navy. Warner took it from a cabin used by legendary World War II Adm. William "Bull" Halsey, taping a note inside one drawer with instructions that it be returned to the Navy after his death.LiNeBrEaKRoughly half of Warner's Senate career has been spent as chairman or ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which shapes and oversees the military's annual budget.LiNeBrEaKThere, Warner helped secure funding for eight aircraft carriers, all built at Northrop Grumman's Newport News shipyard.LiNeBrEaKHe co-authored the law that let the military close roughly one-fourth of its bases after the Cold War. And he helped draft congressional resolutions that authorized both Persian Gulf wars.LiNeBrEaKThe current war in Iraq weighs on him, he acknowledged.LiNeBrEaKHe was an early supporter of toppling Saddam Hussein, but his questions about the Bush administration's strategy for occupying Iraq and launching a democratic government there have grown increasingly pointed in the five years since the invasion.LiNeBrEaKWhen the military disclosed that Iraqi prisoners had been mistreated by Americans running the Abu Ghraib prison, Warner chaired hearings in 2004 that examinedthe abuse in embarrassing detail. As insurgents inflicted heavy casualties on U.S. troops in 2006, Warner returned from a trip to Iraq to declare the war effort was "drifting sideways."LiNeBrEaKNot long after that, Warner reflected on the unseen toll everywar takes on those who fight,recalling his struggles in Korea to cope with the deaths of his comrades.LiNeBrEaK"We lost two guys who over a period of time were sleeping in my tent,"he said, closing his eyes and rubbing his temples at the memory. Warner had the grim job of gathering and shipping home the men's belongings.LiNeBrEaK"You don't forget those things," he said.LiNeBrEaKSecurity in Iraq is better these days, but Warner remains concerned about the Iraqi government's slow progress in taking responsibility for the country's security.LiNeBrEaK"We just moved into a situation we had not prepared our military toaddress. ..." he said. "We underestimated this conflict -- no doubt about it."LiNeBrEaKon the future ...LiNeBrEaKWarner knows he could have been re-elected, probably without opposition, but he decided last year that it was time to move on. By the end of another term, he would be nearly 88.LiNeBrEaKHis health is good, he said, though he had a pacemaker implanted this year after several bouts with an irregular heartbeat. Doctors have cautioned him to expect the normal problems that go with an octogenarian's life.LiNeBrEaK"I feel very strongly, and I've seen it here, where individuals havestayed on, and their health hasimpaired their ability to do the work," he said. "I didn't want that to happen."LiNeBrEaKHe's looking forward to tending his garden, painting a bit more, and spending time with his wife, Jeanne.LiNeBrEaKThe Warners wed in 2003, after dating for several years. They met 30 years earlier, when Jeanne was married to Paul Vander Myde, a naval officer who admired the senator. He died in 2000.LiNeBrEaKTwice divorced, Warner had renounced any future marriages and seemed to enjoy life as one of Capitol Hill's most eligible bachelors.LiNeBrEaKHe showed up regularly on the society pages of The Washington Post through the 1980s and '90s, most famously as an escort for television anchorwoman Barbara Walters.LiNeBrEaKBut soon after he began seeing Jeanne, friends sensed Warner'swanderings had ended. He acknowledges now that she "settled" him.LiNeBrEaK"That's all I'll say."LiNeBrEaKHe hinted that he'll have a relationship with the University of Virginia, where he went to law school and where he went last year to announce his retirement.LiNeBrEaKHe'd also like to stay active on the edges of the federal government, Warner suggested, sharing some of what he's learned about the military and the nation's intelligence community.LiNeBrEaK"I walk out, holding my head high, as able as I've ever been," he said. "I kind of hope that I fade away into history."LiNeBrEaKDale Eisman, (703) 913-9872 dale.eisman@pilotonline.com	LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); LEGISLATION (88%); ELECTIONS (78%); POLITICS (75%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (75%); INTERVIEWS (73%); CLIMATE CHANGE (71%); US PRESIDENTS (78%); IMPEACHMENT (68%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (62%); AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS (54%); EMISSIONS (50%)  	Government  	JOHN WARNER (96%); MARK WARNER (94%); BILL CLINTON (55%); SUSAN COLLINS (52%); JIM WEBB (50%)  	VIRGINIA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 29, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081228-VP-SENATOR-WARNER-20081228  	Newspaper  	VP  	2008 Virginian-Pilot   															
The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		December 28, 2008 Sunday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Parting thoughts Parting thoughts  		FRONT; Pg. A1  	2108 words  	Inside the Senate, Warner is best known as a consensus-builder.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, as the Senate headed toward a partisan showdown over judicial appointments, Warner joined a moderate "gang of 14" senators who brokered a deal to secure confirmation of several controversial GOP nominees but preserved the Democrats' right to use Senate rules to block others.LiNeBrEaK"I remember how skillfully John brought people to the table and pushed them to achieve a result," said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican. Warner's involvement in a group of mostly junior senators like herself "gave us a gravitas" that was vital, she added.LiNeBrEaKWarner had less success with his last big bid at bipartisanship, this year's failed effort to secure passage of "cap and trade" legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions. However, his support is widely credited with getting the bill out of committee and onto the Senate floor, setting the stage for future debates on climate change. LiNeBrEaK"John Warner is very, very adept at governing," said Jim Webb, a Democrat and Virginia's other U.S. senator. "That requires - as much as possible - showing respect for people with all different points of view and understanding that some of these issues are long-term issues, so you're going to be dealing with people with whom you disagree."LiNeBrEaK"I never have seen him just offer to cut a deal - he will almost always propose some kind of change," Webb added. Warner always anticipates how other senators might object to a bill and how it might be tweaked to satisfy them, he said.LiNeBrEaKCollins calls Warner, with his statesman-gray hair and perfectly tailored suits, "everyone's image of what a senator should be."LiNeBrEaKHe "kind of took me under his wing," when she came to the Senate in 1997, Collins said. Warner counseled her to take her time in making up her mind on big issues, to talk to other senators and outsiders she trusted, and not to be intimidated by party leaders.LiNeBrEaKIndependence has been central to Warner's own Senate career, sometimes imperiling him.LiNeBrEaKHe was personally and politically close to Ronald Reagan, but infuriated Reaganites by refusing in 1987 to back Reagan nominee Robert Bork for the Supreme Court. In 1994, he effectively threw Virginia's other Senate seat to the Democrats, refusing to back Republican nominee and Iran-Contra figure Oliver North. Incumbent Chuck Robb won the race.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, Warner showed his independence by backing a package of state tax hikes championed in 2004 by then-Gov. Mark Warner, the man who will succeed him next month.LiNeBrEaK"I remember the day he came to Richmond" to deliver his endorsement, Mark Warner said. "He just said, 'Mark, I think I'm going to come down and say a few things.' ... That was the day he got up, as only John Warner could do, and said: 'Politics be damned. ' It's time to put Virginia first."LiNeBrEaK"He hasn't changed as much as the Senate has changed," said Susan Magill, a former chief of staff. In their early years, Warner "was seen as one of the more conservative Republicans. I don't think that's the case anymore. ... The Democrats are more liberal and the Republicans are more conservative. There are fewer people in the middle." Warner's life has been entwined with the American military.LiNeBrEaKHe joined the Navy when he was 17 and served in the final months of World War II.LiNeBrEaKTrained as a radioman, young Warner flirted with a career in the Navy; as World War II ended, officers volunteered to help him gain admission to the Naval Academy.LiNeBrEaKHis father, a Washington physician, had other ideas.

By Dale EismanLiNeBrEaKThe Virginian-PilotLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKThe first thing John Warner insists everyone remember about his 30 years as a U.S. senator - about his whole life, really - is that he's been lucky.LiNeBrEaK"Hard work and good luck - put that down!" he barked during an interview early this month, brandishing a short wooden pointer for emphasis. "I had a lot of good luck."LiNeBrEaKWork and luck and sometimes a dash of bluster have sustained Warner through a political career that spans four decades, the terms of seven presidents, six other Virginia senators and 11 governors.LiNeBrEaKA second-choice nominee after the Republican Party's original candidate died in a plane crash, Warner won his seat in 1978 by the narrowest margin in Virginia history. But when he retires next month at 81, he will have cast more Senate votes - 10,728 - and received more votes - 5. 36 million in five elections - than any other Virginian.LiNeBrEaKAs a presidential appointee and later a senator, he served through Watergate and Vietnam, eras of runaway inflation and a "hollow" military, the Iran-Contra scandal, the fall of the Soviet Union, the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and the horror of Sept . 11.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate is where he wanted to be from his first days in politics in the 1960s. It provides "the freedom to do pretty much as you please," tackling issues at home and around the world, he said. Senators can travel anywhere "and be well-received by foreign governments, executive branches or parliamentary leaders, because there's only 100 of you. ...LiNeBrEaK"This is a front-row seat on the greatest show on Earth."LiNeBrEaKRichard NixonLiNeBrEaK"I got to know him pretty well" while working as an advance man for Nixon's 1968 campaign for the presidency. "I still have a very high regard for his knowledge of foreign affairs." But Nixon also "had an element of insecurity in him. He was always fearful and suspicious. And unfortunately, his staff did not just give him protection, or say to him: Mr. Vice President ... or Mr. President, now wait a minute, this is not the way we think you should do this."LiNeBrEaKGerald FordLiNeBrEaKFord told Warner that working on the bicentennial commission would help him distance himself from the Pentagon, an unpopular place with voters at the end of the Vietnam War.LiNeBrEaK"He was the nicest man," but he "almost inherited an impossible situation" in taking over after the Watergate scandal forced Nixon from office.LiNeBrEaKJimmy CarterLiNeBrEaK"I rather liked him." They shared an affection for the Navy and for Adm. Hyman Rickover, the father of the nuclear Navy. Rickover had been Carter's mentor in the Navy; Warner had been Rickover's boss as Navy secretary. Carter's presidency turned sour in part because "he tried to run everything as if he was the captain of the ship. ...

Some of his observations follow. Ronald ReaganLiNeBrEaKWarner became fast friends with Reagan in part because of their shared love of horses and the outdoors. The pair occasionally rode together on a farm Warner owned in Virginia's horse country. "His legacy was really one of being forthright and being himself. He never changed."LiNeBrEaKGeorge H.W. BushLiNeBrEaKThe 41st president "was a very broad-based man ... a kindly person" who faced some unusual economic situations. And now his son's got the same problem - a little more severe than he had."LiNeBrEaKBill ClintonLiNeBrEaKHaving never served in the military himself, Clinton made a point of seeking the counsel of senior military leaders and defense-oriented lawmakers such as Warner during private sessions in the White House. "He would just sort of sit in the chair and watch the military and the members of Congress go at it, debate things. ... He was a good listener. ... He was a learner."LiNeBrEaKGeorge W. BushLiNeBrEaKWarner "tried to be supportive" and was a key backer of Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Later, he broke with Bush and pushed the president to begin bringing troops home. "I don't pretend to judge his presidency. ... We're fortunate this country has not been attacked in anything similar to 9/11. And you have to say that a lot of the steps that he took contributed to our nation not suffering another devastating blow." Sen.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		December 28, 2008 Sunday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	young readers embrace brave new world of dYstopian tales  	CECELIA GOODNOW  	DAILY BREAK; Pg. E5  	1177 words  	By Cecelia GoodnowLiNeBrEaKThe Seattle Post-IntelligencerLiNeBrEaKTHERE'S NOTHING like a hurtling asteroid to put teen angst in perspective.LiNeBrEaKAfter all, what's a dateless prom compared with the smoking ruins of civilization? Weighed against epidemics, mass starvation and thought control, the SATs lose their sting, and "safety school" starts to sound like a good thing.LiNeBrEaKThat's one way to explain the surging popularity of post-apocalyptic fiction for the 12-and-up Young Adult market - one of the most robust areas of publishing. The starker explanation is that this popular genre mirrors a world beset by some of the most frightening problems in recent memory, from climate change to terrorism and the shredding of privacy and free will.LiNeBrEaKDystopias are a staple of fiction, from "Brave New World" and "Nineteen Eighty-Four" to contemporary novels such as Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" and Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale." LiNeBrEaKBut the genre is especially hot among publishers reaching out to young readers - the ones who will inherit the nightmare scenarios of the 21st century.LiNeBrEaKEven the tween crowd has a dystopian best-seller - Jeanne DuPrau's "The City of Ember," about a post-apocalyptic underground world whose time is running out. The film version hit theaters in October, and the book series wrapped this fall with "The Diamond of Darkhold."LiNeBrEaKIrene Muller, 16, a member of the Seattle Library's Teen Advisory Board, said adolescents' strong opinions and sense of rebellion make them receptive to dystopian tales that might repel adults who are "too freaked out or set in their ways."LiNeBrEaKToday's headlines provide plenty of fodder. The post- 9/11 tension between security and liberty inspires classic Orwellian themes in Cory Doctorow's "Little Brother," about a teen who is wrongfully detained and tortured by the Department of Homeland Security after the worst terrorist attack in San Francisco history. To protect the Constitution and wreak revenge, the teen - his handle is "wIn5ton," pronounced "Winston" - uses his hacking skills to subvert DHS.LiNeBrEaKOther novels explore classic dystopian themes against the backdrop of a thoroughly modern threat: global warming.LiNeBrEaKExhibit A is "The Other Side of the Island," a fall release that represents National Book Award finalist Allegra Goodman's first foray into teen lit.LiNeBrEaKVolume 1 in a planned trilogy, it's set in a world in which scattered islands - the mountaintops of a world flooded by climate change - are the last refuge of humanity. Goodman's young protagonist, Honor, navigates a domed society characterized by Safe Weather, conformity and obedience to the Corporation, whose figurehead is a beaming, cookie-baking Mrs. Doubtfire-type called Earth Mother.LiNeBrEaK"I was really interested in the idea of a Big Brother that's feminized," Goodman said. "I would describe her as a cross between Betty Crocker and Chairman Mao."LiNeBrEaKGoodman said it's understandable that teens would be drawn to these cautionary tales.LiNeBrEaK"I think they speak to the kinds of anxieties people have about where the world is and where we're going," she said.LiNeBrEaKFor sheer terror, it's hard to beat Susan Beth Pfeffer's "Life As We Knew It" and "The Dead and the Gone," which depict the stark unraveling of civilization after a seemingly innocuous event - an asteroid's collision with the moon - plunges the Earth into a fatal winter of anarchy, disease and starvation. Told through the lives of teen protagonists - one in rural Pennsylvania, the other in Manhattan - the novels are chillingly plausible as they chronicle the grim events unfolding from a climate-changing cataclysm: natural disasters, empty supermarket shelves, $10-a-gallon gas, no gas, shuttered workplaces, isolation and death.LiNeBrEaKSome authors have drawn dark inspiration from pop culture's voyeuristic obsession with celebrity. Among the most respected titles are Scott Westerfeld's "Uglies" trilogy and its companion book, "Extras," about a post-apocalyptic society that mandates cosmetic surgery for teens and awards privileges based on "face rank," a measure of how many citizens click on one's televised exploits.LiNeBrEaKIn "The Hunger Games," one of this fall's most provocative releases, Suzanne Collins holds a warped, funhouse mirror up to the excesses of reality TV. Designed as a tool of domination by the harsh government that presides over the ruins of North America, the annual games are a televised fight to the death among two dozen unwilling contestants ages 12 to 18. The event is equal parts horror and giddy spectacle as professional stylists costume the Tributes to curry favor with the TV viewers who will influence their fate.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		December 28, 2008 Sunday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	McDonnell Courts Independents  		LOCAL; Pg. B8  	544 words  	CALL UP gubernatorial candidate Bob McDonnell's Web site (www.bobmcdonnell.com) and the first thing you learn is that he "worked effectively with Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine" as attorney general. LiNeBrEaKMcDonnell is a conservative Republican, but he must appeal to independent voters to win next year. He's vigorously cultivating an independent streak, emphasizing his record of building bipartisan coalitions on transportation and law enforcement issues.LiNeBrEaKHis campaign chief says it's a coincidence, but McDonnell's maverick moment comes at a time when the state chapter of Americans for Prosperity is picking fights with House Republican leaders.LiNeBrEaKAFP is a conservative advocacy group with ties to McDonnell's campaign manager. Phil Cox is on a leave of absence from his consulting job with the organization, based in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKThe group's Virginia chapter recently got in an arm-wrestling contest with Speaker Bill Howell over rules that allow House subcommittees to kill bills without recorded votes.LiNeBrEaKSome House Republicans are furious at state director Ben Marchi for challenging a rule used to smother bills they viewed as embarrassing or politically risky. Other GOP delegates, who had been lining up support to change the rule, are equally furious that Marchi swooped in and got credit when the caucus voted to require recorded voting.LiNeBrEaKMarchi says he got involved because AFP favors open government, but subcommittee voting is pretty inside baseball for an organization that generally focuses on broader tax and energy policies.LiNeBrEaKAFP describes itself as a grassroots citizens group, but the chairman of its foundation, David Koch, is co-owner of Koch Industries, which owns oil refineries and fertilizer plants. Fortune magazine estimated his net worth this year at $19 billion. The president of AFP and its foundation is Tim Phillips, a former political adviser to McDonnell who now pulls down a steady income topping $200,000 annually, according to tax records.LiNeBrEaKAt the national level, AFP is battling to block proposals that would give the Environmental Protection Agency power to regulate greenhouse gases. The group's position paper warns that would give the EPA oversight over lawn mowers and fork lifts, but doesn't mention oil refineries would be covered too.LiNeBrEaKIn Virginia, the group advocates offshore drilling for oil and gas. It opposes new spending on pre-kindergarten, a smoking ban in restaurants, and restrictions on payday lenders. It helped defeat plans to raise taxes for road projects in Hampton Roads.LiNeBrEaKMcDonnell and AFP agree on most issues, but Marchi notes that they parted ways over transportation. McDonnell backed 2007 legislation, later ruled unconstitutional, that would have created a regional taxing authority in Hampton Roads to fund roads.LiNeBrEaK"We gave him a hard time," Marchi said. "It was unfortunate the attorney general went in that direction."LiNeBrEaKNow McDonnell is devising a road plan he'll roll out next year. He's previously favored locally imposed taxes over regional levies, but Marchi said that won't appease his group.LiNeBrEaKAs McDonnell swings closer to the swing voters, he may end up yanking the chain of some of his closest allies.LiNeBrEaKChristina Nuckols is an editorial writer for The Virginian-Pilot.

The Washington Post 		December 28, 2008 Sunday   Regional Edition	American Czars;  From Eggs to Automobiles 	George F. Will  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B07  	801 words  	In 1966, the price of eggs rose to a level that President Lyndon Johnson judged, God knows how, was too high. There were two culprits -- supply and demand -- and Johnson's agriculture secretary told him there was not much that could be done. LBJ, however, was a can-do fellow who directed the U.S. surgeon general to dampen demand by warning the nation about the hazards of cholesterol in eggs.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, the last president with a direct political connection to Franklin Roosevelt, was picked by FDR in 1935 to be Texas director of the New Deal's National Youth Administration. Two years later, Johnson came to Congress, a rung on the ladder that led to glory as Egg Czar. Today, with Washington experiencing a Roosevelt revival, Johnson's spirit, too, goes marching on as the federal government permeates the economy with politics. LiNeBrEaKOr not. In an interview with Business Week, Rep. Barney Frank, the effervescent Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, was asked, concerning the auto industry, "How do you make sure the government doesn't meddle too deeply in day-to-day operations and bring politics -- like a push for green cars -- into the equation?" Frank replied: "Oh, well, a push for green cars is very much a part of what we're involved in. We don't think that's politics." So, when the government, its 10 thumbs stuck deep in the economy, uses its power to compel an industry to pursue the objectives of the political party that controls both of the government's political branches, that is not politics.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Should GM acquire Chrysler?" Frank: "I'm not competent to say." Frank's humility is selective: He obviously thinks he is competent to say what kind of cars should be made.LiNeBrEaKBusiness Week: "Does Congress realize how few hybrids have been sold, as it pushes Detroit to make them, and will Congress give consumers greater incentives to buy these cars?" Frank: Those who are "blaming the auto companies forget to blame somebody else -- the consumers. In the recorded history of America, no one was ever forced at gunpoint to buy a Hummer. But we do believe that the combination of genuine concern about global warming and energy efficiency means people are now ready to buy these cars."LiNeBrEaKConsumers are such a disappointment to Congress. But what Congress really believes is that people are not ready to buy those cars at a price that reflects the costs of making them. Why else has it voted tax subsidies for buyers?LiNeBrEaKForty years ago, Vietnam was a disaster and the Great Society a disappointment as Johnson limped back to Texas. Today, there is more Johnsonian confidence in government's competence than at any time since Johnson's policies shattered such confidence. The resurgence of confidence began under today's Texan president.LiNeBrEaKThe 1996 Republican platform said: "The federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula. . . . That is why we will abolish the Department of Education [and] end federal meddling in our schools." One year ago, the Department of Education announced: "U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings today honored President Lyndon Baines Johnson in a ceremony officially renaming the U.S. Department of Education Building . . . as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building."LiNeBrEaKThe domestic achievement for which George W. Bush will be most remembered, the 2001 No Child Left Behind law, was the seventh reauthorization of LBJ's 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which brought the federal government heavily into primary and secondary education. No Child Left Behind requires states to define "proficiency" in reading and math, and achieve 100 percent proficiency by 2014.LiNeBrEaKFrederick M. Hess, director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, notes that unless the "proficiency" standards are risible, the goal is delusional.LiNeBrEaKIt is ironic, Hess writes, that 50 states establishing divergent standards -- the decentralized approach Republicans demanded -- have sparked demands for centralization, in the form of national standards, a decade after congressional Republicans opposed President Bill Clinton's plan for voluntary national standards.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, Hess notes, there has been striking dissonance between Republican resistance to race-conscious government policies and No Child Left Behind "requiring states to identify every student by race and then report test scores -- and impose sanctions -- on that basis." The Johnsonian attributes of No Child Left Behind, which Hess says include "Great Society-style ambition and race-conscious rhetoric," suggest that the Egg Czar, who also was the first National School Superintendent, would feel right at home in a Washington where he could be Automotive Engineer in Chief.LiNeBrEaKgeorgewill@washpost.com	POLITICS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); HEADS OF STATE and GOVERNMENT (90%); FOOD PRICES (89%); AGRICULTURAL PRICES (89%); AUTOMAKERS (87%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (87%); INTERVIEWS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (76%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (76%); POLITICAL PARTIES (75%); US POLITICAL PARTIES (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); PHYSICIANS and SURGEONS (72%); GOVERNMENT GRANTS and SUBSIDIES (67%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (67%); HISTORY (60%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  		BARNEY FRANK (84%)  	MASSACHUSETTS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved  				SURGEON GENERAL (57%)  	Maryland  										
The Washington Post 		December 28, 2008 Sunday   Bulldog Edition	Protections in Peril;  A midnight attack on the Endangered Species Act, courtesy of the Interior Department 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06  	505 words  	THE BUSH administration had the good sense to stop trying to push through last-minute regulations that would have made it easier to build coal-fired plants and other polluting facilities near national parks. It was wise to hold off on changing "new source review" rules that govern when power plants must add pollution-reduction equipment. But it couldn't leave well enough alone when it issued regulations that essentially gut the Endangered Species Act. Because the rule will take effect before Barack Obama assumes the presidency, he's stuck with it. But relief could come by way of the courts. LiNeBrEaKThis so-called midnight regulation, despite White House chief of staff Joshua B. Bolten's directive against such a move, is brought to you by the Interior Department.  In May, it listed the polar bear as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act because global warming is shrinking Arctic sea ice. The law was never intended to make up for President Bush's inaction on climate change. But Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne's attempt to protect the polar bear without taking on the larger task of regulating carbon emissions eviscerates the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKSection 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act says that "Each Federal agency, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, shall insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat. . . ." Where Mr. Kempthorne got it right is in preventing the effects of "global processes" (climate change) from triggering consultation "because of the inability to separate out the effect of a specific Federal action from a multitude of other factors that contribute through global processes." But Mr. Kempthorne went further by reinterpreting the statute to mean that agencies do not have to consult the Fish and Wildlife Service (or any other service) for actions that may affect any species, not just polar bears.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, the give-and-take of the consultation process produces compromises that allow projects to go forward while minimizing the harm to protected species. But Interior's new rule eliminates that vital check on the ambitions of agencies that want to complete projects. Such a check will become increasingly important as President-elect Obama and Congress move to make infrastructure repair and revitalization (roads, high-speed rail, wind farms, etc.) an essential part of an economic stimulus plan.LiNeBrEaKA balance must be struck between that plan and protecting species and the environment. No doubt environmental groups will sue to stop the regulation. By settling out of court on terms that are favorable to the plaintiff and that match the new president's philosophy, Interior Secretary-designate Ken Salazar and the Obama administration could nullify Mr. Kempthorne's ill-advised rule much faster than by undertaking the long process of issuing new regulations.

LiNeBrEaKBeginning March, the windmills will start generating all the power that the ICF requires. The factory's annual energy consumption is 25 million units, while the windmills project is estimated to yield 25. 9 million units.LiNeBrEaKSuzlon Energy, a manufacturer of wind turbine generators, has been awarded the Rs 60 crore contract. Work on the project has commenced.LiNeBrEaKChennai-based Ms C-WET, a central institution, is the consultant.LiNeBrEaKAccording to windmill data jointly gathered by C-WET and the ICF, the selected sites are among the best in India. The turbines will be set up at Tottapalli, Sanganeri, Radhapuram, Taluk and Tirunelveli.LiNeBrEaKSukhbir Singh, member (electrical), Railway Board, said: "The project has been initiated with the aim of reducing carbon emissions, while diminishing environmental ill-effects like global warming."LiNeBrEaKEstimates are that the ICF's annual power bills will come down by Rs. 2.5 crore once the windmill project gets into gear. March 2009 has been fixed as the target date of commissioning, said Anil Saxena, railway ministry spokesman.

The Houston Chronicle 		December 27, 2008 Saturday   3 STAR EDITION	Rick Warren's biggest critics: other evangelicals;  Saddleback Community Church pastor faces complaints head on 	RACHEL ZOLL, LISA LEFF, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	RELIGION; Pg. 1  	1072 words  	Rick Warren is in a place he never expected to be: at the center of a culture war.LiNeBrEaKThe pastor chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to give the inaugural invocation backed Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in his home state of California. But he did so belatedly, with none of the enthusiasm he brings to fighting AIDS and illiteracy.LiNeBrEaKWhen other conservative Christians held stadium rallies and raised tens of millions of dollars for the ballot effort, there was no sign of Warren. Neither he nor his wife, Kay, donated any of their considerable fortune to the campaign, according to public records and the Warrens' spokesman. LiNeBrEaKIn fact, his endorsement seemed calculated for minimal impact. It was announced late on a Friday, just 10 days before Election Day, on a Web site geared for members of his Saddleback Community Church, not the general public.LiNeBrEaKFor gay rights advocates, that strategy was nothing more than an attempt to mask Warren's prejudice. They were outraged that Obama decided last week to give a place of honor to a pastor they consider a general for the Christian right.LiNeBrEaKLost in the uproar was the irony of Warren's plight. Ever since he began his climb to prominence in the 1980s, he has battled complaints from fellow evangelicals that he isn't nearly conservative enough.LiNeBrEaK"The comments from many of the evangelicals further to the right of him are often critical for his lax stance on their passionate issues," said Scott Thumma, a professor at Connecticut's Hartford Seminary who researches megachurches and writes about the challenges for gay and lesbian Christians.LiNeBrEaKOn paper, Warren might look like any other religious traditionalist. He is the son of a Southern Baptist pastor, graduate of a Southern Baptist seminary, and his megachurch in Orange County is part of the conservative denomination.LiNeBrEaKBut Warren holds a different worldview than his roots suggest.LiNeBrEaKHe has spoken out against the use of torture to combat terrorism. He has joined the fight against global warming and, encouraged by his wife, has put his prestige and money behind helping people with AIDS. The Warrens have done so at a time when a notable number of conservative Christians still consider the virus a punishment from God.LiNeBrEaK"If you want to save a life, I don't care what your background is and I don't care what your political party is," Warren said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. "I think some of these humanitarian issues transcend politics, or ethnic or religious beliefs."LiNeBrEaKWhile many religious conservatives openly condemn Islam as inherently evil, Warren reaches out to the American Muslim community. This past Saturday, he gave the keynote address at the convention of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, based in Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaK"His social consciousness is somewhat left of center, but his theological, ethical stance is right of center," said the Rev. William Leonard, a critic of the Southern Baptist Convention and dean of Wake Forest Divinity School in North Carolina. "That's the thing that makes him potentially a bridge person."LiNeBrEaKWarren's outlook has come at a price. Many from the Christian right don't trust him.LiNeBrEaKA registered independent who does not endorse candidates, he has called old guard evangelical activists too partisan and overly focused on gay marriage and abortion.LiNeBrEaKIn the run-up to the Saddleback forum he led last August with Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain, those giving Warren the most grief were conservatives. They were convinced he wouldn't be tough enough on Obama. (Obama wound up stumbling in his appeal to religious voters while answering Warren's question about when a baby gets human rights. Obama said it was "above his pay grade" to respond "with specificity.")LiNeBrEaK"For probably the last 25 years, evangelicalism became co-opted, and for most people it became a political term," Warren said. "And it got identified with a certain style of political leanings."LiNeBrEaKThe attacks on Warren stretch to how he presents the Gospel - watered-down and soft, according to his theologically traditional critics.LiNeBrEaKWarren's phenomenal best-seller, The Purpose Driven Life, which has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, partly reflects the self-help ethos of baby boomers, although he insists it isn't an advice book and he defends its religious content.LiNeBrEaKStill, the tone of his writing is deliberate. Warren, 54, is among a generation of pastor-CEOs who use marketing studies, polling and census data to create congregations that will attract people who never go to church. One of Warren's most important mentors was the late Peter Drucker, considered the father of modern management.LiNeBrEaKWarren started Saddleback with one other family in 1980 in California, a state with one of the lowest percentages of churchgoers in the country. Saddleback now draws more than 22,000 worshippers each week.LiNeBrEaKAs the church grew, so did the critiques. "The pioneers get the arrows," he says.LiNeBrEaKWarren survives the pounding partly because of his personal integrity. He donates 90 percent of his many millions in book royalties back to the church. He says he stopped taking a salary from Saddleback six years ago. No scandals have tainted his ministry.LiNeBrEaKHe is also one of the savviest leaders among his peers.LiNeBrEaKHis speaking invitations range from church groups to the Davos World Economic Forum and the United Nations. Saddleback's reach is now so broad, it's nearly its own denomination.LiNeBrEaKWarren provides sermons, study materials and guidance to hundreds of thousands of clergy worldwide through pastors.com and his other Web sites. Warren's 40 Days of Purpose spiritual campaigns have been conducted in more than 20,000 churches, and he recently joined forces with Reader's Digest to launch a multimedia global juggernaut based on his "Purpose Driven" writing.LiNeBrEaKNow he is trying to revolutionize faith-based humanitarian work through his P.E.A.C.E. program. It unites local churches, businesses and governments to fight poverty and disease, promote peace, and combat what he calls spiritual emptiness.LiNeBrEaKThe pilot project for this effort began in 2005 in Rwanda, which has been dubbed the first "purpose-driven nation."LiNeBrEaKIt is no surprise that he and Obama have become friendly. Each tries to operate outside a strict liberal-conservative divide, and has risked angering his supporters to do so.LiNeBrEaK"You can't have a reformation without somebody opposing it," Warren says. "If I wasn't making a difference, nobody would be paying attention."

The News and Advance (Lynchburg, Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 27, 2008 Saturday 	The News and Advance, Lynchburg, Va., Darrell Laurant column: Down a 2009 memory lane  	Darrell Laurant, The News and Advance, Lynchburg, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	583 words  	Dec. 27--Here's a column I like to do every December, a sort of companion piece to the inevitable "Top 10 Stories of the Year" compilations. The idea is to look back at things that don't generally involve mayhem or politicians, but that we'll probably remember longer because they affected more of us directly.LiNeBrEaK--Liberty University, its debt paid off by an insurance policy on the late founder Jerry Falwell, surged to a new high water mark in enrollment -- and, based on voting registration figures, Republicans. LiNeBrEaK--Wards Road continued its inevitable march toward Altavista, one new restaurant at a time.LiNeBrEaK--Another component of the Bluff Walk project opened, the specialty pizza emporium Waterstone joining the Craddock-Terry Hotel and Shoemakers' Restaurant.LiNeBrEaK--Complaints by much of Lynchburg that CSO sewer line projects were sparing the more affluent areas of town were refuted by construction and traffic delays on Boonsboro and Link roads.LiNeBrEaK--A hookah bar (dispensing only legal smokables) opened in Wyndhurst.LiNeBrEaK--Problems with the housing industry stopped some of the larger building projects in Central Virginia in their bulldozer tracks.LiNeBrEaK--The Nelson County History Museum opened in a historic house called Oakland alongside U.S. 29.LiNeBrEaK--Cabell Street lost another outlet when the D Street Bridge was closed. It was not true, however, that plans were to eventually transport residents in and out by helicopter.LiNeBrEaK--The Cinemark Dollar Movie theater went to $2 on weekends.LiNeBrEaK--A summer-long drought revived fears of global warming, which were then quenched (if temporarily) by an autumn of global wetting.LiNeBrEaK--A new and much-needed Veteran's Administration outpatient center opened on Lakeside Drive.LiNeBrEaK-The Johnson Health Center put the finishing touches on a Federal Street annex for women and children.LiNeBrEaK-The city announced plans to revitalize Riverside Park, Heritage High School and the Rivermont Bridge. None of this has happened yet. Meanwhile, someone else jumped (or fell) off the bridge.LiNeBrEaK--A mysterious odor closed Heritage High School for a day.LiNeBrEaK--A flock of new art galleries opened along Rivermont Avenue.LiNeBrEaK--A new music venue was unveiled in Bedford County.LiNeBrEaK--A fountain was installed in the traffic circle in Amherst. In mid-November, it froze solid.LiNeBrEaK--Local young people mistook the Madison Heights bypass for a drag strip, to the chagrin of local police, who dubbed that stretch of highway "The Autobahn."LiNeBrEaK--The proposed Lakeside Centre mega-shopping center near the intersection of Old Forest and Lakeside remained proposed.LiNeBrEaK--A new connector road was cut, linking the shopping centers at the lower end of Wards Road with Leesville Road.LiNeBrEaK--Evington residents showed up en masse to protest a proposed new rock quarry, to no avail.LiNeBrEaK--What used to be the site of the Knight Gallery on Lakeside Drive was replaced by a giant hole in the ground. It was not, local residents were assured, the first stages of a rock quarry.LiNeBrEaK--Rumors that the Texas Inn might stop staying open all night proved, thankfully, groundless.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday   Sunrise Edition	Sprinkle on that salt Every major "ci  		Editorial; Pg. ELL  	1501 words  	Sprinkle on that saltLiNeBrEaKEvery major "civilized" city uses salt on its snowy and/or icy roads. Tally up the school days and work lost; the cost of buying chains (if you could find them); the rental SUVs; the broken arms and ankles; the reduction in retail sales; the buses and light rail systems broken down; the cancelled Christmas trips, etc., all because our politically correct city officials are afraid that sprinkling salt on ice will ruin the rivers.LiNeBrEaKOur city has been crippled for almost two weeks. This is insanity, to say the least. Our rivers run into the Pacific Ocean, which already has salt in it. We cannot allow our lives to be interrupted like this again. Enough is enough.LiNeBrEaKSpread the salt next time --and spare us. LiNeBrEaKKIT HOGANLiNeBrEaKSouthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKWhat global warming?LiNeBrEaKAs I sit here this white Christmas morning in my warm and comfortable little home sipping my third, or is it my fourth, eggnog, I realize I have been wrong in judging Al Gore and his relentlessness in protecting our planet. It also occurs to me that in all the news this past week I have not once heard the dreaded "g . . . w. . ." phrase used.LiNeBrEaKWhich leads me to believe that maybe Gore has already accomplished his task, and we'll now be able to celebrate Arctic blasts on a regular basis and reset our thermostats to a cozy 72 to 73 degrees, which I've already done. Way to go, Al, and thanks from all of us thin-blooded senior citizens, the polar bears and penguins. Happy New Year.LiNeBrEaKLEN GROVERLiNeBrEaKCorneliusLiNeBrEaKThe clowns have come, goneLiNeBrEaKIsn't it slick?LiNeBrEaKDon't you love ruts?LiNeBrEaKBouncing near-airborne on ice chunks, getting stuck in mid-lane.LiNeBrEaKSend in the plows.LiNeBrEaKBut where are the plows?LiNeBrEaKThere ought to be plows.LiNeBrEaKWell, maybe . . . next year.LiNeBrEaKDANIEL WRIGHTLiNeBrEaKSoutheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKPortland shows the spiritLiNeBrEaKThere is much that is wrong with America today, but during this recent arctic experience, I found there is much that is right with the people of Portland.LiNeBrEaKAs a recent widow, I have experienced the caring concern of many who called to offer their condolences or just to check up on me to see how I was doing in the snow. Beyond these often-sad exchanges, I discovered the true spirit of Christmas was all around.LiNeBrEaKWhen I was able, again, to get around --with the help of various "angels" who had four-wheel drive or chains --I discovered fellow shoppers smiling and talking happily with perfect strangers. People were so courteous and gracious.LiNeBrEaKTruly, if the one whose birth we celebrate during this season were to return to Portland, I think that he'd find his spirit alive and well.LiNeBrEaKJERILYN E.

Congress needs to act now by passing House Resolution 1531 against the Bush blanket pardons.LiNeBrEaKROGER KOFLERLiNeBrEaKSoutheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKWhere are the kids?LiNeBrEaKDecember 22, 2008, with its 14 inches of snow, was a strange experience. A beautiful morning filled with inches and inches of new powder. But no snow angels, no sleds or toboggans, no giggles.LiNeBrEaKNo mittens, snow hats, gloves, boots or footprints.LiNeBrEaKNo inner-tubes, saucers, snowballs or snow forts. No neighborhood hills turned into runs. Not one child seen on a two-hour walk. It's 10 a.m., and the snow is still new in the family neighborhood. It's perfectly silent. We are making the first crunchy footprints remembering our snowy childhood stories. What is wrong?LiNeBrEaKWhere are the children?LiNeBrEaKIt's snowing!LiNeBrEaKMARY MALINSKILiNeBrEaKTigardLiNeBrEaKTriMet let us downLiNeBrEaKInstead of TriMet officials' self-congratulatory statement that they are doing an "extraordinary job," they should offer a humble apology to the public for the disgraceful performance of the light-rail system during this latest (and every previous) winter storm.LiNeBrEaKThere is simply no excuse for train passengers to endure delays and cancellations the way they have over the last week. Trains run safely year-round in Alaska, the Sierras and the Rockies (and please don't tell us "Well, they're equipped for it," as if it never snows or freezes here).LiNeBrEaKThe "technology" required for keeping the rails clear and the switches free of ice is uncomplicated: a motorized plow that will keep the core (the area between the rails) free of ice buildup, and propane or electric heaters to keep the switches warm. That's it. (Of course, the will and a plan to keep things running are indispensible, too).LiNeBrEaKWith proper preparation, trains can run safely and close to on time in frigid temperatures. TriMet's failure to plan for icy weather in Portland is dangerous and inexcusable, and it's time the agency is held to account.LiNeBrEaKROBERT S. HATFIELD JR.LiNeBrEaKSouthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKHave a happy one, anywayLiNeBrEaKI've been depending on TriMet during these many days of snow storms.LiNeBrEaKYesterday I, and more than a dozen other passengers, had been at a stop waiting well over an hour hoping for a bus.LiNeBrEaKOne finally arrived at our intersection. There were no passengers on board. I approached the bus and, at a respectful distance from the driver, called out to him, asking if there was any hope: Was a bus going to come along or should we all start walking?LiNeBrEaKThe bus driver looked at me, made eye contact, gave me the finger and drove off.LiNeBrEaKTo that driver I have only one thing to say: Happy New Year. I hope 2009 starts off better than 2008 seems to have ended for you.LiNeBrEaKSTEVEN BARRYLiNeBrEaKSoutheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKForget a trailer taxLiNeBrEaKIn response to Joyce Esterbrook's Dec. 21 letter ("Why not tax trailers?"), apparently, she has drunk the left-wing Kool-Aid. A trailer tax would make an insignificant dent in Gov. Ted Kulongoski's recent budget. The problem in Oregon lies not in taxation. The problem lies in government spending.LiNeBrEaKCut a redundant program or reduce waste and needless spending? The writer's only answer is: If it moves, tax it. We just need to ask Esterbrook what flavor of Kool-Aid she likes the most.LiNeBrEaKO. W. COCKRELLLiNeBrEaKBeavertonLiNeBrEaKDissenting on dissertationsLiNeBrEaKWe see the bumper stickers every day, advising us to: "Question Authority." But when it comes to global warming, we do not practice what we preach.LiNeBrEaKBarbara Wilson's letter ("Climate change is real," Dec. 24) says that over 3,000 scientists have signed a petition that humans do not cause global warming, but that hundreds of thousands of scientists have signed petitions with the opposite opinion. My question is this: Who are these "scientists"? I doubt there are 3,000 people in the world who study long term climactic change, let alone hundreds of thousands. Both sides of this question use "scientists" as if they are the voice of God.LiNeBrEaKDoes something happen when people are awarded a doctoral degree? Do they suddenly become experts on every subject? Forty years ago, I read that between the mid-12th to mid-19th century the weather increasingly became abnormally cold. It was even called "the mini ice age."LiNeBrEaKIf you do not believe me ask yourself this: Why did the Vikings call it "Greenland" when it was discovered? Look it up. Since the mid-19th century, the weather has been warming. The question is not whether we are warming up but whether human activity is making it worse.LiNeBrEaKI would submit we should be talking to those few people who actually study such things. Remember: A damn fool with a Ph.D. is still a damn fool.LiNeBrEaKFRANK NEMETHLiNeBrEaKSoutheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKChristmas 'war' perplexesLiNeBrEaKI've been shaking my head over the whole "war on Christmas" controversy, puzzling over how we've come full circle within my lifetime. You see, when I was a kid, my minister dad would have preferred we didn't celebrate Christmas at all.LiNeBrEaKThat wasn't going to fly with his wife and five children, though. So he settled for second-best: There was never, ever any religious connotation to our cards, tree, decorations or musings. He believed Christmas was, at best, a commercial contrivance, and, at worst, a pagan holiday taken over by the church to keep new converts from missing their old fun.LiNeBrEaK"Jesus," my dad would say, "was not born on Christmas, or even in December. By all accounts, he was born in the spring. What's more, why celebrate the birth of a helpless baby who hasn't yet done anything? If you want to celebrate the Christ, do it on Easter. We know when that is, and by then he had done what he came to do: died to take on our sins, and risen from the dead to prove it." (I'm paraphrasing.)LiNeBrEaKEventually, Dad conceded that if Christmas got people to think of Jesus, even just once a year, it wasn't such a bad thing. But now, it seems that if you don't want religion with your holiday you're warring over Christmas. Like I said, I'm just shaking my head.LiNeBrEaKMerry Christmas, a Quality Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah, a Salubrious Solstice, and the best of holidays to all!LiNeBrEaKANITRA CAMERONLiNeBrEaKNortheast Portland	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); CHRISTMAS (89%); MARINE MAMMALS (74%); CITY GOVERNMENT (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); CITIES (73%); SENIOR CITIZENS (50%)  		AL GORE (69%)  	PORTLAND, OR, USA (91%) OREGON, USA (92%); EARTH (79%); PACIFIC OCEAN (57%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  															
Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	'Santa Dan' brightens youngsters  		EDITORIAL; CHEERS and JEERS; Pg. A11  	555 words  	CHEERS to "Santa Dan," a.k.a. Dan Myers of Reading, whose offer to be the jolly old elf for the fledging Sarah Lynn Strohman Foundation helped brighten Christmas for children in the Pediatric Unit at Harrisburg Hospital. Elmo dolls were provided to the kids in honor of Sarah Lynn Strohman, a 21-year-old Mechanicsburg woman who passed away in September and who loved Elmo.LiNeBrEaKThe foundation also deserves CHEERS for its efforts, as does Mattel for providing the dolls at a 35 percent discount with reduced shipping. As for "Santa Dan," I'm told he doesn't charge for his services, simply deriving pleasure from giving his time and love to children. It's this kind of spirit that makes Santa Claus real. LiNeBrEaKCHEERS to Annie Barr, owner of Annie's Breakfast and Lynch in Silver Spring Twp., for her annual Christmas party for customers that includes a present for every child, goodies and a visit from St. Nick. Annie's employees and customers say she loves kids, and pours her heart and soul into the party. They also note Christmas isn't the only time she gives back to the community -- there are Easter and Halloween events as well.LiNeBrEaKJEERS and Bah-Humbug to stores that stay open late on Christmas Eve and operate on Christmas Day. And I give JEERS to myself for being among the consumers who give owners financial incentive to operate. Thought of this when I was picking up something up Christmas Day. Could have easily gotten the item earlier and the same applied to the stuff I saw other customers buying.LiNeBrEaKThe employees should have been home with their families. Surely, if stores closed -- as they once did -- we'd all adjust and get bread and milk a day or two earlier. We do when snowstorms are coming.LiNeBrEaKJEERS to the citing of seven midstate clubs since late November -- VFWs, American Legions, Elks, etc. -- for violating small games of chance payout limits. I understand the law is the law, but these organizations that sponsor youth baseball teams, aid charities, and help veterans have been operating under limits that haven't been raised in 20 years. Is this really so pressing as to justify state police time? And I don't buy for one second that these clubs being competitors of casinos is just a coincidence.LiNeBrEaKPlenty of JEERS to last week's JEERS to the contradiction of President-elect Barack Obama discussing global warming with Al "The rest of you conserve energy while I live in a huge, energy-sucking mansion" Gore, but traveling with his daughters in an SUV to buy a Christmas tree. Just so fellow pickup drivers don't misunderstand, I repeat the JEERS was for talking the talk, but not walking the walk. And on that note, I share this from an Associated Press story on the Obama family's arrival in Honolulu for a Christmas vacation: "Awaiting the family was a black Cadillac limousine ... and four SUVs." They can't make small vehicles bulletproof?LiNeBrEaKCHEERS to Pennsylvania's new open records laws that goes into effect Thursday. It's not perfect, but it moves Pennsylvania forward in terms of giving the public records of how their money is being spent and other workings of state and local governments. Yes, this benefits the news media, but we aren't seeking anything that shouldn't be readily available to any citizen or taxpayer.LiNeBrEaKJOHN TROUTMAN is an editorial writer for The Patriot-News: 255-8104 or jtroutman@patriot-news.com	CHRISTMAS (92%); CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); HOLIDAYS and OBSERVANCES (90%); YOUTH SPORTS (77%); CHARITIES (77%); HALLOWEEN (68%); POLICE FORCES (66%); WEATHER (62%); BASEBALL (61%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  		BARACK OBAMA (51%)  	HARRISBURG, PA, USA (73%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (78%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  	hrn  	2008 The Patriot News Co.

This in turn means that more water is evaporated and more precipitation is created. Global warming causes severe changes in weather, not perpetual warmth.LiNeBrEaKI hope that I have been able to shed some light on your ignorant misinterpretation.LiNeBrEaKClaire ClarkLiNeBrEaKFairview Park 	GLOBAL WARMING (93%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (88%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (86%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (74%)  				December 30, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.   															
The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday   All Editions	YOUR VIEWS  		OPINION; YOUR VIEWS; Pg. A09  	982 words  	Shoe throwing is positive sign in IraqLiNeBrEaK"In troubled times: words, bombs and shoes" (Opinion, Page O-4, Dec. 21) is aptly headlined. That is now the progression we see in present-day Iraq. Thank you, President Bush.LiNeBrEaKWhen there is trouble and words are not working, the old mode of operation in Iraq would have been to bomb. But now we see yet another positive change brought about in Iraq through the so-called policies of "bullying and greed" by the Bush administration: Shoes instead of bombs are being thrown in anger. This development joins rights for women, education for all, health care and power to the people among the other benefits brought to Iraq by the administration. LiNeBrEaKRosemarie StoneLiNeBrEaKFranklin Lakes, Dec. 21LiNeBrEaKSupport your local restaurantsLiNeBrEaKIn these times, it is essential that people support their local restaurants. Go to your favorite pizzeria or Mexican, Chinese or Italian restaurant. You know the place ? it's where the food is good, and the employees know you and your family. The chef in the kitchen probably knows it's you by the food you order. Your favorite restaurants are extensions of your home.LiNeBrEaKRemember what happened to your local hardware stores? They were replaced by the big box stores. If not supported, your favorite eateries may be replaced by chain restaurants. Chains certainly have their place. But don't allow them to become your only choices.LiNeBrEaKConcerned citizens support local farmers. I ask that you support local restaurants in the same way.LiNeBrEaKThose who say local restaurants are more expensive need to recognize that the owners don't have the buying power or sales volumes of chains. When gasoline prices soared and food deliveries had gas surcharges, local eateries did not pass along those costs to their customers.LiNeBrEaKWhen the independent owner tries to compete dollar for dollar with the chains, he cannot survive. Just look at a newspaper to see how many restaurants have recently closed, changed names or are for sale.LiNeBrEaKJay LippinLiNeBrEaKWestwood, Dec. 23LiNeBrEaKThe writer is owner and chef of Backwoods BBQ and Grill in Westwood.LiNeBrEaKChasing windmills on climate changeLiNeBrEaKIn tough economic times, the proper course for government is to pursue the most rigid economy. To embark on "a wide range of proposals" is altogether erroneous ("State details plan to cut emissions," Page A-6, Dec. 16). I must say that Governor Corzine's Global Warming Response Act is a misguided effort to solve a non-problem.LiNeBrEaKEarth's temperature has always fluctuated, for reasons that are not fully understood. We had an ice age some 20,000 years ago, and it was not due to the absence of SUVs or of coal-fired power plants. Temperatures at the time of the Civil War were low, and today's warming (assuming that it is happening) is probably only a turn toward "normal."LiNeBrEaKWe do not need to limit the public's choices, build "alternate" power sources, require novel automotive technologies or expand mass transit systems that ? nice as they are ? will not pay their own way and will only burden the taxpayer.LiNeBrEaKIn this period of severe economic stress, the correct response is to allow the free market to determine proper choices and not to go (literally) chasing windmills.LiNeBrEaKDaniel L. BauchLiNeBrEaKRidgewood, Dec. 20LiNeBrEaK'Economically infeasible'LiNeBrEaKRegarding "Sprinklers save lives in high-rise fires" (Your Views, Dec. 19) on retrofitting sprinkler systems in New Jersey's high-rise buildings:LiNeBrEaKAs a co-op owner, I agree that fire sprinkler systems save lives. However, it would be a massive undertaking by a building's owners to comply with this proposal.LiNeBrEaKIn buildings with limited or no system whatsoever, it would require installing a dedicated water line from the municipality, with ample water pressure to support such a system. Then there would be the enormous cost of upgrading apartments and common areas to conform to building codes.LiNeBrEaKSuch factors make the proposal economically infeasible for a building or its residents.LiNeBrEaKMaria E. BrautiganLiNeBrEaKHackensack, Dec. 20LiNeBrEaKYMCA pools meet safety standardsLiNeBrEaKRegarding "Some pools may not meet new rules by summer" (Page L-3, Dec. 20):LiNeBrEaKWe fully understand why The Record believed it was important to bring this issue to the public's attention. Water safety is integral to the history and mission of our YMCA and YWCA, and we commend the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act's intent to increase safety in public pools.LiNeBrEaKOur YMCA and YWCA have been diligent in ensuring that the two pools and whirlpool in our facility at 112 Oak St. in Ridgewood comply with the new law. Our organizations have spent the past year working with the Ridgewood Health Department, the National YMCA and the YMCA regional association to acquire and install the proper safety items to be in compliance with this legislation.LiNeBrEaKThe safety of our members and guests is paramount. Each year, our facility serves thousands of people in Bergen County through aquatic instruction, rehabilitation therapy, exercise opportunities and competitive swimming events.

The Register Guard (Eugene, Oregon)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 27, 2008 Saturday 	UO study shows Rogue warming  	Greg Bolt, The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1006 words  	Dec. 27--The Rogue Valley, just a geographic hop and skip from Eugene, could end up looking more like central California than Southwest Oregon after only a few more decades of climate change, says a new study by University of Oregon researchers and others.LiNeBrEaKIn one of the first studies ever to project the effects of a warming world down to a specific geographic region, scientists with the UO's Climate Leadership Initiative and the National Center for Conservation Science and Policy say the Rogue Valley will see hotter, drier summers and rainier, stormier winters in the not-so-distant future. Those conditions could mean bigger, more intense wildfires, lower winter snowpacks and increased flood risks. LiNeBrEaKAnother report looking at the likely effects of a warming climate on the Willamette Valley is expected to be ready early next year.LiNeBrEaKThe Rogue report's authors acknowledge that specific predictions still carry a substantial margin of error, which increases as the size of an area being looked at shrinks. But they say the overall regional trend is unmistakable.LiNeBrEaK"There's very few people today that would deny that it's warming," said Bob Doppelt, director of the Climate Leadership Initiative. "And if it's warming, some of these stresses are likely to happen."LiNeBrEaKThe report recommends that the region begin a gradual shift of buildings and people away from areas that in the future will be more prone to flash flooding and wildfires. That would mean moving away from flood plains and the urban interface at the edge of forests, areas that now are heavily populated.LiNeBrEaKA brief preliminary presentation of the report was delivered to the Rogue Valley Council of Governments earlier this month. The council co-sponsored the official release of the report in Medford.LiNeBrEaK"Rogue basin communities must take the necessary steps to learn how to cope with the effects of climate change and to develop the systems that will allow them to recover from its impacts," said Craig Harper, manager of the council's natural resources department. "Our region is resilient and strong, but to remain so we must begin to respond to these coming changes."LiNeBrEaKDoppelt said the region, which includes the cities of Medford, Grants Pass, Ashland and Cave Junction, will transition to weather more like the Sacramento area. Average annual temperatures are projected to rise 1 to 3 degrees by 2040 and 4 to 8 degrees by 2080, with the average summer temperature up as much as 7 to 15 degrees by the latter date.LiNeBrEaKThat could hurt the region's agriculture, particularly vineyards that now produce Pinot Noir grapes and orchards producing pears. Those crops may have to move farther north or closer to the coast to survive, said report co-author Roger Hamilton of the climate institute.LiNeBrEaKFisheries, forestry and hydropower generation also could face dramatic changes as the climate warms, the report says.LiNeBrEaKThe Port Orford cedar and Brewer's spruce, and the marbled murrelet, spotted owl and fisher (a minklike animal) are among the plants and animals that might not adapt fast enough to survive the change.LiNeBrEaKDoppelt acknowledged that the study uses worst-case scenario climate models used by the International Panel on Climate Change, and that it's possible temperatures won't rise that high.LiNeBrEaKBut he cautioned that some warming already is all but inevitable just based on the heat-trapping greenhouse gases already released and those that will continue to be released from existing power plants, vehicles and other sources around the globe.LiNeBrEaK"It's really important to remember that somewhere close to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit, is already in the can globally," he said. "We are committed to that through emissions that are already concentrated in the atmosphere and the infrastructure that's on the ground today and that we're not just going to turn off tomorrow."LiNeBrEaKOne factor that remains difficult to predict is rain and snow. That's partly because the models aren't yet sophisticated enough and partly because the Northwest is located in a transition zone between the warmer, drier south and the wetter, cooler north.LiNeBrEaK"And the Rogue is right at the heart of that zone," Doppelt said.LiNeBrEaKThe likely outcome, he said, is decades-long shifts between hotter and drier years and then wetter years.LiNeBrEaKBut he said precipitation patterns probably will change either way, with smaller snowpacks at higher elevations and more of the rain that does fall coming in more intense storms with the potential to cause flash flooding.LiNeBrEaKMany people remain skeptical of the science showing a dramatic warming trend over the past 100 years, particularly the evidence that much of the increase is due to greenhouse gases released by human activity.LiNeBrEaKBut Doppelt said regardless of why the change is occurring it's important for governments, businesses and individuals to begin preparing.LiNeBrEaK"First of all, just begin to take climate change into account with every plan and every decision that has any length to it at all," he said. "Any infrastructure project, any land use decision on where certain things are going to be built, we hope decision-makers would really think about what is the likely future effect of climate change and how that will affect their decision."LiNeBrEaKFor those whose memory of the Willamette Valley's unusual December snow is still fresh, Doppelt said it's important to remember that climate change is a long-term trend and doesn't mean it won't be cold now or in the future.LiNeBrEaK"As much as we were shocked by the snow, don't get fooled by that," he said. "The fact that climate change is occurring does not mean that we're not going to have winter."

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 27, 2008 Saturday 	Sold, to the ingenious college kid with the paddle  	The Salt Lake Tribune  	BREAKING; Opinion; Columnists  	492 words  	Tim DeChristopher's story reads like an Edward Abbey novel, only Abbey wasn't nearly this creative.LiNeBrEaKInstead of Abbey's jack Mormon river runner Seldom Seen Smith, our true-life, redrock hero is a 27-year-old University of Utah economics major. And, instead of employing gasoline and TNT, he commits environmental protectionism with an auction paddle. LiNeBrEaKWhen DeChristopher bid on government oil and gas leases at a Bureau of Land Management auction in Salt Lake City this month, he had every advantage over the competition.LiNeBrEaKMoney was not an issue, because DeChristopher didn't intend to pay.LiNeBrEaKHe didn't have to answer to a company president or board of directors, only his conscience.LiNeBrEaKAnd it didn't matter if the oil and gas deposits would cover the costs of the lease and recovery. The last thing DeChristopher intended to do was spoil the scenic terrain and further threaten the planet by drilling it. The son of one of the founders of the West Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club, he is in love with the land, and concerned about fossil fuels causing climate change.LiNeBrEaKSo he bid with reckless abandon, buying 10-plus parcels for a combined $1. 8 million, and driving up the cost of other leases. Then he got caught. The oil and gas industry reps eventually realized they were being monkeywrenched, and DeChristopher was hauled off for questioning. But it was too late to rebid the parcels, which won a reprieve with the potential for an Obama administration pardon.LiNeBrEaKWhat DeChristopher did was, in all likelihood, a crime. But I can't tell you which one. Maybe "Obstruction for Environmental Justice," or "Recklessly Endangering the Exploitation of Wilderness," or even "Indecent Exposure of a Government Agency That's Too Dumb to Require Collateral as a Condition for Bidding."LiNeBrEaKNow it's up to federal attorneys to decide if they want to teach environmental activists a lesson by prosecuting DeChristopher and creating a martyr while upholding the government's right to rape wilderness-quality land.LiNeBrEaKA pair of prominent Utah attorneys, anticipating the filing of charges, have offered to represent DeChristopher. And money is being collected for his defense.LiNeBrEaKBut, in interviews with the news media and BLM officials, DeChristopher has already confessed. He said he's written letters and carried protest signs, to no avail, and an act of "civil disobedience" was his last resort.LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher's best bet to avoid jail would be to plead guilty, and then ask Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch to request a presidential pardon. After all, Hatch went to bat for "genius" drug dealer/musician John Forte. Surely the senator would write a letter on behalf of an ingenious constituent who has also proven himself a true patriot, at least by Edward Abbey's definition.LiNeBrEaK"A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government," Abbey once said. And that's all DeChristopher was trying to do.LiNeBrEaKCasey Jones is a member of The Tribune editorial board.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday 	Developer recruits business owners for climate fight  	By Will Oremus DAILY News STAFF WRITER  	COMMUNITIES; Peninsula; News; Local  	535 words  	As Palo Alto works toward the city council's ambitious goal of reducing citywide emissions by 15 percent from 2005 levels, it's getting a push from a local developer who believes small businesses, collectively, can make a big difference.LiNeBrEaKJim Baer, chief executive of Premier Properties, believes going green tends to be relatively easy for governments and big companies, which can hire consultants and implement sweeping plans, and private citizens, who can simply change their personal habits. But organizing small- and medium-sized businesses around climate change goals is tougher, because there are so many of them but none is large enough to make much of an impact on its own. LiNeBrEaKIt's not that they don't want to make their operations cleaner and more efficient, Baer said. It's just that they're not always sure the best way to go about it.LiNeBrEaKEnter Wave One, the initiative he launched in May to enlist banks, architects, real estate agents and other small firms in the fight against global warming. Instead of expecting each to find its own way toward saving energy, Baer's plan is to organize them into clusters that can all take the same measures at the same time.LiNeBrEaKBaer launched the project with a goal of getting 25 businesses per month to reduce their water and energy use, enroll in the Palo Alto Green program and become certified as green businesses. He has already hired three part-time staff members, teamed up with the Palo Alto-based environmental group Acterra to gain nonprofit status, and lined up some 75 business owners willing to participate.LiNeBrEaKThe interest has been so strong, he said, that the goal of 25 per month might end up being conservative.LiNeBrEaK"Right now there's the willingness of businesses, the good intentions of businesses, but when they decide to contact the city our the county or a nonprofit to help them, it's random access," he said. "That inevitably creates inefficiencies."LiNeBrEaKEliminate the randomness, however, and the process becomes smoother.LiNeBrEaK"If we're organizing the light auditors for 10 businesses on Emerson Street on the same day, or the replacement of 10 lights for businesses downtown, then it's efficient," Baer said.LiNeBrEaKPalo Alto insurance agent Jeri Fink was one of the first to sign up and has already had her business evaluated. She said the auditors' advice has shown her that becoming a green business doesn't have to be daunting or complicated.LiNeBrEaK"That's the biggest thing   is they're there to guide you," Fink said of Wave One. "Otherwise a lot of people won't make the effort."LiNeBrEaKMayor Larry Klein called Wave One an "exciting idea" that could be instrumental in helping the city meet its climate targets.LiNeBrEaK"We need things like that," he said. "We're not going to get anywhere in the fight against global warming without people participating in a lot of different ways. We can't just depend on the government."LiNeBrEaKIf it works in Palo Alto, Baer said, Wave One could become a model for cities nationwide. In fact, that's the genesis of the project's name.LiNeBrEaK"We view this as an intensified pilot program," he said. "We're just the first wave of a thousand waves. We have to have the business community organize itself to make this happen."LiNeBrEaKE-mail Will Oremus at woremus@dailynewsgroup.com	EMISSIONS (90%); SMALL BUSINESS (90%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (90%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); CITIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); MAYORS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); REAL ESTATE AGENTS (72%); REAL ESTATE (72%); CONSULTING SERVICES (71%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (70%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (69%); INSURANCE (67%)  				December 28, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	BIG LAND SALE WILL HELP SLAKE FLORIDA'S THIRST  	ERIC BUERMANN  	NATIONAL; Pg. 14A  	496 words  	America's Everglades received a vote of affirmation this month when the South Florida Water Management District Governing Board approved the purchase of more than 180,000 acres of agricultural land south of Lake Okeechobee. The land will be used to protect and restore one of the nation's most valuable treasures. LiNeBrEaKThe heart of Everglades restoration is water. Scientists have long recognized the need to capture vast quantities of rainfall, store it, treat it and deliver it to the natural system with the right timing, quantity, quality and distribution. Only then will the wildlife of the Everglades be sustained, critical drinking water sources replenished, coastal estuaries protected from lake discharges and abundant, clean water flow south into Florida Bay. This is especially critical for the long term, as we anticipate global climate changes and the associated sea level rise that will inevitably impact Florida's coastlines.LiNeBrEaKThis historic land acquisition provides the unprecedented opportunity to store and treat water on a scale never before envisioned. It is the single most important action to protect the Everglades since the designation of Everglades National Park 60 years ago, and it is a key moment in time. But make no mistake, Everglades restoration is about much more than wildlife and birds.LiNeBrEaKConsider what a healthy Everglades means to South Florida. The quality of life for 7. 5-million residents depends entirely on the water held in our natural system. We depend on it for drinking, recreation, agriculture, landscaping, well-field protection, boating, fishing and countless other components that contribute to a healthy economy and the Florida way of life. The 2006-2008 water shortage vividly reminded us how much we need adequate water storage to sustain our environment, our economy and our quality of life.LiNeBrEaKGov. Charlie Crist's vision to acquire this vast tract of land for Everglades restoration was a monumental step forward, and I applaud him for it. The approval of the largest land purchase in Florida's history was a milestone, but there remains a great deal of work ahead. In the coming months, we will work hard to finalize financing and complete our due diligence. Equally important, we will work closely with our partners - local communities, the Florida Legislature and our federal restoration partners - to assure that the resulting environmental project achieves our restoration goals, sustains regional agriculture and supports the local economy.LiNeBrEaKThe Everglades once covered almost 11,000 square miles of South Florida, but today this invaluable place is about half that size. Protecting what remains is essential to protecting South Florida's ability to thrive as a productive region of our state. The immense benefits of this acquisition and its lasting value to Florida are nearly beyond measure, and the acquisition cost is small in comparison.LiNeBrEaKEric Buermann is chairman of the South Florida Water Management District Governing Board.

Sudan Tribune  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 27, 2008 Saturday 	FEATURE: Travellers pay high fares on South Sudan's roads  	Philip Thon Aleu, Sudan Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	926 words  	Dec. 27--KOBOKO, Uganda -- (KOBOKO, Uganda) With a lot of dust generated from the dry season roads and smoke from burning forests, travelling in Southern Sudan is like another prison. Yet the main road southward through Jonglei, Central and Eastern Equatoria States cuts through a beautiful relief of virgin forest, hills and mountains--a part of Africa described as a hope of the world given the increasing threat of global warming.LiNeBrEaKUgandan bus managers dominate the business here, plying the roads ever more since peace came to Southern Sudan in 2005. LiNeBrEaKDuring holiday seasons fares increase extraordinarily, though normally they remain fairly constant despite fluctuating oil prices. Poor roads and high risks involved while trading in this region are some reasons that bus managers outlined when asked to explain abnormal differences in fares.LiNeBrEaKTHE JOURNEY SOUTHWARDLiNeBrEaKFor the cost of 50 SDG, a traveller can make the 3-4 hour journey from Bor to Juba along 190km of 50% upgraded road.LiNeBrEaKThe Bor-Juba road is a vast and sparsely inhabited area. The relief is flat till Mugala, from which one can see hills and a raised plateau.LiNeBrEaKLocal markets along the way serve travellers with the same items sold in the towns, including cold drinks and biscuits, as well as unique local products. As usual, children wave at passing buses with wide smiles while hunters and cattle keepers raise up their guns in greeting--a sign that disarmament has not taken full effect as the six month disarmament period elapses.LiNeBrEaKSouthern Sudanese villagers, whose social and economic living standards don't differ much from town dwellers, appear nevertheless more comfortable and happier. But settlers along the Bor-Juba road send their children to school elsewhere. A Mundari woman from Central Equatoria State said, "There are no schools here. You can take your child to Juba, Mugala or Sudan Safari (a Bor-Mundari co-shared school near Jameza)."LiNeBrEaKThe Mundari community remains in the same living conditions as witnessed by this reporter in the early 1990s while displaced there during the split within the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. Among the Mundari, asking villagers where health services are rendered is just trading a question for a question. "That drugs shop you mean?" a man replied.LiNeBrEaKHealth centres on the road from Bor to Nimule, which spans the three states of Jonglei, Central and Eastern Equatoria, have slight differences, but villagers summarized them as "poorly serviced." Nimule and Juba, however, have world-class hospitals accessible to town residents. Villages across the three states have nearly the same living conditions as each other.LiNeBrEaKFROM JUBA TO UGANDALiNeBrEaKNot far from Mugala is Southern Sudan's capital of Juba. A traveller from Juba to Nimule (about 180km) pays fifty Sudanese Pounds while from Juba to Kampala, a much longer distance of about 600km, one pays just ninety Sudanese Pounds.LiNeBrEaKAs buses cut through the thick forests south of Juba, they must stop at numerous checkpoints where bus managers pay to pass. The checkpoints, drivers say, back their argument for why travellers should pay high fares to avoid the bus companies losing money. Sudan Tribune established that these check points contribute to high fares.LiNeBrEaKThe road is hilly from Juba to Nimule on the Ugandan border. Careless drivers or faulty buses are commonly involved in accidents here, but construction of bridges is surging and by mid 2009, a great job is expected to be done. Indeed the autonomous Government of Southern Sudan will have a reason to brag on this service provided to a region marginalized by the Khartoum-based regime for centuries.LiNeBrEaKTelecommunication has greatly improved in recent months and only small areas have no telecommunication coverage. Boys grazing cattle can now inform fathers back home if a lion attacks his animals. Yet more common than wild invaders these days are the armed rustlers who raid cattle and kill owners should there be any resistance.LiNeBrEaKWhile living conditions remain fairly the same in both villages and towns in Southern Sudan, villagers trail behind in health and education sectors. Jonglei state, for example, has only a semi-modern hospital in the capital, Bor Town.LiNeBrEaKROAD CONSTRUCTION IS PRIORITYLiNeBrEaKIf the state government is to catch up shortly, road construction is the first priority, the Jonglei government has always argued.LiNeBrEaKBut for now, a traveller has nothing to love staying on this road for hours. The effort made by the Southern government to reconstruct the Juba-Bor road has been challenged by what the government calls "limited budget."LiNeBrEaKThe situation in Central Equatoria is quite better, probably due to the status of hosting the Southern Sudan Government and the policies of the State authorities. Schools here follow Uganda curriculum, a system the Jonglei governor hailed on African Child Day in Bor.LiNeBrEaKPrices of commodities, bus fares and low production in villages should be handled with care by GoSS, say observers, in order to make living in Southern Sudan better. As Ugandans and Kenyans travel upcountry to celebrate Christmas, some South Sudanese take the opposite journey and end up spending their end of the year in foreign cities.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday 	Going green: Good for the environment and the economy  		OPINION  	671 words  	Editor's note: The author represents California's 2nd Senate District, which includes Vallejo.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is experiencing its worst budget crisis in memory, if not in the history of the state, and Democrats in the capitol are working to find a solution -- a permanent one. That means spending cuts and revenue increases.LiNeBrEaKBut earlier this month, legislative Republicans released a set of demands they said would have to be met before they'd even discuss raising revenue -- hardly an appropriate way to negotiate a budget. LiNeBrEaKOne of their demands, in particular, stood out to me: That California delay implementation of our ground-breaking global warming law, AB 32, which was signed into law by Gov. Schwarzenegger in 2006.LiNeBrEaKSeeing as how only one Republican voted for AB 32 as it passed through the Legislature, it's no shock that they're now trying to delay this first-in-the-nation law. What is sad, however, is how out of touch their thinking is.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has led the country in pursuing new laws to address climate change and needs to lead the country in developing a 21st century economy. While my Republican colleagues insist that implementation of AB 32 will hurt the economy, several companies are busy proving them otherwise by looking and moving forward.LiNeBrEaKWith the imminent passage of a federal climate change law, numerous large businesses are working to mitigate global climate change by reducing their own emissions and impacts, while at the same time growing their companies.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the multi-national chemical giant Dupont has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 72 percent below 1990 levels -- not only better for the planet, it's also helped the company save more than $3 billion.LiNeBrEaKIn 2005, General Electric, the third largest company in the world, revealed its new business strategy: "Ecomagination." The plan was, and is, to develop and sell clean technologies that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce environmental impacts.LiNeBrEaKIt's not all about corporate social responsibility for the 128-year-old company, though.LiNeBrEaKWhen GE's C.E.O. says "green is green," he's also referring to the color of money. Profits from the "ecomagination" products have increased from $10 billion in 2005 to $18 billion in 2008.LiNeBrEaKEven Wal-Mart is on board, promoting compact fluorescent light bulbs, requiring suppliers to reduce packaging, and installing solar panels on the roofs of some its stores. Again, this may appear to be a marketing strategy, but in the end, it improves the bottom line while reducing emissions -- good for the economy and good for the environment.LiNeBrEaKIn the past month, we watched as the three major American car companies appeared before Congress requesting a bailout at the expense of the taxpayers. I do not wish to see the automakers fail, per se, in part because of the devastating impact that their collapse would have on countless working families as well as the overall economy.LiNeBrEaKNor should we believe the rhetorical tirades of Congressional Republicans who have tried to pin much of the blame on the workers and their labor unions.LiNeBrEaKIt's important to recognize that the primary reason that the Big Three slid toward financial failure because they lacked the foresight to innovate and to lead the way toward development of new technologies that could have improved their products and improved their bottom line.

Vallejo Times Herald (California) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday 	What are they looking at?  		LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	454 words  	I feel compelled to write something here about your persistent use of including the real loonies on the right on your opinion page.LiNeBrEaKLook, these people have no credibility. What's his name, William Rusher, shows up now and then, saying "whatever happened to that ozone hole" (defending no need for government regulation -- hey, Sparky, it closed because that bad old government restricted the use of CFC's ). LiNeBrEaKI'm just wondering, why do you do this? Do you feel you are striking a sort of balance between "left" and "right"? Look, climate change is not a left-right issue. It's only a political issue on the right side of the spectrum. The left is just arguing over solutions.LiNeBrEaKLet's look at this guy you chose to feature on your opinion page recently: Deroy Murdock is a libertarian conservative (think Andrew Sullivan). He still believes that Saddam Hussein was materially involved with al-Qaida and the 9/11 attacks. He calls the use of torture by our "employees" -- that is, our military, our CIA, our FBI, ( and who knows who else) -- "something of which every American should be proud."LiNeBrEaKSo, with those credentials, he can proclaim global cooling? Let's look at the people he cites. Here we have Sallie Baliunas, who in 2001 stated that the scientific evidence clearly indicates that "... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years." This is a false statement (Google "satellite temperature record"). She later acknowledged this, but somehow tries to defend her position by simply stating that this was not the result of man-made CO2 emissions. In a later paper, attempting to further her concept that solar activity is the driving force behind climate variations here on Earth, she referenced various fellow scientists -- 13 of those sited strongly objected to her interpretation of their work. Is this a "scientist" you can believe in?LiNeBrEaKOK, what about all those German guys he sites? I have no idea. Maybe they prove everything this guy is saying. (Like, it's really cold right now, so global warming is a fiction). But then he sites Piers Corbyn. This person runs a betting site that bets on weather. His track record on those weather bets? Not so good. You can look it up.LiNeBrEaKThe common theme here is the idea that global warming is a myth, that the sun is the major influence and, obviously, we here cannot do anything about it. So, let's all be burning coal and continue driving SUV's at 5 mpg.LiNeBrEaKI must admit that I am absolutely baffled why people on the right continue to challenge the global warming picture. Or, for that matter, science in general.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		December 27, 2008 Saturday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	How to avert the looming power crisis How to avert the looming power crisis  	GLENN ENGLISH  	LOCAL; Pg. B7  	645 words  	By GLENN ENGLISH AND JACKSON E. REASOR JR.LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- The lights might go out in Virginia in two years. As a Washington Post editorial this fall and other reports have noted, blackouts are likely in the commonwealth by 2011 because demand for electricity is outstripping supply and the state needs access to new sources of power.LiNeBrEaKSadly, Virginia's predicament can be seen around the country. The United States faces an energy crisis: More power generation and more transmission lines are needed, and all this must be created quickly while also meeting climate change goals. LiNeBrEaKOver the past few months, officials from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association have met with representatives from the 900 cooperative electric utilities that supply power to 40 million people in 47 states. A common theme has emerged: Our political leaders must develop a national energy policy that funds development of new technologies to keep electricity affordable while meeting climate change goals. Otherwise, a growing number of Americans won't be able to pay for power, and many will be at risk of rolling blackouts and brownouts.LiNeBrEaKIn the past five years, utility bills have risen 30 percent, largely because of the rising cost of fuel, mainly coal and natural gas. The country's leading consumer organizations, including the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, recently wrote to President-elect Barack Obama, calling on him "to devote as much attention to the affordability of electricity as has been devoted to gasoline."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2030, demand for electricity will be 30 percent higher, the equivalent of adding four Californias to the power grid.LiNeBrEaKIn some regions, demand will soon outstrip supply. The North America Electric Reliability Corp., which oversees the reliability of the U.S. electric power grid, projects that the desert Southwest will be at risk for blackouts in 2010 because of a shortage of power generation capacity. An Agriculture Department report this year on rural electric power generation found that "brownouts are probable unless investment in transmission is increased and simultaneously, energy efficiency efforts and demand side management must be intensified."LiNeBrEaKSo what should Obama do to meet both our nation's growing demand for electricity and our climate change goals? The next administration should study the energy blueprint promoted by executives at cooperative electric utilities from around the country:LiNeBrEaK\n The government should expand initiatives that boost efficiency at the consumer level, such as the Energy Department's Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps consumers defray the cost of adding insulation, efficient windows, Energy Star appliances, and heating and cooling systems.LiNeBrEaK\n Government policies should encourage the construction of new power lines so that wind power produced in rural areas can be dispatched to cities where it is most needed.LiNeBrEaK\n Government must pare the red tape associated with building nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaK\n For real long-term progress, our leaders must invest in research so that we can find a way to capture and permanently store carbon emitted by coal-fired power plants. If we can pull off that feat, we could optimize our most plentiful fuel resource without increasing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKCongress and President-elect Obama face a historic opportunity to tame our growing energy crisis. If they don't act, the lights will go out.LiNeBrEaKGlenn English, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma, is chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. Jackson E. Reasor Jr. is chief executive of Old Dominion Electric Cooperative -- which wants to build a new coal-fired plant in Surry County -- and Virginia, Maryland and Delaware Association of Electric Cooperatives.

The Washington Post 		December 27, 2008 Saturday   Regional Edition	Protections in Peril;  A midnight attack on the Endangered Species Act, courtesy of the Interior Department 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A14  	505 words  	THE BUSH administration had the good sense to stop trying to push through last-minute regulations that would have made it easier to build coal-fired plants and other polluting facilities near national parks. It was wise to hold off on changing "new source review" rules that govern when power plants must add pollution-reduction equipment. But it couldn't leave well enough alone when it issued regulations that essentially gut the Endangered Species Act. Because the rule will take effect before Barack Obama assumes the presidency, he's stuck with it. But relief could come by way of the courts. LiNeBrEaKThis so-called midnight regulation, despite White House chief of staff Joshua B. Bolten's directive against such a move, is brought to you by the Interior Department.  In May, it listed the polar bear as "threatened" under the Endangered Species Act because global warming is shrinking Arctic sea ice. The law was never intended to make up for President Bush's inaction on climate change. But Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne's attempt to protect the polar bear without taking on the larger task of regulating carbon emissions eviscerates the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKSection 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act says that "Each Federal agency, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary, shall insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat. . . ." Where Mr. Kempthorne got it right is in preventing the effects of "global processes" (climate change) from triggering consultation "because of the inability to separate out the effect of a specific Federal action from a multitude of other factors that contribute through global processes." But Mr. Kempthorne went further by reinterpreting the statute to mean that agencies do not have to consult the Fish and Wildlife Service (or any other service) for actions that may affect any species, not just polar bears.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, the give-and-take of the consultation process produces compromises that allow projects to go forward while minimizing the harm to protected species. But Interior's new rule eliminates that vital check on the ambitions of agencies that want to complete projects. Such a check will become increasingly important as President-elect Obama and Congress move to make infrastructure repair and revitalization (roads, high-speed rail, wind farms, etc.) an essential part of an economic stimulus plan.LiNeBrEaKA balance must be struck between that plan and protecting species and the environment. No doubt environmental groups will sue to stop the regulation. By settling out of court on terms that are favorable to the plaintiff and that match the new president's philosophy, Interior Secretary-designate Ken Salazar and the Obama administration could nullify Mr. Kempthorne's ill-advised rule much faster than by undertaking the long process of issuing new regulations.

The Boston Globe 		December 26, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Going with climate's flow Environmentalists shift approach, planning to adapt to nature's changes  	Carolyn Y. Johnson Globe Staff  	METRO; Pg. A1  	1027 words  	Environmental advocates, wildlife officials, and land trusts charged with protecting the natural world are beginning to take a new approach to climate change: Rather than focus only on stopping it, they are also thinking about how to adapt to what's coming.LiNeBrEaKThat may mean accepting that certain northern species - such as moose or loon - may not be part of Massachusetts' future ecology. More immediately, it means restoring bogs that could help prevent flooding, or serve as a fallback position for wildlife if sea levels rise - and tearing down dams to give fish access to cooler waters. Both such efforts are underway.  LiNeBrEaK"The old model is - let's protect a certain species or natural community; let's protect this habitat for box turtle or for maple forest," said Andy Finton, director of conservation science at The Nature Conservancy. "We've got to be more flexible in our thinking, because we can't necessarily nail down all the species. ... In a way, we're protecting the stage, while the actors may change over time."LiNeBrEaKThis shift in approach comes as President-elect Barack Obama recently announced his environmental team, calling global warming an urgent issue.LiNeBrEaKLocally, environmentalists and state officials are trying to anticipate the effects of climate change: from whether the spruce and fir trees atop Mount Greylock will turn into northern hardwood forests, to the fate of the region's vernal pools, home to salamanders.LiNeBrEaKThe Nature Conservancy, an environmental organization, recently completed the purchase of a freshwater marsh and a tidal marsh around the Kennebec Estuary in Maine. If sea levels rise, the freshwater marsh could transform into a tidal marsh, and the tidal marsh into mudflats.LiNeBrEaK"We're now looking at the entire estuary as a potential pilot site, where we're going to start doing the measurements and the research to tell us whether in fact these ecosystems do migrate," said Bruce Kidman, spokesman for the Conservancy in Maine. "Given the rise in sea level, will they do what we believe they do?"LiNeBrEaKThe state is focusing on creating tracts of unbroken wild space that provide a large, resilient habitat for species to weather climate change.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the state was a partner a year ago in the acquisition of 240 acres in the town of Webster, helping to create a connected landscape of 8,000 acres of conservation land, straddling the Massachusetts-Rhode Island border.LiNeBrEaKIn Hanson and Halifax, state environmental officials are restoring a cranberry bog, creating a more natural wetlands at Burrage Pond. The idea is that the wetlands will soak up water, helping to prevent flooding - and also act as a refuge for wildlife driven inland if coastal wetlands are submerged as sea level rises.LiNeBrEaKElsewhere in Southeastern Massachusetts, state officials are partners in removing dams from Red Brook, in part so that salter brook trout will be able to find a cool habitat if the rest of the stream warms.LiNeBrEaK"It's pretty clear that what we've traditionally thought of as natural communities in Massachusetts, because of these warming temperatures, are probably going to change," said Mary Griffin, commissioner of the state department of fish and game. "As a department, we're thinking there are a number of actions we can take today in everything we do ... we will use the climate change science as a factor in a lot of the things we do day to day," from land acquisition to habitat management.LiNeBrEaKNext year, the state plans to factor in climate change in making land acquisitions. Last month, environmental leaders from across the state came together at a first of its kind conference to discuss how to cope with the predicted effects on flora and fauna.LiNeBrEaKA year ago, the New England Wild Flower Society called for a "new paradigm," in which "plant community concepts will likely need revision." The society, for example, will continue "banking" seeds from native plants, but with the knowledge that those seeds may not be natives of Massachusetts in 50 or 100 years.LiNeBrEaK"The interesting question will be, as plants move up from south that aren't considered native in New England, how do we look at those - at what point do they consider those native plants?" said Bill Brumback, conservation director of the Society.LiNeBrEaKHector Galbraith, director of the climate change initiative at the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences, is working with a panel of specialists to rank the vulnerability of habitat around the state to climate change. Considered at risk of being eliminated over the coming decades are spruce-fir forest, boreal swamp, and cold water lakes and ponds. LiNeBrEaKKnowing the vulnerability of different habitat types is critical, he said, because it can help guide land acquisitions and allow the state to better make management decisions. The organization is developing a planning tool - based on historical and projected rates of climate change in the state, along with other stressors - that could give conservation officials a smarter way to decide how to invest limited resources.LiNeBrEaKWhile integrating climate change into current planning is relatively new, advocates noted that it was a critical time to rethink environmental strategies.LiNeBrEaK"I think the traditional conservation approach has embraced a sort of static view of the world, and that climate change is emphasizing the need for every one of us landowners to accept that change is going to happen," said Lisa Vernegaard, director of planning and stewardship at The Trustees of Reservations. "We could sit and wring our hands as change happens, but it would be just that - wringing our hands."LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR:LiNeBrEaKREMOVING DAMSLiNeBrEaKState officials eliminated a barrier at Red Brook in Southeastern Massachusetts this year, giving fish that seek out cooler water a better chance of survival if the water warms.LiNeBrEaKPROTECTING WILDLIFELiNeBrEaKMarbled salamanders depend on vernal pools to maintain their populations over time, but the bogs and wetlands where they live are predicted to experience more frequent dry periods.LiNeBrEaKBUILDING A BUFFERLiNeBrEaKThe Nature Conservancy has acquired marshes around the Kennebec Estuary in Maine as protection against an anticipated rise in sea level.

Will President-elect Barack Obama chart a new foreign policy in the Middle East that will restore America's moral stature in the world, or will he succumb to the demands of the Israel lobby as previous administrations have done?LiNeBrEaKPrevious U.S. negotiators involved in the Israeli-Palestinian peace processes were mostly Jewish, with strong ties to Israel; some even had Israeli citizenship.

LiNeBrEaKIsrael has convinced our government that the Palestinian conflict is an internal Israeli problem and it obstructs the participation of the international community.LiNeBrEaKWe allow Israel to impose collective punishment on the Palestinians, a crime against humanity, disregarding international law and human rights conventions, as if Israel were above the law.LiNeBrEaKObama must tell the Israelis to stop building illegal settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories, and if they do not, cut U.S. aid to Israel.LiNeBrEaKWe support an illegal oppressive occupation and wonder why the people of the Middle East hate us.

But, long into the future, we will all be feeling the negative effects of these cuts.LiNeBrEaKDeborah Freedman LustigLiNeBrEaKWalnut CreekLiNeBrEaKSub desalinationLiNeBrEaKIt surprises me that there aren't more stories about converting salt water to fresh water for our state's water needs.LiNeBrEaKI worked at Mare Island Naval Shipyard for years and each nuclear submarine had the capability to convert salt water to fresh water for its entire crew. When the Navy started scrapping those submarines, I thought the state or perhaps a county or city would try to snap up those systems and possibly expand on them for their own use.LiNeBrEaKThe Navy has perfected the technology for their crews and our state would do well to look to that technology for the future needs of our residents. It will also preserve our natural fresh water resources for the wildlife we are endangering by draining our rivers and lakes. We're going to need to do this eventually and the sooner we do it, the less expensive it will be for all of us.LiNeBrEaKMark HutchingsLiNeBrEaKConcordLiNeBrEaKWho's responsible?LiNeBrEaKThere have been several recent articles on the county's budget crisis and its tragic impact on badly needed mental health, social services and foster care programs.LiNeBrEaKThis crisis can be largely traced to overly generous pension benefits that the Board of Supervisors gave county employees several years ago. At that time, the Times and the civil grand jury repeatedly warned the supervisors of this folly and the impact it would have.LiNeBrEaKThe supervisor most responsible is Mark DeSaulnier who has moved on to state Senate leaving the current Board to clean up his fiscal mess. In the past, the Times heavily criticized him on this issue yet endorsed him in the last election. This makes no sense.LiNeBrEaKEarl W. RuppLiNeBrEaKPleasant HillLiNeBrEaKReport abuseLiNeBrEaKI keep waiting to read about the outrage over the children whose grotesque abuse has been in our headlines.LiNeBrEaKOne girl was tortured and murdered by her foster mother/aunt in Antioch; her brother was tortured but escaped death. LiNeBrEaKA Tracy boy's guardian beat and tortured him with the complicity of two adults. I have seen no public reaction other than the desire to get all of the horrid details of those incidents of unimaginable child abuse.LiNeBrEaKThese events did not happen in some backwoods cabin or remote rural area. They happened in our suburbs. All of us need to pay attention. If we suspect a child is being mistreated, we must speak up.LiNeBrEaKI don't understand how a child can simply "not show up" at school or in the neighborhood and not be missed. How can children with blatant signs of abuse and neglect not be noticed or heard when their torturers set upon them?LiNeBrEaKOf course, the officials responsible for these children needed to do their jobs, but we as a society must also watch out for one another. Maybe we need protests in the streets for the cause of children   of any age   to be protected from abuse.LiNeBrEaKCarol GonsalvesLiNeBrEaKBenicia	LETTERS and COMMENTS (94%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); ELECTIONS (78%); BLAGOJEVICH CORRUPTION SCANDAL (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); JEWS and JUDAISM (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (78%); PEACE PROCESS (77%); HUMAN RIGHTS (74%); RELIGION (71%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (70%); MULTILINGUALISM (69%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (69%); FRAUD and FINANCIAL CRIME (69%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); FOSTER CARE (63%); CARBON OFFSETS (62%); BUDGET (60%); CHILDREN (60%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICTS (90%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (66%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN MCCAIN (54%); AL FRANKEN (52%); AL GORE (52%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (93%); CHICAGO, IL, USA (54%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); MINNESOTA, USA (79%); ILLINOIS, USA (79%) ISRAEL (99%); PALESTINIAN TERRITORY (94%); MIDDLE EAST (93%); UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved

We're going to need to do this eventually and the sooner we do it, the less expensive it will be for all of us.LiNeBrEaKMark HutchingsLiNeBrEaKConcordLiNeBrEaKWho's responsible?LiNeBrEaKThere have been several recent articles on the county's budget crisis and its tragic impact on badly needed mental health, social services and foster care programs.LiNeBrEaKThis crisis can be largely traced to overly generous pension benefits that the Board of Supervisors gave county employees several years ago. At that time, the Times and the civil grand jury repeatedly warned the supervisors of this folly and the impact it would have.LiNeBrEaKThe supervisor most responsible is Mark DeSaulnier who has moved on to state Senate leaving the current Board to clean up his fiscal mess. In the past, the Times heavily criticized him on this issue yet endorsed him in the last election. This makes no sense.LiNeBrEaKEarl W. RuppLiNeBrEaKPleasant HillLiNeBrEaKReport abuseLiNeBrEaKI keep waiting to read about the outrage over the children whose grotesque abuse has been in our headlines.LiNeBrEaKOne girl was tortured and murdered by her foster mother/aunt in Antioch; her brother was tortured but escaped death. LiNeBrEaKA Tracy boy's guardian beat and tortured him with the complicity of two adults. I have seen no public reaction other than the desire to get all of the horrid details of those incidents of unimaginable child abuse.LiNeBrEaKThese events did not happen in some backwoods cabin or remote rural area. They happened in our suburbs. All of us need to pay attention. If we suspect a child is being mistreated, we must speak up.LiNeBrEaKI don't understand how a child can simply "not show up" at school or in the neighborhood and not be missed. How can children with blatant signs of abuse and neglect not be noticed or heard when their torturers set upon them?LiNeBrEaKOf course, the officials responsible for these children needed to do their jobs, but we as a society must also watch out for one another. Maybe we need protests in the streets for the cause of children   of any age   to be protected from abuse.LiNeBrEaKCarol GonsalvesLiNeBrEaKBenicia	LETTERS and COMMENTS (94%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); ELECTIONS (78%); BLAGOJEVICH CORRUPTION SCANDAL (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (78%); JEWS and JUDAISM (78%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (78%); PEACE PROCESS (77%); HUMAN RIGHTS (74%); RELIGION (71%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (70%); MULTILINGUALISM (69%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (69%); FRAUD and FINANCIAL CRIME (69%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); FOSTER CARE (63%); CARBON OFFSETS (62%); BUDGET (60%); CHILDREN (60%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICTS (90%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (66%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN MCCAIN (54%); AL FRANKEN (52%); AL GORE (52%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (93%); CHICAGO, IL, USA (54%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); MINNESOTA, USA (79%); ILLINOIS, USA (79%) ISRAEL (99%); PALESTINIAN TERRITORY (94%); MIDDLE EAST (93%); UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved

The German automaker figured its Mini, which gets 37 miles per gallon from its gasoline engine, would be a perfect platform for the experiment, she said.LiNeBrEaKMore than 10,000 "hand-raisers" have expressed interest in the vehicle, she said, and since BMW began taking online applications in November, more than 1,800 have applied to lease it. The deadline was Dec. 24, and the automaker will make decisions early in 2009.LiNeBrEaKMost Mini E drivers will be able to travel 110 to 120 miles on a single charge, the company says. Due to the large battery pack consuming back-seat room, the Mini E become a two-seater.LiNeBrEaKAfter a year of feedback, BMW will take back the Mini Es and decide whether to move to mass production of electric Minis or BMWs.LiNeBrEaKWhatever BMW decides, AC Propulsion will continue with another project, making its eBox.

At least, the worst I've seen in my 52 years. We all had our personal struggles, so I won't bore you with mine. Just trust that my year was in line with our country's. With our world's.LiNeBrEaKIf 2008 was a fight, we'd be losing. Badly. We've been absorbing shot after shot. Real estate values plummet. Bam! Gas prices soar. Bam! Business bailouts. Bam!

It's life.LiNeBrEaKUltimately, history will determine if 2008 was the inspiration for unprecedented progress or the commencement of unavoidable regression.LiNeBrEaKI'm betting on the former. If we're any good   and for 232 years we've been darn good   we'll battle our way out of this. Better days are on their way.LiNeBrEaKA lesson in perspective is necessary. For all the obvious reasons, it's the worst of times. For reasons that only the insightful will understand, it's the best of times.LiNeBrEaKOne of life's mysterious paradoxes is that neither good nor bad times last. Which is why happy times can be sad. When we're on top of the world, we better recognize it. We better appreciate it. We better enjoy it. Because the glory days are fleeting.LiNeBrEaKConversely, because it can motivate us to change and advance, bad can be good. Correction: Very bad can be good. If it's only bad, people won't change. It has to be dreadful, and 2008 was.LiNeBrEaKPearls are created after an oyster's shell has been invaded by parasites. When parasites invade us, as so many of them are doing now, we have an extraordinary opportunity to produce pearls.LiNeBrEaKWhat doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and we're far from dead.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 26, 2008 Friday 	Electric cars coming soon to a road near you  	By Matt Nauman MeDIANEWS STAFF  	BUSINESS  	1042 words  	Tom Gage is a patient man. As chief executive of AC Propulsion, he's watched the ebb and flow of electric-car momentum for more than a decade.LiNeBrEaKThere was California Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, and Chris Paine's documentary, "Who Killed the Electric Car?" There were electrics from General Motors, Honda, Toyota and others, and then they mostly disappeared.LiNeBrEaKNow, with fresh concerns about global warming and everyone from Silicon Valley's Tesla Motors to big automakers like GM and Toyota talking about the electrification of automobiles, Gage, who lives in Sunnyvale, is optimistic. LiNeBrEaKAC Propulsion, which is based in San Dimas, in Southern California, inked a huge deal with BMW this year to produce lithium-ion battery packs and powertrains for 450 Mini Coopers, BMW's small car brand. Those vehicles, to be called the Mini E, will be leased for 12 months to people who live in or near New York City and Los Angeles in early 2009.LiNeBrEaK"This is a big step for electric vehicles," Gage said.LiNeBrEaKThe cars will rent for $850 a month.LiNeBrEaKFor BMW, the Mini E represents a chance to get real-world experience with electric vehicles, said spokeswoman Nathalie Bauters of Mini USA. The German automaker figured its Mini, which gets 37 miles per gallon from its gasoline engine, would be a perfect platform for the experiment, she said.LiNeBrEaKMore than 10,000 "hand-raisers" have expressed interest in the vehicle, she said, and since BMW began taking online applications in November, more than 1,800 have applied to lease it. The deadline was Dec. 24, and the automaker will make decisions early in 2009.LiNeBrEaKMost Mini E drivers will be able to travel 110 to 120 miles on a single charge, the company says. Due to the large battery pack consuming back-seat room, the Mini E become a two-seater.LiNeBrEaKAfter a year of feedback, BMW will take back the Mini Es and decide whether to move to mass production of electric Minis or BMWs.LiNeBrEaKWhatever BMW decides, AC Propulsion will continue with another project, making its eBox. That car is a converted Scion xB with the engine and gas tank removed and batteries and a electric motors installed.LiNeBrEaKThe conversion costs $55,000, which might explain why only 12 have been made so far. (Buyers also have to buy a gasoline Scion xB, which costs $14,000 to $15,000.)LiNeBrEaKStill, owners have been very happy, Gage said. Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks owns one, and drives it frequently, getting more than 100 miles per charge, according to an interview on Current TV. Other eBoxes are operating in France, Florida and British Columbia, and are being used and tested by the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto and the University of Delaware.LiNeBrEaKVantagePoint Venture Partners in San Bruno has funded both Tesla and Better Place, a Palo Alto company with plans to build electric-vehicle charging ports around the world. Alan Salzman, the firm's managing director, predicts 2009 will be a big year for electric cars.LiNeBrEaK"The ball that got seriously bouncing courtesy of Tesla is going to bounce higher in 2009," Salzman said, forecasting that several major car companies would announce "real, near-term plans to produce pure electric cars in volume."LiNeBrEaKGage believes that every auto company will produce an electric car by the middle of next decade. "Electricity gives you transportation without petroleum," he said. "In my view, it's going to happen. It has to happen."LiNeBrEaKContact Matt Nauman at 408-920-5701 or at mnauman@mercurynews.com.Infobox1LiNeBrEaKWhat: Electric cars use battery packs, electric motors and sophisticated software to travel while emitting no pollution.LiNeBrEaKWhy now: The electrification of vehicles, whether pure electrics or plug-in hybrids, has gained traction as the world tries to move away from gasoline cars.LiNeBrEaKMajor players: Tesla, Fisker, AC Propulsion, General Motors, Toyota, Renault-Nissan, Chrysler, BMW/Mini. Plus battery suppliers, and Palo Alto's Better Place, which is building an electric-car infrastructure in Israel, Hawaii, the Bay Area and elsewhere.LiNeBrEaKChallenges: Batteries still need improved performance, increased supply and lower prices.

Duluth News-Tribune (Minnesota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 26, 2008 Friday 	Early ice cover bucks trends  	John Myers, Duluth News Tribune, Minn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	319 words  	Dec. 26--The trend for nearly 30 years has been less ice cover on the big lake, with water temperatures rising. A UMD study found the lake's temperature has risen 4. 9 degrees since 1979, about twice as fast as the rise in air temperatures in our area. LiNeBrEaKThe Lake Superior water-temperature increase has been cited as one of the most pronounced examples of global warming anywhere on the planet.LiNeBrEaKAnother study of ice-cover data for Lake Superior between Bayfield and Madeline Island by Bayfield's Forrest Howk shows that there are now, on average, 45 fewer ice-covered days each winter than in 1857. Howk found that thick ice coverage has been declining by a full day every three years over the 150-year period.LiNeBrEaKThe trend has been even faster over the past 25 years, with ice declining by one day every year. Computer plots show, if the pattern holds, there will be no days of heavy ice cover between Madeline Island and Bayfield by about 2037.LiNeBrEaKThe National Ice Center in Washington, D.C., tracks how much ice covers the Great Lakes but relies on satellite imagery that has proven sketchy in recent years. Steam rising from open water can be seen as ice, for example. The center has proclaimed Lake Superior frozen over in the past when vast amounts of open water were visible from Duluth, such as in March 2003.LiNeBrEaKOfficially, according to the Great Lakes Aquarium, the lake entirely froze over most recently in 1979 and 1962, but it came very close to 100 percent ice-covered in 1996, 1994 and 1972.

Grand Forks Herald (North Dakota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 26, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Hooray for N.D. population growth  	Grand Forks Herald, N.D.  	COMMENTARY  	639 words  	Dec. 26--If you look out your window, you'll see one of the great things about life in North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota: blowing snow and intense cold. Living here means being forced to pay attention to the basics of staying warm, finding shelter, securing food and helping neighbors in need.LiNeBrEaKLiving close to the elements helps residents appreciate the fundamentals, in other words. LiNeBrEaKNot coincidentally, here's a fundamental that North Dakotans not only appreciate but also celebrate:LiNeBrEaKPeople are a good thing.LiNeBrEaKWhen residents look out across the state's wind-swept and unforgiving landscape, that basic truth of human existence becomes clear.LiNeBrEaKPeople are a good thing. Specifically, more people are a good thing. They are net additions, not subtractions, to our society out here on the always-challenging Great Plains. And they are more than welcome.LiNeBrEaKThis thought came to mind (as it always does) while reading the upbeat news coverage of North Dakota's population trends. The state's population is up again, a Forum Communications story reported earlier this week.LiNeBrEaKThe increase of 3,577 people or just more than half a percent since the 2007 estimate is "obviously good news," said Rod Backman, chairman of North Dakota's Census Committee, in the story.LiNeBrEaKAnd he's not the only one. In fact, it's safe to say that a supermajority of North Dakotans consider a growing population to be a fine or even terrific thing, given that population growth has been an issue in every election for governor in years.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans and Democrats in Bismarck disagree on plenty of things. But they're unanimous on this: The more North Dakotans there are, the better off we'll be because people are so obviously an asset -- and the shortage of them is so clearly a drain.LiNeBrEaKIn this, North Dakota was ahead of the game, but the rest of the developed world is catching up. North Dakota's population peaked in the 1930s and then started its decadeslong decline. By the late 1950s, the depressing centrality of "depopulation" was clear, so much so that Elwyn Robinson identified it as one of the core themes of North Dakota history -- the famous "Too Much Mistake."LiNeBrEaKMore recently, Russia, Japan and much of Europe also have entered eras of demographic decline. The trends are so unutterably grim that France, among other countries, has taken drastic action to boost the national birth rate.LiNeBrEaKFrance, for example, now offers three years of paid parental leave, universal preschool for 3-year-olds and older, stipends for in-home nannies and other incentives, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports.LiNeBrEaKEven Europe -- crowded Europe, eavily developed, resource-intensive, climate-change-LiNeBrEaKconscious Europe -- recognizes that population growth is a net blessing, not a curse. That's a welcome and realistic view.LiNeBrEaK"What is the role of population size and growth in the astonishing advance of human know-how?" wrote economist Julian Simon in his book, "The Ultimate Resource II."LiNeBrEaK"The source of these improvements in productivity is the human mind .??.. And because improvements -- their invention and their adoption -- come from people, the amount of improvement plainly depends on the number of people available to use their minds."LiNeBrEaKSimon wrote "The Ultimate Resource" in 1981 and revised it in 1996. But he might as well have written it in North Dakota in 2008 because he captured the celebratory attitude of most North Dakotans toward population growth in the state.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Man-made global warming?;  The Public Pulse 		EDITORIAL; Pg. A8  	192 words  	Believers in man-made global warming have not convinced me that the current cold snowy weather stretching from coast to coast is caused by man-made global warming. I would like to hear "climate experts" explain the following. LiNeBrEaKIn 1794, British explorer, Captain George Vancouver, while charting the coast of what is now Alaska, discovered a huge wall of ice, a glacier, blocking the mouth of a bay in a place he called "Icy Strait."LiNeBrEaKEighty-five years later in 1879, American naturalist John Muir came to Alaska looking for the huge wall of ice described by Vancouver. Arriving at "Icy Strait", Muir found only open water. Determined to find the huge wall of ice, Muir traveled 50 miles into the bay, now known as Glacier Bay, before he found Vancouver's wall of ice. The glacier had melted back a total of 50 miles during the previous 85 years.LiNeBrEaKI wonder how the "man-made climate change" believers would explain the global warming necessary to melt the glacier? Might the melting of the glacier be the result of a naturally occurring climate fluctuation or would they blame the melting on the Eskimos for having too many smoky fires?LiNeBrEaKDANIEL K.

The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Tennessee)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 26, 2008 Friday 	Oak Ridge National Laboratory installs new Cray supercomputer  	Frank Munger, The Knoxville News Sentinel, Tenn.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	478 words  	Dec. 26--OAK RIDGE -- Installation of another Cray XT5 supercomputer was completed in mid-December, further bolstering Oak Ridge National Laboratory's claim as a world-leading center for scientific computing. LiNeBrEaKThe new system -- nicknamed Kraken, after a mythical sea monster -- should be ready for research in early 2009, according to lab officials.LiNeBrEaK"It is assembled and powered on, but not available to users," Buddy Bland, a project leader at ORNL, said recently.LiNeBrEaKIn its initial phase, Kraken will have a peak capability of more than 600 teraflops (600 trillion calculations per second). It will be upgraded about a year from now to achieve a peak of about 1 petaflops (or 1,000 trillion calculations per second).LiNeBrEaKKraken is housed at ORNL as a result of a $65 million grant won by a University of Tennessee-led team (that included ORNL) in a competition sponsored by the National Science Foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe new supercomputer was installed adjacent to an even bigger Cray XT5 system, known as Jaguar, which is currently the second-fastest computer in the world and the fastest for scientific uses.LiNeBrEaKJaguar has a peak computing capability of 1. 6 quadrillion calculations per second and -- after going through final acceptance testing in late December -- should be available for a demanding research load in 2009. The Oak Ridge supercomputer is the Department of Energy's workhorse for its INCITE (Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment) research program.LiNeBrEaKDOE recently allocated 470 million processor hours on Jaguar for high-priority science projects in 2009, including unprecedented models of global climate change. The workload is more than half of the computer time allocated for the entire DOE program.LiNeBrEaKThomas Zacharia, ORNL's scientific computing chief, is also the University of Tennessee's vice president for science and technology. He headed the proposal teams that were responsible for building the high-performance supercomputers to the lab's National Center for Computational Sciences.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview earlier this year, Zacharia talked about plans for having two petascale computers available at the lab. Jaguar should be the world's best computer for open scientific users, and Kraken should be the top machine dedicated to academic users, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe two Cray supercomputers could be hooked together and operated as one if there are special projects that require their combined computing power, Zacharia said.

The Marin Independent Journal (Novato, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 26, 2008 Friday 	Marin environment projects to benefit from $5 million federal grant  	Mark Prado, The Marin Independent Journal, Novato, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	539 words  	Dec. 26--A Bahia wetlands restoration project in Novato and Corte Madera Creek watershed work are beneficiaries of a $5 million grant announced this week.LiNeBrEaKThe grant, to the Association of Bay Area Governments' San Francisco Estuary Project, was awarded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. LiNeBrEaK"Working with various local and private organizations, theire capabilities will ensure these funds address environmental needs throughout the Bay Area," said Alexis Strauss, water division director for EPA's Pacific Southwest region.LiNeBrEaKThe money will go to a variety of Bay Area projects, including the Bahia restoration and revegetation project. The work will occur in a seasonal tidal marsh at the larger Bahia Marsh in Novato over a three-year period.LiNeBrEaKThe work will focus on growing and planting almost 41,000 native plants to help existing wetlands function more naturally. The plants also will provide better habitat for the federally listed endangered California clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse, as well as other fauna.LiNeBrEaKIn the lower Corte Madera Creek area, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission will use the money to study the effects of rising sea level and the impact of local sediment on wetlands restoration.LiNeBrEaKAmong the activities will be to measure wind and waves at the Corte Madera Marsh, examine flood scenarios if sea level does rise and develop ways to combat inundation.LiNeBrEaKAnother portion of the money will be used for work along Corte Madera Creek.LiNeBrEaKThere the Berkeley-based Urban Creek Council will work with private landowners to develop plans to improve banks and lessen soil disturbance to improve habitat for salmon and general water clarity.LiNeBrEaKWork on the projects could start in the early part of 2009, officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe Association of Bay Area Governments project has worked to improve the health of the bay via the estuary project for the past 18 years.LiNeBrEaKIn 1987, Congress officially designated the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary as an "estuary of national significance," creating the estuary project. A federal, state and local partnership, the San Francisco Estuary project is one of 28 such programs throughout the country established under the federal Clean Water Act.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA funds the Bay Area project with $600,000 annually. The grant goes above and beyond that standard funding.LiNeBrEaK"This grant is a great boon to the bay," said Judy Kelly, the Bay Area estuary project's director. "Through the projects in this grant, we expect to improve the health of the bay and make it more resilient to our changing climate -- including sea level rise and more severe storm events. We'll also be doing extensive outreach to engage the public in our restoration efforts."LiNeBrEaKContact Mark Prado via e-mail at mprado@marinij.comLiNeBrEaKRead more Novato stories at the IJ's Novato section.

The New York Times 		December 26, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Winter Cold Puts a Chill On Energy Renewables  	By KATE GALBRAITH  	Section A; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1  	956 words  	Old Man Winter, it turns out, is no friend of renewable energy.LiNeBrEaK  This time of year, wind turbine blades ice up, biodiesel congeals in tanks and solar panels produce less power because there is not as much sun. And perhaps most irritating to the people who own them, the panels become covered with snow, rendering them useless even in bright winter sunshine.LiNeBrEaK  So in regions where homeowners have long rolled their eyes at shoveling driveways, add another cold-weather chore: cleaning off the solar panels. ''At least I can get to them with a long pole and a squeegee,'' said Alan Stankevitz, a homeowner in southeast Minnesota. LiNeBrEaK  As concern has grown about global warming, many utilities and homeowners have been trying to shrink their emissions of carbon dioxide -- their carbon footprints -- by installing solar panels, wind turbines and even generators powered by tides or rivers. But for the moment, at least, the planet is still cold enough to deal nasty winter blows to some of this green machinery.LiNeBrEaK  In January 2007, a bus stalled in the middle of the night on Interstate 70 in the Colorado mountains. The culprit was a 20 percent biodiesel blend that congealed in the freezing weather, according to John Jones, the transit director for the bus line, Summit Stage. (Biodiesel is a diesel substitute, typically made from vegetable oil, that is used to displace some fossil fuels.)LiNeBrEaK  The passengers got out of that situation intact, but Summit Stage, which serves ski resorts, now avoids biodiesel from November to March, and uses only a 5 percent blend in the summertime, when it can still get cold in the mountains. ''We can't have people sitting on buses freezing to death while we get out there trying to get them restarted,'' Mr. Jones said.LiNeBrEaK  Winter may pose even bigger safety hazards in the vicinity of wind turbines. Some observers say the machines can hurl chunks of ice as they rotate.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's like you throw a plate out there and that plate breaks,'' said Ralph Brokaw, a cattle rancher in southeast Wyoming who has 69 wind turbines on his property. When his turbines ice up, he stays out of the way.LiNeBrEaK  The wind industry admits that turbines can drop ice, like a lamppost or any tall structure. To ameliorate the hazard, some turbines are painted black to absorb sunlight and melt the ice faster. But Ron Stimmel, an expert on small wind turbines at the American Wind Energy Association, denies that the whirling blades tend to hurl icy javelins.LiNeBrEaK  Large turbines turn off automatically as ice builds up, and small turbines will slow and stop because the ice prevents them from spinning -- ''just like a plane's wing needs to be de-iced to fly,'' Mr. Stimmel said.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Brokaw says that his turbines do turn off when they are too icy, but the danger sometimes comes right before the turbines shut down, after a wet, warm snow causes ice buildup.LiNeBrEaK  From the standpoint of generating power, winter is actually good for wind turbines, because it is generally windier than summer. In Vermont, for example, Green Mountain Power, which operates a small wind farm in the southeastern part of the state, gets more than twice the monthly production in winter as in August.LiNeBrEaK  The opposite is true, however, for solar power. Days are shorter and the sun is lower in the sky during the winter, ensuring less power production.LiNeBrEaK  Even in northern California, with mild winters and little snow, solar panels can generate about half as much as in the summer, depending on how much they are tilted, according to Rob Erlichman, chief executive of Sunlight Electric, a San Francisco solar company.LiNeBrEaK  Operators of the electrical grid do not worry much about the seasonal swings, because the percentage of production from renewable energy is still so low -- around 1 percent of the country's power comes from wind, and less from solar panels. In addition, Americans use slightly less electricity in the winter than in the summer because air conditioners are not running. This is especially true in sunny areas, so solar panels' peak production matches the spikes in demand.LiNeBrEaK  But as renewable energy becomes a bigger part of the nation's power mix, the seasonable variability could become more of a problem. Already, power developers are learning that they must make careful plans to avoid the worst impacts of ice and snow.LiNeBrEaK  Trey Taylor, the president of Verdant Power, which has put small turbines in the tidal East River in New York City and plans more for the St. Lawrence River in Canada, said that ice chunks could slide over one another ''like a deck of cards,'' pushing ice below and harming turbines. That may rule out parts of otherwise promising sites like the Yukon River in Alaska, he said.LiNeBrEaK  Kevin Devlin, the vice president for operations of Iberdrola Renewables, a wind developer, said that winter was probably the hardest time of year to maintain turbines, because workers must go out in snow and ice. Occasionally, he said, the turbineswill shut down or set off alarms if it is too cold, and workers must brave the elements to fix them.LiNeBrEaK  For homeowners, the upkeep of their power sources can also be a bother.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Stankevitz keeps his panels tilted 40 degrees or higher, but they still become covered with snow -- and experts say that if even one cell in a panel is covered, the panel will not produce power.LiNeBrEaK  On the other hand, the panels can get extra power from sunlight reflected off nearby snow. And like other electronic gear, solar panels work better when cold.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Stankevitz said that on some rare winter days, when the Minnesota sky is clear, the weather is freezing and the sun is shining brightly, his panels can briefly churn out more electricity than they were designed to produce, more than on the balmiest days of summer.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   Sunrise Edition	Snow, ice puts focus on global warming  		Editorial; Pg. ELL  	465 words  	Could it be that Oregon's commitment to "going green" has been so successful that our diminished carbon footprint allowed ingress of this mini ice-age? LiNeBrEaKAll this time, I had been underestimating the impact of Homo sapiens on the warming and cooling cycles of the earth.LiNeBrEaKNow that my eyes have been opened to snow-blindness, I think the only thing to do is to neutralize the consequences of our aggressive and superior behavior.LiNeBrEaKIn order for schools to reopen, businesses to do business, power to be supplied to the elderly and butter to be purchased sans-anarchy, I will do my part by firing up the tractor, the diesel pickup, the mini-van, the company car, the generator and the chainsaw and allow them to idle away the hours.LiNeBrEaKI wish Al Gore would stop by and help out with our "inconvenient truth." I could use some help shoveling global warming off the roof.LiNeBrEaKJENNIFER L. STAFFORDLiNeBrEaKOregon CityLiNeBrEaKIf everyone is done making their clever Al Gore jokes, let's look at the situation.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming, or climate change, results in more extreme weather all across the spectrum. The last few winters have seen increasingly severe weather. This year takes the cake, but it is still part of an overall trend.LiNeBrEaKHistorically, we have tolerated shutdowns when the weather gets bad, because it hardly ever happens here. So most neighborhoods never see a snowplow and lots of people don't get snow tires and we haven't ever felt like such investments would be necessary.LiNeBrEaKThis [weather] may be the future. If it is, we need to rethink our coping strategies. Cities all across the U.S. face snow and ice without becoming paralyzed, (at least most of the time) so let's learn from them. We will all feel better about a white Christmas if it doesn't result in lost income, power outages and cabin fever.LiNeBrEaKGINA HARRISLiNeBrEaKAlohaLiNeBrEaKAs part of his critique of Oregon's Renewable Energy Act, Dave Lister questions the existence of global warming, asserting that "some data shows the planet cooling" (Dec. 18).LiNeBrEaKI can also find "data" that supports the existence of UFOs and Bigfoot or "data" that concludes that doomsday will come in 2012, among other hypotheses.LiNeBrEaKThe questions that need to be asked are: Who funded the research that produced the data and who are the researchers? Are they unbiased scientists or do they have an agenda they are pursuing? Did the research method meet rigorous scientific standards? Was the summary of the research peer-reviewed to assure that conclusions follow from the data?LiNeBrEaKWhen these questions are asked, we find that the preponderance of reputable research supports the reality of global warming, while a few rogue individuals, usually funded by industries that contribute to global warming, find other "data".LiNeBrEaKPAUL LEELiNeBrEaKSoutheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKDear Global Warming,LiNeBrEaKPlease come back.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   Sunrise Edition	THE INAUGURAL INVOCATION A preacher with the wrong message  	KATHA POLLITT  	Editorial; Pg. D09  	862 words  	THE INAUGURAL INVOCATION A preacher withLiNeBrEaKthe wrong messageLiNeBrEaKKATHA POLLITTLiNeBrEaKT o understand how angry and disappointed many Democrats are that Barack Obama has invited evangelical preacher Rick Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration, imagine if a President-elect John McCain had offered this unique honor to the Rev. Al Sharpton --or the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. I know, it's hard to picture: John McCain would never do that in a million years. Republicans respect their base even when, as in McCain's case, it doesn't really return the favor.LiNeBrEaKOnly Democrats, it seems, reward their most loyal supporters --feminists, gays, liberals, opponents of the war, members of the reality-based community --by elbowing them aside to embrace their opponents instead. LiNeBrEaKMost Americans who've heard of Warren know him as the teddy-bearish, Hawaiian-shirted head of the Saddleback megachurch in Orange County, Calif., and the author of "The Purpose Driven Life." Perhaps they also know he's the rare right-wing Christian pastor who sometimes talks about poverty and global warming and HIV. His concern for those issues has given him a reputation as a moderate and has made him the darling of Democratic Party think tanks, ever hoping to break the Republican lock on the white evangelical vote.LiNeBrEaKBut on the signal issues of the religious right he is, as he himself has said, as orthodox as James Dobson.LiNeBrEaKAnd as inflammatory. Warren doesn't just oppose gay marriage, he's compared it to incest and pedophilia. He doesn't just want to ban abortion, he's compared women who terminate pregnancies to Nazis and the pro-choice position to Holocaust denial.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of Jews, Warren has publicly stated his belief that they will burn in hell, presumably along with everyone else who hasn't accepted his particular brand of Christianity (i.e., the vast majority of people in the world). And forget about evolution --the existence of homosexuals, he's argued, disproves Darwin. And while we may not know how old the Earth is, the Saddleback Web site assures us that dinosaurs and humans coexisted.LiNeBrEaKWarren claims that his views are mainstream, pointing out that in 30 states the majority of voters have banned gay marriage. Popular doesn't mean right, of course, but regardless of what Americans think about gay marriage, on other so-called social issues, he's way out in far-right field.LiNeBrEaKTake abortion. Most Americans, whatever their personal feelings, are pro-choice. On Election Day, anti-choice initiatives went down to defeat in all three states where they were on the ballot. Most Americans do not think the one-third of American women who terminate a pregnancy are running a concentration camp in their wombs, and would have no trouble choosing between saving a Jew from a gas chamber and a fertilized egg from a fire at the clinic.LiNeBrEaKOr take marriage. At his Saddleback Church, wifely submission is official doctrine: The church Web site tells women to defer to the husband's "leadership" even when he's wrong on important issues, such as finances. Never mind if she's an accountant and he flunked long division, or if she wants to beef up the kids' college fund and he wants to buy shares in the Brooklyn Bridge. The godly answer is supposed to be "Yes, dear." Is elevating this male chauvinist how President-elect Obama thanks women, who gave him more than half his votes?LiNeBrEaKOr take foreign policy. In electing Obama, Americans overwhelmingly rejected President George W. Bush's Wild West approach to foreign policy. Apparently Warren didn't get that memo. Unlike many evangelical preachers, he issued a statement against torture, but despite his access to Bush, he told Beliefnet.com that he never raised the subject of torture with him. ("I just didn't have the opportunity," he said --although he apparently found plenty of time to lecture Obama about abortion.)LiNeBrEaKOn "Hannity and Colmes," he agreed that the president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, should be killed, because "the Bible says God puts government on Earth to punish evildoers." Really? The Bible says the United States should murder the leaders of other sovereign states? How many other heads of state does Warren want to do away with? If Ahmadinejad, who is, after all, a more-or-less democratically elected leader, had shared his inauguration with an imam who on national television had called for the assassination of President Bush, Americans would be calling for the nuking of Tehran.LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference, Obama defended the choice of Warren: "It is important for the country to come together, even though we may have disagreements on certain social issues." That's all very well, but excuse me if I don't feel all warm and fuzzy. Obama won thanks to the efforts of people who've spent the past eight years appalled by the Bush administration's wars and violations of human rights, its attacks on gays and women, its denigration of science, its general pandering to bigotry and ignorance in the name of God.LiNeBrEaKI'm all for building bridges, but honoring Warren, who insults Obama's base as perverts and murderers, is definitely a bridge too far.LiNeBrEaK2008, the Los Angeles TimesLiNeBrEaKKatha Pollitt writes the "Subject to Debate" column in The Nation.

The Pantagraph (Bloomington, Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 26, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Warren giving invocation sends out right signal  	The Pantagraph, Bloomington, Ill.  	COMMENTARY  	259 words  	Dec. 26--By picking the Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration, President-elect Barack Obama has managed to offend people on the right and left. In this case, that's a sign he is doing something right. LiNeBrEaKWarren is the pastor of Saddleback Community Church and writer of "The Purpose Driven Life" who hosted a forum with Obama and his Republican rival, John McCain, before the November election.LiNeBrEaKSome religious conservatives have been critical of Warren because he is less rigid on social issues than other conservatives. Associated Press religion writer Rachel Zoll noted that Warren has spoken against fighting terrorism through torture, reaches out to American Muslims and fights against global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, among other groups, have criticized Obama's choice for the invocation because Warren has spoken out against same-sex marriage.LiNeBrEaKObama should stick to his goal of bridging differences and reaching out to people on various sides of the important issues facing the United States. Giving in to those on the far left or the far right would only lead to further polarization.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   SOONER EDITION	There's time to prevent global warming's worst impacts  	BILL WOOD, M.D., Highland Park  	EDITORIAL; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. B-6  	248 words  	Regarding "Nations on Track for New Climate Pact" (Dec. 13): To slow global warming, the United States must finally restore our leadership among nations. The argument over whether humans are causing global warming is over. It's almost, but not yet, too late to prevent its worst impending impacts -- including the increasing spread of infectious diseases (like malaria) carried by insects now able to survive warmer northern winters. LiNeBrEaKMore than 1,700 prominent U.S. scientists and economists, including numerous Nobel Prize winners, have called for the United States to commit to cutting global warming pollution 80 percent by the year 2050. Not only will this protect our climate, it will create 5 million new jobs and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKPennsylvania has a big part to play in reducing global warming. We are the third-worst state for global warming pollution, and we create more pollution than 101 other countries combined, according to our own U.S. Department of Energy!LiNeBrEaKProtecting our environment will solve many of our nation's other problems, too. If we move toward the responsible, clean and green energy economy of the future, we can shore up our financial standing and manufacturing base and strengthen our influence in the world, all while averting dangerous global warming and preserving this planet for our children.LiNeBrEaKThis is a win-win-win all around. We should all urge our elected officials, particularly in Congress, to take immediate action on global warming.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   SOONER EDITION	Green energy fizzles in winter;  Renewable sources can give you the shivers 	Kate Galbraith, The New York Times  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-1  	948 words  	Old Man Winter, it turns out, is no friend of renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThis time of year, wind turbine blades ice up, biodiesel congeals in tanks and solar panels produce less power because there is not as much sun. And perhaps most irritating to the people who own them, the panels become covered with snow, rendering them useless even in bright winter sunshine.LiNeBrEaKSo in regions where homeowners have long rolled their eyes at shoveling driveways, add another cold-weather chore: cleaning off the solar panels. LiNeBrEaK"At least I can get to them with a long pole and a squeegee," said Alan Stankevitz, a homeowner in southeast Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKAs concern has grown about global warming, many utilities and homeowners have been trying to shrink their emissions of carbon dioxide -- their carbon footprints -- by installing solar panels, wind turbines and even generators powered by tides or rivers. But for the moment, at least, the planet is still cold enough to deal nasty winter blows to some of this green machinery.LiNeBrEaKIn January 2007, a bus stalled in the middle of the night on Interstate 70 in the Colorado mountains. The culprit was a 20 percent biodiesel blend that congealed in the freezing weather, according to John Jones, the transit director for the bus line, Summit Stage. (Biodiesel is a diesel substitute, typically made from vegetable oil, that is used to displace some fossil fuels.)LiNeBrEaKThe passengers got out of that situation intact, but Summit Stage, which serves ski resorts, now avoids biodiesel from November to March, and uses only a 5 percent blend in the summertime, when it can still get cold in the mountains. "We can't have people sitting on buses freezing to death while we get out there trying to get them restarted," Mr. Jones said.LiNeBrEaKWinter may pose even bigger safety hazards in the vicinity of wind turbines. Some observers say the machines can hurl chunks of ice as they rotate.LiNeBrEaK"It's like you throw a plate out there and that plate breaks," said Ralph Brokaw, a cattle rancher in southeast Wyoming who has 69 wind turbines on his property. When his turbines ice up, he stays out of the way.LiNeBrEaKThe wind industry admits that turbines can drop ice, like a lamppost or any tall structure. To lessen the hazard, some turbines are painted black to absorb sunlight and melt the ice faster. But Ron Stimmel, an expert on small wind turbines at the American Wind Energy Association, denies that the whirling blades tend to hurl icy javelins.LiNeBrEaKLarge turbines turn off automatically as ice builds up, and small turbines will slow and stop because the ice prevents them from spinning -- "just like a plane's wing needs to be de-iced to fly," Mr. Stimmel said.LiNeBrEaKMr. Brokaw says that his turbines do turn off when they are too icy, but the danger sometimes comes right before the turbines shut down, after a wet, warm snow causes ice buildup.LiNeBrEaKFrom the standpoint of generating power, winter is actually good for wind turbines, because it is generally windier than summer. In Vermont, for example, Green Mountain Power, which operates a small wind farm in the southeastern part of the state, gets more than twice the monthly production in winter as in August.LiNeBrEaKThe opposite is true, however, for solar power. Days are shorter and the sun is lower in the sky during the winter, ensuring less power production.LiNeBrEaKEven in northern California, with mild winters and little snow, solar panels can generate as little as half their summertime peak, depending on how much they are tilted, according to Rob Erlichman, chief executive of Sunlight Electric, a San Francisco solar company.LiNeBrEaKOperators of the electrical grid do not worry much about the seasonal swings, because the percentage of production from renewable energy is still so low -- around 1 percent of the country's power comes from wind, and less from solar panels. In addition, Americans use slightly less electricity in the winter than in the summer because air conditioners are not running. This is especially true in sunny areas, so solar panels' peak production matches the spikes in demand.LiNeBrEaKBut as renewable energy becomes a bigger part of the nation's power mix, the seasonable variability could become more of a problem. Already, power developers are learning that they must make careful plans to avoid the worst impacts of ice and snow.LiNeBrEaKTrey Taylor, the president of Verdant Power, which has put small turbines in the tidal East River in New York City and plans more for the St. Lawrence River in Canada, said that ice chunks could slide over one another "like a deck of cards," pushing ice below and harming turbines. That may rule out parts of otherwise promising sites like the Yukon River in Alaska, he said.LiNeBrEaKKevin Devlin, the vice president for operations of Iberdrola Renewables, a wind-energy developer, said that winter was probably the hardest time of year to maintain turbines, because workers must go out in snow and ice. Occasionally, he said, the turbines will shut down or set off alarms if it is too cold, and workers must brave the elements to fix them.LiNeBrEaKFor homeowners, the upkeep of their power sources can also be a bother.LiNeBrEaKMr. Stankevitz keeps his panels tilted 40 degrees or higher, but they still become covered with snow -- and experts say that if even one cell in a panel is covered, the panel will not produce power.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, the panels can get extra power from sunlight reflected off nearby snow. And like other electronic gear, solar panels work better when cold.LiNeBrEaKMr. Stankevitz said that on some rare winter days, when the Minnesota sky is clear, the weather is freezing and the sun is shining brightly, his panels can churn out more electricity than they were designed to produce, more than on the balmiest days of summer.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   All Editions	Climate changes may loom sooner than expected;  Report sees faster rise in seas, but eases some other fears 	By JULIET EILPERIN, WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE, Wire Services  	NEWS; Pg. A01  	862 words  	WASHINGTON ? The United States faces the possibility of much more rapid climate change by the end of the century than previous studies have suggested, according to a new report led by the U.S. Geological Survey.LiNeBrEaKLooking at factors such as rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic and prolonged drought in the Southwest, the new assessment suggests that earlier projections may have underestimated the climatic shifts that could take place by 2100.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the assessment also suggests that some other feared effects of global warming are not likely to occur by the end of the century, such as an abrupt release of methane from the seabed and permafrost or a shutdown of the Atlantic Ocean circulation system that brings warm water north and colder water south. But the report projects an amount of potential sea level rise during that period that may be greater than what other researchers have anticipated, as well as a shift to a more arid climate pattern in the Southwest by mid-century. LiNeBrEaKThirty-two scientists from federal and non-federal institutions contributed to the report, which took nearly two years to complete for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program. It coordinates the climate research of 13 different federal agencies. The survey expands on the 2007 findings of the United Nations Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKTom Armstrong, senior adviser for global change programs at USGS, said the report "shows how quickly the information is advancing" on potential climate shifts. The prospect of abrupt climate change, he said, "is one of those things that keeps people up at night, because it's a low-probability but high-risk scenario. It's unlikely to happen in our lifetimes, but if it were to occur, it would be life-changing."LiNeBrEaKIn one of the report's most worrisome findings, the agency estimates that in light of recent ice sheet melting, global sea level rise could be as much as 4 feet by 2100.LiNeBrEaKThe IPCC had projected a sea level rise of no more than 1. 5 feet by that time, but satellite data over the past two years show the world's major ice sheets are melting much more rapidly than previously thought.LiNeBrEaKThe Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are now losing an average of 48 cubic miles of ice a year, equivalent to twice the amount of ice that exists in the Alps.LiNeBrEaKProlonged droughtLiNeBrEaKScientists also looked at the prospect of prolonged drought over the next 100 years. They said it is impossible to determine yet whether human activity is responsible for the drought the Southwestern United States has experienced over the past decade, but every indication suggests the region will become consistently drier in the next several decades.LiNeBrEaKRichard Seager, a senior research scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said that nearly all of the 24 computer models the group surveyed project the same climatic conditions for the North American Southwest.LiNeBrEaK"If the models are correct, it will transition in the coming years and decades to a more arid climate, and that transition is already under way," Seager said, adding that such conditions would probably include prolonged droughts lasting more than a decade.LiNeBrEaKThe current models cover broad swaths of landscape, and Seager said scientists need to work on versions that can make projections on a much smaller scale. "That's what the water managers out there really need," he said. Current models "don't give them the hard numbers they need."LiNeBrEaKArmstrong said the need for "downscaled models" is one of the challenges facing the federal government, along with better coordination among agencies on the issue of climate change. When it comes to abrupt climate shifts, he said, "We need to be prepared to deal with it in terms of policymaking, keeping in mind it's a low-probability, high-risk scenario. That said, there are really no policies in place to deal with abrupt climate change."LiNeBrEaKRichard Moss, who directed the Climate Change Science Program's coordination office between 2000 and 2006, welcomed the new report but called it "way overdue."LiNeBrEaK"There is finally a greater flow of climate science from the administration," Moss said, noting that the report was originally scheduled to come out in summer 2007. "It really is showing the potential for abrupt climate change is real."LiNeBrEaKMethane leaksLiNeBrEaKThe report is reassuring, however, on the prospects for some potentially drastic effects ? such as a huge release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, that is now locked deep in the seabed and underneath the Arctic permafrost. That is unlikely to occur in the near future, the scientists said.LiNeBrEaK"It's unlikely that we're going to see an abrupt change in methane over the next hundred years, but we should worry about it over a longer time frame," said Ed Brook, the lead author of the methane chapter and a geosciences professor at Oregon State University. "All of these places where methane is stored are vulnerable to leaking."LiNeBrEaKBy the end the century, Brook said, the amount of methane escaping from natural sources such as the Arctic tundra and waterlogged soils in warmer regions "could possibly double," but that would still be less than the current level of human-generated methane emissions.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   All Editions	NEW JERSEY'S GREENHOUSE PLAN;  Right direction, wrong speed 	By PETER KASABACH, Wire Services  	OPINION; Pg. A23  	887 words  	NEW JERSEY'S Greenhouse Gas Plan, released Dec. 15 by the Department of Environmental Protection, is an important first step toward meeting the goals of the state's Global Warming Response Act. But it is only a first step. If this plan were an automobile ? not an entirely inappropriate metaphor ? one could say it is headed in the right direction, but riding the brake instead of the accelerator.LiNeBrEaKThe plan represents the state's strategy to meet its 2020 greenhouse gas reduction goals (matching 1990 emission levels) while offering recommendations to meet the 2050 goal (an 80 percent reduction). The plan acknowledges the critical importance of the transportation sector, both the largest and fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Jersey, and properly emphasizes the need to curb emissions from this source. LiNeBrEaKIt notes that New Jersey's sprawling land-use patterns, which force many to rely exclusively on the automobile to get around, have been a major factor in the growth in transportation-sector emissions.LiNeBrEaKMost important, it recognizes that changing these patterns "will make a major contribution toward helping the state meet its GHG goals."LiNeBrEaKBut when it comes time to turn these words into action, the plan comes up empty.LiNeBrEaKIn the short term, it counts far too heavily on emerging technology to reduce the state's carbon footprint. For the transportation sector, it relies almost entirely on the Low Emissions Vehicle program (which currently cannot be implemented because it is the subject of litigation) to achieve the 2020 goal.LiNeBrEaKLacking strategiesLiNeBrEaKAnd while it does include a series of ambitious land-use policy targets, such as ensuring that 90 percent of all development takes place in areas served by existing infrastructure, there are no accompanying strategies for getting there, and no urgency for getting started now.LiNeBrEaKAs the plan notes, "How and where New Jersey grows today will determine its carbon footprint for decades to come." So what are we waiting for? Rather than rely almost exclusively on uncertain technological fixes, we should begin right now to implement the land-use reforms that will be necessary down the road.LiNeBrEaKFor example, with a federal economic stimulus package looming, we can begin to prioritize transportation investments on the basis of their impact on emissions (think of a second Hudson River rail tunnel vs. widening the Parkway).LiNeBrEaKA noble objectiveLiNeBrEaKThe plan makes mention of directing new growth to areas near transit ? a noble objective ? but ignores the fact that such an effort will require political leadership, along with financial incentives, both for municipalities and for developers.LiNeBrEaKIt is worth noting in this regard that the Transit Village program, the state's premier effort to promote transit-oriented development, has received scant attention from the Corzine administration.LiNeBrEaKGiven the acknowledged importance of land-use change in achieving New Jersey's greenhouse gas goals, why does the plan not emphasize this strategy more in the near term?LiNeBrEaKThe short answer is that it is a daunting task, and one that is far beyond the DEP's purview. Changing New Jersey's land-use patterns will require not only an extraordinary cross-agency effort at the state level, but extensive county and local government collaboration, as well.LiNeBrEaKYet glaringly absent from the Greenhouse Gas Plan is any mention of the existing governmental body responsible for directing statewide land-use policies: the State Planning Commission.LiNeBrEaKNor is any mention made of the existing plan that lays out a vision for the state's future: the State Development and Redevelopment Plan. This commission, appropriately staffed, and this plan, given the teeth to bring about meaningful land-use change, could contribute mightily to the task of meeting the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals.LiNeBrEaKLook to California planLiNeBrEaKNew Jersey would do well to look at how California plans to meet its greenhouse gas reduction targets. California's recently passed Senate Bill 375 ? which the New Jersey plan highlights but does not emulate ? mandates a comprehensive approach to land use incorporating transportation investment, affordable housing, environmental regulation and other considerations that will ultimately offer residents more convenient alternatives for getting around while simultaneously lowering carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe New Jersey plan, then, is an imperfect document. But it is not the final word. A comprehensive process of stakeholder input is about to get under way, and an independent review panel that was supposed to have been formed six months ago will oversee and advise the process.LiNeBrEaKMake up for lost timeLiNeBrEaKThis process will allow us, the citizens of New Jersey, to make up for some of the time that has already slipped away by insisting that the plan go beyond the easy steps and start taking the hard ones.LiNeBrEaKIf we're going to implement the kinds of meaningful, systemic reforms our state really needs, not only to meet the ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals set by the Legislature, but also to chart a course toward long-term, sustainable economic growth in the nation's most densely populated state, we need to shift our plan into a higher gear.LiNeBrEaKPeter Kasabach is executive director of New Jersey Future, a Trenton-based nonprofit smart-growth research and advocacy organization.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 26, 2008 Friday 	Sierra Warming: Later snow, earlier melt: High anxiety  	Tom Knudson, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	2236 words  	Dec. 26--LAKE TAHOE -- Finally, snow.LiNeBrEaKAfter weeks of waiting, mountain residents awoke to their first glimpse of winter on Dec. 13, a few fluffy inches of powder that clung to the tops of boulders like chefs' hats.LiNeBrEaKMore fell over the past two weeks, enough to bury the camel-colored meadow grass and wine-red willows in a deepening blanket of white. The magic, though, came late, just days before Christmas -- one of the tardiest winter debuts ever.LiNeBrEaKHow much more snow will fall is anyone's guess. A winter storm just hit Thursday, dumping several feet of snow, to the relief of snow-starved resorts. But in the late arrival of this year's snow season -- and increasingly early spring snowmelt from the mountains -- scientists and state officials are finding more than the signature of a natural drought. They believe they detect the fingerprint of climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe implications could be enormous. After all, the snowcapped Sierra is more than a skier's paradise. It is a giant water faucet in the sky, a 400-mile-long, 60-mile-wide reservoir held in cold storage that supplies California with more than 60 percent of its water, much of it when it's needed most: over the hot, dry summer months. LiNeBrEaKNot only are warmer temperatures thawing that mountain snow sooner, they are changing the nature of the precipitation as it falls -- turning more Sierra snowflakes to sleet, slush and rain. Now 10 percent smaller than a century ago, the Sierra snowpack is expected to retreat dramatically in coming decades, posing major challenges for water managers and the climate-dependent ski industry.LiNeBrEaKSki areas already are feeling the heat. This fall, temperatures were so toasty around Lake Tahoe that many resorts missed planned Thanksgiving weekend openings, despite major investments in energy- intensive snowmaking operations. Alpine Meadows did not open for the season until Dec. 19 -- one of its latest starts ever.LiNeBrEaK"The fact that snow is coming later is clearly having a major economic impact," said Art Chapman, president of JMA Ventures, which owns Alpine Meadows and Homewood ski areas. "I think everybody in the ski industry is very concerned about climate change."LiNeBrEaKAs the peaks warm, some ski areas are moving beyond snow and skiing -- and sometimes kicking up controversy as they do, particularly with high-end real estate development ventures.LiNeBrEaKAt Mammoth Mountain, guests no longer simply slide downhill on skis. They ride mountain bikes, golf, fish, even scale an artificial climbing wall.LiNeBrEaK"We absolutely recognize the problem. Seasons are changing. Shorter winters mean longer summers," said Greg Dallas, a Mammoth vice president, at a recent climate change conference in Bishop.LiNeBrEaK"Our strategy is to pump more guests through in what we call the mud seasons, the shoulder seasons," he said. "We need to be able to &Acirc;... weatherproof our business."LiNeBrEaKMore moisture a false hopeLiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, weatherproofing is not possible at lower elevations where massive state reservoirs -- all fed by snowmelt -- have dropped to their lowest levels in more than a decade following two years of drought and the driest spring and summer on record.LiNeBrEaK"The forecast is that by 2050 we'll have 25 to 40 percent less snowpack than today," said Lester Snow, director of the California Department of Water Resources. "That's like losing 6 million acre-feet, six Folsom Reservoirs -- so it's a major amount of storage."LiNeBrEaKEven more worrisome is that California's dams were built on the belief that climatic conditions of the past 150 years, one of the coolest, wettest periods of the millennium, would portend the future. Scientists now know that's not true -- and many say global warming is sure to sharpen the pain of natural drought cycles.LiNeBrEaK"What we consider to be normal wetness today is a chimera," said Scott Stine, a professor at California State University, East Bay.LiNeBrEaKStine's research has shown that two century-plus droughts parched the Sierra in medieval times, allowing forests to grow on what are now the bottoms of mountain lakes.LiNeBrEaK"This is hopefully not where we're headed," Stine said. "But it has happened before under natural conditions."LiNeBrEaKFew parts of North America are more linked to snow than the Sierra Nevada, which takes its name from Spanish explorers who called it una gran sierra nevada -- a great snowy range.LiNeBrEaKIt was snow that brought the Donner Party to grief in the 1840s. A century ago, more than seven stories of snow fell in Alpine County near Lake Tahoe, a record for the range. In 1952, 12-foot snowdrifts stopped a Southern Pacific train, the City of San Francisco, near Donner Summit, stranding passengers for days.LiNeBrEaKToday, Sierra residents look back on that history with a kind of wistfulness. In Lee Vining, 78-year-old Rita Banta halted her needlework to recall how a half-century ago, children would flock every winter to a rope tow on a hill outside town near Mono Lake.LiNeBrEaK"They'd ski from morning till night," she said. "The kids loved it. We haven't had that for a long time. There's not enough snow."LiNeBrEaKIn Yosemite National Park, Mary Kline recalled an old photo that hangs in the Ahwahnee Hotel, a grainy, black-and-white shot showing people whooshing down a hill on a toboggan at Curry Village.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't even believe it when I first saw it," said Kline, Yosemite's branch chief for interpretive services. "It was like, 'You're kidding? Curry Village?' They actually had a toboggan run on packed snow."LiNeBrEaKNobody has that kind of fun on the valley floor anymore. Nor are they likely to anytime soon. Climate models suggest that by the end of this century, the Sierra snowpack could shrink 70 percent to 90 percent -- a somber prospect for many.LiNeBrEaK"Mountains are the places where winter never dies," said Shelton Johnson, a Yosemite ranger. "When you see a peak covered in snow, that's more than geology and hydrology. It's a visceral thing. But when that peak is missing snow, something is literally gone. It's a lessening of grandeur."LiNeBrEaKFlood cycles could worsenLiNeBrEaKAt its simplest, the Sierra's problem is location: The range sits close to the Pacific Ocean, meaning snow often falls close to freezing point, making it more vulnerable to global warming. A 2006 study in the Journal of Climate found that while three-quarters of mountain weather stations across the West recorded declining snowpacks over the past half-century, the losses were greatest in the Sierra.LiNeBrEaK"Temperatures have warmed during winter and early-spring storms," the study noted. "Consequently, the fraction of precipitation that fell as snow declined while the fraction that fell as rain increased."LiNeBrEaKMore winter rain spells trouble for California -- melting snow and triggering floods like the massive New Year's Day deluge of 1997 that roared out of the Sierra and inundated large parts of the Central Valley.LiNeBrEaK"Ironically, while we get drier we're also going to get floodier," Daniel Cayan, a research meteorologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said at the Bishop conference.LiNeBrEaKIt's only recently that scientists have begun to uncover the changing nature of the Sierra snowpack. Their findings and projections, published in academic journals, often are highly technical. Nonetheless, they reflect what people are observing in the field.LiNeBrEaKIn the journal Climate Change, for example, three researchers at the Scripps Institution for Oceanography reported that peak spring runoff in Sierra streams now comes as much as three weeks earlier than it did in 1948.LiNeBrEaKDon Ahlert, a Bay Area carpenter who has rafted and kayaked the Tuolumne, Stanislaus and American rivers since the 1960s, is familiar with the trend.LiNeBrEaK"We'd usually get our peak in the middle of June, or late June," he said. "Now it seems like it's a month earlier."LiNeBrEaKIn the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, a team of more than a dozen scientists projected that a declining Sierra snowpack would one day trigger widespread water shortages in the foothills and Central Valley.LiNeBrEaKFour years later, that's already happening around Mariposa west of Yosemite, where even normally reliable subsurface water sources are in danger.LiNeBrEaK"I know people whose wells have gone dry, who've had to drill multiple wells or who've had to go much deeper," said Len McKenzie, a 67-year-old retired naturalist with the park.LiNeBrEaKIn the 2006 Journal of Climate article about a rainier and less-snowy Sierra, researchers warned that "the shift from snowfall to rain may also be expected to increase the risk of winter and spring flooding in many settings."LiNeBrEaKThat pattern is a major concern for state water managers, who must keep reservoirs low in the winter for flood control, yet fill them up in the spring with snowmelt for irrigation and municipal use. More winter rain and snowmelt trips up that timing.LiNeBrEaK"What you probably want to do is have your reservoirs drawn down farther going into the winter season," said Snow, the state water manager, "so you can more readily capture these higher flood flows that would have normally been in snowpack until early spring."LiNeBrEaKSki areas face lean timesLiNeBrEaKFew corners of the Sierra are more vulnerable to a vanishing snowpack than its ski slopes. By the end of the century, ski seasons across the state could shrink by seven weeks down to three months, according to the 2004 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.LiNeBrEaKThat future is coming into focus today across the range, including at the Stover Mountain Ski Hill, a small nonprofit rope tow near Chester in the northern Sierra that has not opened in two years.LiNeBrEaK"Twelve years ago, we were averaging 50 to 60 days a year," said Dan Smith, manager of Stover Mountain and coach of the high school ski team.LiNeBrEaKThe facility has operated for more than half a century and charges just $12. 50 for a lift ticket. But it is 5,600 to 6,300 feet above sea level, making it one of the lowest-elevation ski slopes in California -- and therefore more susceptible to warming.LiNeBrEaK"A couple years back, we were not able to cover the brush and manzanita," said Smith. "We used to get storms constantly. Now it's a little moisture here and there -- 6, 7 inches. That's nothing."LiNeBrEaKEven better-known, high- elevation resorts around Lake Tahoe found themselves struggling to open this fall. Conditions were so balmy that not even snowmaking equipment could help.LiNeBrEaKSki areas make snow by shooting a mixture of water and compressed air through small, cannonlike guns and other devices stretched across the slopes. The process works best with temperatures in the mid-20s or below, and low humidity.LiNeBrEaKThis fall, the resorts got neither.LiNeBrEaKBy early December, with an inversion layer pushing temperatures into the 40s and low 50s, the snowmaking crew at Alpine Meadows was getting nervous.LiNeBrEaK"It's depressing," Dave Thatcher, director of snowmaking at Alpine, said at the time. "I'm hoping it gets real cold."LiNeBrEaKOn Dec. 8, he got his wish as temperatures dropped into the 20s. All night, the big compressors under Thatcher's office rumbled, shaking the floor; outside, the snowmaking guns howled and roared.LiNeBrEaKAt dawn, a mini-blizzard was raging outside Alpine's base lodge. In all, a foot of snow had fallen -- every flake of it man-made -- across approximately 7 1/2 acres.LiNeBrEaKSitting at his desk, as the compressors thundered beneath him and snow piled up outside, Thatcher, a compact, energetic man, beamed. "We're slaying it," he said. Slapped to the side of his desk, a bumper sticker read: "Snow Happens."LiNeBrEaKA co-worker in coveralls walked by and shouted: "We're going to open this week, aren't we?"LiNeBrEaK"By hell or high water," Thatcher shot back.LiNeBrEaKThen it started to warm up: 32 degrees at 8 a.m. &Acirc;... 37. 5 degrees at 9 a.m. &Acirc;... 40 degrees at 10 a.m. At the bottom of Kangaroo run, puddles of water began to form and flow downhill.LiNeBrEaKStanding nearby, Jim Kercher, Alpine Meadows' general manager, surveyed the night's work. He liked what he saw on the ground but not the lemon-orange rays of sun spilling over the ridge.LiNeBrEaK"You can feel it. This is warming up," he said. "It feels good on my back, but it hurts me in my head."LiNeBrEaKAs more warm days followed cold nights, the struggle to make snow continued. Finally, Alpine opened a few runs on Dec. 12. But with real snow in the forecast and conditions for making more of it improving, the ski area shut down to prepare for a more expansive Dec. 19 opening.LiNeBrEaK"Thirty to 40 percent of your season occurs before the end of the year," said Chapman, Alpine's owner.LiNeBrEaK"When you're not able to open, or you open late, you can't make it up on the other end because once Easter falls, people put away their skis and pull out their bicycles and their tennis rackets."LiNeBrEaKThat early season already is lost. Now, with real snow falling by the foot around Tahoe, moods are shifting from dreary to upbeat -- but not jubilant.LiNeBrEaKAfter all, everyone remembers how the heavy snowstorms of last January and February, so filled with moisture and promise, suddenly stopped.LiNeBrEaKThe long-term forecast is not promising.LiNeBrEaK"Probably the best we can hope for is an average year," Snow said. "And it could be worse than that."LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Tom Knudson, (530) 582-5336.

LiNeBrEaKAC Propulsion, which is based in San Dimas, in Southern California, inked a huge deal with BMW this year to produce lithium-ion battery packs and powertrains for 450 Mini Coopers, BMW's small-car brand. Those vehicles, to be called the Mini E, will be leased for 12 months to people who live in or near New York City and Los Angeles in early 2009.LiNeBrEaK"This is a big step for electric vehicles," Gage said.LiNeBrEaKThe cars will rent for $850 a month.LiNeBrEaKFor BMW, the Mini E represents a chance to get real-world experience with electric vehicles, said spokeswoman Nathalie Bauters of Mini USA. The German automaker figured its Mini, which gets 37 miles per gallon from its gasoline engine, would be a perfect platform for the experiment, she said.LiNeBrEaKMore than 10,000 "hand-raisers" have expressed interest in the vehicle, she said, and since BMW began taking online applications in November, more than 1,800 have applied to lease it. The deadline was Dec. 24, and the automaker will make decisions early in 2009.LiNeBrEaKMost Mini E drivers will be able to travel 110 to 120 miles on a single charge, the company says.

That car is a converted Scion xB with the engine and gas tank removed and batteries and electric motors installed.LiNeBrEaKThe conversion costs $55,000, which might explain why only 12 have been made so far. (Buyers also have to buy a gasoline Scion xB, which costs $14,000 to $15,000.)LiNeBrEaKStill, owners have been very happy, Gage said.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		December 26, 2008 Friday 	GLOBAL WARMING TO IRONY IN WHERE WEATHER IS HEADED  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A23  	467 words  	You have published letters and editorials pointing to the irony of all these drastic winter storms in light of global warming. Sadly, this is not ironic at all. Experts analyzing the effects of global climate change have predicted exactly this: more extreme weather events across the country, and a colder, wetter winter for the Northwest. This is global warming. LiNeBrEaKVaughn BellLiNeBrEaKSeattleLiNeBrEaK\ STATE BUDGETLiNeBrEaKGOVERNOR PROPOSES TO CUT WRONG THINGSLiNeBrEaKDuring Gov. Chris Gregoire's campaign, she insisted the state was not over budget. It seems really strange she hasn't even started her second term and we are all of a sudden $6 billion over budget. Instead of cutting the Departments of Education and Transportation, closing state parks, cutting the prison system by letting prisoners loose and limiting other essential services, why doesn't she cut nonessential services, such as the Department of Ecology and state welfare (by only awarding payment to state residents), deport illegal immigrants and make the Department of Natural Resources run at a profit?LiNeBrEaKBy cutting essential services, she is trying to make us happy to accept a raise in taxes or an income tax.LiNeBrEaKBruce HahnLiNeBrEaKOmakLiNeBrEaKGAU KEEPS PEOPLE OFF THE STREETSLiNeBrEaKThe governor's "no new taxes" budget proves that political rhetoric produces bad fiscal policy. It is unconscionable to eliminate medical coverage and assistance to disabled adults currently on the General Assistance program.LiNeBrEaKThe very day the governor announced her budget I received a message from one of the 21,000 people on the program. He was wondering how he would pay his rent and afford to see his doctor. His entire safety net was just put on the chopping block. He used to be homeless and through the General Assistance program he was able to get back on his feet and rent an apartment.LiNeBrEaKThe news made it a very real possibility he would be forced back onto the streets. The only advice I could give him was to contact his legislators and hope they care enough to take action. I promised to do the same.LiNeBrEaKGAU and the people who rely on it for survival are too important to be subjected to this political game.LiNeBrEaKDan WiseLiNeBrEaKSeattleLiNeBrEaK\ BANKSLiNeBrEaKTRANSPARENCY IS VITAL TO TARP PROCESSLiNeBrEaKI was absolutely amazed to read the bankers' responses to where the TARP funds are going. Not only will they not verify where the money is being spent, they come up with statements like "we manage our capital in the aggregate." Who is lending the money to the banks? The taxpayers are. Had controls and accountability been part of these loans, I bet the can of money I buried in my backyard that banks would have accounted for every penny; failure to do so would result in them not getting a dime. I want to know where the money is going. Do banks have a problem with that? If they do please return promptly our money.LiNeBrEaKRoger LehnertLiNeBrEaKFerndale	GLOBAL WARMING (91%); BUDGET (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (88%); INCOME ASSISTANCE (88%); WEATHER (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (77%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (77%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (76%); LEGISLATORS (76%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (73%); BANKING and FINANCE (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (72%); PRISONS (69%); STATE PARKS (69%); IMMIGRATION (67%); ECONOMIC POLICY (66%); ECONOMIC NEWS (66%); HEALTH INSURANCE (50%); HOMELESSNESS (50%); DISABLED PERSONS (50%); TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (65%) STATE; BUDGET; STORM; FINANCE  		CHRISTINE GREGOIRE (57%)  	WASHINGTON, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 27, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   						LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	LETTER

LiNeBrEaKThe thief wasn't even perturbed by a face-to-face confrontation with store manager Roger Adamson.LiNeBrEaK"I looked at him. I said 'Drop it!'" Adamson said. "He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he ran for the door and away he went, right out the front door."LiNeBrEaKObama stays low-keyLiNeBrEaKon Christmas Day KAILUA, Hawaii - President-elect Barack Obama spent a private Christmas Day with family and friends, continuing a vacation that has been remarkable for how low-key he has kept it.LiNeBrEaKObama, wife Michelle and their two young daughters opened presents at their rented vacation home and planned a dinner of turkey and ham, according to aides. He planned no public events, and aides said they did not expect to release any further details.LiNeBrEaKThe Obamas arrived in Honolulu on Saturday with four aides, his Secret Service detail and a small group of journalists. Since then, he has been largely sequestered at the beachfront estate.LiNeBrEaKWith less a month before Obama takes office, he is taking every step possible to make sure this holiday is as private as possible - something he bemoaned while walking to a driving range Sunday.LiNeBrEaK"Okay, guys," Obama said, recognizing the photographers snapping pictures. "Come on. . . . How many shots do you need?"LiNeBrEaKStudies: ClimateLiNeBrEaKrapidly changing WASHINGTON - The United States faces the possibility of much more rapid climate change by the end of the century than previous studies have suggested, according to a new report led by the U.S. Geological Survey.LiNeBrEaKThe survey - which was commissioned by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and issued this month - expands on the 2007 findings of the United Nations Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change. Looking at factors such as rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic and prolonged drought in the Southwest, the new assessment suggests that earlier projections may have underestimated the climatic shifts that could take place by 2100.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the assessment also suggests that some other feared effects of global warming are not likely to occur by the end of the century, such as an abrupt release of methane from the seabed and permafrost or a shutdown of the Atlantic Ocean circulation system that brings warm water north and colder water south. But the report projects an amount of potential sea level rise during that period that may be greater than what other researchers have anticipated, as well as a shift to a more arid climate pattern in the Southwest by mid-century.LiNeBrEaKThirty-two scientists from federal and non-federal institutions contributed to the report, which took nearly two years to complete. The Climate Change Science Program, which was established in 1990, coordinates the climate research of 13 different federal agencies.LiNeBrEaKCourt: No immunityLiNeBrEaKfor good Samaritan LOS ANGELES - The handful of 20-something friends went to a bar. They drank until the early morning, then left. And when one of their cars crashed into a light pole, Lisa Torti hurried over and pulled one of the passengers from the wreckage.LiNeBrEaKSound like the story of a good Samaritan? Perhaps. But here in the Golden State, it's also grounds for a lawsuit.LiNeBrEaKLast week, a divided California Supreme Court ruled that Torti is not protected from civil liability, because the help she provided wasn't emergency medical care.LiNeBrEaKThe decision refines the legal immunity granted to good Samaritans under a California statute. It states that "no person who in good faith, and not for compensation, renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission."LiNeBrEaKThe ruling emphasizes that immunity applies only to those who provide emergency medical care in such situations.LiNeBrEaKThe court's ruling stems from a suit filed by Alexandra Van Horn, who claimed that Torti negligently moved her from the car and, in doing so, permanently damaged her spinal cord and rendered her paraplegic. Torti claimed she was trying to help Van Horn, an act protected by the statute, according to court documents.LiNeBrEaKThe court sided with Van Horn. Because the statute is part of a health and safety code pertaining to emergency medical services, it is intended to protect "only those" who provide "emergency medical care at the scene of a medical emergency," Justice Carlos R. Moreno wrote for the majority.LiNeBrEaKThree dissenting judges, in a separate opinion, found that reading of the statute "distorted." They argued that it "imposes an arbitrary and unreasonable limitation" on the statute's legal protections, allowing good Samaritans to be sued for incidental damages and limits the help they can offer.LiNeBrEaK"In the majority's view, a passerby who, at the risk of his or her own life, saves someone about to perish in a burning building can be sued for incidental injury caused in the rescue, but would be immune for harming the victim during the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation out on the sidewalk," wrote Justice Marvin R. Baxter.LiNeBrEaKConsequently, Baxter wrote, the result is that Torti has "no immunity for her bravery."LiNeBrEaKStar-Ledger wire services	CHRISTMAS (91%); PET FOODS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (88%); CLIMATOLOGY (85%); DOGS (79%); GROCERY STORES and SUPERMARKETS (78%); SHOPLIFTING (78%); JOURNALISM (77%); PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES (77%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (73%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (72%); DROUGHT (66%); GLOBAL WARMING (66%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (62%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (60%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (92%); HONOLULU, HI, USA (79%) HAWAII, USA (92%); UTAH, USA (92%); NEW JERSEY, USA (79%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%); ATLANTIC OCEAN (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); ARCTIC (79%)  	December 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  	nsl  	2008 Newark Morning Ledger Co.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 		December 26, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Landfill A Good Deal For Pasco  	BILL NEWTON, Special to the Tribune  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 25  	655 words  	By BILL NEWTONLiNeBrEaKSpecial to the TribuneLiNeBrEaKRegarding "State Agency Slaps Public During Landfill Debacle" (Our Opinion, Dec. 19):LiNeBrEaKTimes are tough, so this is time for Pasco County to be extra careful with taxpayer funds. That's why Florida Consumer Action Network (FCAN) supports the east Pasco bioreactor landfill proposal that's in front of the county now - an environmentally friendly project that puts money back in the pockets of consumers. It offers Pasco County compelling financial incentives, as well as a green way to deal with our waste disposal needs.LiNeBrEaKBioreactor landfills use advanced technology to rapidly compost trash and generate methane used to make electricity, thereby greatly reducing greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global warming. We agree and so does the Nature Coast Sierra club. Even the governor's new energy bill recognizes this use as a way to achieve our statewide recycling goals. LiNeBrEaKThe proposed bioreactor facility would be constructed at no cost to the county. The owners would only charge Pasco residents $27 per ton, compared with the $56. 70 they pay today. Pasco residents would save hundreds of millions of dollars compared to the county's plan to expand the Shady Hills incinerator at a cost of about $150 million and counting.LiNeBrEaKThe facility's owner has also offered to accept a portion of Pasco residential waste for free, build a citizen recycling center, construct roadway improvements and limit the types of materials that would be accepted to further safeguard the environment.LiNeBrEaKSo why is the county considering incinerator expansion? We wonder, especially since they have said that residents' fees will eventually triple or more to pay back bonds needed for expansion. With well-documented public health and environmental risks and high taxpayer costs, we're not sure why any government would consider expanding an incinerator today. We suspect politics is involved.LiNeBrEaKThe environmental arguments against this landfill don't hold water. In a draft permit it is expected to finalize next month, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection saw no significant issues with the proposal. As an extra layer of protection and assurance, the draft permit would require the developer to regularly monitor groundwater and all systems to ensure they are properly functioning and pose no threat to the environment.LiNeBrEaKWe understand that a protest group of residents has been formed in the area and is concerned about the environment. Citizens should be concerned and monitor this project closely. But what may not be evident is that the group in the news was initiated and funded not by average citizens but by several large, influential landowners in the area who have their own interests. Their concern may well be less about the environment and more that a nearby landfill, no matter how environmentally safe, might hurt their interests.LiNeBrEaKOur bottom line is this: How can Pasco consumers save money and protect their environment? Private enterprise has put on the table a green proposal that will save taxpayers millions of dollars. The FDEP is likely to approve a permit. The opponents seem political and motivated by private interests.LiNeBrEaKAt a time when so many Pasco residents face financial pressures and fewer county services, when public trust in elected officials is eroding, and when government scandals fill our news, county government needs to look out for taxpayer interests - not those of wealthy landowners. Our group, a Florida consumer watchdog organization with deep roots in Pasco County, will be following this project with interest in the coming months.LiNeBrEaKWe urge citizens to write their county commissioners and tell them to save money and fight for Pasco, not special interests. Don't burn our tax dollars!LiNeBrEaKBill Newton is executive director of the Florida Consumer Action Network in Tampa.

The Washington Times 		December 26, 2008 Friday 		By Greg Pierce, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; INSIDE POLITICS; A06  	1098 words  	Lost decadeLiNeBrEaK"Mr. Obama's troops palpitate with excitement at the prospect of $1 trillion in 'stimulus,' though any net benefit to the economy likely will be incidental," Wall Street Journal business columnist Holman W. Jenkins Jr. writes.LiNeBrEaK"Al Gore has thrown out the window any unpopular carbon taxes in favor of direct subsidies to his green energy investments. He sees the moment for what it is - alarm about global warming has degenerated into a pretext. Billions will be diverted from useful purposes to create 'green jobs' that deliver no meaningful impact on climate or the accumulation of atmospheric carbon," Mr. Jenkins said.LiNeBrEaK"Large 'confidence' costs were always destined to flow from the extreme steps being taken, even if advisable, to prop up the economy. The federal government's alternating takeovers and bailouts of companies are inherently destabilizing and create massive uncertainty in investors and businesses.LiNeBrEaK"The Fed's shocking steps to print money and acquire every kind of private asset and, soon perhaps, washing machines and Chevy Tahoes, may in retrospect be seen as just the right medicine. At the moment, no rational investor or business manager looks upon such doings with confidence in our economic future. ... LiNeBrEaK"Our point here is that the bad policy vicious circle probably has a long way to run While it's still possible to entertain wild hopes about an Obama administration, such hopes are partly self-liquidating on closer inspection - they exist in the first place only because Mr. Obama has given us so little to go on, except campaign boilerplate.LiNeBrEaK"Bottom line: Politics is in charge - in a way that makes a lost decade of subpar prosperity more likely than not."LiNeBrEaKMedia thrillerLiNeBrEaK"Sean Hannity marks 2008 as the year journalism died. But it could just as easily be the year journalism felt a thrill going up its leg," the Media Research Center's L. Brent Bozell III writes at www.mrc.org.LiNeBrEaK"That Chris Matthews announcement in February, that a Barack Obama speech caused him a mild ecstasy, represented the everyday 'mainstream' media view. Reporters didn't so much produce 'news' during this election year as they tried to make a sale. Every story seemed to say 'You know you want Obama.'LiNeBrEaK"Chris Matthews won the 'Quote of the Year' for 2008 in the Media Research Center's annual tally of the year's worst reporting, or 'The Best of Notable Quotables.' The only quote that came close to Matthews in summing up the year in liberal tilt was this bizarre post-election headline from the Reuters wire service: 'Media bias largely unseen in U.S. presidential race.'LiNeBrEaK'The 'Obamagasm Award' went to Nancy Gibbs, Time's senior writer in charge of obsequious fawning, for using her post-election cover story to compare Obama to Jesus Christ, only better: 'Some princes are born in palaces. Some are born in mangers. But a few are born in the imagination, out of scraps of history and hope.' ...LiNeBrEaK"Even anchormen couldn't resist the urge to 'save the country' by selling Obama NBC's Brian Williams won the 'Let Us Fluff Your Pillow Award' for soft and cuddly interviews for trying to help Michelle Obama identify the worst Republican lie about her husband: 'What of the attacks has busted through to you? What makes you angriest at John McCain, the Republicans? What's being said about your husband that you want to shout from the mountain tops is not true?'LiNeBrEaK"Do you remember Cindy McCain being asked claptrap like that?"LiNeBrEaKPower of cashLiNeBrEaK"Conventional wisdom dictates that Barack Obama was swept into office on the winds of change. History books will surely echo that notion. But while those are sentimentally satisfying explanations for what took place this past November, Obama owes his presidency largely to cold hard cash," Steven Stark writes in the Boston Phoenix.LiNeBrEaK"Though the American dollar is now taking a horrific beating in these financial End Times, it's still strong enough to put a man in the Oval Office. In the end, Obama's victory was notable in a number of ways, most obviously because of his race. But in political terms, it was about as conventional as they come," Mr. Stark said.LiNeBrEaK"That's an important distinction, because it tells us a lot about our likely political future. Remember that, at the beginning of this fall campaign, the press fell all over itself proclaiming the Obama operation as the harbinger of a new, realigned type of post-Internet politics - able to mobilize a massive network, mostly of the young, at a moment's notice. Turnout was predicted to set new records.LiNeBrEaK"In reality, turnout was up, but not by much, and the young comprised nearly the same percentage of the vote they always have. As for Obama's decisive victory? It was about what one would expect from any challenger to an incumbent party running in the midst of a recession and the worst economic crisis in a generation.LiNeBrEaK"Still, the Obama campaign did make political history with an unexpected innovation: it brilliantly used the Internet to convert enthusiasm into money. And that helped make Obama the greatest political fundraiser of all time.LiNeBrEaK"Essentially, then, he won the presidency the old-fashioned way, using his vast resources to first wipe out Hillary Clinton and then overwhelm John McCain."LiNeBrEaKReform vs. recoveryLiNeBrEaK"Barack Obama wants to use the recession to remake the U.S. economy," John Stossel writes at www.realclear politics.com.LiNeBrEaK" 'Painful crisis also provides us with an opportunity to transform our economy to improve the lives of ordinary people,' Obama said.LiNeBrEaK"His designated chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, is more direct: 'You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'LiNeBrEaK"So they will 'transform our economy.' Obama's nearly trillion-dollar plan will not merely repair bridges, fill potholes and fix up schools; it will also impose a utopian vision based on the belief that an economy is a thing to be planned from above. But this is an arrogant conceit. No one can possibly know enough to redesign something as complex as 'an economy,' which really is people engaging in exchanges to achieve their goals. Planning it means planning them," Mr. Stossel said.LiNeBrEaK"Obama and Emanuel want us to believe that their blueprint for reform will bring recovery from the recession. Yet we have recovered from past recessions without undertaking a radical social and economic transformation.LiNeBrEaK"In fact, reform would impede recovery.LiNeBrEaK"This is not the first time a president chose reform over recovery. Franklin Roosevelt did it with his New Deal, and the result was long years of depression and deprivation."

The Washington Post 		December 26, 2008 Friday   Regional Edition	Electrical Gridlock;  Steps to Avert the Looming Power Crisis 	Glenn English and Jackson E. Reasor Jr.  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A23  	629 words  	The lights might go out in Virginia in two years. As a Post editorial this fall and other reports have noted, blackouts are likely in the commonwealth by 2011 because demand for electricity is outstripping supply and the state needs access to new sources of power.LiNeBrEaKSadly, Virginia's predicament can be seen around the country. The United States faces an energy crisis: More power generation and more transmission lines are needed, and all this must be created quickly while also meeting climate change goals. LiNeBrEaKOver the past few months, officials from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association have met with representatives from the 900 cooperative electric utilities that supply power to 40 million people in 47 states. A common theme has emerged: Our political leaders must develop a national energy policy that funds development of new technologies to keep electricity affordable while meeting climate change goals. Otherwise, a growing number of Americans won't be able to pay for power, and many will be at risk of rolling blackouts and brownouts.LiNeBrEaKIn the past five years, utility bills have risen 30 percent, largely because of the rising cost of fuel, mainly coal and natural gas. The country's leading consumer organizations, including the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, recently wrote to President-elect Barack Obama, calling on him "to devote as much attention to the affordability of electricity as has been devoted to gasoline."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that by 2030, demand for electricity will be 30 percent higher, the equivalent of adding four  Californias to the power grid.LiNeBrEaKIn some regions, demand will soon outstrip supply. The North America Electric Reliability Corp., which oversees the reliability of the U.S. electric power grid, projects that the desert Southwest will be at risk for blackouts in 2010 because of a shortage of power generation capacity. An Agriculture Department report this year on rural electric power generation found that "brownouts are probable unless investment in transmission is increased and simultaneously, energy efficiency efforts and demand side management must be intensified."LiNeBrEaKSo what should Obama do to meet both our nation's growing demand for electricity  and our climate change goals? The next administration should study the energy blueprint promoted by executives at cooperative electric utilities from around the country:LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; The government should expand initiatives that boost efficiency at the consumer level, such as the Energy Department's Weatherization Assistance Program, which helps consumers defray the cost of adding insulation, efficient windows, Energy Star appliances, and heating and cooling systems.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Government policies should encourage the construction of new power lines so that wind power produced in rural areas can be dispatched to cities where it is most needed.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Government must pare the red tape associated with building nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; For real long-term progress, our leaders must invest in research so that we can find a way to capture and permanently store carbon emitted  by coal-fired power plants. If we can pull off that feat, we could optimize our most plentiful fuel resource without increasing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKCongress and President-elect Obama  face a historic opportunity to tame our growing energy crisis. If they don't act,  the lights will go out.LiNeBrEaKGlenn English, a former Democratic congressman from Oklahoma, is chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which represents more than 900 cooperative electric utilities. Jackson E. Reasor Jr. is president and chief executive of Old Dominion Electric Cooperative and the Virginia, Maryland and Delaware Association of Electric Cooperatives.

The Boston Globe 		December 25, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Put climate change in the curriculum  	Queen Arsem-O'Malley  	OP-ED; Pg. A23  	753 words  	ENVIRONMENTAL consciousness is sweeping the nation. Politicians, vacation destinations, and college campuses all try to attract people with talk of carbon footprints, carbon offsets, and carbon neutrality. And the movement has been fueled by the SIGG-carrying, bike-riding portion of the population - in other words, by young adults.LiNeBrEaKBut while environmental responsibility has become a top concern for colleges, the time has come to make climate change a more prominent subject of earlier schooling as well. LiNeBrEaKThe point of climate-change education isn't that students should be able to spout carbon-emissions facts as they hug trees and recycle everything within reach (though they may do much of that after learning the facts).LiNeBrEaKAs climate change becomes more and more dire, it affects every aspect of our lives: social, political, physical, and economic. Recognizing this, the G-8 summit culminated in a commitment by the major industrial nations to a 50 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.LiNeBrEaKBut how can we ever achieve that change if today's secondary- and elementary-school students lack the tools to understand the problem and build solutions?LiNeBrEaKOn the broadest level, students need to understand the science behind climate change and recognize that although the science continues to become more refined, we can act now with the information we have. Students need to become more familiar with the general strategies we will use to lessen the impacts of climate change. Perhaps most importantly, students need to learn to think creatively about climate change, since innovative solutions will be necessary for one of the most challenging problems of our time.LiNeBrEaKClimate change is a quickly evolving phenomenon, so instructional materials and specific curricula may become dated quickly. Some groups, such as the National Wildlife Federation, have compiled materials for teachers to use within their existing curriculums, which is the only feasible way to approach climate-change education: to incorporate it into a variety of subjects.LiNeBrEaKHere in Massachusetts, the Youth Climate Action Network (a group in which I participate), made up of schools and groups from all over the state, is organizing a public hearing on climate-change education. The network is made up of students, educators, community organizers, and others. Members are working together to define the specific lessons and skills that could become part of the state-mandated curriculum.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental responsibility has become such a hot topic for college-bound high school students that the Sustainable Endowments Institute has published the "College Sustainability Report Card" for the past two years. It grades 200 schools' policies in categories such as green building, transportation, food services, and recycling. ("Sustainability leader" Middlebury College offers locally grown berries.) In August, Congress passed the Higher Education Sustainability Act, providing grants to colleges and universities to encourage academic programs that address sustainability, and to help campuses become more energy-efficient.LiNeBrEaKIt's not just the attraction of "green" campuses that motivates high school students, it's also the desire to be prepared for green jobs. The growth of the "green-collar" job market makes climate-change education a necessity. With the creation of the state's Clean Energy Technology Center, more than $2 million is being invested in workforce development in the clean-energy sector. Boston alone is spending a quarter of a million dollars on local green-collar training.LiNeBrEaKBut the need for environmental education goes way beyond green-collar jobs.LiNeBrEaKThe Boston City Council's Committee on Education sees climate-change education as a critical step toward shaping students into responsible citizens, and crucial in the switch to a green economy. There is the No Child Left Inside Act, a bill now waiting for a vote in the US House. The measure would authorize $500 million in grants to states for professional development and programs in environmental and outdoor education.LiNeBrEaKMaryland Governor Martin O'Malley has already jumped on the solar-powered bandwagon, announcing in April that he would be creating the Children in Nature Partnership to advise him on creating a statewide plan. So where's ours? LiNeBrEaKAmong all proposed educational reforms, climate-change education is a time-sensitive issue that needs to be acted upon immediately.LiNeBrEaKQueen Arsem-O'Malley, a Boston Latin senior, was a Ward Fellow with the Globe editorial page this summer.

The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 25, 2008 Thursday 	Report lists climate change options  	Dave DeWitte, The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	597 words  	Dec. 25--A final report from the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council released this week says an interim goal of reducing state greenhouse gas emissions by 22 percent by 2020 is achievable.LiNeBrEaKThe council was established by the Iowa General Assembly about one year ago to submit greenhouse gas emission reduction proposals. Reductions in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are being studied in an effort to limit climate change. The council was specifically asked to develop scenarios for achieving reductions of 50 percent and 90 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKTo reach the 50 percent goal, the council recommended the state cut greenhouse gas emis sions 1 percent by 2012 and 11 percent by 2020. For the 90 percent reduction goal, the committee recommended reducing emissions 3 percent by 2012, and 22 percent by 2020. LiNeBrEaKThe final report presents 56 policy options, and analyzes the net cost impact of 37 of them. The costs were estimated at about $4. 8 billion between 2009 and 2020, or a weighted average cost of $8. 80 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions reduced.LiNeBrEaK"Many of the policies are estimated to yield significant cost-saving opportunities for Iowans," the report said. "Other policies will incur net costs." The council said 38 recommendations that were analyzed yielded emissions reductions totaling 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2012, and 105 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2020.LiNeBrEaKThe combined effect of implementing those 38 options and recent federal and state actions would enable the state to achieve the 2020 goals, the report said.LiNeBrEaKPolicy options listed by the 23-member councils included specific suggested goals. Some of them included:LiNeBrEaK--By 2020, use 50 percent of available methane from livestock manure for renewable electricity and steam generation, or incorporation into the natural gas distribution system.LiNeBrEaK--Achieve 7,500 megawatt hours per year of new smallscale distributed generation to the power grid, from sources such as solar photovoltaic systems, small wind farms, and fuel cells.LiNeBrEaK--If deemed feasible, consider building one new 1,200 megawatt nuclear power plant in Iowa.LiNeBrEaK--Achieve a 10 percent per capita reduction in vehicle miles traveled by 2020 in urban areas through "smart growth" strategies, including more bicycle and pedestrian paths, more infill redevelopment, and transit-oriented de velopment.LiNeBrEaK--Improve light-duty ve hicle fleet fuel economy by 20 percent by 2012, 100 percent by 2020, and 250 percent or more by 2050.LiNeBrEaK--Create electricity pricing policies that encourage consumers to take steps that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging use of renewable energy and plants that generate both heat and power.LiNeBrEaKIndustry groups have begun to stake out their positions. One of the first was the Iowa Association of Electric Cooperatives, which faulted the report for not adequately analyzing the cost impact of its recommendations on consumers at a time when the economy is slowing.LiNeBrEaK-- Contact the writer: (319) 398-8317 or david.dewitte@gazcomm.comLiNeBrEaKThe full reportLiNeBrEaKTo access the full report of the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council, go to: www.LiNeBrEaKiaclimatechange.us/capag.cfm	EMISSIONS (94%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); METHANE (89%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (88%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (86%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (86%); POWER PLANTS (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION (78%); FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY (78%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (78%); AGRICULTURAL WASTES (76%); PRICE MANAGEMENT (68%); WIND ENERGY (68%); POWER COGENERATION (67%); WIND POWER PLANTS (67%); SOLAR ENERGY (67%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (67%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (66%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (62%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (62%)  	General  		IOWA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 25, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081225-CR-Report-lists-climate-change-options-1225  	Newspaper  	CR  	2008 The Gazette   															
The Houston Chronicle 		December 25, 2008 Thursday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Security adviser a hawk on energy;  Retired general is a strong advocate for offshore drilling, nuclear power 	RICHARD S. DUNHAM, Washington Bureau, Staff  	A; Pg. 1  	741 words  	WASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama's choice of retired Gen. James L. Jones to become his national security adviser won bipartisan applause because of the former NATO supreme commander's military and diplomatic track records.LiNeBrEaKBut amid the rave reviews for his military accomplishments, his ability to speak fluent French and his basketball prowess, one line on Jones' resume was widely overlooked: his expertise on energy issues.LiNeBrEaKUnlike most of Obama's inner circle, the retired general, 64, has been a strong advocate of aggressive energy exploration and development, including offshore drilling and nuclear power. LiNeBrEaKFor the past year, Jones has been president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy. Until his Dec. 1 selection by Obama, he also served as a board member of the Chevron Corp. - just like President George W. Bush's first national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, now the secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKEnergy industry experts, business leaders and area members of Congress from both parties predict that Jones' presence will ensure that the "all-of-the-above" approach favored by Texas lawmakers - pursuing drilling, conservation, nuclear power and alternative energy sources simultaneously - will at least get a hearing in Obama administration deliberations.LiNeBrEaK"I like the idea that Gen. Jones is for a balanced approach to energy policy," said Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston. "He will be there and talk about that. Having that receptive person inside the room bodes well for the country and our region of the country."LiNeBrEaKDuring his 2003-2006 stint as NATO's supreme commander, Jones stressed his view that energy policy was a top national security matter for the United States and a leading international security priority.LiNeBrEaKAs the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's energy institute, he delivered a 36-page policy blueprint to the Obama transition team that recommended aggressive drilling and energy efficiency efforts.LiNeBrEaK"We're very excited and enthusiastic that there will be somebody in the administration and in the White House who has talked about" offshore drilling and energy security, said Dan Naatz, the Independent Petroleum Association of America's vice president of federal resources and political affairs.LiNeBrEaKFavors drillingLiNeBrEaKJones favors expanded domestic oil and gas exploration, including offshore drilling, wider use of nuclear power, rapid development of clean-coal technology and an emphasis on renewable energy sources. He has advocated a reduction in "burdensome regulations" that stymie energy production and industry innovation. He also favors U.S. engagement in global climate change talks.LiNeBrEaKJones declined a request for an interview for this article. But his top deputy at the Energy Institute, Karen Alderman Harbert, said he is committed "to enhancing our nation's energy security."LiNeBrEaKWhile the oil and gas industry has been very nervous about the shape of a future Obama energy program, Frank Maisano, an energy specialist at Bracewell and Giuliani, said Jones' presence increases the likelihood that the administration will "come to a policy decision that is well thought out and carefully considered."LiNeBrEaKOpen up the GulfLiNeBrEaKRep. John Culberson, R-Houston, said he is pleased that Jones "has voiced his willingness to expand America's offshore drilling capacity."LiNeBrEaKRep. Kevin Brady, R-The Woodlands, said Jones "would have a platform to urge the president to resist efforts to reinstate the (offshore drilling) moratorium."LiNeBrEaKBrady is pushing for Jones to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico to natural gas exploration and to modernize America's aging nuclear energy infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and nuclear power skeptics express concern about Jones' record but believe that he will not dictate administration policy.LiNeBrEaK"We certainly don't agree with everything in that report, particularly the drill-everywhere approach and building many more nuclear plants," said Alan Nogee, director of the Clean Energy Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists.LiNeBrEaKStill, Nogee applauds Jones' commitment to conservation and renewable energy.LiNeBrEaK"For the first time ever, we're going to have a national security adviser, a commerce secretary and a secretary of state who strongly support improving the nation's energy efficiency and developing the nation's renewable resources," Nogee said.LiNeBrEaKJones' influence on Obama policy will depend on his ability to convince the president of the security component of energy independence.

Lubbock Avalanche-Journal (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 25, 2008 Thursday 	Lubbock man finds knitting good way to help others  	Jeremy Henderson, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Texas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	907 words  	Dec. 25--There is the Robert Schmidt who was.LiNeBrEaKThere is the Robert Schmidt who is.LiNeBrEaKThat Robert Schmidt is 82.LiNeBrEaKAge blunts a man.LiNeBrEaKThe land once waited for the Robert Schmidt who was. He was a farmer. It waited for him to make it alive. His wife, Dorey, wrote a poem about all that during their 20 years in Wimberley. She called it "Earth Man." She wrote about how his arms and sweat could urge fertility into the hill country soil and about how his strong hands made wood sing.LiNeBrEaKAny time the folks of Wimberley needed their decks fixed, their fences mended, their mill wheels repaired, they called the Robert who was, and Robert was there. LiNeBrEaKThe Robert who is, knits.LiNeBrEaKHe takes his blood pressure medicine and his dizzy pills and heads into the family room.LiNeBrEaKThen he eases into a brown La-Z-Boy recliner in front of a really loud Western or a really loud Hallmark movie or maybe the really loud Christmas music channel and he knits like hell.LiNeBrEaK"The years kind of pile up, you know," says Dorey, 77. "The levels of activity diminish. It's very frustrating for a man who's always been able to get up and go do everything and always be able to accomplish things to not be able to anymore."LiNeBrEaKThe knitting changed all that.LiNeBrEaK"This has had a calming effect. That he's able to be less active but feels that he's doing something rather than just wasting away at television."LiNeBrEaKSt. John's United Methodist, the Schmidts' church, had a bunch of somethings Robert could have been doing on Wednesday nights. He couldLiNeBrEaKhave discussed the Bible. He could have learned about global warming. He could have watched a movie and then talked about how it made him feel.LiNeBrEaKSo of course Robert joined Prayer Shawl, St. John's formerly all-women knitting group.LiNeBrEaK"I guess I'm kinda nervous," Robert says. "I gotta be doing something with my hands."LiNeBrEaKHe was really into woodworking for a while there, he says. Carving. Whittling. He'd make these little pocket crosses and hand them out to the nurses and doctors who take care of him and his heart problems.LiNeBrEaK"I did that for several years," he says, "but a lot of that wood gets a little heavy."LiNeBrEaKBut yarn he can handle.LiNeBrEaKWell.LiNeBrEaKTwo Christmases ago, Robert made some shawls and caps for the St. John's Tree of Warmth, a Christmastime clothing drive. There were some leftovers. So he took them down to The Phoenix House, a nursing home on the corner of 34th and Indiana.LiNeBrEaK"They told me there were these four women together in one room and only one of them had gotten a Christmas present from somewhere," he says. "The other three got nothing."LiNeBrEaKRobert gave them each a shawl that looked like a rainbow.LiNeBrEaK"They lit up like Christmas trees," he says. "I said, huh, if that makes these women that happy, I could make kids happier and do it a lot easier than making shawls.' "LiNeBrEaKSo this year he started making caps. Caps, caps, caps. Caps everywhere. Caps for kids.LiNeBrEaKAnd suddenly, Robert Schmidt was helping people again.LiNeBrEaKHe can knit a cap in "two and a half, maybe three hours," he says.LiNeBrEaKWhen he has a sack full, he and Dorey find a children's charity to tote them to. The first didn't send a thank-you card. "So no more for them."LiNeBrEaKBy year's end, Robert will have knitted and distributed more than 200 caps, a couple of dozen shawls, and several scarves to charities across the city.LiNeBrEaKHe recently delivered a batch especially made for the Lubbock Ronald McDonald House, which does send thank-you cards. They were red and yellow.LiNeBrEaKIf Treasa Arnold had to guess, there were 40.LiNeBrEaK"They were so cute," says Arnold, coordinator of Ronald McDonald House's Family Room. "It's a funny thing because I was at my dentist a couple of weeks ago and one of the women there knew I worked here and she was telling me about this man who was donating all these scarves he'd knitted. So I've been asked about him twice now."LiNeBrEaKDina Jeffries, the House's outreach and development coordinator, says the caps will likely find their way into the gift bags the organization hands out to children at Christmas, Jeffries says. Or in a neonatal intensive care unit.LiNeBrEaK"Children in the neonatal units have such a hard time keeping warm because you lost most of your body heat through your head," she says. "They'd be great for the NICU."LiNeBrEaKThat's the kind of warm thought that can melt even a man whose granddaughter calls him "Grumpy."LiNeBrEaKNot that ol' Robert would let on.LiNeBrEaK"He's really kind of a quiet kind of guy," Dorey says. "He's always been a man of few words who just enjoyed working with his hands. He's not very much of a joiner or anything. He works best independently. He's got kind of a rough exterior. You won't find him out leading a fundraising drive or anything like that, but you will find him giving small kindnesses to people."LiNeBrEaKAw, shucks, says the Robert who is. He just wants to knit like a man.LiNeBrEaKTo comment on this story:LiNeBrEaKjeremy.henderson@lubbockonline.com 766-8724LiNeBrEaKshelly.gonzales@lubbockonline.com 766-8747LiNeBrEaKYou won't find him out leading a fundraising drive or anything like that, but you will find him giving small kindnesses to people.'LiNeBrEaKDorey SchmidtLiNeBrEaKOn her husband, Robert	KNITTING and CROCHETING (89%); CHRISTMAS (89%); SEWING and NEEDLECRAFTS (89%); CHRISTIANS and CHRISTIANITY (86%); CARDIOVASCULAR DRUGS (74%); NURSES and NURSING (73%); POETRY (71%); MUSIC INDUSTRY (70%); NURSING HOMES (68%); RELIGION (68%); PROTESTANTS and PROTESTANTISM (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%); MUSIC (52%)  	Social Issues  		TEXAS, USA (72%) UNITED STATES (72%)  	December 25, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081225-QZ-Lubbock-man-finds-knitting-good-way-to-help-others-1225  	Newspaper  	QZ  	2008    	NYSE:LZB  														
The New York Times 		December 25, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	E.P.A.'s Doctor No  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 32  	620 words  	On April 2, 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal Clean Air Act plainly empowered the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases from cars and trucks -- and, by inference, other sources like power plants. LiNeBrEaK  There was great hope at the time that the decision would force President Bush to confront the issue of climate change, which he had largely ignored for six years. Instead, it became the catalyst for a campaign of scientific obfuscation, political flimflam and simple dereliction of duty -- which United States Senator Barbara Boxer aptly described as a ''master plan'' -- to ensure that the administration did as little as possible.LiNeBrEaK  The guiding intelligence behind the master plan has been Vice President Dick Cheney; Mr. Cheney's point man, in turn, has been Stephen Johnson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  LiNeBrEaK  It was Mr. Johnson who refused to grant California a normally routine waiver that would have allowed it to impose its own greenhouse gas standards on cars and trucks. It was Mr. Johnson who was trotted out to explain why the administration could not possibly fulfill the Supreme Court's mandate before leaving office. LiNeBrEaK  And it was Mr. Johnson, in one final burst of negativity, who declared last week that his agency was under no obligation to even consider greenhouse gas emissions when deciding whether to allow a new coal-fired power plant to go forward. LiNeBrEaK  The case involved a proposed power plant in Utah and turned on an arcane regulatory question: whether a Clean Air Act provision requiring the monitoring of carbon-dioxide emissions also meant that they could be controlled. This sort of question would normally prompt careful review. Mr. Johnson responded with a 19-page memorandum that added up to one word: No. LiNeBrEaK  Senator Boxer has gone so far as to call Mr. Johnson's peremptory judgment illegal. LiNeBrEaK  The only thing saving this administration from a total wipeout on clean air issues was a timely decision on Tuesday from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It temporarily reinstated the Clean Air Interstate Rule -- a 2005 regulation aimed at reducing soot and smog, and the most important clean air proposal to emerge from Mr. Bush's E.P.A. In July, the court found the rule deficient on several counts, but on appeal it decided that a flawed rule was better than none at all. LiNeBrEaK  So there we have it. One original initiative in eight years, saved at the bell. That's a poor showing, and the Democrats are hardly alone in hoping for better under an Obama administration. Last week, two prominent moderate Republicans -- William K. Reilly, who ran the E.P.A. under President George H.W. Bush, and William D. Ruckelshaus, who served as administrator under both Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan -- sent a little-noticed but eloquent letter to President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaK  The gist of the letter was that the E.P.A. could be an enormously positive force in the fight against climate change and oil dependency. All it needed was someone who believed in its mission and was prepared to use the laws already on the books. Granting California its waiver, carrying out the Supreme Court decision, regulating emissions from vehicles and power plants -- all this and more, they wrote, could be accomplished with the statutory tools at hand. LiNeBrEaK  This exhortation from two veterans of the environmental wars was designed to encourage not only Mr. Obama, but also Lisa Jackson, the woman he has chosen to run the agency. It was also, however, an arrow aimed at the ideologues who have been running the agency for the last half-dozen years -- and a lament for how little they have done with the weapons Congress gave them.

The New York Times 		December 25, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	The Hum of Green Cleaning  	By STEVEN KURUTZ  	Section D; Column 0; House and Home/Style Desk; CURRENTS TOOLS; Pg. 3  	161 words  	  In the effort to green our lives, there must be some limits: vacuuming, for instance. Isn't the chore odious enough without worrying if it is contributing to global warming? LiNeBrEaK  Apparently not, at least according to AB Electrolux, which last month began marketing the AirMax Oko, a green vacuum, in Europe. Vacuuming for one hour with a standard vacuum  takes 60 percent of the energy that an efficient refrigerator uses in a week, said Cecilia Nord, a company vice president. LiNeBrEaK  The Oko, which is made of 55 percent recycled plastic, cuts energy consumption by a third, she said. And when you're ready to ditch it for a new model, 90 percent of it can be recycled. But being good to the earth has a price: At about $295, it is slightly more expensive than its counterparts, and because the colors of recyclable plastic are limited, it comes only in black. The Oko is available only in Germany and Austria, but Electrolux plans to introduce similar vacuums here in 2009.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		December 25, 2008 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Holiday ham // Pigs and their emissions come under U.N. panel's concerns over climate  		OP-ED; AS I SEE IT; Pg. A11  	712 words  	The year-end news isn't pretty. The dictatorship-dominated United Nations has its eye on our Christmas hams as a key source of allegedly manmade global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We haven't come to grips with agricultural emissions," warned Rajendra Pachauri, head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in a front page article in The New York Times Dec. 4.LiNeBrEaKBefore he gets the U.N. to go after hog flatulence, you'd think Pachauri would make sure that global warming is actually occurring, and that if it is, that it's in fact manmade, or pig-made, and not just due to solar activity or natural cycles. LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press reports that "2008 is on a pace to be a slightly cooler year" than last year. On Dec. 11, the palm trees were snow-covered in New Orleans in the earliest snowfall ever recorded in the city's history. Enjoying a rare blizzard on the Outer Banks, kids were building snowmen on the beach a week before Thanksgiving.LiNeBrEaK"Alaskan glaciers grew this year instead of retreating," reported Investor's Business Daily on Dec. 15, while "Fairbanks had its fourth coldest October in 104 years of records," and "the temperature at Denver International Airport dropped to 18-below-zero on Sunday, breaking the previous record of 14-below set in 1901."LiNeBrEaKStill, environmental ministers from 187 nations gathered in Poland this month to talk about a new treaty to fight global warming in a conference that was scheduled prior to the snowball fights on Bourbon Street.LiNeBrEaKFarm flatulence and belching were "one of the main issues" on the agenda in Poland, reports The New York Times, explaining that "the trillions of farm animals around the world generate 18 percent of the emissions that are raising global temperatures, according to United Nations estimates, more than from cars, buses and airplanes."LiNeBrEaKGoing into this year's Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that frozen ham stocks in the U.S. totaled 160. 5 million pounds, only about 2. 2 million pounds below the record high pre-holiday figure for that date of 162. 66 million pounds.LiNeBrEaKTo control our carbon footprint, says Pachauri, we should "reduce meat consumption." A good world-saving lunch would be an internationally sanctioned broccoli burger, minus the cheese, unless we can find some zero-emitting heifers or develop methane-capturing cow diapers.LiNeBrEaKIn a "Raise a Stink" campaign earlier this year, farmers in New Zealand mailed reeking parcels of sheep and cow manure to members of parliament to protest a proposed flatulence tax. The new levy is designed to empty tens of millions of dollars from the pockets of farmers, raise meat prices, meet the government's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, and pay for research into methane gas emissions from agricultural animals.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Kyoto Protocal, New Zealand is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 5. 2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. "According to government figures, New Zealand's 45 million sheep and cattle burped and farted about 90 percent of the country's methane emissions," reports The London Telegraph.LiNeBrEaKNext year, Sweden is launching a green labeling program for food, so consumers can readily see that a turkey is allegedly better than a pig for keeping the ocean levels down, and that carrots are even better. "Producing a pound of beef creates 11 times as much greenhouse gas emissions as a pound of chicken and 100 times more than a pound of carrots, according to Lantmannen," a Swedish environmental group, reports the Times.LiNeBrEaKThe perfectly correct Christmas dinner? A carrot souffle, minus the eggs, and a "sin tax" on any fuel-burning side dishes that traveled more than 100 miles.LiNeBrEaKOr maybe a big stuffed kangaroo on the Christmas table would please the warming zealots. "It's been long known that kangaroos don't produce methane," explained George Wilson of the Australian Wildlife Service recently in Times.LiNeBrEaKIf Australia's kangaroo population of 35 million was increased to 175 million, and if 42 million sheep and cattle could be removed, Wilson calculates that the country could cut 16 megatons of greenhouse gas emissions, 3 percent of the nation's total.LiNeBrEaKRALPH R.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		December 25, 2008 Thursday 	A mammoth enterprise  		COMMENTARY; Pg. 4  	333 words  	In Ukraine and Siberia, vestiges of circular huts with foundations of huge interlocked jawbones have been discovered. Apparently, the bones of the woolly mammoth were a common building material in Paleolithic times. Archaeologists figure that the tusks of the animal probably supported a covering of mammoth hides sewed together. A mammoth-hunting culture appears to have thrived for tens of thousands of years, until the huge creatures   a type of elephant adapted to extreme cold by a thick coat of fur   became extinct, some 10,000 years ago. LiNeBrEaKIndeed, much else of mammoths still exists as well, including well-preserved frozen remains found in bogs. Siberian tribal peoples have traded with China in mammoth ivory since medieval times. The tusks of the creature were longer and thinner than those of modern elephants, frequently exceeding 10 feet, spiraling outward before curving in to opposed points.LiNeBrEaKIf there were ever an extinct animal that might be a good candidate for cloning, the mammoth, with tons of available DNA, is it. Researchers say that its genome will be mapped out soon and, in 10 or 20 years, mammoths (the word is derived from an ancient Russian word for the animal) could once again bestride the earth.LiNeBrEaKThe question is what will we do with them. Well, we could let them roam. Global warming or not, there s still plenty of sparsely inhabited frozen wasteland in Arctic and sub-Arctic Siberia, Alaska and Canada   and plenty of mammoths  favored grasses and gorses, based on evidence collected from their frozen forebears.LiNeBrEaKThere are, in fact, climate researchers who maintain, on the basis of diminished sunspot activity and other factors, that, rather than warming, the earth is probably headed for prolonged cooling. This would be splendid news for the new mammoths, since it could increase their range, which, back in the day, extended to France and Spain. Would humans see them as a new source of protein adapted to  climate change ? Some descendents might prefer that to tofu.

The Washington Times 		December 25, 2008 Thursday 	Australia emissions plan irks greens;  Rudd lowers advised cuts 	By Kristina Stefanova, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PAGE ONE; A01  	815 words  	Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has infuriated environmentalists with a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as little as 5 percent by the year 2020 - far less than a government panel had recommended.LiNeBrEaKMr. Rudd's announcement last week sparked a wave of protests, including one in which demonstrators copied the tactics of an Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President Bush in Baghdad.LiNeBrEaKMr. Rudd called the government plan "one of the largest and most important structural reforms to our economy in a generation." LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups had hoped that Australia, home to the world's largest coal industry, would cut emissions by at least 25 percent by 2020 from 2000 levels.LiNeBrEaKBut Mr. Rudd said he was worried about the ability of Australian companies, especially the nation's coal industry, to comply with stringent measures during a global economic downturn.LiNeBrEaK"We will be attacked from the far right for taking any action at all," he said. "We will be attacked from parts of the far left for not going far enough by refusing to close down Australia's coal industry. We believe we got the balance just right."LiNeBrEaKProtesters reacted furiously, blockading several federal government buildings across the country.LiNeBrEaKIn Adelaide, demonstrators threw shoes at a man wearing a papier-mache mask modeled after Mr. Rudd. In Hobart, protesters donned masks portraying other federal Labor ministers said to have betrayed Australians.LiNeBrEaKThe government left open the possibility of emission cuts of up to 15 percent. But it left the final target dependent on whether other countries, including major emitters China and India, agree on a new deal at a United Nations-sponsored meeting in Copenhagen next year. The meeting is to produce a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which commits developed nations to curb emissions blamed for disruptive climate change.LiNeBrEaKMr. Rudd said his lower target would "deliver necessary reform to tackle the long-term challenge of climate change, while supporting our economy and securing jobs during this global recession."LiNeBrEaKThe prime minister came to power in November 2007, in part because of his environmental promises, and he accepted the Kyoto accord as his first official act.LiNeBrEaKIn the year leading up to this month's announcement of the 5 percent to 15 percent target, many had expected Mr. Rudd to adapt a 25 percent to 40 percent curb recommended by an independent, government-commissioned study.LiNeBrEaKEconomist Ross Garnaut, who wrote the report, warned that Australia's failure to enact more stringent measures to deal with climate change will cause it to loose iconic attractions such as the Great Barrier Reef.LiNeBrEaKClimate change poses a "diabolical policy problem - harder than any other issue of high importance that has come before our polity in living memory," Mr. Garnaut said.LiNeBrEaK"Without early and strong action some time before 2020, we will realize that we've indelibly surrendered to forces that have moved beyond our control."LiNeBrEaKDespite the criticism, the U.N. climate chief, Yvo de Boer, said Australia should be applauded for its efforts.LiNeBrEaK"Australia has now put a figure on the table, something countries have been calling for a long time," Mr. de Boer told ABC Radio's "AM" program. "Now the time begins when we can compare the commitments that different countries are willing to make and see if they measure up to each other."LiNeBrEaKThe new targets are part of a broader emissions-trading program set to begin by July 1, 2010, if Parliament approves.LiNeBrEaKThe carbon-trading plan would require about 1,000 Australian companies emitting more than 25,000 tons of carbon to buy permits to cover their emissions, either in Australia or in international markets.LiNeBrEaKUp to 25 percent of permits would be given to industries competing in international markets that don't impose a carbon tax. Big polluters such as petroleum refining, pulp and paper, plastics and glass could apply for free permits.LiNeBrEaKCoal mining is not eligible for free permits but the industry is to receive federal aid to help mines reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaK"No one gets a free ride under this scheme," said Climate Change Minister Penny Wong. "We have put in place assistance for Australian firms who are exposed on world markets and who bear significant costs under the scheme.LiNeBrEaK"But ... they all have to contribute, they all have to pay a price to some proportion for the pollution they put into theLiNeBrEaKatmosphere, for the first time ... They haven't had to do that before"LiNeBrEaKWhile Australia has relatively low overall greenhouse gas emissions for an industrialized country, it is one of the world's highest per-capita emitters, mainly because of coal.LiNeBrEaKCoal miners in New South Wales alone, Australia's most populous state, export enough coal to supply New Zealand, Indonesia and Singapore with all their electricity.LiNeBrEaKAlong with neighboring Queensland and Victoria, New South Wales produces enough coal to provide Australia with 83 percent of its power.

The Washington Post 		December 25, 2008 Thursday   Regional Edition	Faster Climate Change Feared;  New Report Points to Accelerated Melting, Longer Drought 	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	1192 words  	The United States faces the possibility of much more rapid climate change by the end of the century than previous studies have suggested, according to a new report led by the U.S. Geological Survey.LiNeBrEaKThe survey -- which was commissioned by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and issued this month -- expands on the 2007 findings of the United Nations Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change. Looking at factors such as rapid sea ice loss in the Arctic and prolonged drought in the Southwest, the new assessment suggests that earlier projections may have underestimated the climatic shifts that could take place by 2100.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the assessment also suggests that some other feared effects of global warming are not likely to occur by the end of the century, such as an abrupt release of methane from the seabed and permafrost or a shutdown of the Atlantic Ocean circulation system that brings warm water north and colder water south. But the report projects an amount of potential sea level rise during that period that may be greater than what other researchers have anticipated, as well as a shift to a more arid climate pattern in the Southwest by mid-century. LiNeBrEaKThirty-two scientists from federal and non-federal institutions contributed to the report, which took nearly two years to complete. The Climate Change Science Program, which was established in 1990, coordinates the climate research of 13 different federal agencies.LiNeBrEaKTom Armstrong, senior adviser for global change programs at USGS, said the report "shows how quickly the information is advancing" on potential climate shifts. The prospect of abrupt climate change, he said, "is one of those things that keeps people up at night, because it's a low-probability but high-risk scenario. It's unlikely to happen in our lifetimes, but if it were to occur, it would be life-changing."LiNeBrEaKIn one of the report's most worrisome findings, the agency estimates that in light of recent ice sheet melting, global sea level rise could be as much as four feet by 2100. The IPCC had projected a sea level rise of no more than 1. 5 feet by that time, but satellite data over the past two years show the world's major ice sheets are melting much more rapidly than previously thought. The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are now losing an average of 48 cubic miles of ice a year, equivalent to twice the amount of ice that exists in the Alps.LiNeBrEaKKonrad Steffen, who directs the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder and was lead author on the report's chapter on ice sheets, said the models the IPCC used did not factor in some of the dynamics that scientists now understand about ice sheet melting. Among other things, Steffen and his collaborators have identified a process of "lubrication," in which warmer ocean water gets in underneath coastal ice sheets and accelerates melting.LiNeBrEaK"This has to be put into models," said Steffen, who organized a conference last summer in St. Petersburg, Russia, as part of an effort to develop more sophisticated ice sheet models. "What we predicted is sea level rise will be higher, but I have to be honest, we cannot model it for 2100 yet."LiNeBrEaKStill, Armstrong said the report "does take a step forward from where the IPCC was," especially in terms of ice sheet melting.LiNeBrEaKScientists also looked at the prospect of prolonged drought over the next 100 years. They said it is impossible to determine yet whether human activity is responsible for the drought the Southwestern United States has experienced over the past decade, but every indication suggests the region will become consistently drier in the next several decades. Richard Seager, a senior research scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said that nearly all of the 24 computer models the group surveyed project the same climatic conditions for the North American Southwest, which includes Mexico.LiNeBrEaK"If the models are correct, it will transition in the coming years and decades to a more arid climate, and that transition is already underway," Seager said, adding that such conditions would probably include prolonged droughts lasting more than a decade.LiNeBrEaKThe current models cover broad swaths of landscape, and Seager said scientists need to work on developing versions that can make projections on a much smaller scale. "That's what the water managers out there really need," he said. Current models "don't give them the hard numbers they need."LiNeBrEaKArmstrong said the need for "downscaled models" is one of the challenges facing the federal government, along with better coordination among agencies on the issue of climate change. When it comes to abrupt climate shifts, he said, "We need to be prepared to deal with it in terms of policymaking, keeping in mind it's a low-probability, high-risk scenario. That said, there are really no policies in place to deal with abrupt climate change."LiNeBrEaKRichard Moss, who directed the Climate Change Science Program's coordination office between 2000 and 2006 and now serves as vice president and managing director for climate change at the World Wildlife Fund-U.S., welcomed the new report but called it "way overdue."LiNeBrEaK"There is finally a greater flow of climate science from the administration," Moss said, noting that the report was originally scheduled to come out in the summer of 2007. "It really is showing the potential for abrupt climate change is real."LiNeBrEaKThe report is reassuring, however, on the prospects for some potentially drastic effects -- such as a huge release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, that is now locked deep in the seabed and underneath the Arctic permafrost. That is unlikely to occur in the near future, the scientists said.LiNeBrEaK"It's unlikely that we're going to see an abrupt change in methane over the next hundred years, but we should worry about it over a longer time frame," said Ed Brook, the lead author of the methane chapter and a geosciences professor at Oregon State University. "All of these places where methane is stored are vulnerable to leaking."LiNeBrEaKBy the end the century, Brook said, the amount of methane escaping from natural sources such as the Arctic tundra and waterlogged soils in warmer regions "could possibly double," but that would still be less than the current level of human-generated methane emissions. Over the course of the next thousand years, he added, methane hydrates stored deep in the seabed could be released: "Once you start melting there, you can't really take it back."LiNeBrEaKIn the near term, Brook said, more precise monitoring of methane levels worldwide would give researchers a better sense of the risk of a bigger atmospheric release. "We don't know exactly how much methane is coming out all over the world," he said. "That's why monitoring is important."LiNeBrEaKWhile predictions remain uncertain, Steffen said cutting emissions linked to global warming represents one of the best strategies for averting catastrophic changes.LiNeBrEaK"We have to act very fast, by understanding better and by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, because it's a large-scale experiment that can get out of hand," Steffen said. "So we don't want that to happen."

The new refrigerant, hydrofluoro-olefin (HFO)-1234yf, came through a joint development agreement between Dupont and Honeywell. Dupont claims the use of the new refrigerant in new cars has the potential to save more than 2,200 million litres -- or about 590 million gallons of fuel -- a year.

The economy has the chills, there's a ruthless cold going around and people are worried about their jobs, their kids' education, their retirement. Christmas won't be as elaborate this year, and the gym membership might have to lapse, pre-empting those New Year's resolutions. The post-holiday sales will be overrun with people exchanging gifts for cash.LiNeBrEaKThis would be a good year for a merciful Mother Nature to bless us with one of those gentle Decembers that really drives home the point about global warming. LiNeBrEaKFat chance.LiNeBrEaKInstead, we're expecting enough snow to ice the record for the wettest year in history. We've already witnessed the coldest Bears game ever. The mercury barely reached 4 degrees on Monday.LiNeBrEaKCar windows and garage doors are frozen shut. Every night, we have to play musical parking spaces so the plows can do our street (or not). Our fingers are so cold, we're afraid they'll snap off if we bump them on something. We can't even feel our toes.LiNeBrEaKThe sidewalks are treacherous, but someone has to walk the dog.LiNeBrEaKOur cars keep getting stuck in the snow that turned to slush that turned to ice that got covered with more snow that turned to slush, etc.LiNeBrEaKFriends in Florida keep calling to brag about how nice the beaches are this time of year (or to complain that it's in the 50s). It doesn't help that the TV newscasts keep showing those pictures of Barack Obama's Hawaiian Christmas hideout.LiNeBrEaKThose of us who have to work are weighing our options: Drive to work and risk having to crawl home in a blinding snowstorm, or take mass transit and turn into a popsicle at the bus stop.LiNeBrEaKHere's how to stay warm:LiNeBrEaKInstead of brushing past that Streetwise vendor on your way out of Starbucks, buy an extra cup of hot chocolate and make a gift of it.LiNeBrEaKThat stranger pleading for spare change could use a couple of bucks. Don't have anything smaller than a twenty? Make his day, and yours.LiNeBrEaKTip your cabbie generously. God knows you're grateful for the ride.LiNeBrEaKIf you don't have money to spare, you can still help melt the misery.LiNeBrEaKShovel your neighbor's sidewalk. (If you have a snowblower and a teenager, you can get the whole block done.)LiNeBrEaKWalk your neighbor's dog.LiNeBrEaKDon't shove to get on the bus or train. Smile. We're all in this together.LiNeBrEaKYield the right-of-way, especially to pedestrians.LiNeBrEaKLet the other guy have the primo parking spot.LiNeBrEaKHelp that poor fool get her car unstuck.LiNeBrEaKStay home.LiNeBrEaKTurn on the oven and bake your colleagues a pan of brownies.LiNeBrEaKFix yourself a nice hot cup of tea and call your mom.LiNeBrEaKSurrender to the kids' pleadings to go out and play, if only for a few minutes. Your nose will be frozen in no time. But inside, you'll be warm.

LiNeBrEaKThe association donated $3,000 toward the program, and individual officers and local businesses and corporations also donated.LiNeBrEaKGifts included bicycles, board games, dolls, action figures and sports equipment.LiNeBrEaKOfficers began delivering the baskets at 7 a.m. Wednesday and were greeted with lots of smiles and some tears, Officer Jeff Thomason said.LiNeBrEaKThe program has been run for more than 30 years.LiNeBrEaK"It's one of our ways of giving back to the community," Thomason said. "We see there is a need, and we just want to make people happier at this time of the year."LiNeBrEaK  Harry HarrisLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaKreduce your carbon footprint: Tired of the same old New Year's resolutions aimed at losing weight, eating better and going to the gym?LiNeBrEaKThe Ecology Center in Berkeley has a challenge for you that won't require giving up pizza or chocolate cake.LiNeBrEaKThe center is asking more residents to participate in the recently launched Climate Change Action Project, which brings together small groups of residents to find ways to reduce their carbon footprints while saving money and building community.LiNeBrEaKGroup members are using a curriculum and workbook called "Low Carbon Diet: A 30 Day Program to Lose 50,000 Pounds (of carbon dioxide)."LiNeBrEaKResidents are making simple household energy efficiency improvements, such as sealing air leaks and unplugging appliances when not in use, and using public transit to achieve their goals.LiNeBrEaKBy the end of the monthlong program, most groups have achieved a net reduction of 50,000 pounds of carbon dioxide and reduced their household utility bills substantially, Ecology Center officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe Low Carbon Diet workbook explains that the average American household generates 55,000 pounds of carbon dioxide annually.LiNeBrEaKIn contrast, the average German household generates 27,000 pounds and the average Swedish household contributes 15,000, Ecology Center officials said.LiNeBrEaKEach activity in the workbook corresponds to a particular reduction in carbon footprint pounds.LiNeBrEaKFor example, replacing five incandescent bulbs with fluorescent bulbs results in a 500-pound reduction in carbon emissions. Setting the thermostat to 65-68 degrees during the day and to 55-58 degrees at night results in a 1,400-pound reduction, center officials said.LiNeBrEaKParticipants go to four weekly meetings to calculate their carbon footprints, determine waste reduction goals, and create action plans that lead to small and large changes in their households, workplaces, neighborhoods, schools, congregations, and social, political and civic groups, Ecology Center officials said.LiNeBrEaKBay Area residents are invited to join already-formed groups or to form groups of their own.LiNeBrEaKAnyone interested in facilitating a group can gather 5 to 10 friends, neighbors, co-workers or family members and determine a meeting time. No special knowledge or experience is needed.LiNeBrEaKThe Ecology Center will provide a facilitators' packet, relevant tools, resources, and ongoing support.LiNeBrEaKThe Ecology Center is a nonprofit the community for the past 40 years.LiNeBrEaKFor more information, go to www.ecologycenter.org .LiNeBrEaK  Kristin BenderLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaK$120,000 grant for Food and Housing Project: The California Wellness Foundation has approved a $120,000 grant for the Berkeley Food and Housing Project, a 38-year-old social service agency that helps homeless women and their children.LiNeBrEaKThe grant will help the nonprofit offer case management to 75 homeless women, and health care referrals and health benefits advocacy to at least 300 homeless women annually for the next three years, Executive Director Terrie Light said.LiNeBrEaKThe grant comes as the agency is seeing a 30 percent increase in the number of women seeking meals and help, Associate Director Geoffrey Green said.LiNeBrEaKThe nonprofit provides 197,000 meals annually to homeless and hungry people through its feeding programs at Berkeley's Multi-Service Center, Russell Street Residence, Men's Overnight Shelter and other sites.LiNeBrEaKThe agency also helps roughly 160 people move from the streets to permanent housing each year.LiNeBrEaKThe agency has received other gifts and grants recently.LiNeBrEaKBayer USA Foundation gave $10,000 for the Men's and Women's Overnight Shelters; The Thomas J.

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	YOUR LETTERS  		OPINIONS; Pg. A13  	675 words  	Kroger decision is disappointingLiNeBrEaKRe "Kroger drops plan to build Dayton store," Dec. 13: East End Community Services, a nonprofit organization serving the Twin Towers and surrounding neighborhoods in East Dayton, is extremely disappointed by the Kroger Co.'s unfortunate decision to withdraw from its plan to build a state-of-the-art store at Wayne and Wyoming streets.LiNeBrEaKAmong other losses to our community, the decision cost about 150 new jobs in East Dayton. This is devastating at a time when unemployment in Dayton is growing daily. Kroger should look for ways to mitigate the loss for Dayton. LiNeBrEaKWe want to commend and applaud City of Dayton commissioners and administrators for going to extraordinary means to secure options on nearly all of the properties that were needed for the Kroger development.LiNeBrEaKThe city of Dayton staff did in about 10 months what the Kroger private developer was unable to do over the course of nearly four years.LiNeBrEaKCity Hall demonstrated total commitment to making the Kroger development happen, only to be rebuffed by Kroger at the eleventh hour.LiNeBrEaKWe are grateful for the city's continued leadership in pursuing another appropriate and more viable commercial development for Wayne and Wyoming streets.LiNeBrEaKIn partnership with the association of Twin Towers citizen leaders, we encourage all property owners to continue working with the city through the end of 2009, allowing the city more time to develop other opportunities for the Wayne/Wyoming corner.LiNeBrEaKJan Lepore-JentlesonLiNeBrEaKDaytonLiNeBrEaKMs. Lepore-Jentleson is executive director of East End Community Services. LiNeBrEaKClimate letter full of misconceptionsLiNeBrEaKRe "Dyer's climate rant doesn't make sense," Dec. 17: The letter writer uses several gross misconceptions while attempting to refute Gwynne Dyer's commentary ("4 harsh truths are clear about climate change," Dec. 4).LiNeBrEaKDespite a cooling over the last 10 years or so, 2008 is still the 10th warmest year since the 1850s. Paraphrasing Myles Allen of Oxford University, "Globally, this year would have been considered warm as recently as the 1970s or 1980s, but our Victorian ancestors would have considered it a scorcher."LiNeBrEaKThere will be fluctuations due to other factors, such as La Ni&ntilde;a and El Ni&ntilde;o; however, the long-term trend is still warming.LiNeBrEaKThe effects of water vapor in the air (humidity) should not be confused with the effects of clouds.LiNeBrEaKWater vapor is a gas, transparent to radiation in the visible spectrum (including sunlight), but not to radiation from warm objects on the Earth; it is, indeed, a greenhouse gas.LiNeBrEaKClouds consist of water droplets and are quite reflective, thereby limiting the amount of radiation reaching the surface.LiNeBrEaKFinally, water vapor and CO2 do not act independently. Unfortunately, warmer air (from increases in atmospheric CO2 , for example) holds more water vapor.LiNeBrEaKThis can set up a vicious cycle of runaway global temperatures.LiNeBrEaKJerry E.

What defines sensible? Is it those controls with which you agree, even if your opinion is in the minority ?LiNeBrEaKTeepen would have us believe that - with the passage of more firearms controls - criminals who traffic in firearms are going to obey these new laws.LiNeBrEaKI invite Teepen to review the case of Warren v. District of Columbia, 1981, and DeShaney v. Winnebago City, 1989. In essence, the courts have ruled that no government agency is required to defend any private citizen. So why shouldn't I be able to defend myself?LiNeBrEaKI do not carry a firearm because I'm afraid; I carry a firearm so that I do not have to be afraid to go about my daily business.LiNeBrEaKThe right to bear arms guaranteed by the Second Amendment comes before the right of protection from unreasonable searches and seizures, protection from selfincrimination, and the right to a speedy trial.

The Denver Post 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	More scary than global warming  	Al Knight Denver Post Columnist  	Pg. B-13  	603 words  	President-elect Barack Obama is now safely vacationing in sunny Hawaii, far from the grip of the current U.S. cold wave. While many shivering Americans may have recently experienced second thoughts about the looming menace of global warming, Obama clearly is not open to such doubts.LiNeBrEaKHis recent Cabinet appointments make it clear that when it comes to the issue of global warming, his administration will be both single-minded and aggressive in addressing the concern. He is clearly prepared to use strong language in marshalling public support for his program but that doesn't mean the public has to believe everything he says. LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect is well known for his ability to turn a phrase as well as borrow a phrase. In the past, he has taken his lumps for borrowing phrases. Those incidents may ultimately appear to be minor transgressions compared to important comments Obama recently made regarding his plans to put America in the forefront of the fight to "save the planet from global warming."LiNeBrEaKObama's pronouncements on the subject could have been penned by Al Gore, the former vice president and chief tub-thumper for the global warming alarmists.LiNeBrEaK"The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear," Obama said. "Sea levels are rising, coastlines are shrinking, we've seen record drought, spreading famine and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season."LiNeBrEaKA number of commentators seized upon these remarks and have disputed each of Obama's assertions. It has been noted that the main effect on coastlines is traceable to the sinking of soils rather than to higher sea levels and that famines are not worse than ever. Obama's claim about hurricanes has been disputed in two ways. First, the storms are not getting stronger, and second, there is no direct link between "global warming" and those that have developed.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect is about to become the most powerful person on the planet and it therefore matters if he is right when it comes to the threat posed by global warming. If he is right, then it is obviously a matter of some urgency to decide what should be done about it. If he is wrong, as he clearly is in his most recent statements, then his policies to address the concern are very likely wrong as well.LiNeBrEaKAs the spokesman for the Democratic left, Obama dislikes carbon emissions, big cars, big coal and big oil. All of that is fine if one can make the case that there are better ways of producing energy and that these ways are competitive with more traditional ways of doing things. Under such an approach, one may take into account such factors as cost, efficiency and safety. In such a calm setting, it is OK to note that the nation's windmill farms are actually producing just a fraction of their design capacity and that the solar industry can't compete with $40 per barrel oil. It is OK to note it will be a long time before a replacement is found for coal that currently produces half of the nation's electricity.LiNeBrEaKAll of this rationality becomes a nuisance, however, if it is simply announced that time is of the essence and the future of the planet depends upon hasty action that may well cripple an already fragile U.S. economy.LiNeBrEaKBig chunks of the U.S. population took heart when the president-elect made a series of tempered appointments to his Cabinet, especially in the area of foreign policy.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the appointments recently made affecting issues of energy and the environment are, in contrast, every bit as scary as the specter of global warming.LiNeBrEaKAl Knight of Buena Vista (alknight@LiNeBrEaKmindspring.com) is a former member of The Post's editorial-page staff.

The Idaho Statesman (Boise)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	Green investors urge Idaho Power to cut emissions: The utility has drawn criticism for using coal from Wyoming and Nevada for half of its power.  	Rocky Barker, The Idaho Statesman, Boise  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	323 words  	Dec. 24--Green investor groups have filed a shareholder resolution with IdaCorp urging the Boise company to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe resolution was filed by As You Sow Foundation and Calvert Asset Management, members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of faith-based and socially responsible investors with $110 billion in combined assets. LiNeBrEaKTrillium Asset Management, which has a Boise office, filed a similar resolution. It asks that IdaCorp, Idaho Power's parent company, to present a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by Sept. 30, 2009.LiNeBrEaKIdaho Power depends on coal from Wyoming and Nevada for 50 percent of its power. The groups criticize the company for not aggressively developing renewable resources like wind, solar and geothermal.LiNeBrEaK"Shareholders are particularly concerned that IdaCorp's heavy reliance on coal makes it vulnerable to financial risk," said Michael Passoff, associate director of As You Sow, based in San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKIdaCorp is reviewing the resolution, said Pat Harrington, corporate secretary of the utility holding company. The resolution will come up for a vote at the annual investors meeting in May.LiNeBrEaK"This is early in the process," Harrington said. "We haven't really developed a response to it."LiNeBrEaKHe pointed out that Idaho Power's hydroelectric dams, which account for 46 percent of its power source, produce relatively carbon-free power and rank the utility among the lowest in the country for greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKRocky Barker: 377-6484	EMISSIONS (92%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); SHAREHOLDERS (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (75%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (75%); ETHICAL INVESTING (73%); RELIGION (72%); SOLAR ENERGY (70%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (67%); DAMS and RESERVOIRS (51%)  	General  		BOISE, ID, USA (88%) IDAHO, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081224-ID-Green-investors-urge-Idaho-Power-to-cut-emissions-1224  	Newspaper  	ID  	2008 The Idaho Statesman   	NYSE:IDA  	IDAHO POWER CO (90%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (65%)  		INTERFAITH CENTER ON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY (58%)  											
Japan Times (Tokyo)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Climate-change meeting stalls  	Japan Times, Tokyo  	COMMENTARY  	469 words  	Dec. 24--THERE IS NEAR-UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT -- the few stubborn holdouts will likely never be convinced -- that climate change is real and the world must respond aggressively to it. The existing framework for action, the Kyoto Protocol, expires in 2012 and its effectiveness has been limited by the failure of key countries, notably the United States, to ratify the treaty, and its exclusion of other significant polluters from obligations to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKOn Dec. 12, delegates from nearly 190 countries concluded two weeks of meetings to discuss a new framework to tackle climate change. They at least agreed that developed nations should continue to take on the duty of fulfilling goals for greenhouse-gas emissions cuts after 2012. But, sadly, real commitments to reduce such emissions were lacking. This is a distressing lack of progress since delegates reached virtually the same outcome at a meeting last year in Bali.LiNeBrEaKThe failure to move forward reflects the difficulty of translating general agreement into concrete action. Accepting specific commitments will be costly and there is a temptation to let other countries pay the costs, especially when the world is facing a deep recession. There are always cases to be made for "some other country" to be forced to bear the burden, but this bargaining strategy only blocks an international deal since one country's inaction encourages others to do the same.LiNeBrEaKThe inclination to hold back has been reinforced by the coming change of administrations in the U.S. All are now waiting to see what President-elect Barack Obama will do, but he does not take office until next month, putting the process on hold. To his credit, Mr. Obama has called climate change "a matter of urgency" and promised to seek legislation to cut greenhouse-gas emissions sharply -- a return to 1990 levels by 2020 and a further 80 percent cut by 2050 -- and to increase U.S. participation in global initiatives.LiNeBrEaKThat pledge was not enough to break the deadlock in Poznan. The result is that a draft treaty is unlikely to be ready next year as planned, but a "policy framework" should be in place and ready for ratification and should go into force in 2013.

Yes, Ohio, there is a Santa Claus ..." LiNeBrEaKA reader suggests that members of Congress should wear uniforms, like NASCAR drivers, so that we will know who their corporate sponsors are.LiNeBrEaKMany of those in Congress should also wear logos representing the teachers' unions, environmentalist extremists and other special interests.LiNeBrEaKIf there are still any educators or others who think that both sides of an issue should be presented, the nonprofit Heartland Institute has put together Al Gore's movie, "An Inconvenient Truth," and the British Channel 4 program, "The Great Global Warming Swindle," in one package with two DVDs.LiNeBrEaKPeople who are impressed by how many of Barack Obama's advisers have Ivy League degrees seem not to remember how many people with Ivy League degrees mismanaged the Vietnam war and how many people with Ivy League degrees mismanaged economic policy during the Great Depression of the 1930s.LiNeBrEaKThe fact that sales at Starbucks are going down, while sales at McDonald's are going up, shows that people are adjusting to economic adversity by cutting back their spending.LiNeBrEaKOnly in Congress do people adjust to economic adversity and growing deficits by spending more money.LiNeBrEaKFederal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke seems to be pretty popular thus far. My own preference is for Federal Reserve chairmen who are unpopular.LiNeBrEaKWhen Paul Volcker was chairman of the Fed back in the 1980s, he was hated like poison, but his policies finally broke the back of the inflation that had been out of control for years - not without some painful costs, but few benefits can be gotten without costs.LiNeBrEaKIt is fascinating to see that politicians whose interventions in mortgage lending have created a disaster in financial institutions are now moving on to intervene in the automobile industry.LiNeBrEaKWal-Mart has done more for poor people than any 10 liberals, at least nine of whom are almost guaranteed to hate Wal-Mart.LiNeBrEaKRonald Reagan had a vision of America. Barack Obama has a vision of Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKOne of the signs of how easily we are bullied by small and vocal groups is how many universities, among other institutions, dare not even refer to the Christmas vacation but instead refer to "the winter holiday."LiNeBrEaKAs American incomes have risen over the years, liberals have kept changing the definition of "poverty." Otherwise, the dwindling numbers of people who could be called "poor" would take away the liberals' main claim to influence and power.LiNeBrEaKIf you didn't know that Gov. Rod Blagojevich was a Democrat, you are unlikely to find out from the mainstream media.LiNeBrEaKBut, if you didn't know that recently convicted Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska was a Republican, the media made sure to tell you.LiNeBrEaKRecent covers on Time magazine and Newsweek - as well as the stories inside - suggest that these magazines are as giddy as teenagers are over some rock stars, when it comes to Obama.LiNeBrEaKGov. Blagojevich may have inadvertently done us a big favor by discrediting the idea that we should look up to politicians as our protectors and saviors.LiNeBrEaKThomas Sowell is a columnist with Creators Syndicate.

The New York Times 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   The New York Times on the Web	In Reversal, Court Allows a Bush Plan on Pollution  	By FELICITY BARRINGER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 13  	656 words  	A federal appeals court in Washington reversed itself on Tuesday and temporarily reinstated a Bush administration plan to reduce pollution from coal-fired power plants. LiNeBrEaK  In July, the court struck down the rule, saying the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded its authority in devising a new emissions-trading system to reduce that pollution, and must rewrite the rule to fix its ''fundamental flaws.'' Environmentalists criticized the decision as a major setback for clean air. LiNeBrEaK  In Tuesday's decision, the court said that having a flawed rule temporarily in place was better than having no rule at all. The agency must still revise the rule but has no deadline for doing so.  LiNeBrEaK  The regulation, known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule, had been the centerpiece of the Bush administration's re-engineering of the Clean Air Act. It  set significant targets to reduce pollution around the power plants and in the downwind states whose air quality was affected by the emissions.LiNeBrEaK  Tuesday's decision, by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, means that levels of smog-forming nitrogen oxides must be reduced in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia beginning Jan. 1. Levels of sulfur dioxide, closely associated with the formation of deadly fine soot particles, must be reduced beginning a year later. LiNeBrEaK  Environmentalists applauded the decision, saying it could form the basis for stronger controls to be drafted by the new administration. Industry groups were relieved to know what rules would cover their operations for the moment, but were pleased that the court's original objections to the rule were unchanged.LiNeBrEaK  The court's second thoughts about striking down the rule came in response to complaints from state regulators, environmental groups, some utilities and the E.P.A. itself. LiNeBrEaK  Judge Judith W. Rogers, concurring with the court's decision, said eliminating the rule ''would have serious adverse implications for public health and the environment,'' because ''the rule has become so intertwined'' with the overall architecture of current Clean Air Act protections.LiNeBrEaK  Both the new Congress and President-elect Barack Obama are expected to tackle the problem of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. That will include determining how the new controls on those emissions should dovetail with controls for mercury, a toxic pollutant, and with the carbon dioxide emissions that are associated with climate change.LiNeBrEaK  Bob Meyers, who heads the Air and Radiation office at the E.P.A., said that he was disappointed that the court did not reconsider its underlying objections to the rule. The regulation, he said, ''was one of the main programs the administration was able to put forward to improve public health and the environment.''LiNeBrEaK  He added, ''To the extent that today's hearing restores it -- by removing immediate threat of vacating a rule -- it is a good day.''LiNeBrEaK  Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group, said in an e-mail message that his group applauded the court for ''providing greater near-term certainty for pollution reduction programs and emission markets, and maintaining important health and environmental benefits.''LiNeBrEaK  But, he added, ''It's impossible to predict what comes next.''LiNeBrEaK  Vicki Patton, the deputy general counsel with the Environmental Defense Fund, said that, while the E.P.A. must redesign the rule to meet the court's objections, ''the baton has been handed off to President-elect Obama and his team.'' LiNeBrEaK  The rule, Ms. Patton said, ''provides a foundation for building a more comprehensive program that protects human health from the full sweep of pollutants that are emitted from coal-fired power plants.''LiNeBrEaK  On Monday, the E.P.A. issued a report on fine-particle pollution that showed that the number of geographic areas failing to meet federal standards had nearly doubled, to 58, including part or all of 211 counties in 25 states.

ELL  	779 words  	529 switch penalizedLiNeBrEaKIn a story on the Oppenheimer Core Bond fund losses, you quoted an investment adviser who advised parents to switch their investments out of the troubled Oppenheimer Fund into a money market fund ("Manager of 529 plan assesses investments," Dec. 20).LiNeBrEaKWhat your story did not tell readers was that the fund was set up to penalize investors who wanted to switch out of the losing fund. I know because I tried. The state told me I would have to pay a 5. 5 percent penalty to switch out of the bad fund. LiNeBrEaKIt seems to me that the state arranged a coercive situation designed to force folks to keep their money in the rip-off fund or face thousands of dollars in fees if they switched.LiNeBrEaKThat is not a standard arrangement. Please investigate further about why the state made it so hard to move money out of the bad fund.LiNeBrEaKJOHN WILLIAMSLiNeBrEaKNorthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKRed flag was obviousLiNeBrEaKThe disaster of the Oppenheimer Core Bond fund where savers lost 38 percent of their short term savings, shouldn't have happened.LiNeBrEaKI found it odd that there wasn't someone at Oppenheimer checking the performance of the fund. A red flag should have come up in the first week of September when the fund fell off the cliff and followed stocks down.LiNeBrEaKSomeone at Oppenheimer should have noticed. All they needed was a computer.LiNeBrEaKNICK OATMANLiNeBrEaKMilwaukieLiNeBrEaKLeash law often violatedLiNeBrEaKYour editorial about dog bites was very interesting ("Going to the dogs," Dec. 20).LiNeBrEaKWe know all about it since my wife was bitten by a "friendly" (according to the owner) dog while taking a walk. She was barely within reach of the dog and the bite was just a random, unexplained attack.LiNeBrEaKThe owners of dogs and the city of Portland need to do something about all the unleashed dogs we continually encounter when we are on the Wildwood trail and other city park trails.LiNeBrEaKThese "friendly" dogs are not always so friendly and scare anyone who has had a dog biting experience.LiNeBrEaKWe frequently ask these owners to hold onto their dogs as we pass and many cannot even get control of them. When we point out the leash law on these trails, many of the owners are offended.LiNeBrEaKWhen will the city realize this growing problem in its parks and when will these otherwise law-abiding citizens start following the law?LiNeBrEaKJAMES POLLOCKLiNeBrEaKNorthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKClimate change is realLiNeBrEaKRegarding the letter from Del Ball, "Witness warming myth" (Dec. 20):LiNeBrEaKI am always disappointed when I read letters denouncing the science of climate change and making incomplete and inaccurate statements of these so-called benefits of increased carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThese are "parroted" statements that come from ultra-conservative sources.LiNeBrEaKBall states that over 3,000 scientists have signed a petition that humans do not cause global warming. So what? There are hundreds of thousands of scientists who have signed petitions with the opposite opinion.LiNeBrEaKI'm sure there are scientists who still believe that the earth is flat, and the sun spins around the Earth. There have always been those who refuse to believe good science and prefer crackpot theories.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, the beliefs regarding climate change tend to sort out as a partisan issue. The more [politically] conservative a person might be, the more tenacious the denials of scientific fact.LiNeBrEaKAn objective lay person needs to read as much as possible about this subject and after carefully examining the scientific credentials of spokespersons, their political ideology and other subjective motivations, decide on the scientific truth of this matter.LiNeBrEaKBARBARA WILSONLiNeBrEaKBeavertonLiNeBrEaKNo handout for KennedyLiNeBrEaKCaroline Kennedy is, by all accounts, a smart, decent and capable woman. There is no reason why she shouldn't enter politics if she chooses.LiNeBrEaKThat doesn't mean she should be handed Hillary Clinton's soon to-be-vacated U.S. Senate seat because she is a "Kennedy."LiNeBrEaKRunning for office and getting a handout are two different things.LiNeBrEaKCaroline Kennedy has failed to vote in many elections since she registered in the city in 1988, including votes for the Senate seat she hopes to fill. I believe she wants to continue to ride on the Obama bandwagon.LiNeBrEaKLets hope New York's governor shows no signs of Chicago-style politics.LiNeBrEaKJUDY FRALIA-MANTELLOLiNeBrEaKBeavertonLiNeBrEaKElect, don't appointLiNeBrEaKWhy do we allow anyone to appoint someone to any elected position?

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	SORRY, BLACKBURN: SOCIAL SECURITY INDEFENSIBLE  		OPINION; Pg. 10A  	280 words  	Tom Blackburn illustrated his ignorance of markets, investing, and our Social Security system in his column, ("Dodging a Social Security bailout," Dec. 8).LiNeBrEaKFirst, how is the current system viable when you consider that it takes money from people and gives it to others as part of their retirement benefit and any remainder is spent as part of the general budget? There is no investment, and therefore no way for the money to grow. How can you possibly defend such a system? It will eventually fail. Anyone who thinks it won't is a fool. LiNeBrEaKSecond, Mr. Blackburn's bias shows through his timing. Stories that bash privatizing Social Security appear only during bear (stocks go lower) markets. Also, I notice that there are very few global warming stories these days. Hmmm.LiNeBrEaKThird, what I find really amusing is that Mr. Blackburn thinks that everyone will invest all monies in a single investment category. Anyone who put all his money in WorldCom or Enron deserved what he got. Does Mr. Blackburn invest his money that way? This may be news to him, but most people don't invest that way either.LiNeBrEaKIf Social Security is such a "good deal," then I presume that you send funds that you could invest in stocks or other investment vehicles (I don't mean cars) to the Social Security Administration. To broaden his knowledge of investing, I recommend that Mr. Blackburn study the term diversification. It's synonymous with "don't put all your eggs in one basket."LiNeBrEaKFor the record, no matter how often people repeat it, President Bush never, ever suggested that we move the entire Social Security system to the stock market. Why does Mr. Blackburn perpetuate the myth that he has?LiNeBrEaKSTEVEN SCOTTLiNeBrEaKWellington	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); SOCIAL SECURITY (90%); US SOCIAL SECURITY (78%); PERSONAL FINANCE (73%); BUDGET (56%); GLOBAL WARMING (54%)  	SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (55%); NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE) (55%); NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (55%)  			March 2, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	Give no eco-dollars to tyrants  	ANDREW P. MORRISS  	COMMENTARY; Pg. 7  	639 words  	CHAMPAIGN, Ill.LiNeBrEaKCHINA wants richer nations to pay a fixed percentage of their gross domestic product to help developing countries reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, with a suggested contribution of a mere 1 percent for a total of $300 billion/year. China also wants to create an international mechanism to transfer technology to developing nations to reduce emissions. Both are bad ideas.LiNeBrEaKChina s proposals put the cart before the horse. Getting poor people to stop emitting greenhouse gases means getting them to stop being poor. LiNeBrEaKStudies consistently show that interest in protecting the environment rises as people get richer   making the single most important step to improve the environment helping developing countries stop being poor.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the largest source of air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa is the indoor burning of dung and other organic fuels for cooking and heat. Household biogas digesters can free people from the acute indoor air pollution caused by the open fires and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions for as little as $50 a family.LiNeBrEaKSolving pollution problems in developing countries means we must first free local entrepreneurs from the choking hand of corruption, bureaucracy and mercantilist economic regulations that keep them poor.LiNeBrEaKTransferring $300 billion to developing countries would have the opposite effect because government-based foreign aid harms the countries that receive the handouts.LiNeBrEaKKenyan economist James Shikwati has shown how such aid fuels corrupt governments, hollows out the local economy, and weakens local markets.LiNeBrEaKJournalist John Stossel showed graphic examples of the same problem on ABC S 20/20, and New York University economist William Easterly has comprehensively detailed the flaws in the top-down aid model.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, a $300 billion transfer to developing countries would put money in the pockets of the likes of Sudan s Omar al-Bashir, Venezuela s Hugo Chavez, and Uzbekistan s Islom Karimov.LiNeBrEaKThese thugs, whose regimes daily commit human-rights violations on a vast scale, would share in the $300 billion bonanza. Not only is providing any money to these tyrants immoral, but the idea that they would actually spend the money on reducing pollution is ludicrous.LiNeBrEaKIt is true that Europe, Japan and the United States industrialized at a time when people didn t know about the dangerous effects of pollution.LiNeBrEaKToday s developed countries did pump out a lot of pollution, including greenhouse gases. However, once the developed world became rich and discovered the scope of the pollution problem, we cleaned up our industries  emissions.LiNeBrEaKChina s argument sounds fair, since it looks like we were able to emit all we wanted while poorer countries will be stuck with abatement costs. But this argument rests on the assumption that developing countries can only afford 1920s-style power plants or trucks unless they get the $300 billion.LiNeBrEaKPower plants and heavy-duty trucks do cost more to build today than 50 or 100 years ago, but they cost more because modern ones are better, not just cleaner. Indeed, modern technology produces fewer greenhouse gases than older technology mostly because it is more efficient.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, while developing countries are going to have to build more expensive power plants, factories and trucks than did the United States or European countries during our industrialization, those new ones will not just be cleaner but more efficient than the ones we built.LiNeBrEaKIf we are serious about addressing global pollution issues, we need to first get serious about removing obstacles to economic development that will create demand for a clean environment in the developing world. Turning $300 billion over to despots and bureaucrats would take us in exactly wrong direction.LiNeBrEaKAndrew P. Morriss is a professor of law and business at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	After successful auction, emissions program starts Jan. 1  	By Peter B. Lord, Journal Environment Writer  	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	761 words  	Despite speculation by some that putting a tax on carbon emissions will be disastrous for the economy, Rhode Island and nine other states are posed to do just that starting Jan. 1. Those who participated in two recent auctions of carbon credits by the states suggest the program can work without damaging the economy, while serving as a model for the country.LiNeBrEaKLast week in Hartford, all 31. 5 million carbon allowances offered for sale were purchased at a price of $3. 38 per allowance, for a total of $106. 5 million. Rhode Island is expected to receive about $2. 5 million from that auction and one in September to invest in energy efficiency programs for consumers. LiNeBrEaKEach allowance permits one ton of carbon emissions. Starting Jan. 1, local utilities must have enough allowances to cover their emissions, and they must start ratcheting down their emissions to meet new caps.LiNeBrEaKPeter Grannis, chair of the 10-state cooperative called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, said in a statement,  Once again the results prove that distributing allowances via auctions in a carbon dioxide cap and trade program can be successful. We look forward to developing a partnership with the Obama administration to create a strong federal climate action program. LiNeBrEaKW. Michael Sullivan, director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, took part in last week s auction and was elected to RGGI s seven member board of directors. He said the program is working.LiNeBrEaK I think the people who are speculating that this will destroy the economy are unable to look coldly and rationally at the facts,  Sullivan said.  What makes it work is you invest in demand management and drive down the consumption of electricity. LiNeBrEaKThe program is one of the few to put a price on pollution. While it will initially make electricity more expensive because utilities have to buy allowances for the carbon they produce, the organizers plan to invest the proceeds from those allowances in energy-conservation technologies and strategies so the public will use less electricity.LiNeBrEaKLowering power usage would lead to less production of CO{-2}, which goes into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaKDan Sosland, executive director of Environment Northeast, an advocacy group, added,  Until now, we ve essentially been giving power plant owners freedom to pollute. Now states can use the funds from these carbon allowances to make our homes, schools and businesses more energy efficient. LiNeBrEaKPotomac Solutions, a company hired to monitor the auction, said it found no collusion or manipulation by bidders. A total of 69 entities submitted enough bids to purchase 3. 5 times the available supply of allowances in the auction.LiNeBrEaKThe company said it was encouraging that  compliance entities or their affiliates, which should value the allowances most highly, purchased most of the allowances in the auction. LiNeBrEaK The program at this point is remarkably successful in that we have gone through two separate auctions,  Sullivan said.LiNeBrEaKSullivan said at the outset he was  profoundly apprehensive  about the program.LiNeBrEaKFirst, he worried whether anyone would put value in a commodity that can t be seen or held.LiNeBrEaKSecond, with all the speculation and malfeasance and manipulation that has destroyed stock values on Wall Street this year, he feared similar practices might upset the carbon auctions. But they did not.LiNeBrEaK I am remarkably proud of RGGI s accomplishments and pleased we have been successful,  Sullivan said.LiNeBrEaKThe other participants are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and New Hampshire. The states took action because there was no successful effort to launch a national program to reduce carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKDetails about last week s auction will be released on Jan. 6, after financial settlements and transfer of CO{-2} allowances is completed. Sullivan said that in the September auction, most of the participants were energy generators or related companies.LiNeBrEaKThe next auction will be March 18.LiNeBrEaKPlans call for capping local CO{-2} emissions at current levels through 2014. The cap will then be reduced a total of 10 percent during the next four years.LiNeBrEaKPlants that exceed the cap will have to pay for carbon offsets or other measures.LiNeBrEaKSullivan said he remains concerned that the program doesn t adequately address utilities that buy  dirty  power from outside the region. Others are concerned that the program doesn t cover more sources of carbon dioxide beyond power plants.LiNeBrEaKCongress and the Obama administration are expected to debate a national program this winter.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   All Editions	Is N.J. greenhouse gas plan just hot air?  	By JEFF TITTEL, Wire Services  	OPINION; Pg. A09  	848 words  	CLIMATE CHANGE is the most serious threat facing our state and our planet. Last week the state Department of Environmental Protection released the greenhouse gas plan, the state's first comprehensive attempt to deal with climate change. The report has some very good ideas but is still a work in progress. Some areas need strengthening, while others need more details. But this plan is a critical step forward in our battle with global warming.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey has seen firsthand the impacts of global warming, like devastating floods, increased drought conditions and Japanese bark beetles destroying our forests. If left unchecked, more than 9 percent of New Jersey will disappear underwater. When the Giants play the Dolphins in the Meadowlands, they could be real dolphins. LiNeBrEaKThe plan would make New Jersey a leader in renewable energy; it has many positive policies to change how we produce energy to light and heat our homes and businesses. However, the energy efficiency portion of the plan needs more work.LiNeBrEaKImproving New Jersey's energy efficiency is the cheapest and easiest way to reduce greenhouse gases. For every dollar spent on energy efficiency in a residential building, we save four dollars. In commercial buildings, every dollar of investment saves $16.LiNeBrEaKWith a comprehensive energy efficiency program, we could halve our energy needs.LiNeBrEaKTo support energy efficiency the Legislature must pass the "Green Buildings Bill" and an enhanced appliance standard.LiNeBrEaKThe DEP plan does not mention the economic benefit from investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. By Sierra Club estimates, a $3. 2 billion investment in New Jersey could create 57,000 new jobs. These jobs would range from software engineers to laborers.LiNeBrEaKThe transportation section of the plan needs the most work. Many important pieces are missing, such as developing low carbon fuel standards, implementing policy to promote zero-emission vehicles and requiring New Jersey to buy a green fleet. Currently the state owns 500 SUVs; they need to be replaced with hybrids and zero-emission vehicles.LiNeBrEaKNew mass transitLiNeBrEaKThe plan does not go far enough in promoting the development of new mass transit systems in appropriate places. Instead of systems to promote sprawl, like the Lackawanna cutoff in the Poconos, we need to help people move in our densely populated areas. The demand already exists for a cross-county connector and a West Shore line in Bergen County.LiNeBrEaKThe governor's plan to widen the Garden State Parkway in the Pinelands and the Turnpike in the farmlands of New Jersey also raises concern. It will undermine the benefits of all other transportation programs. These projects will increase traffic, reliance on cars and also sprawl.LiNeBrEaKThe money instead should be put toward the Pulaski Skyway and the 50 percent of our bridges that are deficient in New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKThe state has to have a mandatory trip reduction program. Such a program was in place in 1999 before then-Gov. Christie Whitman killed it. A mandatory program would give businesses funding and incentives to get people out of single-occupancy vehicles. They include carpools, vanpools, jitney service and subsidizing people to take mass transit.LiNeBrEaKThese programs have worked throughout the country. Without a mandatory program, we will not be able to reduce enough greenhouse gases to avert the threats of climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe plan contains ambitious land use policies. It suggests trying to limit 90 percent of New Jersey's development to areas already served by public infrastructure and having 99 percent of new development in the form of redevelopment. We will never meet these goals if the state continues subsidizing sprawl by running new water and sewer lines into rural areas.LiNeBrEaKThe plan also calls for limiting new development until 99 percent of buildings are occupied in an area. We are concerned the Legislature would never pass such a strong land use bill.LiNeBrEaKThese plans are announced while the state continues to subsidize the largest greenhouse gas emitter in New Jersey, Xanadu. This mammoth building is not required to use any efficiency, renewable or green design.LiNeBrEaKAn excellent ideaLiNeBrEaKThe plan mentions a California law requiring that all new transportation be combined with land-use planning to be carbon neutral. This is an excellent idea; to accomplish it, the programs that we are currently using need to be redesigned.LiNeBrEaKFinally, the plan talks about the need to preserve open space as places to sequester carbon. The Garden State Preservation Trust, the financing authority that purchases open space for the state, is out of money. In order to make this space for sequestration available, the preservation trust needs state funding.LiNeBrEaKWithout implementation, this plan will just be more hot air, like the State Plan and the water supply master plan.LiNeBrEaKThere will be a public stakeholder process on these critical components of the plan for 10 days starting Jan. 6 in Trenton.LiNeBrEaKIt you really care about the future of the state and dealing with climate change, it is important you attend one of these meetings.LiNeBrEaKJeff Tittel is director of the New Jersey Sierra Club.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	ATLAS ASSEMBLED PLANT BY PLANT;  NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM VOLUNTEERS CATALOG COUNTY'S FLORA 	Mike Lee, STAFF WRITER  	LOCAL; Pg. B-1  	812 words  	On the top floor of San Diego's Natural History Museum, well out of public view, the region's largest collection of plant specimens is growing like a weed.LiNeBrEaKNearly 9,000 samples were added this year alone -- a museum record -- thanks to a mostly volunteer project called the San Diego County Plant Atlas. The effort, which began in 2002, is an ambitious plan to round up and catalog every type of plant from every corner of the county.LiNeBrEaKThat will allow researchers to analyze the region's floral diversity and chart changes, including those linked to global warming. It also should give regulators a better sense about plant species when considering development proposals. LiNeBrEaKDespite its successes, the project's future is uncertain. Like so many nonprofit enterprises, its funding sources are shrinking. With no grant money coming in, the museum is picking up the tab of roughly $150,000 a year for the atlas, said Jon Rebman, the museum's curator of botany.LiNeBrEaKHe said the help won't last indefinitely. "We are worried about the future of the project," Rebman said. "If the ball drops, it just won't be picked up."LiNeBrEaKRebman proposed the plant atlas about seven years ago as a companion to the museum's authoritative tome, the San Diego County Bird Atlas, which was published in book form in 2004. At the start, Rebman said he was appalled at how little scientific information was available about a county with the most diverse flora in the nation.LiNeBrEaK"Basically, I said we don't know much about our land and we are losing huge chunks of it to development," he said.LiNeBrEaKAt least by one measure, he was right. Atlas research has turned up more than 250 species or subspecies that had not previously been recorded in the county.LiNeBrEaKWith support from The San Diego Foundation, and later the National Science Foundation and others, Rebman adapted bird atlas methods for use with plants. A map used for both efforts divides the county into about 480 squares of three miles each.LiNeBrEaKWhile the bird atlas includes roughly 500 species, the plant atlas targets approximately 2,500 species countywide. Rebman doesn't accept observational reports. He wants samples, or "vouchers," of each kind of plant found, along with data about the elevation, geographic coordinates and other details.LiNeBrEaKThat way, researchers of the future will have tangible proof of what grew here in the early 2000s, rather than having to rely on photos or written descriptions.LiNeBrEaKRebman figures it may take another decade to reach his goal of roughly 100,000 specimens. Many will be duplicates, a strategy devised partly to show subtle differences in plants that appear the same to untrained eyes.LiNeBrEaKSince 2002, an army of several hundred trained volunteers has collected most of the 37,000 samples, which another team of volunteers painstakingly arrange on oversized sheets of archival-quality paper.LiNeBrEaK"I consider this therapy," said Jan Domnitz of La Mesa, who regularly donates her time to display leaves and flowers on pages. She handles the delicate specimens with tweezers and pallet knives as she glues them down for posterity.LiNeBrEaK"The whole point is for a scientist to come in and see all aspects of the plant," she said.LiNeBrEaKScientists aren't the only ones who can see the work done by Domnitz and her friends. Digital images of the specimens, along with an interactive plant-mapping program, are in an online archive on the museum's Web site.LiNeBrEaK"It's a body of raw data that could be used in many different ways in the future that we haven't even imagined yet," Rebman said.LiNeBrEaKThomas Oberbauer, a habitat official for the county, is among the atlas project's biggest fans. "This kind of information is important for us to determine what we need to protect, where we need to protect things and how things might change in the future because it sets a baseline," he said.LiNeBrEaKPlant atlas director Mary Ann Hawke already is using the fast-growing archive to research changes in bloom periods. She's curious whether samples collected over the past century show that climate change is altering flowering times. She doesn't know the answer yet.LiNeBrEaK"For me, the collection is interesting, but it's just a way to generate data about what the plants are doing and the most important question of all: What are they telling us about how we are changing our world?" she said.LiNeBrEaKOVERVIEWLiNeBrEaKBackground: The San Diego County Plant Atlas was launched in 2002 to amass tens of thousands of plant specimens and boost the scientific knowledge about the region's flora.LiNeBrEaKWhat's new: This year, professionals and volunteers gathered nearly 9,000 plant samples, bringing the atlas total to more than 37,000.LiNeBrEaKThe future: Atlas organizers aim to spend another decade or so collecting a total of roughly 100,000 specimens, but the project's future is uncertain because of dwindling financial support.LiNeBrEaKOnline:LiNeBrEaKTo view a free, interactive version of the plant atlas, visit sdnhm.org/plantatlas/index.html	MUSEUMS and GALLERIES (90%); HISTORY (90%); VOLUNTEERS (89%); BOTANY (78%); SCIENCE NEWS (74%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (74%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (74%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); GRANTS and GIFTS (73%); SCIENCE FUNDING (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (55%) COST; MUSEUMS; SAN DIEGO;   			SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The San Diego Union-Tribune   			1 CHART; 2 PICS; CAPTIONS: 1.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	Senator attacks EPA coal-power ruling: Utah facilities ? Boxer appeals to the U.S. attorney general, says the head of the agency broke the law.  	Judy Fahys, The Salt Lake Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	439 words  	Dec. 24--A U.S. senator wants the Justice Department to step in against the nation's top environmental cop after he cleared the way last week for new, coal-fired power plants -- including some in Utah -- to be built without regard to their impact on global warming. LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., says EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson "has run amok." She wrote Monday to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to demand that he have the "blatantly illegal" policy suspended.LiNeBrEaKA "renegade" Johnson "defies the clear language of our environmental laws and acts without legal authority," said Boxer, who heads the Senate's environment and public-works committee.LiNeBrEaK"Mr. Johnson's latest action is intended to make the job of combating global warming more difficult and will add to the millions of taxpayer dollars he has wasted in defending his illegal decisions."LiNeBrEaKThe flap stems from Johnson's Dec. 18 memo interpreting the Clean Air Act. In it, he essentially says his agency does not have to analyze how much carbon dioxide new coal-fired power plants pump out, although an appeals board and the U.S. Supreme Court have said global-warming pollution can be considered in deciding on new plants.LiNeBrEaKJohnson's memo directly relates to the new, 110-megawatt waste-fuel plant that South Jordan-based Deseret Power Electric Cooperative wants to build at its Bonanza Generating Station in eastern Utah's Uintah County. In addition, it sets a policy that could apply to dozensLiNeBrEaKof proposed coal-fired plants nationwide, including those planned for Sigurd and Delta in central Utah.LiNeBrEaKJonathan Shradar, spokesman for Johnson, defended last week's memo. "I thought Santa decided who was naughty or nice," he said. " ... Johnson's memo is supported by 30 years of agency actions and provides clarity and consistency to the permitting process."LiNeBrEaKBoxer said in her sharply worded letter that Johnson's memo on climate change and the Clean Air Act runs counter to the Supreme Court and EPA Appeals Board decisions. She added that it disregards the public's right to participate in EPA's decisions.LiNeBrEaK"The attorney general," she concluded, "has an obligation to intervene when the actions of the administration are so clearly outside the law."LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.com	ATTORNEYS GENERAL (91%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (91%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (91%); POWER PLANTS (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); SUPREME COURTS (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (78%); HAZARDOUS WASTE FUELS (77%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (77%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (69%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (64%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (57%)  	Crime/law  	BARBARA BOXER (92%); MICHAEL MUKASEY (57%)  	UTAH, USA (98%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081224-ST-Senator-attacks-EPA-coal-power-ruling-1224  	Newspaper  	ST  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune   		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (80%)  		SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES (55%); US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (84%)  											
The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Carbon - up, up and away;  BATTLE AGAINST GLOBAL WARMING;  Fliers soon will be able to offset the CO{-2} exhaust from planes with the swipe of a card	Michael Cabanatuan, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	713 words  	 Environmentally conscious travelers flying out of San Francisco International Airport will soon be able to assuage their guilt and minimize the impact of their air travel by buying certified carbon offsets at airport kiosks. LiNeBrEaK The experimental program, scheduled to start this spring, would make SFO the first airport in the nation - possibly the world - to offer fliers the opportunity to purchase carbon offsets.LiNeBrEaK "We'd like people to stop and consider the impacts of flying," said Steve McDougal, executive vice president for 3Degrees, a San Francisco firm that sells renewable-energy and carbon-reduction investments and is teaming up with the airport and the city on the project. "Obviously, people need to fly sometimes. No one expects them to stop, but they should consider taking steps to reduce their impacts." LiNeBrEaK San Francisco's Airport Commission has authorized the program, which will involve a $163,000 investment from SFO, but is still working out the details with 3Degrees. Because of that, McDougal said, he can't yet discuss specifics, such as the cost to purchase carbon offsets and what programs would benefit from travelers' purchases. LiNeBrEaKBut the general idea, officials said, is that a traveler would approach a kiosk resembling the self-service check-in stations used by airlines, then punch in his or her destination. The computer would calculate the carbon footprint and the cost of an investment to offset the damage. The traveler could then swipe a credit card to help save the planet. Travelers would receive a printed receipt listing the projects benefiting from their environmental largesse.LiNeBrEaKThe carbon offsets are not tax deductible, said Krista Canellakis, a 3Degrees spokeswoman. LiNeBrEaK"While the carbon offsets purchased at kiosks can't be seen or touched, they are an actual product with a specific environmental claim whose ownership is transferred at the time of purchase," she said.LiNeBrEaKMike McCarron, airport spokesman, said the projects offered will be chosen by the mayor's office, in conjunction with 3Degrees, from a list certified by the city's Environment Department. Airport Director John Martin told the commission that projects could include renewable energy ventures in developing countries, agriculture and organic waste capture, coal mine methane capture, and sustainable forestry.LiNeBrEaK Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom, said a portion of each offset purchase would go to the San Francisco Carbon Fund, which supports local projects such as energy-efficiency programs and solar panel installations for low-income housing, as well as efforts to convert waste oils into biodiesel fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of offsets for SFO travelers is still being negotiated, McDougal said, but figures on the company's Web-based "carbon calculator" suggest that a two-hour trip uses about 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per person, and the cost to offset that would be about $4. Offsetting a trip to Europe would cost $36. LiNeBrEaK"It's definitely not going to double your ticket or anything," he said. "It's going to end up being a small percentage of your total airfare."LiNeBrEaKUnder the agreement, the airport will provide the kiosks and 3Degrees will supply the software and the certified carbon offsets being sold and will operate the program. Kiosks will be placed throughout the airport, with locations at the customer service desk in Terminal 3 and two wings of the International Terminal. 3Degrees will get 30 percent of each purchase, with the rest going to carbon-reduction projects. The agreement calls for a one-year program, with a possible extension. LiNeBrEaK "The carbon kiosks will not only reduce global warming," Ballard said, "they will serve an educational function. It's something interesting to do while you're killing time at the airport."LiNeBrEaKGiven the innovative nature of the venture, airport officials said they don't expect 3Degrees will turn a profit - at least not at the outset. McDougal said it's impossible to predict how many passengers will want to make what is essentially a voluntary contribution to compensate for the impacts of their air travel. But he hopes the program takes off.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, it will be successful," he said. "But if we just have a lot of people stop and read the information and think about it, that's something we've accomplished."

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	An environment to Ramapo center to be hub of green studies  	ANA M. ALAYA, STAR-LEDGER STAFF  	NEW JERSEY; Pg. 011  	1070 words  	Long before Al Gore started teaching about global warming, Ramapo College students were planting organic gardens, recycling bottles, and studying solar and wind power and other alternative energies.LiNeBrEaKA lot has changed since Ramapo started to go green 30 years ago, but not its commitment to the environmental movement. It plans to open New Jersey's first on-campus sustainability education center this spring to showcase the most technologically advanced green building designs.LiNeBrEaKRamapo isn't alone in rediscovering the green movement that in the 1970s swept across American college campuses. Administrations in New Jersey and elsewhere are making big changes to conserve energy and catch the coming wave of new industries and careers that aim to capture solar, wind and other green technologies. LiNeBrEaKThe 1,787-square-foot center in Ramapo will feature solar panels, geothermal heating, energy-efficient lighting, even waterless urinals. Future plans call for a wind generator, organic gardens and a solar greenhouse.LiNeBrEaKThe project is designed to embrace the idea of sustainability, a catch-all term used by scientists and environmentalists reflecting a recognition that our actions today affect our prospects for the future.LiNeBrEaK"It basically is applying the knowledge that we have finite resources and use them in such a way to conserve them as long as possible," said Emma Rainforth, an assistant professor of environmental science and geology. She added that a key belief of sustainability is alternatives can be used to sustain current lifestyles.LiNeBrEaKRainforth said the center will serve as a hub for advanced study on sustainability issues, a place where students in the environmental degree programs and eco-friendly clubs on campus, as well as students from K-12 area schools, can take classes, garden, and study the latest green technologies.LiNeBrEaKThe opening of the center fits neatly with the college's commitment to the environment, which goes back to Ramapo's founding in 1969.LiNeBrEaKRecently, the college's president, Peter P. Mercer, signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, a measure signed by 400 college presidents, including at least six in New Jersey, promising to reduce their schools' greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKA DECADES-OLD IDEA In 1975 a group of students and faculty at Ramapo in Mahwah had a similar goal in mind when they built the Alternate Energy and Environment Center on the campus in response to the energy crisis of that decade. Its goal was to demonstrate alternative methods of producing and using resources, including energy, food and shelter, in ways that did not take a huge toll by depleting those resources and creating pollution.LiNeBrEaKBefore it was torn down to make way for dormitories seven years ago, the old center had a solar schoolroom and a solar greenhouse, organic gardens, a yard where recycled glass was stored and later sold, and a water-pumping wind system.LiNeBrEaK"People learned that you can have a major impact on creating the environment you occupy, and we hope to recreate that phenomenon," said Michael Edelstein, a psychology and environmental studies professor. "The idea is to draw people in and empower them that they can change the way things are done."LiNeBrEaKEdelstein has been teaching - some would say preaching - sustainability for more than three decades. His office is a kind of shrine to his efforts: a worm composter doubles as a coffee table, and an old sign from the Alternate Energy center hangs above his desk, as well as a black and white photo of the original center's recycled Jacobs generator that used wind to generate electricity for the center.LiNeBrEaKThe new center, he said, will be much more technologically advanced and will be called the Sharp Sustainability Education Center Home, so named to reflect generous donations from the college's corporate neighbor - a $250,000 grant and 83 solar panels capable of generating 14. 608 kilowatts, as well as AV equipment.LiNeBrEaKThe project is also funded by a $500,000 appropriation from the college and a number of federal and state grants and donations. The college's Institute of Environmental Studies continues to fundraise for the organic garden and outdoor features.LiNeBrEaKThe school hired an architect that specializes in sustainable designs, Stephen Tilly Architects of New York, to build the structure, which uses the best orientation toward the sun, natural daylight and ventilation, as well as recycled and environmentally friendly materials, and a super insulated building "envelope" of walls and windows, roof and floor.LiNeBrEaKEdelstein said New Jersey has emerged as an epicenter of change because of its "far reaching" target of an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gasses by 2050, with substantial progress on this path by 2020. The new center will showcase new technologies and practices that builders can use to make new structures more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaK"It makes sense to invest in green technology because it no longer is simply ideological," Edelstein said. "It makes economic sense."LiNeBrEaKOver the years, Edelstein has seen interest in environmental studies rise and fall. There was a great interest in the subject in the years soon after the college opened in 1969, but dropped sharply after Ronald Reagan was elected president. The environmental studies school went from 400 students to 35 in the first two years of Reagan's term, he said.LiNeBrEaK"The problem was that Jimmy Carter came on television in a sweater and told everyone to turn their heat down, and then Reagan came on and said, 'There is no problem,'" Edelstein said.LiNeBrEaKToday, in the wake of Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" documentary about global warming, and the fuel crisis that gripped the nation this past year, society has entered a new environmental era, Edelstein said.LiNeBrEaK"Students are rediscovering it," Edelstein said.LiNeBrEaKOne of those students is Paul Coraggio of Hazlet, who is pursuing a major in international business and a minor in environmental science. He is focused on sustainable business and development and founded 1Step (Students Together for Environmental Progress), a student club that runs an annual "green facts" competition in which students compete to use the least amount of energy in their dormitories.LiNeBrEaK"People are realizing that the benefits of (green building) are ubiquitous," Coraggio said. "In the past it was just an environmental issue. Now it's connected to health, economic and other issues. Businesses are realizing there are cost savings."

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	COAH: No housing deadline extension Several towns sought another six months  	MATTHEW REILLY, STAR-LEDGER STAFF  	NEW JERSEY; Pg. 017  	518 words  	The head of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs said yesterday the state Council on Affordable Housing will not grant a request to extend the Dec. 31 deadline for towns to submit their plans for providing affordable housing. LiNeBrEaKThe state League of Municipalities had written to Gov. Jon Corzine to ask him to issue an executive order to extend the deadline six months. DCA Commissioner Joseph Doria sent a letter to league director William Dressel today denying the request for an extension.LiNeBrEaK"We have given serious thought and consideration to your request but have determined that an across-the-board extension of the deadline would not be consistent with COAH's statutory obligations under the Fair Housing Act," Doria said in the letter. "As we have stated, COAH is committed to continuing to work cooperatively with municipal officials in the planning process, and that cooperation certainly will continue as we move forward."LiNeBrEaKIn a letter to municipal officials, Dressel notified the towns that the request has been denied, despite the backing of state Sens. Raymond Lesniak (D-Union) and Christopher "Kip" Bateman (R-Somerset), Assembly Speaker Joseph Roberts (D-Camden) and Assemblyman Gerald Green (D-Union).LiNeBrEaK"The commissioner's decision means that municipalities will need to file revised third-round plans by December 31 or face 'builders' remedy' lawsuits," Dressel said. The so-called "builder's remedy" allows dense, market-value developments in exchange for providing a smaller number of affordable units.LiNeBrEaKLegislative Republicans put out a statement noting that the Corzine administration's "Draft Global Warming Response Act Recommendation Report," issued Dec. 15, includes recommendations for smart growth and housing development that the GOP lawmakers believe conflict with COAH requirements.LiNeBrEaK"How can we reasonably expect local governments to factor zoning recommendations issued by the Corzine administration on December 15 into COAH plans that are due on December 31?" said Sen. Andrew Ciesla (R-Ocean). "This new report on global warming only makes clear the absolute lack of consistency or direction within the Corzine administration with regards to development and affordable housing."LiNeBrEaKDoria said the Dec. 31 deadline applies only to those towns that previously participated in COAH's original third round or that voluntarily chose to file plans before the court and thereby continue to maintain protection against "builder's remedy" lawsuits. He cited published reports that indicate more than 200 towns to which the deadline applies have recently taken action to approve revised plans, or are poised to do so over the next couple of days.LiNeBrEaKLesniak said a bill that he and Bateman are sponsoring (S2485) would address problems in the current COAH guidelines that are stifling job growth and economic development in New Jersey.LiNeBrEaK"The bill would suspend the 2. 5 percent development fee strangling our economic recovery as well as direct the State Housing Commission to recommend sound planning and economic principles sorely lacking in the current COAH mandates and regulations," Lesniak said.

The Times of India  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	India against carbon tax on aviation, shipping sectors  	Nitin Sethi, The Times of India  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	478 words  	Dec. 24--NEW DELHI -- The government has opposed moves to impose carbon tax on the aviation sector as well as the shipping industry that would make the consumer bear the burden. LiNeBrEaKGlobal transport accounts for about 14 percent of the total emissions worldwide. But the world is still undecided about whom to blame for them.LiNeBrEaKA move backed by several industrialised countries suggests that everyone who flies on international routes or uses ships for transport should pay a fee to cover the cost of greenhouse gas emissions. The EU has been threatening to unilaterally impose such a tax on flights coming in or leaving the region.LiNeBrEaKThe Indian government has pointed out that the cost of capping emissions from either aviation or the shipping industry must be imposed on those who run the ships and airplanes and not on the basis of how many people fly from a country or use the ship to move goods.LiNeBrEaKFor India, such a move, sources said, would be tantamount to breaking the existing global treaty which puts the burden on the industrialised countries to undertake emission reduction and not on the poor and developing countries.LiNeBrEaKThe point of concern for the government is that International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation are involved in resolving the dispute. Unlike the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, where India is a crucial player along with the other G77 countries and China, and each country's influence is equal to a single vote, the two sectoral organisations are influenced strongly by the industrialised countries.LiNeBrEaKThe devil, in the case of shipping industry, they realise, lies in the way these organisations influence the UNFCCC in deciding who owns the ships that roam the oceans.LiNeBrEaKThe shipping sector is peculiar because companies in industrialised countries often run their ships under what are called "flags of convenience". They get their ships registered in small countries like Tobago and Liberia, which work as tax havens and also help circumvent other international regulations. If one was to go by the flags the ships fly, IMO has stated, poor and developing countries own 66. 58 percent of the ships.LiNeBrEaKBut if one was to go behind the veil, Indian officials said, it would become evident that 68 percent of the ships belonged to rich countries.LiNeBrEaKThe debate is bound to see a final resolution by the end of 2009 when more than 100 member countries of the UNFCCC strike a new deal to cut emissions.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition		DINESH RAMDE  	BUSINESS; Pg. D3  	782 words  	By Dinesh RamdeLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKMILWAUKEELiNeBrEaKRather than warmth and good cheer, the twinkle and glow of homes festooned with holiday lights reminds Adam Siegel of carbon emissions and global warming.LiNeBrEaKSiegel insists he is not a Grinch, only green.LiNeBrEaK"You can have a beautiful display, a gorgeous display; you can even have massive display, but why do it in a wasteful way?" said Siegel, a blogger from McLean, Va. LiNeBrEaKThere are signs that after several years of floundering holiday sales for energy efficient LED lighting, more people feel the same way.LiNeBrEaKManufacturers and retailers across the country report sales that are surprisingly brisk even during an economic downturn. For example, light-bulb maker Osram Sylvania said it doubled its LED sales since last year to between 15 million and 20 million LED units.LiNeBrEaKLight-emitting diodes can be three times more expensive than traditional incandescent lights, but they use 90 percent less energy, produce less heat and last longer.LiNeBrEaKSiegel has done the math on his blog, GetEnergySmartNow.com, which is not affiliated with any energy or lighting company. He calculates that an average string of LED lights saves enough energy to pay for itself in as little as a year.LiNeBrEaKCalculations by other independent researchers suggest the break-even point could be two to three years, depending on how long the lights are left on.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of who is doing the math, the upfront cost of LED lighting is almost always worth the investment, especially with more utilities throwing in additional incentives that can range from $2 to $4 per set.LiNeBrEaKAmong the first to switch over to LED lights were large corporations or municipalities that stand to save the most.LiNeBrEaKAt the Milwaukee headquarters of beer brewer MillerCoors LLC, a 200,000-light LED display using 15 miles of lights has been synchronized to music. Company spokesman Mike Jones said LED lights cut holiday lighting costs by 60 percent.LiNeBrEaK"This is a tough year but we don't intend to cancel the holidays," Jones said. "This is a gift to our employees, a gift to the community, and even better, we're using half the energy."LiNeBrEaKThe government swapped out traditional lighting on the National Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C., which now has 37,000 LED lights. New York's Rockefeller Center tree was decorated with 30,000 LED lights on five miles of wire.LiNeBrEaKLEDs are tiny semiconductors similar to computer chips, and are commonly used in traffic signals, track lighting and electronic devices. LED lights are more efficient because most of the energy in the circuit gets converted to light, whereas up to 90 percent of the energy emitted by incandescent bulbs is wasted as heat.LiNeBrEaKThey're sturdier, last up to 10 times longer than incandescents and, because they are not as hot, are less of a fire hazard.LiNeBrEaKPrices for the greener bulbs can still be a barrier for some. For example, Amazon.com sells a string of 100 multicolor LED holiday lights for about $28, while the incandescent equivalent is about $10.LiNeBrEaKEven so, 21 of Amazon's top 25 holiday-light sales are LED products.LiNeBrEaKChristmas Lights Etc., based in Alpharetta, Ga., sold 25 million holiday lights this year, with LED sales up more than 50 percent over last year. Spokesman Aaron Hassen said many LED products sold out quickly.LiNeBrEaK"It did catch us off guard a little bit, but we're all learning from the trend," he said. "I think people are finally understanding what a difference these make."LiNeBrEaKSylvania spokeswoman Stephanie J. Anderson said LED sales will only grow as the technology improves. Companies may even employ solar technology, so that the lights would need no grounded power source.LiNeBrEaKNot everyone sees the need to deck the halls with an expensive alternative. Brian K. Nagatani, an employment attorney in the San Francisco Bay Area, said there's no point taking a long-term view.LiNeBrEaK"I would just buy the cheapest one on the shelf," said Nagatani, 33. "I mean, you only take it out once a year for, like, three weeks."LiNeBrEaKStill, cities like Palm Desert, Calif., that must balance energy use year-round are pushing residents to make the switch.LiNeBrEaKThe city last year offered a free string of LED lights to residents in exchange for traditional lights. Between 2007 and this year, the number of swaps has tripled from 568 units to 1,748 and counting.LiNeBrEaK"In the desert you can imagine energy use is high, like with air conditioning in August," said Patrick Conlon, who directs the city's Office of Energy Management. "We did this to stir up enthusiasm for energy efficiency, and we're pleasantly surprised how well it's worked."LiNeBrEaKThe program cost about $26,000 this year, he said, and the city might have to consider rebates next year instead of free replacements if interest remains so high.

The Washington Times 		December 24, 2008 Wednesday 	Climate czar left no electronic trail  	By Jim McElhatton, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PAGE ONE; A01  	990 words  	Don't bother looking for any electronic records of Carol Browner's first stint as a federal government executive. The soon-to-be Obama administration climate czar intentionally didn't keep many.LiNeBrEaKIn sworn testimony obtained by The Washington Times, Ms. Browner disclosed that she refused to use e-mail when she served as President Clinton's Environmental Protection Agency chief in the 1990s for fear of leaving a digital trail. She also ordered her government computer hard drive wiped clean of records just before leaving office.LiNeBrEaK"It was a conscious decision not to use a piece of equipment or to learn how to use a piece of equipment because I didn't want to be in a situation similar to what I had been in Florida," she testified about government computers. The testimony referred to her days as an environmental regulator in Florida, where an e-mail message sent to her surfaced in litigation. LiNeBrEaK"This is why I made this decision not to use my computer," she said. "I was very careful."LiNeBrEaKMs. Browner's sworn statements were gathered in a little-noticed civil case involving the government's obligation to preserve its official records that transpired after Ms. Browner left office in January 2001. The lawsuit examined why EPA officials failed to save electronic records that chronicled the Clinton administration's final actions in office and that were being sought by a conservative legal group under federal open-records laws.LiNeBrEaKThe same day a judge ordered the agency to preserve such records, Ms. Browner asked a staff member that any files on her government computer be erased, prompting allegations of a possible cover-up.LiNeBrEaKThe ensuing investigation ultimately cleared Ms. Browner of any wrongdoing, concluding she was unaware of the judge's order. Her former agency, however, didn't fare as well. It was found in contempt of court for failing to preserve government records at the heart of the case.LiNeBrEaKWhile exonerated, Ms. Browner's testimony provided a rare insight into her distaste for keeping historical government records in electronic form. It's an aversion that concerns some government watchdogs as she prepares to take the high-profile job of coordinating President-elect Barack Obama's efforts against global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously, it's troubling that public officials would avoid doing things because they're afraid the public might see it later," said Mike Surrusco, senior researcher at Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that monitors government ethics and openness.LiNeBrEaKCharles Davis, executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition at the University of Missouri, said avoiding computers and e-mail "seems a little drastic and over the top."LiNeBrEaK"It's regrettable," Mr. Davis added. "It seems a rejection of the entire inertia of the marketplace to forswear digital communications."LiNeBrEaKObama aides declined to say whether Ms. Browner plans to use email or computers in her new job but said she worked to improve transparency during her years at the EPA, where she made decisions on written memos instead of e-mails.LiNeBrEaKShe is hardly the only high-ranking government official to avoid e-mail.LiNeBrEaKFormer Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and current Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff have opted not to use e-mail on the job, either, according to a 2006 House report. And President Bush has cited personal privacy issues for his decision to forgo e-mail.LiNeBrEaKIn her deposition, Ms. Browner said she instructed her staff to remove her computer when she first took office at the EPA, though she later kept it when told the computer was assigned to her office.LiNeBrEaKStill, she said she hardly ever used it and relied on her staff to sort through e-mails and print out important messages. In Florida, she said she was overwhelmed by e-mail. She also said during her 2001 deposition that during her years as an environmental regulator in Florida, she once had to provide affidavits after an internal e-mail sent to her surfaced in litigation involving a permitting issueLiNeBrEaK"I thought, you know what? I don't need this. I don't need to go there again, I don't need to deal with this. I will not use e-mail, and I did not use e-mail."LiNeBrEaKJust before leaving office, Ms. Browner ordered that the hard drive of her computer be wiped clean, though a group had been seeking a court injunction to preserve her records. She said she wasn't told to keep the computer records intact in connection with the FOIA lawsuit, but wanted to make sure that computer games her son installed on her work computer were removed.LiNeBrEaKLandmark Legal Foundation's president, Mark R. Levin, who sued the EPA and was among the lawyers at Ms. Browner's deposition, said her answers suggested a "culture of deniability" during her years at the agency.LiNeBrEaK"She was the most disconnected senior official I have ever come across in government," Mr. Levin said.LiNeBrEaKTommy Vietor, a spokesman for the Obama transition team, disputed Mr. Levin's criticism, calling Landmark "a partisan attack group that fought clean-air standards and efforts to get arsenic out of drinking water."LiNeBrEaK"Carol Browner's record at EPA is marked by her work to increase the public's right to know about toxic chemicals in the air and water, and her efforts to improve the government's responsiveness to environmental issues," he said.LiNeBrEaK"Both a judge and inspector general report found that Ms. Browner did nothing wrong" by ordering her computer files deleted, Mr. Vietor said.LiNeBrEaKMeredith Fuchs, general counsel to the nonpartisan National Security Archive, which collects and publishes declassified government records, said government officials have to walk a fine line when it comes to e-mail.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of these officials look at the record laws as a limitation of what they can do," she said. "But they're doing things on behalf of the public, and there has to be some transparency about what they're doing."LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, Ms. Fuchs added, "We don't want these people heading big agencies reading e-mail all day."

Al Jazeera (Doha, Qatar)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Chinese voice economy concerns  	Dinah Gardner, Al Jazeera, Doha, Qatar  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	818 words  	Dec. 23--BEIJING -- As China celebrates 30 years of successful economic reform policies, rising unemployment and predictions of a sharp slowdown next year have left many Chinese with concerns about their financial future.LiNeBrEaKAl Jazeera asked them what they think will be China's biggest challenge in the year ahead and how the global financial crisis is affecting them.LiNeBrEaKWang Huan, 27, editor, from Fuxin, Liaoning LiNeBrEaK"I think the economy is going to be China's biggest challenge next year. Both the global and the domestic economies are struggling.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the manufacturing industry right now is having a hard time with the costs of resources rising.LiNeBrEaKI think things will start to improve by next spring when some of the government's economic measures will start showing some effect.LiNeBrEaKI haven't really felt the effects of the financial crisis yet, but already some of my friends have been laid off so I am also worried for myself next year.LiNeBrEaKI think that it will be very difficult to solve the world's environmental problems because the financial crisis is making all the countries less keen to do something, such as measures about global warming."LiNeBrEaKYang Shun, 23, IT student, from Taiyuan, Shanxi provinceLiNeBrEaK"Dealing with the financial crisis is going to be China's big task next year. Of course I am worried about my new job [at a computer company] which I start next year.LiNeBrEaKI think next year the job market is going to be really tough in China.LiNeBrEaKOf course, I'm really worried about China's environment and the pollution.LiNeBrEaKWe cycled from Taiyuan to Beijing over the past four days and we had to put these scarves over our mouths and when we took them off they were completely black. It was so dirty.LiNeBrEaKEvery year the government takes some steps to improving the environment; it's getting better, year by year.LiNeBrEaKFor myself, well I just hope my new job goes well and I don't lose it."LiNeBrEaKZhang Ke, 26, photographer at Tiananmen Square, from BeijingLiNeBrEaK"I don't really know what China's biggest problem is but I guess a big one is the stock market. It really crashed this year and I think it will be really difficult for it to recover next year.LiNeBrEaKI don't have stocks but a lot of my friends have bought some.LiNeBrEaKI think 2009 will be a good year for China.LiNeBrEaKThis year we had the Olympics and so a lot of foreigners came here and the world saw China and now more people overseas understand us -- our culture and our country.LiNeBrEaKIt means that more people will come and visit China and that our country will have better relationships with other countries."LiNeBrEaKJia Xiao Ying, 30, teacher, from Shuozhou, ShanxiLiNeBrEaK"The most serious problem for us is of course the financial crisis. It hasn't really affected my life too much so far though.LiNeBrEaKMy big hope for next year is the government will be able to control inflation and even lower the cost of living for us ordinary people.LiNeBrEaKIn terms of the environment I am worried about water. China is suffering much more frequently from drought now and it affects our health. I think it cannot be solved next year and in fact will get worse.LiNeBrEaKFor myself, I hope that the educational system in Shanxi can sort itself out. As a teacher I am so busy, so stressed with getting all the administrative demands and tests we have to pass sorted out and I don't have any time to actually devote to teaching my students well."LiNeBrEaKMister Sun, 46, egg pancake maker, Jilin provinceLiNeBrEaK"Next year is the 60th anniversary of China's founding and that's going to be the big thing in 2009. Our preparations for this great event will help our economy.LiNeBrEaKI don't think the financial crisis is going to have such a big effect on us in China. The financial crisis doesn't really affect me! Why not? Because my business is so tiny, it can't really touch me.LiNeBrEaKI hope that China becomes the strongest country in the world next year and for myself well I just hope my business grows more successful."LiNeBrEaKLiu Sijia, 26, unemployed musician, from Ningxia autonomous regionLiNeBrEaK"I don't think the economy is in such a bad shape because China is developing its economy well.LiNeBrEaKHowever, I think China's biggest problem next year is its people. How can we make Chinese people more responsible, better citizens, with better morals?LiNeBrEaKHow can we improve our society -- that's our big problem for next year.LiNeBrEaKI haven't felt any bad effects from the financial crisis, in fact I feel like we Chinese have some benefits.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the renminbi is now stronger compared with foreign currencies.LiNeBrEaKNext year I am afraid that China's economy will fail like Japan's -- I am afraid we are developing too fast and it is not sustainable."

A10  	853 words  	The Dunbar debateLiNeBrEaKRe: Dec. 16 editorial "How Texans can change the State Board of Education."LiNeBrEaKIt is illustrative that James Kallison, an assistant professor of education, uses ad hominem attacks against members of the State Board of Education, whose opinions he does not agree with.LiNeBrEaKApparently, Cynthia Dunbar leads a cabal of knuckle-dragging Evangelicals whose main purpose is to further a "right-wing" ideology. So what is the remedy that Kallison proposes? Well, voting the members out won't work because apparently the voting public is not educated enough to make up their own minds. We have to change the rules via new legislation. If the residents of Kansas made up their minds about a similar matter, Texans should be able to as well. LiNeBrEaKWouldn't an education professor be all for diversity of thought, anyway? Would he be so concerned about an extreme left-wing member of the board who was pushing for man-made global warming indoctrination, social justice activism and anti-American views?LiNeBrEaKGeorge MartinezLiNeBrEaKLeanderLiNeBrEaKRe: Dec. 15 editorial "Dunbar bedevils public education."LiNeBrEaKTell me where I need to live to be able to cast my vote against this nut.

Small and low-wage employers will be the employers paying the most in taxes to reimburse the unemployment trust funds of many states.LiNeBrEaKIn Texas, only the first $9,000 paid in wages are subject to the tax to repay any deficit. While some states tax a higher amount of wages, it is nowhere close to the amount of wages used to determine weekly unemployment benefits.LiNeBrEaKAnother problem is that if a state's trust fund is in debt to the feds for more than three years, the employers begin loosing part of their offset from the Federal Unemployment Tax. Because this tax is applied only to the first $7,000 in wages, the low-wage employers are shafted again.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Labor should not approve any state's unemployment insurance program that does not assess an unemployment tax on the wages used to determine benefit entitlement.LiNeBrEaKErnie TullisLiNeBrEaKAustinLiNeBrEaKFriends for lifeLiNeBrEaKThe coverage of the passing of Hays County Sheriff Allen Bridges was great.LiNeBrEaKAllen and my husband, Glen, were good friends for 40 years.

The Bakersfield Californian  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Invest in alternative energy: Kern, nation will benefit from developing new sources of energy. Economy will be boosted.  	The Bakersfield Californian  	COMMENTARY  	635 words  	Dec. 23--Economists say Barack Obama's plan to spend billions of dollars on alternative-energy programs might not represent the economic boon the president-elect hopes.LiNeBrEaKSome, like Vincent Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve Board official now at the American Enterprise Institute, say federal spending that targets other areas might have greater benefit.LiNeBrEaKObama, who believes properly focused "green" spending can create jobs, redirect energy needs away from fossil fuels, and help lift the nation out of recession, has talked about directing billions of dollars toward energy-efficient cars, home weatherization programs and -- two things that should be of particular interest to Kern County entrepreneurs -- solar panels and wind farms. LiNeBrEaKEconomists' complaints about spending on alternative-energy projects are based on the assumption that the recession will be relatively brief. But a deep, prolonged recession -- something some economists say they're starting to expect -- might benefit from alternative-energy spending.LiNeBrEaKThat's one of many difficult decisions the Obama administration will have to make as it weighs recession-fighting options.LiNeBrEaKAt least two considerations favor alternative energy spending. Apart from short-term economics, the development of "green" industries and practices has worthy side benefits to the nation's future. And history reminds us that many an economic boom has followed periods of sustained infrastructure improvement.LiNeBrEaKBut the "green" stimulus plan has risks, too. Obama must consult the best minds available to his administration before he moves ahead with any plan that ambitious in this most volatile time.LiNeBrEaKBased on his choices to fill the key slots in the administration's "green team," Obama will pursue lofty energy goals regardless of the state of the economy.LiNeBrEaKObama selected Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol Browner, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, to lead a White House council on energy and climate.LiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, is a leading advocate of the need to reduce greenhouse gases by developing new sources of energy.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science," Obama said in announcing Chu's appointment. "We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKBecause of the new administration's interest in alternative fuels, renewable energy and other "clean" technologies, those pursuits seem certain to get a healthy infusion of capital. The Obama administration also seems likely to emphasize energy efficiency, a decidedly unglamorous undertaking that nevertheless can reap big economic dividends.LiNeBrEaKWe've seen that demonstrated over the past two months, as decreased demand on world energy prices have sent oil prices plummeting from the record highs of the summer. Demand has fallen by about 5 percent and world oil prices have dropped from $150 to under $50 per barrel. Merely increasing efficiency in homes and businesses has the potential to reduce energy consumption significantly, and the new administration recognized that.LiNeBrEaKIs that sort of investment the best way to lift the U.S. out of this recession? Economists can argue about that, but it's hard to miss the other benefits of a new, fresh approach to energy policy.

Beaver County Times (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Reaching out: Choice of minister to give invocation sends a message  	Beaver County Times, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	407 words  	Dec. 23--President-elect Barack Obama continues to drive nails in the coffin of the all-or-nothing politics that has diminished our nation for two decades. LiNeBrEaKThe announcement that Pastor Rick Warren will deliver the invocation at Obama's inaugural is the latest nail.LiNeBrEaKThe selection of Warren, a best-selling author and leader of a Southern California megachurch, drew immediate objections from gay rights activists, who strongly supported Obama during the election campaign. Warren supported a successful ballot initiative that banned gay marriage in California.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press reported The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, wrote a letter to Obama asking him to reconsider. "We feel a deep level of disrespect when one of the architects and promoters of an anti-gay agenda is given the prominence and the pulpit of your historic nomination," the group said. (Some religious conservatives were equally critical of Warren for accepting Obama's invitation.)LiNeBrEaKObama wouldn't back down. He told reporters in Chicago that America needs to "come together," even when there's disagreement on social issues. "That dialogue is part of what my campaign is all about," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect is making a point here, and it extends beyond signaling religious conservatives that he will listen to their views. What Obama wants people to do is put aside the rigid ideological and political blinders that have crippled governance for the last 20 years and to work together on a problem-by-problem basis.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, religious conservatives and women's rights groups might never agree on abortion; however, they could work together to prevent violence against women. They might not agree on gay marriage; however, they could work together to reduce global warming.LiNeBrEaKThey can be, as Warren and others have phrased it, "co-belligerents," allies on an ad hoc basis without having to compromise their core beliefs.LiNeBrEaKAmericans need to understand that Obama and Warren aren't selling out.LiNeBrEaKThey're reaching out.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	BRIEF: Magazine: Duke CEO among 'global elite'  	Bruce Henderson, The Charlotte Observer, N.C.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	230 words  	Dec. 23--Duke Energy CEO Jim Rogers is among the world's 50 most powerful people, Newsweek magazine says. LiNeBrEaKThe magazine, in its Jan. 5 edition, calls Duke "not the world's greenest utility" and Rogers "no green saint." But it groups him among industry leaders who support limits on planet-warming carbon dioxide and have the clout to sway both businesses and politicians.LiNeBrEaKThe article describes Duke's $50 million investment to place solar panels on N.C. rooftops, its $320 million purchase in June of a wind-power company and collaboration in the nation's largest solar farm, to be built in Davidson County.LiNeBrEaKIt also recounts Duke's construction of two coal-fueled power plants, which emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, and its court defeat over air-pollution controls in 2007.LiNeBrEaKBut Rogers "with his sooty record -- but belief in renewable energy and the need to cut CO2 -- is just the kind of powerful ally" President-elect Obama will need, Newsweek says.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Wary of Obama  	Letter to the Editor  	LETTERS; Opinion  	180 words  	Wary of ObamaLiNeBrEaKI was at first encouraged by Barack Obama's early picks for Cabinet slots. During the campaign, many of us who opposed him were concerned by his past associations. LiNeBrEaKI worried that he came from the corrupt Chicago machine, and felt that John McCain at least was an honest dealer with proven character and infegrety.LiNeBrEaKNow we see tired Clinton retreads heading major areas, the big lie of global warming, and the stench of an Illinois governor selling Obama's Senate seat to the highest bidder. Obama and his chief of staff headed the re-election bid of this cretin. Is this the change you hoped for?LiNeBrEaKAs I write this, Obama is touting his support of cleaning up greenhouse gasses. That's just the ticket in a collapsing economy.LiNeBrEaKWe are being sold down the river by the new religion with Al Gore acting as Moses and Obama as the new Messiah. You will see "carbon credits" exchanged like trading cards and a new financial scandal will just add to our demise. Now Al Franken takes the lead in Minnesota.LiNeBrEaKThey just keep counting until the get the votes they need.LiNeBrEaKBob ArmstrongLiNeBrEaKClayton	LETTERS and COMMENTS (93%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); ELECTIONS (78%); BLAGOJEVICH CORRUPTION SCANDAL (78%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (75%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); CARBON OFFSETS (68%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); RELIGION (52%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (67%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN MCCAIN (58%); AL GORE (56%); AL FRANKEN (55%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (72%) MINNESOTA, USA (79%); ILLINOIS, USA (78%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  															
Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Mary Hanna column: Best wishes from my friend Ed  	By Mary Hanna San Mateo County Times  	NEWS  	480 words  	IF IT COMES in a green envelope with a drawing of a Christmas tree on it, is it a Christmas card? Don't bet on it.LiNeBrEaKWhen we received a card that appeared to be hand-addressed to "The Hanna Family" from Ed Begley Jr., I knew that Ed hadn't personally addressed it. Ed's a busy guy. Besides, they have computers that do that.LiNeBrEaKI must admit, my first thought was, "What mailing list did he buy and how do I get off of it?" LiNeBrEaKYou remember Ed, don't you? He was on "St. Elsewhere" and still does TV work as well as appearing in movies like "Best in Show"   one of my all-time favorites.LiNeBrEaKMostly, Ed is famous for being a greenie who rides his bike to awards shows wearing a hemp tuxedo (OK, I made up the tuxedo part). He is, however, about as crunchy granola as you can get.LiNeBrEaKI was curious about what Ed's holiday message might be. I guessed it was an expression of hope for our planet or a suggestion about how to recycle Christmas trees and wrapping paper. Maybe a plea for energy conservation or a wish for peace in the new year?LiNeBrEaKI opened the card, printed by GreenLife Greetings on recycled-content paper, and found   an ad. No greeting, no holiday wish. Just an ad for a gizmo that has saved Ed's family from the evils of tap water, including the awful taste, the hair damage and the dry skin.LiNeBrEaKThere was a picture of Ed, cuddling up to his 5-foot-tall water purifier. The worst part? He was wearing shorts. Like the sight of Ed Begley's hairy knees is going to make me buy something from him.LiNeBrEaKMaybe I was supposed to notice his smooth skin, thanks to the pure water he bathes in, but I couldn't get past his shorts and crummy T-shirt.LiNeBrEaKNobody wants to see that, Ed. If you're going to hawk a product, at least dress up a little, huh?LiNeBrEaKIt was the first greeting card I've ever received that has a no-postage-necessary reply card included.LiNeBrEaKIt got me thinking about celebrity endorsements, especially ones that are meant to appear personal   you know, like when you get a phone call from Martin Sheen around election time.LiNeBrEaKUsually the Hollywood pitch starts out like this: "Hi, this is Mona Movie Star, and I know that you're concerned about the effects of global warming on our planet. I'm calling today to tell you that my friend, Holly Hillside, has all the answers, and when we elect her president, she's going to save Earth from certain destruction and give each and every one of us a free water purifier with a 60-day guarantee.LiNeBrEaK"Your skin will be softer or you'll get your vote back! Don't forget to go to the polls next Tuesday!"LiNeBrEaKHere's my plea for the holidays, election day, and all the year round:LiNeBrEaKHollywood, don't pretend you know me or what I care about. Don't assume I care about your personal preferences, either. Above all, don't disguise a product pitch in a greeting card, or in a movie, for that matter.LiNeBrEaKPeace.LiNeBrEaKWrite to Mary Hanna at P.O.

Commonwealth Journal (Somerset, Kentucky)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Global warming? Sub-zero wind chill temperatures make us wonder: Entire nation locked in early winter deep freeze  	Bill Mardis, Commonwealth Journal, Somerset, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	660 words  	Dec. 23--Bulletin: Global warming meeting canceled. Below zero wind-chill readings are keeping climate doomsayers huddled by the fire.LiNeBrEaKThe entire country, including southern climes, was locked in a deep freeze as Christmas week got under way. Northern states, from east to west, were buried in record-setting snows as autumn said goodbye to winter.LiNeBrEaKThe frigid weather made ice-fishers rush for cover and put a smile on the face of polar bears. This is really winter, like ones about which old-timers reminisce. LiNeBrEaKAn Arctic blast roared across Lake Cumberland Country simultaneously with the official start of winter Sunday morning and sent temperatures plunging to single digits early Monday. A northwest wind made it feel like 5 to 10 degrees below zero.LiNeBrEaKEven though the past November was one of the coolest on record, the shock value of the current cold snap is considerable. Temperatures shot upward to a daily record high of 70 degrees last Friday before diving to near zero Monday morning.LiNeBrEaKThe only thing that kept air temperatures Monday from falling below zero was the absence of snow cover. Had there been snow on the ground, the temperature would have dropped several degrees below zero, something that hasn't happened in the Somerset area for several years. Black Mountain, the highest elevation in Kentucky, recorded 2 below zero early Monday.LiNeBrEaKBitter would describe the cold in these parts. A plunging thermometer dipped to 9 degrees at shortly after 4 a.m. Monday at Lake Cumberland Regional Airport in Somerset. The temperature remained at 9 degrees for five hours, rising to 10 degrees at 9 a.m. It had "warmed" to 18 by noon with a west wind at 6 mph that would take your breath away.LiNeBrEaKAn unofficial thermometer between Somerset and Burnside hovered just below 8 degrees at daybreak Monday. The temperature shivered at 4 degrees between 6 and 7 a.m. Monday at the Wayne County Airport in Monticello.LiNeBrEaKFrigid weather doesn't cause problems in Somerset like during years past. Charles Dick, manager of Somerset Gas Service said there is a plentiful supply of natural gas to keep Somerset's 3,000 gas customers warm.LiNeBrEaK"We've got several ways to bring gas into Somerset," said Dick. "We have unlimited production in Eastern Kentucky ... we're in good shape."LiNeBrEaKSomerset Gas Service during a natural gas shortage in the 1970s extended a natural gas pipeline to Eastern Kentucky. An expanded network of pipelines provides a mode of transportation for previously landlocked gas wells in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky.LiNeBrEaKBefore this, industrial users of natural gas in Somerset were ordered off the gas system during severely cold weather and flames in home furnaces flickered weakly. Most factories kept an alternative source of energy, such as propane, on site for use during frigid weather.LiNeBrEaKNick Comer, spokesman for East Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC), supplier of electricity to South Kentucky RECC, said the frigid weather early Monday did not set a record for electric use.LiNeBrEaK"Our all-time record was set last January 25 when the temperature dropped to 7 degrees," said Comer. Our usage (Monday) was 200 megawatts short of that record."LiNeBrEaKAlthough several of EKPC's natural gas powered peaking units were in operation Monday, Comer said there is no shortage of electricity. A spokesman for Kentucky Utilities did not immediately return a telephone call.LiNeBrEaKA heart-warming outlook: The thermometer is projected to take an upward trend by Christmas Day and the long-range forecast is warmer and wetter than normal for most of the winter.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   Home Final Edition	Legacy depends on definition of security  		EDITORIAL and COMMENT; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. 08A  	260 words  	As the outgoing president deals with the worst economic meltdown since the 1930s by trying to shore up his sorry legacy, he now tells us that he has kept us secure for the past seven years. I guess that depends on what criteria are used to define secure. LiNeBrEaKIf the major criterion is that there have been no new mass casualties on U.S. soil as a result of terrorism, then yes, we have been secure.LiNeBrEaKBut if you take the broader view that security includes leaving a legacy for future generations, then we can safely say the failure to secure those millions of people is complete.LiNeBrEaKIn spite of what the deniers say, global warming is a fact, and the world is still hopelessly addicted to fossil energy. Oil prices are down because of demand destruction -- economic prospects are so poor that demand for oil is plummeting. Even gasoline at $1 per gallon is steep when you're not working.LiNeBrEaKThe country is effectively bankrupt, making many important tasks next to impossible: transitioning to a sustainable, renewable-energy infrastructure; reverting to rail transport for freight and travel; redesigning communities for walkability and bikeability; re-localizing our food production; and training our work force to accomplish all of this.LiNeBrEaKThe Treasury Department and Federal Reserve Board have pumped more than $7 trillion of cash, loans and loan guarantees into the system since September (with scant oversight).LiNeBrEaKI'm sure the high-school class of 2040 will be very thankful to George W. Bush for the secure 19th-century lifestyle he has afforded them.LiNeBrEaK\ MAC CRAWFORD \ Columbus	LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (79%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (74%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (74%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (74%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (74%); TERRORISM (71%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES and TREASURIES (70%); INFRASTRUCTURE (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (54%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (90%) Letters  		GEORGE W BUSH (54%)  	COLUMBUS, OH, USA (90%) OHIO, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  							Letter

The Garden City Telegram (Kansas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Wintry blast  	The Garden City Telegram, Kan.  	COMMENTARY  	427 words  	Dec. 23--Brrr.LiNeBrEaKThe cold weather that's blasted much of the nation's midsection over the past couple of weeks made its presence known in southwest Kansas. LiNeBrEaKBut as bone chilling as it has been here at times, people in Minnesota and other parts of the Upper Midwest have been plagued with wind chills in the neighborhood of 40 below zero.LiNeBrEaKThose folks may be more familiar with such cold weather, but let's face it: No one can get used to that kind of bitter cold.LiNeBrEaKThe Weather Channel even termed the temperatures there as "Siberian levels." That's cold.LiNeBrEaKSo, with Jack Frost creating such a nuisance, what was that about global warming?LiNeBrEaKWhen we're bundling up and shivering while dashing from place to place (pity the poor souls who have to work outside), the notion of planet Earth warming to such a point that it is threatening life as we know it seems even tougher to comprehend.LiNeBrEaKScientists do agree that the world is getting warmer. And many are convinced that increasing concentrations of greenhouses gases, such as carbon dioxide, are partly to blame in generating extreme weather conditions.LiNeBrEaKFair enough. Still, we're left to wonder whether bitterly cold winters would become milder with global warming, and if so pose less of a threat.LiNeBrEaKWinter weather, including exposure to extreme cold, can cause serious injury and illness. In 2007 Kansas was hit with devastating ice storms that resulted in deaths and destroyed property, and left many without power for weeks.LiNeBrEaKLast winter was one of the nation's coldest in years. Mother Nature's most recent offering of arctic air seems like more of the same.LiNeBrEaKThe day's weather always is a topic of conversation. But for scientists who study climate change and its causes, long-term weather trends are of greater interest.LiNeBrEaKOne finding is that when it comes to being good stewards of the environment, we all should do our part by pursuing "greener" alternatives at home and work.LiNeBrEaKWhile that's an admirable goal, we should be forgiven if our attention these days is on something other than sweating the threat of global warming -- especially when the weather feels more like we're headed toward another Ice Age.

Jordan Times (Amman)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Ministerial conference adopts guidelines for water strategy  	Hani Hazaimeh, Jordan Times, Amman  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	699 words  	Dec. 23--DEAD SEA -- A ministerial water conference on Monday adopted guidelines for a water strategy for the Mediterranean, which will focus on protecting water quality and finding a balance between drawing on new water resources and managing demand.LiNeBrEaKThe strategy, which will also address the impact of climate change, will be discussed at a higher level during a meeting of the heads of member states of the Union for the Mediterranean (UPM) by the end of 2010. LiNeBrEaKAddressing the participants, Minister of Water and Irrigation Raed Abu Saud said water scarcity in Jordan and the region constitutes the greatest challenge for any future development projects.LiNeBrEaK"Currently, the estimated annual water deficit in Jordan is 500 million cubic metres [mcm], while the per capita water share is around 150 cubic metres annually compared to the international standard of 1,000 cubic metres per year," Abu Saud said at the meeting, which was attended by 19 representatives from UPM member states, including Israel and the Arab League.LiNeBrEaKHe added that the difference in the water situation between countries of the north and the south calls for strong cooperation and the development of appropriate frameworks for the sustainable management of water resources, as well as feasible solutions to bridge the gap between the water availability in the northern countries and scarcity in the south.LiNeBrEaKAbu Saud noted that Jordan has come a long way in terms of providing nontraditional water sources and using water from wastewater treatment plants.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the Kingdom embarked on projects to desalinate brackish groundwater wells to be used for drinking purposes, and is promoting private sector participation in the management of water facilities, he told participants at the one-day conference, held under the Royal patronage and attended by HRH Prince Hashem.LiNeBrEaKThe government is keen to address the issue of water scarcity, the minister said, citing strategic ventures such as the Disi Water Conveyance Project&Acirc;&cedil; which is projected to supply the capital with 100mcm annually, and the Red-Dead Canal, which will be the foundation stone for water security in the Kingdom in the long run.LiNeBrEaKAbu Saud warned that MENA countries are facing a serious challenge as water reserves in these areas might run out within the next few decades.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Jean-Louis Borloo, the French minister of ecology and sustainable development and planning, noted all countries, whether located in the Mediterranean or beyond, would benefit from peace and stability in the region.LiNeBrEaK"If we succeed to address the water issue, if we manage to agree upon a matter as fundamental as that of water, the Union for the Mediterranean would have provided the proof of its political legitimacy," he said.LiNeBrEaKAvailable water resources are dramatically and irreparably decreasing in regions already exposed to important stresses topped by major risks of destabilisation, Borloo said, adding that these resources have been exposed to demographic, climate and economic pressures.LiNeBrEaK"We have to advance much faster, much further and on a much larger scale," he stressed, pointing out that in order to develop cooperation within the framework of the union, a common strategy in the long term is needed to tackle problems beyond state borders.LiNeBrEaKCalling for the establishment of a group comprising experts from different national authorities to be in charge of the water sector, Borloo proposed that this group meet in January next year.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, he highlighted the importance of engaging civil society in addressing challenges facing the Mediterranean with regard to water resources.LiNeBrEaKBorloo added that civil society actors take action as intermediaries between governments and their people in defining water policies and strategies to be adopted in the near future.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Land for coal plant OK'd  	John G. Edwards  	D; Pg. 1D  	624 words  	las vegas review-journal LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Bureau of Land Management on Monday approved land for one giant billion-dollar coal-fired power plant near Ely and issued a draft decision on a second one nearby.LiNeBrEaKYet neither project is assured of being built.LiNeBrEaKThe federal agency decided to grant right-of-way land for the 1,600-megawatt coal-fired White Pine Energy Station that LS Power of East Brunswick, N.J., plans to build 30 miles north of Ely. LiNeBrEaKWhile the BLM issued a final environmental impact statement for the LS Power project, the agency on Friday posted a copy of an environmental impact statement draft for the $5 billion Ely Energy Station that NV Energy proposes to build nearby.LiNeBrEaKThe final approval on the LS Power project was encouraging to David Sims, director of project development for NV Energy, because he believes NV Energy's project attains higher standards for reduction of pollutants.LiNeBrEaK"We're confident we'd get the same treatment (from BLM)," Sims said.LiNeBrEaKThe BLM action on the LS Power project "is a huge step toward bringing the project to reality," said Mark Milburn, director of project development at LS Power.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Milburn said he expects environmental groups to appeal the BLM decision on the White Pine plant.LiNeBrEaKCharles Benjamin, Nevada office director of Western Resource Advocates, agreed, saying he expects a group of environmental groups to file an administrative appeal. The appeal will point to deficiencies the groups found in the BLM action Monday, he said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups and U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., have spoken against more coal-fired power plants, saying they create pollution associated with greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKReid spokesman Jon Summers said the Senate majority leader remains steadfast in his opposition.LiNeBrEaK"LS Power would be wiser and more helpful to its own investors to withdraw the proposal to build an enormous coal plant to import millions of tons of coal, pollute Nevada's skies and sell its power to other states, and instead focus on developing clean renewable power in our state as rapidly as possible," Summers said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKBoth the White Pine plant and the Ely center need final air permits from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. The division has not decided how it will react to an appeals board decision that required the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider an air permit granted for a coal-fired power plant at Bonanza, Utah.LiNeBrEaKKaren Rajala, coordinator of the White Pine County Community and Economic Development Department, called the BLM actions positive news, but she declined to speculate on either or both of the power plants being built.LiNeBrEaK"I don't participate in setting odds," she said, laughing. "We're just very hopeful it will result in energy development for White Pine County."LiNeBrEaKLocal leaders want to diversify their economy, which has been subject to cyclical changes in the fortunes of mining companies, she said. The coal-fired power plants could help bring additional industry and provide young people with good-paying jobs, she said.LiNeBrEaKNV Energy suspects it will take another year for the BLM to issue a final decision on the Ely Energy Center, Sims said.LiNeBrEaKThe utility company in November 2007 postponed construction of the Ely center for 3&frac12; years, because of delays in BLM action on the plant. The first of two units is now expected to begin power generation by 2015, followed by a second in 2016.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, NV Energy is waiting to see what kind of carbon dioxide regulations may be required by Congress and how much more expensive the rules might make coal-fired power, Sims said.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired plants throw off about twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas plants of the same size.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Vilsack and the Valley: New ag secretary will have a major impact on region's No. 1 industry.  	Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	526 words  	Dec. 23--The nomination of Tom Vilsack to be President-elect Barack Obama's secretary of agriculture has drawn praise, for the most part, from farm interests and environmentalists alike. But there are some specific concerns for California and the Valley. LiNeBrEaKVilsack, the former two-term governor of Iowa, is well-versed in the highly subsidized commodity agriculture of the Midwest, but has little experience in the complex issues of California's agriculture, with its specialty crops and its controversial water problems.LiNeBrEaKBut Vilsack won't be able -- and shouldn't be permitted -- to overlook California, the largest agricultural producer in the nation at roughly $37 billion each year.LiNeBrEaKThat bounty is threatened by a number of problems, from foreign competition and the strength of the dollar to environmental concerns and the overarching issue of water supplies. Vilsack will need to get up to speed on those matters quickly, or his tenure may turn out to be a disappointment for Californians from every side of the debate.LiNeBrEaKGiven Obama's expressed determination to reduce greenhouse gases in the fight against global climate change, Vilsack will have an important role in the administration. Agriculture is responsible for as much as one-third of the greenhouse gases produced in the United States by some estimates.LiNeBrEaKVilsack is a major booster of corn ethanol -- not surprising for a former governor of Iowa. But on that score he may tangle with Stephen Chu, Obama's designee for secretary of energy, who is a fierce critic of using corn to make fuel instead of food.LiNeBrEaKThat debate will be important for California, which produces some corn ethanol now but could become a major source of other bio-fuels in the future.LiNeBrEaKIn another area, Vilsack could be a very good choice for California and the Valley. He will be in charge of many of the nation's nutrition programs, including those that affect children most profoundly. On Wednesday, he said the Department of Agriculture "must place nutrition at the center of all food assistance programs administered by the department."LiNeBrEaKThat's good news in the Valley, where childhood obesity is rampant -- ironically, often among the poor -- because of ignorance of nutrition needs.LiNeBrEaKBut a focus on better nutrition is also an economic opportunity for Valley farmers. Better nutrition is often as simple as "eat more fruits and vegetables," and who knows more about fruits and vegetables than Valley growers? Thus a push for better nutrition could also fuel a move toward a more sustainable economic environment for the Valley's farmers.LiNeBrEaKThat's a very great deal to pile on the plate of an ag secretary who hasn't even been confirmed by the Senate yet. But the Valley has a great deal at stake with this appointment.

Middle East and North Africa Report (Amman, Jordan)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	District Cooling to create major environmental benefits to Bahrain  	Middle East and North Africa Business Report, Amman, Jordan  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	665 words  	Dec. 23--Tabreed Bahrain, the world leader in district cooling, says that the large scale use of district cooling systems in Bahrain will bring large scale environmental benefits to the Kingdom, including a significant reduction in harmful Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions -- otherwise known as greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe company has estimated that for every 10,000 tons of district cooling provided the amount of CO2 emissions would be reduced by 14,700 metric tons annually.  The estimate comes as Tabreed Bahrain plans for the provision of up to 450,000 tons of district cooling to the Manama North Shore for new and existing developments by 2030. LiNeBrEaKTabreed Bahrain is also pioneering the use of seawater for its district cooling projects that are underway. These include Bahrain Financial Harbour, Bahrain World Trade Centre, the Diplomatic area and Reef Island.  In an arid desert climate like Bahrain the company cannot use or rely upon other sources of water for the operation of cooling systems and has therefore developed technology that will use renewable sea water resources.LiNeBrEaKBahrain is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but with the country currently reaching very high per capita CO2 emissions, measured at 35 tons in 2002, there is a growing need for technology that can reduce emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe potential savings that can be brought through district cooling would be the equivalent of BD140 million between now and 2030 if traded on European carbon emission markets at current prices.LiNeBrEaKBernt Andersson, Chief Executive Officer, Tabreed Bahrain said: "One of the clear benefits of district cooling is the benefits it can bring to the environment through lower emissions of harmful CO2 and CFC refrigerants that are produced by mainstream chillers used in existing cooling systems. Refrigerants contribute the equivalent of 725 tons of emissions every year in Bahrain.LiNeBrEaK"Without the use of energy and environmentally efficient district cooling systems to manage the massive new project development in Bahrain there will otherwise be a very significant increase in emissions that will damage the environment."LiNeBrEaKMr. Andersson says that district cooling systems, such as those being introduced by Tabreed Bahrain, help the environment through both increasing energy efficiency and reducing environmental emissions including air pollution, greenhouse gases and ozone destroying refrigerants.LiNeBrEaK"District cooling can be a key strategy for accomplishing an economical and environmentally sound phasing out of harmful refrigerants. District cooling systems use ozone-friendly refrigerants and are better able to control the emissions of whatever refrigerant is used," explained the Tabreed Bahrain Chief Executive.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the environmental benefits the company has estimated that district cooling can reduce peak power demand across the country by up to 65 per cent -- and offer major savings in the requirements for electricity from both the public and private sector.LiNeBrEaKExperts at Tabreed Bahrain also forecast that district cooling systems -- long-term infrastructure projects that can provide chilled air for buildings in a whole district from one energy efficient central plant -- will play an increasingly important role in the long term development of the country.LiNeBrEaKDistrict cooling systems can benefit existing as well as new developments -- with the capacity to bring major savings to private property owners -- and also free up roof space for other projects and additional purposes.

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Environmentalists, utilities disagree on how to promote using less electricity: THE SIMPLEST WAY TO BATTLE GLOBAL WARMING IS TO USE LESS ELECTRICITY. BUT THAT BASIC IDEA HAS SPARKED A BITTER BATTLE BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND UTILITIES.  	John Dorschner, The Miami Herald  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1457 words  	Dec. 23--To reduce her energy bill, Eckels added insulation throughout her house made from recycled blue jeans.LiNeBrEaKThe meter shows energy generated from Eckels' solar panels. What she doesn't use is added to the FPL grid.LiNeBrEaKHer lap pool helped motivate Eckels to go solar -- the state- of-the-art panels now help to power the pool pump.LiNeBrEaKIn all the complex discussions about how to combat global warming, Vicki Eckels does her small part in her Fort Lauderdale home: She sets her air conditioning thermostat at 85 degrees, has stuffed extra insulation into her roof and runs the water heater only 90 minutes a day.LiNeBrEaKThen there's the roof, which isn't so small: It has state-of-the-art solar photovoltaic panels that provide about half of the power to her 1,500-square-foot house. What solar power she doesn't use is sent to the grid -- and she gets paid for it. LiNeBrEaKBottom line: She buys only about 500 kilowatt-hours a month from the utility -- about half that of a typical customer. Her monthly bill is about $60.LiNeBrEaKThat makes Eckels a woman of the moment, part of the green movement that's sweeping the country to battle man-made climate change -- and part of the growing group of consumers who are searching for ways to pinch pennies in these tough economic times. "I do what I can," Eckels says.LiNeBrEaKSuch energy conservation may seem like an inarguable good, but how to promote it has sparked a bitter debate among environmentalists, utilities and policymakers.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities, required by a 1980 law to teach customers to cut power usage, say they're doing a lot. And customers are paying for it -- about two bucks a month on the average Florida Power and Light Co. bill.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say power companies aren't doing nearly enough for that money. The Legislature agrees. It has ordered the Public Service Commission to find ways that utilities can do more for conservation, a path that may lead to making a fundamental change in the way utilities are paid.LiNeBrEaKOn a larger scale, policymakers are talking about the need for complex measures to combat man-made climate change by promoting renewable energy or using cap-and-trade systems to penalize companies that produce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKMORE, NOT LESSLiNeBrEaKStill, one widely respected report, The Stern Review, concluded that "energy efficiency has the potential to be the biggest single source of emissions savings."LiNeBrEaKFor two decades, however, most of us have been using more power, not less. "In spite of more energy-efficient appliances in the market . . . electric usage per FPL customer has increased by approximately 20 percent," FPL spokesman Mayco Villafana says.LiNeBrEaKTiVos that run around the clock, televisions scattered around the house, cellphones charging, computers doing background projects in sleep mode, "smart" toasters with tiny sensors -- they all soak up electricity.LiNeBrEaKOnly this year, with soaring energy prices slamming customers during a recession, usage by FPL customers dipped by 2. 8 percent in the third quarter, although much of that is attributed to common penny-pinching and empty, foreclosed houses.LiNeBrEaKEven so, the green movement plays some part. New air conditioners, clothes dryers and many other appliances have been designed to use less energy. Thicker windows and insulation in attics help.LiNeBrEaKSome actions are cheaper than others. Eckels paid $43,000 for her solar system in her home just south of downtown Fort Lauderdale. For that, she will get a $2,000 credit on her federal income taxes. She hopes to get a rebate of $20,000 from the state if new funding is provided for a solar program.LiNeBrEaKUsing solar, she says, has taught her the value of electricity. "I unplug everything when not being used" because many electronic appliances, particularly the more sophisticated, tend to keep running in background mode even when unused.LiNeBrEaKShe uses efficient fluorescent bulbs, has some tinted windows, draws curtains to keep direct sunlight from overheating the house, uses a compost heap for garbage instead of having a disposal. And, oh yes, she drives a Ford Escape hybrid.LiNeBrEaKHelped by new regulations, Eckels participates in net metering, in which she gets credit from FPL for solar power she feeds to the grid equal to the rate utilities receive from customers.LiNeBrEaKSo far, Eckels is not part of a mass movement. Only 176 of FPL's 4. 5 million customers have signed up for net metering this year. Still, that's up from 27 in 2006 and 87 in 2007.LiNeBrEaKFor those who want to cut consumption, FPL is ready to help, with plenty of advice on its website and by phone. The utility even offers to send a person to your home for a detailed assessment of how to cut power usage.LiNeBrEaKSuch actions are part of 21 energy conservation programs FPL operates. They also include measures that reward businesses and residents who agree to cut their usage during peak periods, as well as sealing up windows for low-income customers. Such programs cost the average customer $2. 03 a month.LiNeBrEaKFPL boasts that 2006 federal data shows it's No. 1 nationally for "cumulative energy efficiency achievement." It says its conservation efforts over the past 30 years have meant it has not had to build 12 medium-sized power plants.LiNeBrEaKSKEPTICAL OF FPLLiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are skeptical of some of FPL's claims. Stephen Smith, head of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, wrote recently to the Governor's Action Team on Energy and Climate Change that FPL's claim to be No. 1 relates to demand reduction programs, paying customers to lower usage at certain times, and not overall energy savings.LiNeBrEaKMeasuring energy savings as a percentage of total sales, FPL ranks No. 19 nationally, Smith wrote. "Energy savings, not demand reduction, is the path to reduced global warming."LiNeBrEaKCertainly, customers are paying. In a PSC workshop earlier this year, environmentalist Holly Binns said Florida utilities have collected $4. 15 billion from customers since 1981 to reduce electricity consumption, but consumption per customer has risen 44 percent in Florida while it declined by 28 percent in California, an early advocate of energy-efficient appliances and building codes as well as demanding aggressive programs from utilities.LiNeBrEaKAt that same meeting, John McWhirter of the Florida Industrial Power Users Group noted that it was an odd system when the law required those who profited from increased usage to teach consumers how to lower usage.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say the best way to make utilities perform better is to change the way they're paid. Earlier this year, they persuaded the Legislature to ask the PSC to develop a report on separating profit from the amount of electricity people use.LiNeBrEaKNow, the more electricity customers use, the more the utility profits. Yet at the same time, state law requires that utilities teach customers to use less electricity.LiNeBrEaK"This is a perverse disincentive," says Smith of the Southern Alliance. 'Utilities are trying to aggressively get more revenue, while they say, 'How great we are in energy efficiency.' "LiNeBrEaKSmith and many other environmentalists say decoupling revenue from usage would allow the utilities to get a reasonable rate of profit, but that profit wouldn't increase when customers increase their usage. That way utilities could help reduce energy usage without hurting themselves, or so environmentalists theorize.LiNeBrEaKNOT ENTHUSEDLiNeBrEaKThe utilities are not enthused. "There is no evidence that decoupling leads to reductions in demand for electricity," says FPL's Villafana. "And given FPL's record as the nation's No. 1 utility for energy conservation, we are hard-pressed to see how decoupling could have done a better job" than FPL has already done.LiNeBrEaK"In addition, decoupling could harm customers by reducing the incentive for utilities to keep their costs as low as possible," Villafana says, because they would be guaranteed a certain profit and have no incentive to control costs.LiNeBrEaKSmith counters that a conscientious utility would still control costs. "They just hate to see a loss of their rapid growth." Decoupling "would set a very important tone."LiNeBrEaKBoth sides "acknowledge that revenue decoupling by itself does not provide a utility with an incentive to pursue energy conservation." Other programs would have to insist on performance goals.LiNeBrEaKIn the past several months, the PSC staff listened to everyone's statements on decoupling and drafted a report for the Legislature outlining the arguments but didn't come to a firm conclusion.

The New York Times 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	For Science Adviser, Dogged Work Against Global Perils  	By ANDREW C. REVKIN and CORNELIA DEAN  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; Pg. 3  	422 words  	John P. Holdren has spent decades wrestling with ways to reduce planet-scale risks -- notably the spread of nuclear weapons and the buildup of greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaK  Now Dr. Holdren has been tapped to be the science adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, who pledged on Saturday to listen to such advice ''especially when it's inconvenient.'' LiNeBrEaK  Many longtime friends, and some critics, of Dr. Holdren said his dogged nature and passion for the power of science would  make it hard for the president to renege on that pledge. LiNeBrEaK  In an interview, Dr. Holdren, a 64-year-old physicist and environmental policy professor at Harvard, said he was confident he would not have to fight to be heard. He noted that the position was being restored to the level of assistant to the president, on a par with the national security adviser. LiNeBrEaK  ''President-elect Obama has made it absolutely clear that he is making science and technology one of the centerpieces of this administration,'' Dr. Holdren said.LiNeBrEaK  With Dr. Holdren, Dr. Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol M. Browner as a White House coordinator for energy and climate, Mr. Obama has chosen advocates for strong action against greenhouse gases. Each has supported a mix of market mechanisms like a legislated cap on emissions and a push to improve nonpolluting energy technology. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Holdren will also be co-chairman of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, along with Harold Varmus, the Nobel laureate who heads the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Eric Lander, who heads the Broad Institute, a Harvard-M.I.T. collaborative for genomics research, and who was a leader in efforts to decipher the human genome.LiNeBrEaK  In an interview, Dr. Varmus said one of their first tasks would be to consider new appointees to the council, known as P-CAST. Dr. Varmus noted that current council members, in a ''dear successors'' letter to the incoming group, suggested that it be shrunk  to perhaps 20 members from 35 and that the council meet more often with lawmakers and the Office of Management and Budget.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Holdren has occasionally been drubbed by conservatives as overstating environmental perils. But he has many defenders, too. Lewis M. Branscomb, a physicist who served on presidential panels in three administrations, wrote in an e-mail message that if Dr. Holdren, Dr. Chu and others nominated for science and technical positions were confirmed, ''No president since the days of Benjamin Franklin will ever have been so well served in matters scientific.''

The New York Times 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	In Choice to Lead NOAA, a Wide Range of Credentials  	By CORNELIA DEAN  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; Pg. 3  	420 words  	Jane Lubchenco, the marine ecologist President-elect Barack Obama has chosen to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, would bring diverse scientific credentials to the job. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Lubchenco  has been a professor at Harvard and at Oregon State University, where her research focuses, among other things, on the effects of overfishing and the influence of climate change on ocean processes. She has been an outspoken advocate of action on climate and for marine conservation and has received a MacArthur ''genius'' grant. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most eminent scientific organization, and once headed the American Association for the Advancement of Science, its largest.  LiNeBrEaK  NOAA's purview is wide, extending from the depths of the ocean to the edge of space, and includes atmospheric research, weather prediction and other fields. Scientists, activist groups and environmentalists expressed enthusiastic confidence that she was up to the job. LiNeBrEaK  ''The challenges are huge, but the opportunities are even bigger,'' she said in an interview. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Lubchenco has also broken ground in her career by redefining what it means to work as a scientist. For one thing, when she and her husband, Bruce Menge, a fellow marine ecologist, went to Oregon State University 31 years ago, they both wanted to teach, do research and build a family. So, initially, they shared a single faculty appointment. It was a sacrifice financially, she said, but it ''absolutely'' worked. The model is becoming more common, she said, ''though not common enough.''LiNeBrEaK  And Dr. Lubchenco rejects the idea, widespread in academia, that the researcher's obligation to society is more or less limited to making findings and reporting them in the scholarly literature.LiNeBrEaK   She is the principal founder of the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program, named for the pioneering ecologist, which trains researchers to participate effectively in the policy arena and to communicate their findings to journalists and the public. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Lubchenco is as aware as anyone of the charges that the Bush administration has been unfriendly to science, especially research related to climate change, one of the central missions of the 13,000 people at NOAA. LiNeBrEaK  But, she said, ''there are some spectacular scientists and other individuals on the NOAA team. I have already heard from quite a few people at NOAA, and they seem energized and optimistic about working together and being able to tackle some of the real serious problems.''

The New York Times 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	At a Sleek Bioenergy Lab, A Lens on a Cabinet Pick  	By KENNETH CHANG and ANDREW C. REVKIN  	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; Pg. 1  	1338 words  	The Joint BioEnergy Institute, which encompasses the fourth floor of a high-tech office building here in a neighborhood of biotech companies, radiates a sleek ecological modernity: floorboards manufactured of recycled materials and laminated to look like bamboo, trendy office furniture and laboratories stocked with new equipment.LiNeBrEaK  It even has a hip nickname: Jay-Bay. That is how everyone pronounces  JBEI. The institute has the look and feel  --  and organizational chart  --  of a startup venture, not a federal research laboratory.LiNeBrEaK  But JBEI is financed by the Energy Department -- $135 million over five years. And JBEI is  under the purview of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in nearby Berkeley, whose director, Steven Chu, has been selected as the next energy secretary.LiNeBrEaK  Over the past week, President-elect Barack Obama has made high-profile announcements of science appointments like that of Dr. Chu and has said that science findings will guide policy.  LiNeBrEaK  For years, Dr. Chu has been unambiguous in stating that carbon dioxide emitted by cars, power plants and industry is a direct cause of global warming and that urgent action to slash emissions is needed to avoid upheaval of the planet's climate.LiNeBrEaK  He  has not said anything publicly about his plans or goals as energy secretary, and   he has not talked to the news media since being selected. But his actions as Lawrence Berkeley's director, including the creation of JBEI, offer hints of how he might harness the 17 national laboratories  --  or at least the ones not dedicated to nuclear arms research  --  to address climate and energy issues. LiNeBrEaK  JBEI, whose mission is to use so-called synthetic biology to convert plant cellulose into fuel, moved into its Emeryville home last May. It is one of several major forays by Lawrence Berkeley into alternative fuels, an area where the lab conducted almost no research before Dr. Chu became  director in 2004.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu has often said that free markets will not be enough to drive the necessary changes in energy use, and Mr. Obama highlighted Dr. Chu's efforts on renewable fuels when he announced his selection. ''Steven is uniquely suited to be our next secretary of energy as we make this pursuit a guiding purpose of the Department of Energy, as well as a national mission,'' Mr. Obama said.LiNeBrEaK  In Dr. Chu, Mr. Obama has selected someone who possesses unquestioned scientific credentials  --  Dr. Chu shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for using lasers to cool atoms to temperatures just above absolute zero  --  and management experience within the Energy Department. Lawrence Berkeley has 4,000 employees and a $650 million budget.LiNeBrEaK  Unlike most federal research laboratories, whose budgets have been flat or slashed over the last four years, Lawrence Berkeley's has grown about 20 percent during that time. LiNeBrEaK  Researchers at the laboratory traditionally explored a variety of basic sciences like physics, chemistry and biology. Since the 1970s, the lab has had  a division working on energy conservation  --  developing energy standards for appliances, for instance. But most researchers worked on their own particular interests, sometimes with collaboration, sometimes not.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu decided the lab should undertake a more concerted effort on energy, which he regarded as one of the most pressing scientific and technological issues of the 21st century. He motivated the staff, recruited scientists and used his Nobel prestige to raise attention to  the need to replace fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK  ''He came with that vision, and I think it's really energized a lot of people here and changed their research directions in very good ways,'' said A. Paul Alivisatos, the deputy director. Dr. Chu has also shown willingness, perhaps zeal, in shaking up the traditional ways of the national laboratories. A second biofuels research center set up under Dr. Chu's watch is financed  by $500 million from BP, the petroleum company, in a collaboration of a magnitude unprecedented for a national laboratory.LiNeBrEaK  In mid-2005, about nine months after becoming director, Dr. Chu called Jay Keasling, head of the lab's physical biosciences division, and Dr. Alivisatos, then head of the materials sciences division, together for a meeting. ''He said, 'I want to work on energy,' '' Dr. Keasling recalled. ''And he wanted to work on transportation fuels.''LiNeBrEaK  In the battle to lower emissions of carbon dioxide, cars, trucks and airplanes pose a difficult problem, because most of the alternative power sources  --  nuclear, wind, solar  --  do not work on the small scale needed for transportation, and battery technology is still in need of additional advances.LiNeBrEaK  Biofuels, fermented and distilled from plants, may offer a solution.  Although the burning of biofuels still emits carbon dioxide, it is the same carbon dioxide that the plants had sucked out of the air. LiNeBrEaK  But  the growing of plants for fuel competes with the growing of food. In addition, corn-derived ethanol, the biofuel in use today in the United States, takes considerable energy to produce, and that greatly diminishes any ecological benefits. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu hopes to find (or engineer) better biofuel plants and to develop processes for breaking down cellulose and transforming it into fuel at costs competitive with gasoline. LiNeBrEaK  ''Steve was out in front of this long before there was this $4 gasoline,'' said Dr. Keasling, who now also serves as chief executive of JBEI. LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Keasling and Dr. Alivisatos were put in charge of what was called the Helios vision, turning sunlight into renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Keasling's own research focuses on engineering microbes to produce particular chemicals. His major success was bacteria that make an antimalaria drug. With Dr. Chu's push into biofuels, Dr. Keasling is now directing this synthetic biology research at microbes that could easily break down cellulose in the cell walls of plants into sugars, a process that now takes inefficient high temperatures.LiNeBrEaK  ''I had always thought about biofuels and bioenergy,'' Dr. Keasling said, ''but there was just no profit in it and there was no interest in it and no funding from federal agencies.''LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu's evangelism helped generate financing. In summer 2006, the Energy Department announced a competition for setting up three bioenergy research centers. A proposal by Lawrence Berkeley and several other partners  became JBEI, fulfilling one component of the original Helios vision. Meanwhile, BP offered $50 million a year for 10 years to create the Energy Biosciences Institute, which is conducting more basic research into biofuels. Dr. Chu pushed the University of California, Berkeley, along with Lawrence Berkeley and the University of Illinois, to apply for the grant. LiNeBrEaK  That generated controversy about corporate financing at the Berkeley campus, which runs Lawrence Berkeley under a contract with the Energy Department.  A large laboratory building for the BP institute is scheduled to be built beginning in 2010. LiNeBrEaK  The sources of money have also shaped which initiatives are moving ahead most aggressively. While biofuel research is flush with money, the work on artificial photosynthesis, to skip the plant-growing step entirely, another key part of the original Helios vision, is being done with about $5 million a year from the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaK  Nathan Lewis, a Caltech specialist in solar energy who worked with Dr. Chu on some  energy research strategies for Lawrence Berkeley, conceded that it was not the ideal mix of work. ''The oil company certainly has more of a vested interest in that approach, and the government simply didn't step up,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Meanwhile, JBEI  has grown to a staff of 150. Dr. Keasling said that people pursuing  different projects worked next to one another in hopes that information would be shared and collaboration would be encouraged. LiNeBrEaK  ''The idea is that you can move the research rapidly,'' he said, ''and in part we took a lesson from the biotech community and the high-tech community that has grown up in the Bay Area.''

A05  	511 words  	Rick Warren is in a place he never expected to be: at the center of a culture war.LiNeBrEaKThe pastor chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to give the inaugural invocation backed Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in his home state of California. But he did so belatedly, with none of the enthusiasm he brings to fighting AIDS and illiteracy.

They were outraged that Obama decided to give a place of honor to a pastor they consider a general for the Christian right.LiNeBrEaKLost in the uproar was the irony of Warren's plight. Ever since he began his climb to prominence in the 1980s, he has battled complaints from evangelicals that he isn't nearly conservative enough.LiNeBrEaK"The comments from many of the evangelicals further to the right of him are often critical for his lax stance on their passionate issues," said Scott Thumma, a professor at Connecticut's Hartford Seminary who researches megachurches and writes about the challenges for gay and lesbian Christians.LiNeBrEaKWarren has spoken out against the use of torture to combat terrorism.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Bogus bidder: I had to take a chance  	Patty Henetz, The Salt Lake Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1031 words  	Dec. 23--Tim DeChristopher stood alone Friday when he placed bogus bids on drilling parcels near two Utah national parks, single-handedly sabotaging an oil- and gas-lease sale that caught the attention of Congress and the incoming Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKNow, the 27-year-old University of Utah economics student stands with powerful new friends, including Pat Shea, former head of the Bureau of Land Management; Utah's most prominent defense attorney, Ron Yengich; and hundreds of supporters promising to contribute to his legal-defense fund. LiNeBrEaKOthers led him to this point, inspiring DeChristopher to oppose a government he fears is leading the world to climate disaster. His mother, Christine, helped start the West Virginia chapter ofLiNeBrEaKthe Sierra Club and took him as a small child to anti-coal rallies. Terry Root, a Stanford University scientist who worked with Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, put her hand on DeChristopher's shoulder and apologized for being too late to avert the worst effects of global warming. And Gore called on young people to commit acts of civil disobedience to stop greenhouse-gas belching coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaK"I don't ever want to have to look back at 2008 and know that there was still a slight chance that we could have done something to make a difference, and I didn't take that chance," DeChristopher said Monday. "Ethically, I have to pursue that chance."LiNeBrEaKThat pursuit could land him in federal court.LiNeBrEaKMelodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Salt Lake City, said Monday that her office hadn't seen the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's investigative report. Federal prosecutors likely will do their own inquiry on whether DeChristopher's case should be brought before a grand jury, which wouldn't happen for weeks.LiNeBrEaK"The process is just starting," Rydalch said. "It will take time to evaluate evidence and make a determination whether we will prosecute."LiNeBrEaKBLM spokeswoman Mary Wilson said Monday the agency was considering what to do next. " This is so unprecedented," she said, "we don't know what our options are."LiNeBrEaKOne possibility: Redo the lease auction. Normally, the agency must give 30 days' notice. But the BLM might be able to bypass that rule, Wilson said, by offering a shorter public-review period.LiNeBrEaKKathleen Sgamma, director of government affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, said her organization had no plans to take action against DeChristopher.LiNeBrEaK"We just hope the U.S. Attorney's Office makes sure this doesn't happen again," she said.LiNeBrEaKMainstream conservation organizations, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which opposed the lease sale, remained on the sidelines.LiNeBrEaK"It's not clear whether this individual has broken any laws," Executive Director Scott Groene said Monday. "But SUWA doesn't condone any illegal activity."LiNeBrEaKShea, who with Yengich is representing DeChristopher, said he stepped forward to help the student because when Shea was the BLM boss, anonymous protesters took destructive actions against the public-lands agency. By contrast, Shea said, DeChristopher has "integrity of purpose" that deserves protection in court.LiNeBrEaKBLM officials said DeChristopher bid $1. 8 million -- which he has neither the intention nor the money to pay -- for more than 10 lease parcels near Arches and Canyonlands while driving up other bids by about $500,000.LiNeBrEaKAfter other oil and gas bidders complained, BLM special agents escorted out DeChristopher and his roommate, Kent Boardman, for a closed-door interview as the auction proceeded.LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher said Monday -- during an interview at his ad-hoc strategy center at the back of the One World Cafe in Salt Lake City -- that his conversation with the agents was open and honest. He told them he believed the auction was the real fraud, that it had been rushed through to beat the clock on the lame-duck Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"I also felt it had been a threat to my future," he said, "and, in response to that, this was a conscious act of civil disobedience."LiNeBrEaKThe agents spent even more time with Boardman. DeChristopher said they may have been trying to determine whether there had been some kind of conspiracy.LiNeBrEaKRather, Boardman was surprised the first time his roomie raised bidding paddle No. 70.LiNeBrEaK"He said, 'What are you doing?' " DeChristopher recalled. Then, after DeChristopher won a bid, Boardman said, "'Do you have a plan?' "LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher said he acted because less brazen tactics weren't working to stop the drilling leases. To him, the big picture includes catastrophic famine, millions of refugees and an agricultural system killed off by climate disruption.LiNeBrEaKMeeting Terry Root, a speaker at this year's Wallace Stegner symposium at the U. law school, still resonates with DeChristopher: "There were things we could have done in the '80s, things we could have done in the '90s, but at this point, we're too late, my generation has failed you, and I'm sorry,' " the student recalled Root saying.LiNeBrEaK"That was a very powerful experience for me," DeChristopher said. "It really rocked me."LiNeBrEaKFrankly, he said, he was hoping for someone else to come along to take action. Yet in an essay he posted Saturday on the Web blog oneutah.org, DeChristopher quoted from June Jordan's 1980 "Poem for South African Women," when he wrote, "Hopefully all of us will realize that we are the ones we have been waiting for."LiNeBrEaKIt's down to the wire, DeChristopher said, "down to one of our last opportunities here in the next couple of years to make drastic changes in order to ensure a livable future."LiNeBrEaKDuring a "Democracy Now" radio interview Monday morning, DeChristopher reiterated that he was willing to do prison time, but preferred staying free.LiNeBrEaK"I don't want to be a martyr or anything like that," he said.LiNeBrEaKphenetz@sltrib.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); NATIONAL PARKS (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (86%); AUCTIONS (78%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (78%); EMISSIONS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); LAWYERS (76%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (74%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (73%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (73%); WILDERNESS (73%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (73%); POWER PLANTS (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (68%); GRAND JURY (63%)  	Gas/Oil  	AL GORE (70%); BARACK OBAMA (58%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (98%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	December 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081223-ST-DRILLING-BID-20081223  	Newspaper  	ST  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune   				UNIVERSITY OF UTAH (58%); BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (57%); SIERRA CLUB (56%); STANFORD UNIVERSITY (56%); INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (56%)  											
San Jose Mercury News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Holiday hiatus, but here's what we're watching  	John Ryan, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	SPORTS  	474 words  	Dec. 23--Every year the Buzz page takes a holiday hiatus, and every year we wonder if that would be allowed were the 49ers and Raiders in the playoff hunt. For next year, then, Mike Singletary has us worried. (Fortunately, the Raiders appear to be considering the return of Tom Cable, so we won't have to worry about them until global warming has made it impossible to ski anyway.) LiNeBrEaKThe page will return Tuesday, Jan. 6. Some brief notebook-emptying on end-of-year activities:LiNeBrEaK--Amid all the bowl games last Jan. 1, the most compelling event was the NHL's Winter Classic. The outdoor game went from slightly zany marketing ploy to true stroke of genius that might be the best thing Gary Bettman has ever done.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Pittsburgh visited Buffalo. This year, it's Detroit visiting Chicago in Wrigley Field. The Red Wings are the defending champions, and the Blackhawks have risen from the ashes. The ticket market is hot hot hot. But will the game be c-c-c-cold?LiNeBrEaKLast year, the game-time temperature in Buffalo was 33 degrees, and when the snow fell, it was gentle and windless and magical for the occasion. Monday in Chicago, with temperatures near zero, the city closed its public ice-skating rinks.LiNeBrEaKIf there are space heaters in the penalty box, this could be the dirtiest game in NHL history.LiNeBrEaK--The NBA: five Christmas Day games. Too much. For about 20 years, that day meant something on the NBA schedule, and now it's too glutted to be special.LiNeBrEaK--On the (very good) chance that Raiders-Tampa Bay is less than compelling, and on the (off) chance that the 49ers haven't grabbed your attention, the NFL tossed out its archaic TV rules for this week to give fans more of what they're looking for. The Bay Area will get early and late games on both CBS and Fox, despite the 49ers home game that would otherwise prevent CBS from airing afternoon competition.LiNeBrEaKAt 10 a.m., while the Raiders and Bucs are on KPIX, the Giants and Vikings will play on KTVU. But the Giants have nothing to play for, and with Rich Gannon calling the game pitting his old team against his old coach, it might be worth listening to the second half.LiNeBrEaKAt 1: 15 p.m., as KTVU shows Mike Singletary continuing to prove the Yorks need him more than he needs them, KPIX will show the Dolphins and Jets fighting for a playoff spot. One item sure to make an appearance on the telecast is the Jets' official 2008 calendar, in which December is Chad Pennington Month.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	Farewell to a low-profile chief;  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 		Op-Ed; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. B4  	1334 words  	Editor - There is just a tinge of insincerity attached to the words of those clamoring that San Francisco Police Chief Heather Fong has kept too low a profile. She has been doing her job as she sees to be proper. Can you imagine the headlines she might have generated if there had been a near-daily public view: "Fong looks to become mayor"?LiNeBrEaKWith more cooperation all around, she could have accomplished more than the "job well done!"LiNeBrEaK WILLIAM J. COBURN  LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco LiNeBrEaKSource of prideLiNeBrEaKEditor - I read with sadness of Police Chief Heather Fong's decision to retire. While I applaud her choice to do what is good for her, I also feel a loss for our city. It has made me extra proud of San Francisco to have Heather Fong as our chief of police. I admire her and the way she has conducted herself. I thank her for all the agony she has experienced in performing her work so nobly. All the best to her in the next phase of her life.LiNeBrEaKSHIRLEY KAISER San Francisco LiNeBrEaKHope for improvementLiNeBrEaKEditor - When Heather Fong is replaced as San Francisco's head cop, let's hope that p.c. stands only for police chief. LiNeBrEaKNORMAN VOGEL LiNeBrEaK San Francisco LiNeBrEaKGood dealLiNeBrEaKEditor - In one of the more outrageous interpretations of history I've read, Larry Kelley accuses Franklin D. Roosevelt of gaming the political process and creating 20 million dependent citizens and reliable Democratic voters by establishing Social Security "A second New Deal is a recipe for disaster," Dec. 19. I have understood that Social Security is enduringly popular among both Democrats and Republicans as an intergenerational compact that prevents seniors from living in poverty.LiNeBrEaKRegarding the human cause of the current warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrote last year, "The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions."LiNeBrEaKWhile direct regulation may be appropriate in some cases, a "cap and trade" program favored by President-elect Obama and other leaders is explicitly designed to allow companies to innovate and find the most cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Rather than driving the country into another Depression, these new technologies, efficiencies and employment opportunities will help to lift us out of our Great Recession.LiNeBrEaKDAVE MASSEN San Francisco LiNeBrEaKExecutive wrecking ballLiNeBrEaKEditor - How is it possible that a president has the power to change regulations that have been put in place through years of effort by citizens and Congress? I am talking about President Bush's plans to allow uranium mining near the Grand Canyon. He wants to block Congress from preventing it. What kind of democracy is this?LiNeBrEaK Also, he has proposed to cut Fish and Wildlife Service scientists out of reviewing mining projects to see whether there is danger to wildlife - and leave it up to the Department of Transportation. Congress, where are you?LiNeBrEaKMARGARETHA DERASARY LiNeBrEaKOakland LiNeBrEaKPerpetuating hateLiNeBrEaKA young woman was kidnapped and violently raped by four men because she was a lesbian "Four men sought in gang rape of lesbian," Dec. 21.LiNeBrEaKBy having Rev. Rick Warren give an invocation at his inaugural, President-elect Barack Obama is indirectly perpetuating this kind of atrocity. We strongly urge Obama to select a religious leader who truly believes in equal rights for all.LiNeBrEaKELIZABETH RUTZICK LiNeBrEaK IAN TULLER LiNeBrEaK San Francisco LiNeBrEaKUSA reliableLiNeBrEaK Editor - In the fog of misinformation and spin swirling around the Big Three auto bailout, one of the biggest canards is the charge that American cars are less reliable than the foreign competition.LiNeBrEaKWhile it's true that Detroit made a lot of shoddy cars in the '70s, '80s and into the '90s, numerous independent studies show that for over 10 years, most Ford and many GM models are more reliable than their European counterparts and come in a very close second to Japanese imports.LiNeBrEaK I drive a 1998 Ford Escort with over 110,000 miles on it. The only thing to go wrong was the horn, which was replaced on warranty - and I get 36 miles per gallon on the road and 22 mpg in town. I have friends who have spent thousands of dollars each in repairs on their Mercedes, BMWs and Toyotas. Perception is not always reality. The foreign automakers are clearly ahead of Detroit in one area: marketing and sales pitch. LiNeBrEaKRICHARD COVERT LiNeBrEaK San Francisco LiNeBrEaKA voice for workersLiNeBrEaKEditor - In his cabinet selections, President-elect Barack Obama has drawn heavily from his former 2008 Democratic competitors. With the appointment of Gov. Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary, who had a short foray in the presidential race, Obama nominated a fourth ex-opponent to his administration. This "team of rivals," however, still lacks the voice of the second runner-up.LiNeBrEaKDespite his personal failings, John Edwards' voice must be given a place in Obama's administration. During the campaign, no other candidate spoke with more passion of ending poverty in the next 30 years than Edwards. Since the end of his candidacy, there has been no mention of the 37 million impoverished Americans. Further, unions representing more than 2 million workers endorsed Edwards because of his commitment to the cause of working and middle-class families. LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, he championed the defense of good American jobs and the enactment of strong worker safety laws. Surely, there is room for one more former rival.LiNeBrEaKANTHONY TUCCI Pacifica LiNeBrEaKNo accountabilityLiNeBrEaK Editor - Too much going to illegal aliens: welfare, food stamps, education and free health care. Too many families not taking care of their own family members, because social services step in for free ...why? We were better off when neighbors, friends, family, churches and charity gave you a hand up - with accountability. Now social services ruined all that with free handouts - and has bankrupt us in many ways.LiNeBrEaKKEVIN O'CONNOR Santa Barbara LiNeBrEaKWhere's the devastation?LiNeBrEaK Editor - When will I begin to see stories detailing the massive destruction wrought by the light brown apple moth?LiNeBrEaKGiven that our leaders were ready to spray the entire Bay Area for years to come to counter this grave threat to the state's agriculture, I keep wondering when we will see and hear about the massive damage that the some experts were predicting.LiNeBrEaKIs it possible the proposed emergency spraying was unnecessary? I can't imagine the possibility our leaders created a crisis for the benefit of a few wealthy and powerful stake holders ... oh wait, maybe I can.LiNeBrEaKROBIN EARL Richmond LiNeBrEaKShutting out the poorLiNeBrEaKEditor - In reading C.W. Nevius' article "Homeless problem remedy: Serve San Franciscans first" Dec. 19, I was amazed at the desperation on the part of the city not to provide for people who are homeless and needy.LiNeBrEaK The point of the article is that people are coming into the city for services and that we should "take care of our own." This thinking reflects a circle-the-wagons approach and one that is reflective of the Middle Ages in the way they circled in their own little cities with their gates closed. It is a very self-serving, selfish, approach. LiNeBrEaKThe reality is that we are all a part of the community. We are not a city with walls, where only the privileged are allowed, even though rents are fast making it that way. LiNeBrEaK I found it rather humorous as to how we would approach the situation: have case managers check with other cities to see if people have received services in the past three months. First, suppose they have not needed services until now, and secondly, think of the resources in salary and benefits that is going to cost. LiNeBrEaKFinally, this sounds like desperation, with no sense of compassion. It reflects upon the compassion of our leaders: Their compassion is for themselves. We should be looking at how we can cut salaries and expenses to provide for those in need. LiNeBrEaK The reality is the needs are growing, people are going hungry, losing housing. Rather than circle our wagons, we should open our arms and our hearts to provide those needs.LiNeBrEaKFATHER RIVER DAMIEN SIMS LiNeBrEaKSociety of Franciscan Workers LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco 	POLICE FORCES (92%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (91%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (86%); SOCIAL SECURITY (86%); CLIMATE CHANGE (85%); RECESSION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); EMPLOYMENT (77%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (74%); MAYORS (71%); POLITICS (69%); CLIMATOLOGY (67%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (64%); US PRESIDENTS (86%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (64%); VOTERS and VOTING (64%); EMISSIONS (62%); URANIUM MINING (60%); MINES and MINING (60%); VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS (50%) OP-ED; LETTER  		BARACK OBAMA (52%); GEORGE W BUSH (50%)  	SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  															
The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Pastor's toughest critics are evangelicals  	By Rachel Zoll The Associated Press  	BREAKING; News; National; World; Religion; Features  	1100 words  	Rick Warren is in a place he never expected to be: at the center of a culture war.LiNeBrEaKThe pastor chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to give the inaugural invocation backed Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in his home state of California. But he did so belatedly, with none of the enthusiasm he brings to fighting AIDS and illiteracy.LiNeBrEaKWhen other conservative Christians held stadium rallies and raised tens of millions of dollars for the ballot effort, there was no sign of Warren. Neither he nor his wife, Kay, donated any of their considerable fortune to the campaign, according to public records and the Warrens' spokesman. LiNeBrEaKIn fact, his endorsement seemed calculated for minimal impact. It was announced late on a Friday, just 10 days before Election Day, on a Web site geared for members of his Saddleback Community Church, not the general public. LiNeBrEaKFor gay rights advocates, that strategy was nothing more than an attempt to mask Warren's prejudice. They were outraged that Obama decided last week to give a place of honor to a pastor they consider a general for the Christian right.LiNeBrEaKLost in the uproar was the irony of Warren's plight. Ever since he began his climb to prominence in the 1980s, he has battled complaints from fellow evangelicals that he isn't nearly conservative enough.LiNeBrEaK"The comments from many of the evangelicals further to the right of him are often critical for his lax stance on their passionate issues," said Scott Thumma, a professor at Connecticut's Hartford Seminary who researches megachurches and writes about the challenges for gay and lesbian Christians.LiNeBrEaKOn paper, Warren might look like any other religious traditionalist. He is the son of a Southern Baptist pastor, graduate of a Southern Baptist seminary, and his megachurch in Orange County is part of the conservative denomination.LiNeBrEaKBut Warren holds a different worldview than his roots suggest. He has spoken out against the use of torture to combat terrorism. He has joined the fight against global warming and, encouraged by his wife, has put his prestige and money behind helping people with AIDS. The Warrens have done so at a time when a notable number of conservative Christians still consider the virus a punishment from God.LiNeBrEaK"If you want to save a life, I don't care what your background is and I don't care what your political party is," Warren said recently. "I think some of these humanitarian issues transcend politics, or ethnic or religious beliefs."LiNeBrEaK"For probably the last 25 years, evangelicalism became co-opted, and for most people it became a political term," Warren said. "And it got identified with a certain style of political leanings."LiNeBrEaKWhile many religious conservatives openly condemn Islam as inherently evil, Warren reaches out to the American Muslim community. This past Saturday, he gave the keynote address at the convention of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, based in Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaK"His social consciousness is somewhat left of center, but his theological, ethical stance is right of center," said the Rev. William Leonard, a critic of the Southern Baptist Convention and dean of Wake Forest Divinity School in North Carolina. "That's the thing that makes him potentially a bridge person."LiNeBrEaKWarren's outlook has come at a price. Many from the Christian right don't trust him.LiNeBrEaKA registered independent who does not endorse candidates, he has called old guard evangelical activists too partisan and overly focused on gay marriage and abortion.LiNeBrEaKIn the run-up to the Saddleback forum he led last August with Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain, those giving Warren the most grief were conservatives. They were convinced he wouldn't be tough enough on Obama. (Obama wound up stumbling in his appeal to religious voters while answering Warren's question about when a baby gets human rights. Obama said it was "above his pay grade" to respond "with specificity.") LiNeBrEaK"For probably the last 25 years, evangelicalism became co-opted, and for most people it became a political term," Warren said. "And it got identified with a certain style of political leanings."LiNeBrEaKThe attacks on Warren stretch to how he presents the Gospel -- watered-down and soft, according to his theologically traditional critics.LiNeBrEaKWarren's phenomenal best-seller, "The Purpose Driven Life," which has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, partly reflects the self-help ethos of baby boomers, although he insists it isn't an advice book and he defends its religious content.LiNeBrEaKStill, the tone of his writing is deliberate. Warren, 54, is among a generation of pastor-CEOs who use marketing studies, polling and census data to create congregations that will attract people who never go to church. One of Warren's most important mentors was the late Peter Drucker, considered the father of modern management.LiNeBrEaKWarren started Saddleback with one other family in 1980 in California, a state with one of the lowest percentages of churchgoers in the country. Saddleback now draws more than 22,000 worshippers each week.LiNeBrEaKAs the church grew, so did the critiques. "The pioneers get the arrows," he says.LiNeBrEaKWarren survives the pounding partly because of his personal integrity. He donates 90 percent of his many millions in book royalties back to the church. He says he stopped taking a salary from Saddleback six years ago. No scandals have tainted his ministry.LiNeBrEaKHe is also one of the savviest leaders among his peers.LiNeBrEaKHis speaking invitations range from church groups to the Davos World Economic Forum and the United Nations. Saddleback's reach is now so broad, it's nearly its own denomination.LiNeBrEaKWarren provides sermons, study materials and guidance to hundreds of thousands of clergy worldwide through pastors.com and his other Web sites. Warren's "40 Days of Purpose" spiritual campaigns have been conducted in more than 20,000 churches, and he recently joined forces with Reader's Digest to launch a multimedia global juggernaut based on his "Purpose Driven" writing.LiNeBrEaKNow he is trying to revolutionize faith-based humanitarian work through his P.E.A.C.E. program. It unites local churches, businesses and governments to fight poverty and disease, promote peace, and combat what he calls spiritual emptiness. The pilot project for this effort began in 2005 in Rwanda, which has been dubbed the first "purpose-driven nation."LiNeBrEaKIt is no surprise that he and Obama have become friendly.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	Court reinstates clean air rule during EPA fix  	By Jesse J. Holland The Associated Press  	NEWS  	523 words  	WASHINGTON &raquo; In a ruling hailed by environmentalists, a federal appeals court on Tuesday reinstated one of President George W. Bush's clean air regulations while the Environmental Protection Agency makes court-mandated changes. LiNeBrEaKIn July, the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which required 28 mostly Eastern states to reduce smog-forming and soot-producing emissions that can travel long distances in the wind.LiNeBrEaKThe court said the EPA overstepped its authority by instituting the rule, citing "more than several fatal flaws" in the regulation. However, a three-judge panel decided to reinstate the rule while the EPA develops a new clean air program.LiNeBrEaKJudge Judith W. Rogers said allowing the country to go without the protection of CAIR while the EPA fixes it "would sacrifice clear benefits to public health and the environment."LiNeBrEaKThe judges did not give EPA a deadline to come up with new regulations, but warned the agency that this decision is not an "indefinite stay" of its July ruling.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency had predicted that the Clean Air Interstate Rule would prevent about 17,000 premature deaths a year by dramatically reducing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. In addition, the EPA said the rule would save up to $100 billion in health benefits, eliminate millions of lost work and school days and prevent tens of thousands of nonfatal heart attacks.LiNeBrEaKRep. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who heads a House global warming panel, applauded the decision, saying that "common sense ruled the day."LiNeBrEaK"Knocking down the Clean Air Interstate Rule completely would have left our lungs in a lurch," the congressman said. "Today's decision is significant because it gives the new Obama Administration some breathing room -- and gives the American people some clean air to breathe."LiNeBrEaK"Air pollution does not obey state boundaries and CAIR is essential to protect Americans living downwind of sources of dangerous emissions," he said.LiNeBrEaKSaid Vickie Patton, deputy general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund: "Today's court decision is a welcome gift for the millions of Americans that face serious health threats from power plant pollution. Power plants across the East will reduce millions of tons of smog and soot pollution today while America's new leadership fixes the mistakes made by the Bush administration."LiNeBrEaKJeff Holmstead, one of the authors of the CAIR rule when he served as EPA's air administrator, said the court had changed "nothing substantive from its earlier opinion."LiNeBrEaKHolmstead, who now heads Bracewell and Giuliani's Environmental Strategies Group, said that while the opinion "is more consistent with past precedent in its approach to rulemaking, there is still some uncertainty regarding exactly what the EPA will do in response. Until the Agency responds, regulated sources will have to comply with CAIR."LiNeBrEaK"The regulated industry looks forward to working closely with the new administration in formulating a response to today's decision. The resulting rule must balance important environmental, economic, and energy objectives," he said.

For next year, then, Mike Singletary has us worried. (Fortunately, the Raiders appear to be considering the return of Tom Cable, so we won't have to worry about them until global warming has made it impossible to ski anyway.) LiNeBrEaKThe page will return Tuesday, Jan. 6. Some brief notebook-emptying on end-of-year activities:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAmid all the bowl games last Jan. 1, the most compelling event was the NHL's Winter Classic. The outdoor game went from slightly zany marketing ploy to true stroke of genius that might be the best thing Gary Bettman has ever done. LiNeBrEaKLast year, Pittsburgh visited Buffalo. This year, it's Detroit visiting Chicago in Wrigley Field. The Red Wings are the defending champions, and the Blackhawks have risen from the ashes. The ticket market is hot hot hot. But will the game be c-c-c-cold?LiNeBrEaKLast year, the game-time temperature in Buffalo was 33 degrees, and when the snow fell, it was gentle and windless and magical for the occasion. Monday in Chicago, with temperatures near zero, the city closed its public ice-skating rinks.LiNeBrEaKIf there are space heaters in the penalty box, this could be the dirtiest game in NHL history.LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKThe NBA: five Christmas Day games. Too much. For about 20 years, that day meant something on the NBA schedule, and now it's too glutted to be special. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKOn the (very good) chance that Raiders-Tampa Bay is less than compelling, and on the (off) chance that the 49ers haven't grabbed your attention, the NFL tossed out its archaic TV rules for this week to give fans more of what they're looking for. The Bay Area will get early and late games on both CBS and Fox, despite the 49ers home game that would otherwise prevent CBS from airing afternoon competition. LiNeBrEaKAt 10 a.m., while the Raiders and Bucs are on KPIX, the Giants and Vikings will play on KTVU. But the Giants have nothing to play for, and with Rich Gannon calling the game pitting his old team against his old coach, it might be worth listening to the second half.LiNeBrEaKAt 1: 15 p.m., as KTVU shows Mike Singletary continuing to prove the Yorks need him more than he needs them, KPIX will show the Dolphins and Jets fighting for a playoff spot. One item sure to make an appearance on the telecast is the Jets' official 2008 calendar, in which December is Chad Pennington Month.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	PUT STIMULUS MONEY INTO TRANSIT  	BLAIR ANUNDSON GUEST COLUMNIST  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A19  	644 words  	President-elect Barack Obama recently proposed a massive federal infrastructure plan that he likened to the New Deal and President Dwight Eisenhower's historic initiative to create the interstate highway system. When roads and bridges are crumbling and public transportation systems are scrambling to keep up with booming demand, Obama and others are right to recognize the need for investment. But it is critically important how infrastructure money gets spent. It is not enough for Congress to simply spend money. In fact, poorly thought out transportation policy contributes to many of America's most pressing problems.LiNeBrEaKConsider: LiNeBrEaK-Each year Americans waste billions of dollars and millions of hours stuck in traffic - a problem that is often made worse by construction of new highways.LiNeBrEaK-As driving has increased over the decades, transportation has become the second biggest expense for the average household - even more than health care and just behind housing costs.LiNeBrEaK-Our transportation system is the chief source of our nation's addiction to oil, leaving America vulnerable to volatile prices and hostile foreign regimes.LiNeBrEaK-Cars and trucks are the biggest end-user source of global warming pollution, contributing to a third of the nation's emissions and nearly half of our state's.LiNeBrEaKClearly, not every infrastructure dollar is created equal. Rather than spend more money with a 20th-century transportation fix, the next administration and Congress should focus on a 21st-century solution. We need to focus only on projects that advance long-term national goals, by alleviating congestion, improving safety, increasing transportation choices, increasing our energy independence, curbing global warming pollution, and supporting affordable, healthy, sustainable communities.LiNeBrEaKTo reach these goals, at least as much money should go to expanding modern public transportation (light rail, commuter rail, rapid bus service, etc.) as to roads and highways. The economic rescue package should also include assistance for our region's transit agencies. Operating support would quickly put people to work and help our working families deal with the effects of the economic slowdown and volatile gas prices.LiNeBrEaKAdditional capital funds now could help agencies such as King County Metro Transit make investments that will reduce operating costs over the long term, such as the planned purchase of additional 60-foot hybrid coaches.LiNeBrEaKFinally, Congress should use the stimulus package to fund sustainable, transit-oriented communities. Smart Growth projects such as King County's Burien Transit-Oriented Development Project and the 98th Street White Center Connector project are good examples of local projects that could jump start Washington's economy and keep us all moving.LiNeBrEaKInvestments in ready-to-go transit and pedestrian projects, such as those listed above, will create a wealth of employment opportunities in the short and the long run. Studies show transit investments create almost 20 percent more jobs than new highways for the same amount of spending.LiNeBrEaKAlso, any new spending for roads and bridges must prioritize rehabilitating our current system. It is irresponsible to spend massive amounts on new interchanges and lane expansions when our existing roadways and bridges suffer from long-deferred repair and maintenance needs.LiNeBrEaKTo ensure accountability, state transportation departments should be required to report back on the effectiveness of their spending relative to job creation, fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and vehicle miles traveled.LiNeBrEaKThe incoming administration and the next Congress have a tremendous opportunity to turn the economy around. A bad deal could do more harm than good, but a good deal could help us meet many of America's most important challenges while setting us on the path to a better, more sustainable 21st-century transportation system.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	SEATTLE'S STORM: REASONABLE PACE\  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A18  	370 words  	Mostly, the weekend snowstorm felt like a winter break. Unplanned and unsought, to be sure, but relaxing, neighborly and holiday cheer.LiNeBrEaKThat was true mainly, of course, when people didn't have to worry about such problems as a failed furnace, finding shelter or being strand at the airport. But, with the chartered bus scare having stopped short of catastrophe, the first few days brought no reports of loss of life, something to be deeply grateful for. LiNeBrEaKBy and large, though, Seattle seemed to roll with the snow wallops. People stocked up, stayed home and skied around. Or, they brought their patience, parkas and tire chains to pack Qwest Field to give Mike Holmgren a snowy Green Bay, oops, Seattle send-off.LiNeBrEaKFor a city reputed to be filled with drivers clueless about the snow, people seemed to show more restraint about their speed and expectations than in some past storms. Lots of individuals and workplaces heeded reality and authorities' advice about not going anywhere unless absolutely necessary. Even Monday morning, the number of cross-country skiers and vehicles on some neighborhood side streets was pretty close to even.LiNeBrEaKAlas, a metropolis does not endlessly live by hot chocolate, roaring fires, homemade chicken Parmigiana, dog walks and snowman construction projects alone. Work places beckon, whether or not sidewalks have been cleared. The trash has to go out, hopefully to be collected before the Ice Age of '08 ends. There's that final holiday gift to buy or preparations for the visiting guests, assuming they can make it here.LiNeBrEaKGood cheer will give way to clear judgment about how well public services have been handled and, in particular, whether there is a lag in getting back to normal. In an area dedicated to fighting global warming (yes, it's still a real problem) by reducing auto usage, the public has to be able to have confidence that, wherever it's safe, mass transit will perform with reliability roughly comparable to that of cars at any time.LiNeBrEaKSeattle has chilled for a few days, and it will try to get back into gear at some reasonable pace as conditions improve. We should, though, try to maintain some of the patience that got the area through several days of storms with relative security.

Snow in New Orleans, snow in Las Vegas, crippling ice storms on the East Coast, bitter cold in the Midwest, snow and ice in Seattle? Hmm - must be global warming! Wayne TurnerLiNeBrEaKKentLiNeBrEaKVOTE OFFICIALS OUT IF THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH WEATHERLiNeBrEaKNearly every year, and especially this year, we have days when the roads are impassable because of snow and ice. Nearly every year, our elected officials, whose main responsibility is public safety, ignore it. This year, there have been hundreds of millions of dollars and a lot of public safety lost because Mayor Greg Nickels and King County Executive Ron Sims just don't care. People can't get to jobs, and lose wages. Schools close and people have to stay home from work to take care of kids who would be in school if they could get there.LiNeBrEaKPeople can't get to finish their Christmas shopping because they can't get there. Fire trucks and 911 vehicles can't get where they are needed. There are a tremendous number of vehicle accidents with, at best, vehicle damage, and at worst, injuries or fatalities. None of this seems to be their problem - it is our problem. We need to fix it. When they come up for re-election, vote for someone else! LiNeBrEaKThe greater Seattle area is too big and too important to the general health and well being of the Pacific Northwest to be allowed to grind to a screeching halt for several days each year, or in bad years, a week or so.LiNeBrEaKCities all over the country experience snow and ice in the winter and deal with it and life goes on. Here, everything stops because the elected officials seem to want it that way.LiNeBrEaKClydia PappenfusLiNeBrEaKShorelineLiNeBrEaKIN BAD WEATHER, METRO CAN'T GET THE JOB DONELiNeBrEaKTonight, Friday, Dec. 19, you, Metro, finally and irrevocably pushed me over the edge. I waited downtown on Third Avenue and Pike Street 45 minutes a gain for a #28 to Ballard. Not only were there NO buses except, interestingly enough, three #358 and three #312 in a row - lots of those, I wonder who is greasing that route - but it sort of got scary as 200-plus of us common folk were waiting and milling about in the frigid environment, getting angry and cold trying to get home or to get to work. If a bus did finally arrive at this point, I knew there would be "no room at the inn." I started walking.LiNeBrEaKBy then, I had left my office on Capitol Hill at 11th Avenue and Pike Street at 4: 45 pm. I walked toward home along the entire #28 route without ever seeing a #28.LiNeBrEaKWhen I got to South Lake Union, I was excited to see a #17 that refused to take me as a passenger.LiNeBrEaKA #30 - bless that driver - let me on at an intersection, which is a big Metro NO, and took me to Fremont. I walked from Fremont to Ballard without ever seeing any buses at all ever again.LiNeBrEaKI am a 61-year-old woman in good health with great snow boots. It took me more than 2 1/2 hours to get home on foot and by public transportation. I am fearful for those who are not as able as I and angry for those of us who pay you $594 a year for a bus pass that you treat us so rudely. From a longtime supporter of mass transit, shame on you, Metro, for not taking care of your people. We pay your bills.LiNeBrEaKDeirdre AfricaLiNeBrEaKSeattleLiNeBrEaK\ STATE BUDGETLiNeBrEaKRAISE TAXES ON DEEP POCKETSLiNeBrEaKSold down the river! Why is it that during economic downturns, students, children, the sick, the handicapped and the elderly always get the shaft? But there is a solution that extends beyond cutting expenses for those who are the most vulnerable. It's a solution much ballyhooed by our president-elect.\ Raise taxes for the deep pockets we have in the state - Microsoft, the Seahawks, the Mariners, Weyer- haeuser, Boeing, our insurance giants, QWest and telecommunications moguls, hospital CEOs, etc. How unfounded is the fear that our upper classes will pack up and leave with their businesses not far behind? They have it too good to leave.LiNeBrEaKAs a teacher I feel betrayed by Gov. Chris Gregoire who on Thursday unveiled a no-new-taxes budget plan that would fix a nearly $6 billion deficit by whacking spending, suspending voter initiatives, reneging on promises, and borrowing some money. It makes me suspicious that the governor is as beholden to campaign donors as much as Dino Rossi was beholden to construction and real estate interests.LiNeBrEaKI can only shudder to think that the governor's budget is perhaps a microcosm of policies to come at the federal level - to rally a conservative base to stay in power at any expense by sacrificing the health, education and welfare of those who stand most to benefit - us, the citizenry - and I am chagrined to think that maybe my choices were reduced to vote for the lesser of two unsavory ills.LiNeBrEaKJeffrey MorgenLiNeBrEaKIssaquahLiNeBrEaK\ PRESIDENT-ELECTLiNeBrEaKNOT SAYING MUCH: OBAMA IS BETTER OF TWO EVILSLiNeBrEaKHappy Solstice to all of my friends. I will not protest anything Obama again. I did not vote for him, I am not supporting him and I leave the honor to protest his style to those who swooned over him and elected him. Maybe next time (if there will be another election) people will think before they support the better of two evils.LiNeBrEaKSo please stop sending me petitions to let Obama know what we want. He knew what we wanted when he was a candidate: We wanted peace, not only in Iraq, but in Afghanistan and the Middle East; we wanted environmental protection, not selective clean coal, offshore drilling and nuclear plants; we wanted universal health care, not more money to the insurance people who have sucked Medicare money to enrich themselves; we wanted education for all, not charter schools; we wanted gay marriage, not an anti-gay minister to do the invocation; we wanted fair trade and just immigration reform. We were not heard before the election. What makes anyone think we will be heard after the coronation?LiNeBrEaKDorli T. RaineyLiNeBrEaKSeattleLiNeBrEaK\ BUSH ADMINISTRATIONLiNeBrEaKABU GHRAIB SHOWS U.S. HAD TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICELiNeBrEaKWhen the abuses of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq first broke to the public, the highest-ranking members of the Bush administration claimed that the abuses were the result "of a few bad apples." Several of those bad apples, most notably Lynndie England and Charles Grainer, were tried and convicted of abuses. Today they remain imprisoned for the offenses they committed. But - as many of us suspected from the beginning - Vice President Dick Cheney recently said in an interview that he was fully aware of the tactics, and worked to get them implemented. It's clear then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and President George W. Bush were part of the cabal that had them approved.LiNeBrEaKIs there any fairness if those at the bottom who implemented the abuses - the so-called "hit men" - serve jail time, while those who paved the way for the abuses walk away scot-free? Would there be any fairness if, in his remaining month in office, Bush issues pre-emptive pardons for those who ordered the abuse?LiNeBrEaKAre there two standards of justice now in this nation: one for the lowest echelon among us, and another for the highest? Would anyone in this nation who silently watched those bad apples in Iraq being sentenced to jail time fight for the exoneration of those bad apples in Washington, D.C., who made it all possible?LiNeBrEaKBruce BarnbaumLiNeBrEaKGranite FallsLiNeBrEaK\ WALL STREETLiNeBrEaKDON'T TRUST PAULSON TO OVERSEE BAILOUTSLiNeBrEaKWhy is all the blame for the economic meltdown being laid on sub-prime loans, while Wall Street CEO types get a free pass? These high-rolling managers who OK'd big wages, bonuses, stock options and golden parachutes for themselves and their board of directors certainly were part of the problem. These are the guys who created risky investment schemes, like derivatives and hedge funds, and then lobbied Congress not to regulate these schemes.LiNeBrEaKYou don't have to look very far to find out who these guys are. Look at Henry Paulson, former Goldman Sachs bigwig. With a net worth of around $700 million, he's one of them. Do you trust this guy to oversee the management of the bailout money? I don't. He's the fox guarding the hen house.LiNeBrEaKVern MeinzLiNeBrEaKOlympia	WEATHER (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); COASTAL AREAS (89%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); ELECTIONS (77%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (77%); COUNTIES (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (71%); WALKING and JOGGING (69%); CHRISTMAS (68%) WEATHER; SNOW; STORM ; TAX; STATE; BUDGET  			SEATTLE, WA, USA (94%); NEW ORLEANS, LA, USA (92%) WASHINGTON, USA (94%); LOUISIANA, USA (92%); MIDWEST USA (88%); WEST USA (79%); NORTHWEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   			Drawing  			LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  	LETTER  								
St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Clean coal: Reality or goal? OUR VIEW | ENERGY  		EDITORIAL; Pg. B6  	664 words  	Illinois sits atop the nation's second-largest coal reserves. Whether that fuel represents the nation's energy future or its past is the subject of an increasingly bitter debate playing out over the nation's airwaves.LiNeBrEaKIndustry groups have been working hard to sell the concept of "clean" coal, that is, coal that can be burned using new technologies that reduce or capture and store dangerous emissions. But earlier this month, a coalition of environmental groups concerned about global warming began airing a series of ads built around the slogan "In reality, there is no such thing as clean coal." LiNeBrEaKThose ads prompted the coal industry to fire back with ads of its own: "The reality: It's here, and it's made coal over 70 percent cleaner."LiNeBrEaKAt its core, this is a burning debate over how best to meet future energy needs in an era of global warming and a system of carbon emission caps, which almost certainly will be enacted in the near future.LiNeBrEaKCoal is the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States. About half the nation's electricity is generated in coal-fired plants. At current usage rates, the country has sufficient coal reserves to last for centuries.LiNeBrEaKBut coal also is the dirtiest fossil fuel. Newer technologies have reduced the amount chemicals that cause acid rain and smog, which are produced when coal burns. That's what coal companies such as St. Louis-based Peabody Energy and coal-burning electric utilities mean when they talk about cleaner coal.LiNeBrEaKBut chemicals aren't the only problem with the emissions. Each year, coal-fired power plants in the United States also emit 1. 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes global warming. That's what environmentalists mean when they say there is no such thing as clean coal.LiNeBrEaKOn average, U.S. coal-fired power plants are 35 years old. Decisions about whether to upgrade or replace them are being made now.LiNeBrEaKLast week, President-elect Barack Obama named his choices for the key energy and environment posts in his administration. During the campaign, he promised to support a bill to create a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. That would mean setting a price on carbon emissions, which would give utilities an incentive to reduce pollution.LiNeBrEaKBut capturing all or even most of that 1. 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be an enormous undertaking. Just a handful of small power plants around the globe are capable of capturing carbon dioxide, and only one or two actually do it.LiNeBrEaKAmong many problems is that 1. 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide takes up an immense amount of space. In a 2007 report, experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that:LiNeBrEaK- All the carbon dioxide emitted by the nation's coal-fired power plants, if captured for storage, would take up as much space as all the natural gas currently transported over the nation's pipeline system.LiNeBrEaK- If just 60 percent of the carbon dioxide were compressed into liquid form, it would take up the equivalent of 20 million barrels of oil to hold it.LiNeBrEaK- Moving captured carbon dioxide from where it is produced to where it would have to be stored would require an investment of billions of dollars. Of course, before that could be done, we would need to have answers to basic questions about where and how to store it.LiNeBrEaKIn Germany in September, a small plant began trapping carbon dioxide from a coal-fired boiler. Eventually, the CO2 will be pumped into a nearly depleted oil field. If all goes well - always a big "if" with new technology - experts say the process could become cost-effective in a little more a decade. But that assumes that between now and then, scores of similar plants are built to test and perfect the technology.LiNeBrEaKIt's true that coal-fired plants are cleaner than they used to be, and it is possible - in theory - that they actually will be clean at some point. It is in the nation's interest to pursue that goal. But clean coal is not a reality now, and determining whether it ever can be truly clean will take years.

LiNeBrEaKMost of the nitrogen that supports the rapid, lush growth of rain forests comes from tiny bacteria that can turn nitrogen in the air into fertilizer in the soil.LiNeBrEaKUntil now, scientists had thought that phosphorus was the key element supporting the prodigious expansion of rain forests, according to Lars Hedin, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton, who led the research. But an experiment testing the effects of various elements on test plots in lowland rain forests on the Gigante Peninsula in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument in Panama showed that areas treated with molybdenum withdrew more nitrogen from the atmosphere than other elements.LiNeBrEaK"We were surprised," said Hedin, who is also a professor in the Princeton Environmental Institute. "It's not what we were expecting."LiNeBrEaKThe report, detailed in the Dec. 7 online edition of Nature Geoscience, will be the journal's cover story in its print edition.LiNeBrEaKMolybdenum, the team found, is essential for controlling the biological conversion of nitrogen in the atmosphere into natural soil nitrogen fertilizer, which in turn spurs plant growth.LiNeBrEaK"Just like trace amounts of vitamins are essential for human health, this exceedingly rare trace metal is indispensable for the vital function of tropical rain forests in the larger Earth system," Hedin said.LiNeBrEaKMolybdenum is 10,000 times less abundant than phosphorus and other major nutrients in these ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKThe discovery has implications for global climate change policy, the scientists said. Previously, researchers knew little about rain forests' capacity to absorb the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. If molybdenum is central to the biochemical processes involved in the uptake of carbon dioxide, there may be limits to how much carbon tropical rain forests can absorb.LiNeBrEaKThe biological enzyme nitrogenase, which converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil fertilizer, feeds on molybdenum, the researchers found.LiNeBrEaK"Nitrogenase without molybdenum is like a car engine without spark plugs," said Alexander Barron, the lead author on the paper, who was a graduate student in Hedin's laboratory and earned his Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton in 2007. He is working on climate legislation in Congress.LiNeBrEaKOther authors on the paper from Princeton include: Anne Kraepiel, an associate research scholar in the Department of Chemistry; Nina Wurzburger, a research associate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; and Jean Philippe Bellenger, an associate research scholar in the Princeton Environmental Institute. S. Joseph Wright, who earned his bachelor's degree in biology from Princeton in 1974 and now is a staff scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Institute in Panama, is also a contributing author.LiNeBrEaKMolybdenum, a lustrous, silvery metal, is found in soil, rock and sea water and in a range of enzymes vital to human health. Traces of the element have been found in Japanese swords dating back to the 14th century. In modern times, its high strength, good electrical conductivity and anticorrosive properties have made molybdenum desirable as an element of rocket engines, radiation shields, light bulb filaments and circuit boards.LiNeBrEaKThe research was conducted with support from the National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Smithsonian Scholarly Studies program, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute student fellowship program and the Environmental Protection Agency student fellowship program.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Layered images reveal ancient cycles of climate change on Mars  		TODAY; Pg. 040  	438 words  	Researchers at California Institute of Technology and their colleagues have found evidence of ancient climate change on Mars caused by regular variation in the planet's tilt, or obliquity. On Earth, similar "astronomical forcing" of climate drives ice-age cycles. LiNeBrEaKUsing stereo topographic maps obtained by processing data from the high-resolution camera onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Caltech scientists, led by graduate student Kevin Lewis and Oded Aharonson, associate professor of planetary science, along with John Grotzinger, the Fletcher Jones professor of geology, identified and measured layered rock outcrops within four craters in the planet's Arabia Terra region. The layering in different outcrops occurs at scales ranging from a few meters to tens of meters, but at each location the layers all have similar thicknesses and exhibit similar features.LiNeBrEaKBased on a pattern of layers within layers measured at one location, known as Becquerel crater, the scientists propose that each layer was formed over a period of about 100,000 years and that these layers were produced by the same cyclical climate changes.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, every 10 layers were bundled together into larger units, which were laid down over an approximately one-million-year period; in the Becquerel crater, the 10-layer pattern is repeated at least 10 times. This one-million-year cycle corresponds to a known pattern of change in Mars' obliquity caused by the dynamics of the solar system.LiNeBrEaK"Due to the scale of the layers, small variations in Mars' orbit are the best candidate for the implied climate changes. These are the very same changes that have been shown to set the pacing of ice ages on the Earth and can also lead to cyclic layering of sediments," says Lewis, the first author of a paper about the work published in Science.LiNeBrEaKThe tilt of Earth on its axis varies between 22. 1 degrees and 24. 5 degrees over a 41,000-year period. The tilt itself is responsible for seasonal variation in climate because the portion of the Earth that is tipped toward the sun- and that receives more sunlight hours during a day - gradually changes throughout the year. During phases of lower obliquity, polar regions are less subject to seasonal variations, leading to periods of glaciation.LiNeBrEaKMars' tilt varies by tens of degrees over a 100,000-year cycle, producing even more dramatic variation. When the obliquity is low, the poles are the coldest places on the planet, while the sun is near the equator all the time. This could cause volatiles in the atmosphere, like water and carbon dioxide, to migrate poleward, where they'd be locked up as ice.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 23, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Coal: Cleaner -- but not clean enough  	St. Louis Post-Dispatch  	COMMENTARY  	737 words  	Dec. 23--Illinois sits atop the nation's second-largest coal reserves. Whether that fuel represents the nation's energy future or its past is the subject of an increasingly bitter debate playing out over the nation's airwaves.LiNeBrEaKIndustry groups have been working hard to sell the concept of "clean" coal, that is, coal that can be burned using new technologies that reduce or capture and store dangerous emissions. But earlier this month, a coalition of environmental groups concerned about global warming began airing a series of ads built around the slogan "In reality, there is no such thing as clean coal." LiNeBrEaKThose ads prompted the coal industry to fire back with ads of its own: "The reality: It's here, and it's made coal over 70 percent cleaner."LiNeBrEaKAt its core, this is a burning debate over how best to meet future energy needs in an era of global warming and a system of carbon emission caps, which almost certainly will be enacted in the near future.LiNeBrEaKCoal is the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States. About half the nation's electricity is generated in coal-fired plants. At current usage rates, the country has sufficient coal reserves to last for centuries.LiNeBrEaKBut coal also is the dirtiest fossil fuel. Newer technologies have reduced the amount chemicals that cause acid rain and smog, which are produced when coal burns. That's what coal companies such as St. Louis-based Peabody Energy and coal-burning electric utilities mean when they talk about cleaner coal.LiNeBrEaKBut chemicals aren't the only problem with the emissions. Each year, coal-fired power plants in the United States also emit 1. 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that causes global warming. That's what environmentalists mean when they say there is no such thing as clean coal.LiNeBrEaKOn average, U.S. coal-fired power plants are 35 years old. Decisions about whether to upgrade or replace them are being made now.LiNeBrEaKLast week, President-elect Barack Obama named his choices for the key energy and environment posts in his administration. During the campaign, he promised to support a bill to create a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. That would mean setting a price on carbon emissions, which would give utilities an incentive to reduce pollution.LiNeBrEaKBut capturing all or even most of that 1. 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide would be an enormous undertaking. Just a handful of small power plants around the globe are capable of capturing carbon dioxide, and only one or two actually do it.LiNeBrEaKAmong many problems is that 1. 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide takes up an immense amount of space. In a 2007 report, experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that:LiNeBrEaK-- All the carbon dioxide emitted by the nation's coal-fired power plants, if captured for storage, would take up as much space as all the natural gas currently transported over the nation's pipeline system.LiNeBrEaK-- If just 60 percent of the carbon dioxide were compressed into liquid form, it would take up the equivalent of 20 million barrels of oil to hold it.LiNeBrEaK-- Moving captured carbon dioxide from where it is produced to where it would have to be stored would require an investment of billions of dollars. Of course, before that could be done, we would need to have answers to basic questions about where and how to store it.LiNeBrEaKIn Germany in September, a small plant began trapping carbon dioxide from a coal-fired boiler. Eventually, the CO2 will be pumped into a nearly depleted oil field. If all goes well -- always a big "if" with new technology -- experts say the process could become cost-effective in a little more a decade. But that assumes that between now and then, scores of similar plants are built to test and perfect the technology.LiNeBrEaKIt's true that coal-fired plants are cleaner than they used to be, and it is possible -- in theory -- that they actually will be clean at some point. It is in the nation's interest to pursue that goal. But clean coal is not a reality now, and determining whether it ever can be truly clean will take years.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 		December 23, 2008 Tuesday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	your views  		LOCAL; Pg. B8  	1046 words  	In defense of geeksLiNeBrEaKRE "GEEKS ON CALL faces lawsuits from 10 of its franchisees," Business, front page, Dec. 20: As a retired information technology (IT) professional, I resent that a company in the business to assist consumers with technology challenges using computers, HDTVs and other "modern" equipment would name itself "Geeks on Call."LiNeBrEaKAs a child, I remember the geeks in the circus sideshows, performers often billed as wild men whose acts usually included biting the head off a live chicken, bat, snake or bugs. LiNeBrEaKModern geeks are intelligent, highly trained and invaluable resources for dealing with today's technological consumer electronic challenges.LiNeBrEaKImagine if other respected professions adopted this self deprecation:LiNeBrEaKSawbones for MDs. Pill rollers for pharmacists. Ambulance chasers for attorneys. Diggers for undertakers. Book cookers for accountants. Hacks for journalists.LiNeBrEaKAnd the list goes on and on.LiNeBrEaKEnough already! The IT profession is NOT the Rodney Dangerfield of reputable professions.LiNeBrEaKSkip JordanLiNeBrEaKPortsmouthLiNeBrEaKDon't fault law for obesityLiNeBrEaKRe "Unappetizing learning," letter, Dec. 19: The writer blames No Child Left Behind for an increase in childhood obesity.LiNeBrEaKWhy stop there? Let's also blame NCLB for global warming, the collapse of the stock market and the terrorist bombing in India.LiNeBrEaKChildren are more obese than their parents were at their age, but it is not a trend related to NCLB but rather an inter-generational increase observed when comparing data collected about children today with data collected when their parents were children.LiNeBrEaKSo why are our children fatter than we were? Where are today's children after school, on weekends or during the summer break, when they are not the school's responsibility? For far too many of them, they are inside watching television, playing on the Internet or playing video games, all provided for them by their parents, not the schools, and certainly not NCLB. These activities are sedentary, are often accompanied by snacking, and besides health concerns, they do little to teach the little darlings social skills they'll need in life.LiNeBrEaKCriticize NCLB for any number of valid points, but to do so citing childhood obesity is a specious argument.LiNeBrEaKDavid BrechtelLiNeBrEaKVirginia BeachLiNeBrEaKRebuttal: gay marriageLiNeBrEaKRe "Monogamy at risk," letter, Dec. 18:LiNeBrEaKAllow me to remind everyone of the similarities between the arguments against gay marriage and miscegenation (interracial marriage). Pundits of "morality" argued that interracial marriage would create an environment where bestiality and plural marriages would flourish.LiNeBrEaKIn our own Virginia Supreme Court in the landmark Loving vs. Virginia case, Judge Leon Brazile cited the opinion of German physiologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. He said, "Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement, there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix."LiNeBrEaKA more enlightened jurist, California Supreme Court Justice Roger Traynor, in 1948 said, "The right to marry is the right of individuals, not of racial groups."LiNeBrEaKI hope that I will live long enough to see the end of our discrimination of others based on outdated prejudices and misguided judgments.LiNeBrEaKDon HurwitzLiNeBrEaKChesapeakeLiNeBrEaKSocial Security excessLiNeBrEaKRe "One bonus we don't need," op-ed, Dec. 15:LiNeBrEaKThe writer begs President-elect Obama to increase his Social Security taxes by eliminating the cap on taxable wages, claiming that the cap "depriv{es} the Social Security System of much-needed revenue that would help to ensure its long-term solvency." This is complete nonsense .LiNeBrEaKOur Social Security taxes produce a surplus. We pay more than needed to pay benefits to the starving widows and children painted in Michael Messner's piece. Excess taxpayer dollars go into the federal government's general budget, where they are spent on worthy projects like bailouts for Wall Street tycoons and the United Auto Workers union. The money is then replaced by IOUs from Congress.LiNeBrEaKRaising taxes won't improve Social Security's solvency. If he really wants that extra 6. 2 percent to do good things, he should donate it to charity. There are lots of good ones here in Hampton Roads that could use it.LiNeBrEaKKevin P. BilmsLiNeBrEaKChesapeakeLiNeBrEaKTicket the loafersLiNeBrEaKIt's a daily occurrence on my commute to encounter one of two things: a driver clueless on the art of merging, or one on his cell phone in the left lane, cruising 5 mph below the speed limit and holding up several cars in an area already congested.LiNeBrEaKLately, several states have begun handing out citations to these left-lane loafers . Virginia should be no exception. Virginia state law requires vehicles in the left lane to yield to faster traffic. This rules applies even when the faster traffic is speeding. Ticketing these road hazards will help reduce congestion, motor vehicle accidents and road rage incidents. And the increased revenue will assist with road and bridge projects.LiNeBrEaKAllen MesickLiNeBrEaKChesapeakeLiNeBrEaKGenerous to a faultLiNeBrEaKRe "Chrysler shutting all U.S. plants for at least 1 month," front page, Dec. 18:LiNeBrEaKI find it quite comforting that Chrysler (and Ford) will be extending the normal two-week holiday vacation plant closings in an effort to cut costs in response to slumping sales. One could assume that this is an attempt to convince Congress that they are serious about becoming competitive in the marketplace.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the third-to-last paragraph of the article noted that workers would receive vacation pay for the normal holiday shutdown and would also receive "unemployment benefits and supplemental pay from the company that total about 85 percent of their normal pay" during the extended vacation. This "normal holiday vacation" is in addition to workers' regular vacation time.LiNeBrEaKI challenge anyone to show me an industry that is profitable with as ridiculously generous a benefits package as this. Politicians need to abandon their long-held allegiances to the unions and allow the auto manufacturers to go the way of other businesses that couldn't compete and maintain profitability. Only when the automakers are forced to declare bankruptcy and reorganize can these outdated union contracts be renegotiated.LiNeBrEaKJoe TrofeLiNeBrEaKPortsmouth	US NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT (90%); COMPUTING and INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (90%); MARRIAGE (89%); OBESITY (89%); CHILDREN'S HEALTH (89%); CHILDREN (89%); FOOD LIABILITY LITIGATION (89%); INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (89%); RACE and RACISM (84%); WRITERS and WRITING (78%); TELEVISION EQUIPMENT (77%); CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (77%); JUDGES (73%); JOURNALISM (73%); EDUCATION LAW (72%); HIGH DEFINITION TELEVISION (72%); SCHOOL PERFORMANCE (71%); SUPREME COURTS (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (66%); SAME SEX MARRIAGE and UNIONS (64%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (60%); TERRORISM (51%); BOMBS and EXPLOSIVES (51%)  			VIRGINIA BEACH, VA, USA (52%) VIRGINIA, USA (87%) UNITED STATES (87%); INDIA (74%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Landmark Communications, Inc.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 		December 22, 2008 Monday   Online Edition	Thinking Right;  Bad shopping, good shopping? 	JIM WOOTEN; Staff  		467 words  	Monday, December 22, 2008, 08: 18 AMLiNeBrEaKAn Atlanta businessman who says he has a perfect payment history with American Express and a high credit score is angry that his credit card spending limit was reduce --- and that one of the factors used to make the decision is where he shops. LiNeBrEaK"Other customers who have used their card at establishments where you recently shopped have a poor repayment history with American Express," the company said in a letter to Atlantan Kevin Johnson. Among other factors considered are debt levels, repayment and credit histories, the letter said. Johnson said none of the latter factors applied to him.LiNeBrEaKConsideration of where cards are used strikes Johnson as "consumer profiling of the worst kind." A company representative told AJC reporter Carrie Teegardin that it does not discriminate and complies with all fair lending laws.LiNeBrEaKMy view is that credit card companies or any other lender should put together any profile it chooses that doesn't discriminate on the basis of legally prohibited categories --- race, for example. There's no evidence that American Express is discriminating unlawfully.LiNeBrEaKBeyond Johnson's personal situation, which I don't know and therefore have no opinion on, his story does touch on larger, more important issue.LiNeBrEaKThe subprime mortgage debacle that has visited this recession on America, got its start in an effort by politicians and advocacy groups to push mortgage lenders to waive credit-worthiness as the primary consideration in making loans. The financial sector, to its ever-lasting shame, was much too eager to comply, due in part to greed and to a system that held nobody accountable for extending bad loans. That chain of irresponsibility has, as we all know, brought down some of the icons of Wall Street.LiNeBrEaKThe credit card industry has its own money-printing machine. When it extends credit to those who may be swamped by too much debt, it invites a second wave of financial disaster that could turn the recession into Depression. It therefore should employ every legal screen to determine whether it's printed more credit-money than a consumer can repay. If it determines, for example, that people who drive red cars and shop at Joe's Fruit Stand begin to make late payments when debt reaches $600, it should limit credit to $500.LiNeBrEaKThese are, after all, debts borne by those who are managing credit responsibly. If we believe that computer models can predict global warming, then surely we can believe that computer models can predict consumer financial trouble even before individual borrowers recognize it.LiNeBrEaKThe better companies manage the credit they extend, the less likely that fees and interest rates will be raised for others.LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/shared-blogs/ajc/thinkingright/entries/2008/12/22/bad_shopping_good_shopping.html	PAYMENT CARDS and SERVICES (90%); CREDIT CARDS (90%); RECESSION (86%); ECONOMIC NEWS (86%); CONSUMER LENDING (78%); CREDIT REGULATION (78%); SUBPRIME LENDING (78%); PERSONAL FINANCE (77%); MARKET SEGMENTATION (76%); FAIR LENDING (73%); MORTGAGE BANKING (73%); BANKING and FINANCE (72%); MORTGAGE BANKING and FINANCE (70%); MORTGAGE LOANS (70%); INTEREST RATES (65%); ECONOMIC DEPRESSION (65%); SUBPRIME MORTGAGES (65%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%) Blogs  	NAICS522210 CREDIT CARD ISSUING (92%); SIC6141 PERSONAL CREDIT INSTITUTIONS (92%)  		ATLANTA, GA, USA (93%) GEORGIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 8, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspapers  		2008 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   	AXP (NYSE) (92%)  	AMERICAN EXPRESS CO (92%)  													
The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: California's global warming gambit: The Golden State risks ruining its economy to save the planet  	The Augusta Chronicle, Ga.  	COMMENTARY  	576 words  	Dec. 22--California has adopted the most comprehensive plan in the nation to battle global warming -- a plan that President-elect Barack Obama says he may implement nationwide.LiNeBrEaKWe're all for environmentally improving the planet and cleaning up our air and water. Essentially we agree with Sen. John McCain's view that there's nothing to lose by fighting global warming. If global warming fears are true, then it's a matter of trying to save the planet. If they're not true, we'll at least get a cleaner, more healthy planet from the effort.LiNeBrEaKIt's a win-win situation. But only so long as it's within reason. LiNeBrEaKA climate change plan is not reasonable if it smothers the economy and diminishes our freedoms -- and that's what the California plan seemingly does. It commits the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and relies on 31 new rules to achieve that goal -- rules that will impact all facets of California life, from the fuels Californians put in their gas tanks to the air conditioners they install in their homes.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger applauds the program, claiming it will "help unleash the full force of California's innovation and technology for a healthier planet, a stronger and more robust economy and a safer and more secure energy future."LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama, in naming his top energy and environmental teams, said California is providing a good model for the federal government to follow. We're not so sure.LiNeBrEaKThe Golden State's business leaders, manufacturers and chambers of commerce say the Schwarzenegger plan will cost billions for utilities, refineries and large factories to transform their operations to cut greenhouse gases. It will also add more billions in higher electricity costs as utility companies are forced to move to renewable energies.LiNeBrEaKWith the state already sinking under the worst budget crisis in its history as a result of businesses and industries fleeing to states with fewer taxes and regulations, it strains credulity to believe the governor's claim that more taxes and regulations will restore the economy.LiNeBrEaKThe same would be true if Obama also goes down this ill-conceived environmental path, which stands to strangle much of the economy as well as business and individual freedoms.LiNeBrEaKIt's remarkable, too, that neither Obama nor Schwarzenegger mention nuclear power as a clean energy source -- even though, unlike the renewable sources that may take decades to develop, nuclear power has proven itself to be practical and relatively inexpensive.LiNeBrEaKSen. McCain's "all of the above" plan would employ everything in the energy arsenal -- offshore drilling, nuclear power, clean coal power, as well as developing new energy sources such as wind, solar and biofuels. The latter three sources may someday prove practical, but that day is decades in the future. In the meantime, our economy and our freedoms will have to get along on energy sources that we know will work. We can't just throw them overboard. They have to serve as a bridge until we get to where we want to go.

Belleville News-Democrat (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	Cartoonist blends humor of Christmas, politics  	Teri Maddox, Belleville News-Democrat, Ill.  	LIFESTYLE  	731 words  	Dec. 22--Collinsville artist Jim Cook is capitalizing on the charged U.S. political climate for his Twelve Cartoons of Christmas this year.LiNeBrEaKIn one cartoon, Santa holds his head in despair over a front-page story in the North Pole Gazette. The headline reads, "Government bails out Christmas; President appoints Grinch toy czar."LiNeBrEaKAnother cartoon shows a sign outside the U.S. Capitol with a slash through three men on camels. LiNeBrEaK"There don't seem to be a lot of wise men in Washington right now," said Cook, who posts the annual series on his Web site, TOON Refuge (www.toonrefugee.com).LiNeBrEaKTwo governors made appearances this year. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich is peering from behind bars in a jail cell wrapped like a Christmas present. It's from the FBI to federal prison.LiNeBrEaKCook also takes on Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- specifically, her support for a program to control wolf populations with aerial hunting.LiNeBrEaKThe cartoon shows Santa grieving over Rudolph's carcass in the snow. The red-nosed reindeer apparently has been shot.LiNeBrEaK"Curse you, Sarah Palin!" Santa yells at an airplane flying overhead, prompting the governor to reply, "You betcha!"LiNeBrEaKCook, 54, operates Studio JMC out of his home. He specializes in Web-page design and development but also enjoys painting, drawing, printmaking and illustration.LiNeBrEaKCook launched Toon Refuge three years ago as a way to showcase his cartoons. Those with Christmas themes evolved into the "Twelve Days" series.LiNeBrEaKSo far, the most popular cartoon -- judging by number of hits -- is one from last year related to global warming. Santa clings to a red-and-white pole while floating on a broken chunk of the polar ice cap.LiNeBrEaK"It gets a hundred or so views a day, even during the summer," Cook said. "But it really starts to spike in November. It's currently being viewed over a thousand times a day."LiNeBrEaKAnother favorite shows the three wise men on their way to Bethlehem. They're gathered around a map, camels parked nearby.LiNeBrEaK"Gold, frankincense and myrrh, and you couldn't spring for a GPS?" one of the robed men asks.LiNeBrEaKCook grew up in Wood River and earned an architecture degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It took him only a couple years in the real world to decide art was his true calling, so he enrolled in classes at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.LiNeBrEaKCook's life took an unusual turn in the early '80s, when he answered an ad on an SIUE bulletin board. Hot-air balloon pilot Bob Esch was seeking a drafter.LiNeBrEaK"He was trying to set a record for most distanced traveled in a hot-air balloon," Cook said. "And he was designing a gondola that could hold all the propane tanks."LiNeBrEaKCook eventually became a pilot for Esch's company, flying balloons for corporate clients.LiNeBrEaKHe later designed T-shirts for a screenprinter, produced catalogs for a uniform company and worked as a freelance graphic artist before serving as a newsroom illustrator for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch from 1986 to 1994.LiNeBrEaKCook wrote an Internet column his last two years at the Post, then struck out on his own.LiNeBrEaK"At the time, there weren't many people who were doing Web design in St. Louis," he said. "So even though I didn't know much, I knew more than most."LiNeBrEaKSince that time, Cook's clients have ranged from the St. Louis Sports Commission to the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis. The church hired him to develop a Web site for the Pope's 1999 visit.LiNeBrEaKCook begins each cartoon with a fairly detailed pencil sketch. He scans it and uses it as a template for drawing lines and areas of flat color in Adobe Illustrator.LiNeBrEaK"The image is then exported to Adobe Photoshop, where I add the shadowing, highlights and other details," he said.LiNeBrEaKCook lives in Collinsville with his wife, Christee.

But Massachusetts Maritime Academy in Bourne just may have the most visible efforts. LiNeBrEaKThe nation's oldest continuously operating maritime college, at the mouth of the Cape Cod Canal, built one of the region's first wind turbines in 2006 that now produces about 20 percent of the campus' electrical needs. Last year, the state-owned college completed a LEED gold certified dorm complex - the first state owned dorm to get such a designation.LiNeBrEaKThat dorm has 81 kilowatts of solar panels on its roof. Nearby, the college just turned on the largest installation of solar-powered outdoor lighting - 59 fixtures - in New England to illuminate the northwest campus areas around the dorms.LiNeBrEaKNow, the academy has turned on microturbines that will provide electricity - with its waste heat going to warm water for dorm showers. Granted, they are gas powered and not as green as wind, but they can produce energy continuously (unlike wind) and release fewer greenhouse gases than coal.LiNeBrEaKMore is planned: A wind turbine on top of a dorm, and a partnership with a new company that makes wind turbines that oscillate up and down.

Buffalo News (New York) 		December 22, 2008 Monday   CENTRAL EDITION	Obama gets it;  Energy, environment appointments show the president-elect sees the links 		EDITORIAL PAGE; Pg. A10  	535 words  	It appears that, in the incoming Obama administration, it will be hard to tell the difference between the people making energy policy and the people making environmental policy. Which means that we will be fortunate to be governed by people who know that the two are one and the same. LiNeBrEaKThe fatal flaw of American leadership, such as it was, over the past 30 years has been the idea that the goal of building up an adequate and secure energy supply is at cross-purposes with the goal of preserving a clean and sustainable environment.LiNeBrEaKNothing could be further from the truth. And that is a truth realized by the appointment by President-elect Barack Obama of four leaders of his energy/environment team. The choices show an understanding that if we crack one nut, we'll have cracked them both.LiNeBrEaKIt is a team that continues a somewhat controversial streak of bringing back high-ranking officials of the Clinton administration, but it goes on to do the Clintonistas one better. While one Clinton administration official -- Vice President Al Gore -- was awarded a Nobel Prize seven years after leaving office, Obama's team will begin its administration with a Nobel Laureate in the Cabinet.LiNeBrEaKThat would be Energy Secretary-designate Steven Chu, Ph.D., administrator of the Energy Department's top-drawer Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of California, where he is also a professor of physics and biology. He shared the Nobel in 1997 for figuring out how to cool and trap atoms with laser light. In recent years, though, he has turned his attention to finding new sources of energy to curb global climate change.LiNeBrEaKOn resume paper, at least, Chu recalls the statement by President John F. Kennedy, who greeted a gathering of Nobel Prize winners by saying it was the most brain power ever assembled at the White House, except for the days that Thomas Jefferson dined alone. That doesn't mean Chu, a Washington outsider with no political background, will be a success in running the bureaucracy of a Cabinet department. But he won't be dining alone.LiNeBrEaKObama is also bringing back Carol Browner, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency for the whole of the Clinton administration, as White House energy boss. And Browner will bring along two of her former EPA staffers, Lisa Jackson, to run that agency, and Nancy Sutley, to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKGiving someone with a long environmental background the White House energy portfolio shows that, even if Obama doesn't have the answer, he grasps the question. Huge portions of our environmental woes, from old-fashioned water pollution to new-age climate change, stem from our dependence on what are essentially 19th century energy models -- drilling, mining, burning and breathing hydrocarbons. And every proposed remedy to that problem has been strenuously, and often honestly, opposed by fears that cutting back on those habits can only lead to economic ruin.LiNeBrEaKObama, on the other hand, has shown that he understands the need to grow the economy, not kneecap it, by embracing whole new models of energy production. Now it will be up to deep thinkers like Chu, and policy experts like Browner, to make that understanding a reality.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 22, 2008 Monday 	CFLs are mercury hazards  	Letter to the Editor  	LETTERS; Opinion  	202 words  	Your editorial of Dec. 16 calling for clean-up of the old mercury mine conjures an image of contrast in the government-bureaucratic mindset, in this case the Congress versus the EPA. LiNeBrEaKWhile the EPA on the one hand is rightly concerned about the safety of the levees holding the mercury-contaminated soup, on the other hand we have Congress mandating the replacement of tungsten lightbulbs by mercury-charged "curly cue" bulbs.LiNeBrEaKThese bulbs will have to be specially handled for safe disposal. Their widespread substitution for tungsten bulbs will spread the risk of mercury contamination throughout the household environment and will be a danger to children and adults alike; any breaks will require a hazmat team to clean up the debris.LiNeBrEaKThis Congress-sponsored environmental risk is to be offered to the global warming gods by Americans as a purifying sacrifice to pay for their sinful carbon footprints.LiNeBrEaKThanks to Congress we will all feel more "carbon-purified" as we shall be punished not only with the increased health hazard but also the poorer light quality and the extra costs of disposal and hazmat cleanup. Thanks Congress, for helping us do this deserved penance for our carbon sins.LiNeBrEaKRon KilmartinLiNeBrEaKPleasant Hill	LETTERS and COMMENTS (95%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); MISC METAL MINING (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); CHILDREN (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (67%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (58%)  			SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (84%) CALIFORNIA, USA (84%) UNITED STATES (84%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  															
Daily Press - Victorville (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	Feds rework BLM conservation standards: Critics claim new policies work against Mojave preservation  	Charles Nguyen, Daily Press, Victorville, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	458 words  	Dec. 22--T h e B u re a u o f L a n d Management announced new land management guidelines that officials hope will strengthen conservation efforts, but critics have decried the developments as a continuance of misguided environmental policy. LiNeBrEaKThe revised guidelines manual, last updated in 2001, attempts to standardize identification of rare species and covers conservation policy of more than 300 species listed on 258 million acres of federally owned land that the BLM manages.LiNeBrEaKMore than 20 animal species on area BLM-managed lands, including those in the Mojave National Preserve, are now protected under the revised "Manual for Management of Special Status Species," according to BLM spokeswoman Jill Moran.LiNeBrEaKIn ad d i t i o n , t h e B L M California office identified more than 90 special-status plants in the Mojave National Preserve that are covered in the revised manual.LiNeBrEaKThe manual also establishes a new policy that gives BLM's state directors the power to designate a species as "bureau-sensitive," affording the species "special management consideration to promote their conservation and reduce likelihood and need for future listing under the (Endangered Species Act)," Moran said.LiNeBrEaKLisa Belenky, senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, argued that the designation process is too wideranging and will ultimately hinder conservation efforts.LiNeBrEaK"The new manual will allow the BLM to ignore conservation of statelisted species unless the BLM state director for each state designates those species as 'sensitive,'" she said.LiNeBrEaKMoran said that standardizing BLM guidelines across state lines was needed to "provide greater consistency across the agency and ensure more effective cooperation among BLM states."LiNeBrEaKBut federal methods of conservation are still too narrow, Belenky said, and undermine the whole-scale "ecosystem approach" needed for effective preservation of endangered species and habitats.LiNeBrEaK"BLM is stuck in the past," Belenky stated in a CBD press release. "The new manual does not even mention global climate change, which is an overarching threat to wildlife and plants that depend on our public lands for survival."LiNeBrEaKThe new criteria cover only species located on BLM-managed lands and habitats, which Belenky said was another signal that the federal conservation effort is ineffective on a wide scale	ENDANGERED SPECIES (90%); NATIONAL PARKS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (90%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (89%); WILDLIFE (87%); BIODIVERSITY (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (72%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%)  	General  		MOJAVE DESERT (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081222-VV-Feds-rework-BLM-conservation-standards-1222  	Newspaper  	VV  	2008 Daily Press   		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)  		CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (55%)  											
The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	Biomass to the rescue?  	John Dorschner, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	2781 words  	Dec. 22--for Biomass Gas and Electric, which has dealsLiNeBrEaKto build three plants in FloridaLiNeBrEaKNobody loves biomass. When talk turns to global warming and the green movement, it's hardly ever mentioned. Biomass can be garbage (literally) or wood chips or sugar-cane remnants or grass.LiNeBrEaKStill, among energy experts, biomass has some strong supporters, and for good reason: Right now, virtually all the renewable-energy power in Florida comes from biomass, including three plants in Miami-Dade and Broward.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, it's cheap -- cheaper in some instances even than coal, which is generally considered the nation's least expensive way of producing electricity but is also the biggest producer of greenhouse gases that scientists say are heating up the globe. LiNeBrEaK"We're very strong supporters of biomass," says Stephen Smith, head of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. "In the short run, it will be a real workhorse." But he adds: "There are various shades of green in biomass. Some is better than others."LiNeBrEaKAs policymakers search for alternatives to fossil fuels that threaten to submerge South Florida under the sea, biomass has emerged as a leading possibility, much more plausible than wind in the state, but it comes with strong pluses and minuses.LiNeBrEaKBig business has gotten involved. Leading biomass producers -- including the multimillionaire Fanjul family with an electric plant burning sugar-cane leftovers -- have joined the push to require utilities to use more renewables and pay proper rates for them, which would mean the businesses could get decent revenue by expanding operations.LiNeBrEaKStill, many have concerns. "Not all biomass is created equal," says Gerald Karnas of the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists believe garbage is not as green as, say, wood chips. Others worry that arundo donax, a towering grass proposed by some as a biomass fuel, might spread unintentionally to many areas, including the Everglades, as have other non-native plants.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, major companies in North Florida that use wood products are concerned that state subsidies for renewable energy could drive up the prices of timber that are used for everything from paper to fat-free ice cream.LiNeBrEaKEven so, research prepared for the Public Service Commission is showing that biomass and solar are the two top practical renewables in Florida.LiNeBrEaK"The bottom line is that Florida is well positioned for growth in biomass," says Sean Stafford, a lobbyist for Florida Crystals, the Fanjul company. He points out that biomass does not have the "volatile price structure" associated with natural gas, the No. 1 energy source of Florida Power and Light.LiNeBrEaKWhat follows is a primer on biomass.LiNeBrEaKITS QUALITIES:LiNeBrEaKCARBON NEUTRAL?LiNeBrEaKSome biomass -- sugar-cane waste, wood chips -- is generally considered carbon neutral. As cane and trees grow, they soak up carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. That gas is released when the biomass is burned, meaning they produce energy without contributing to climate change.LiNeBrEaKGarbage is another story. "In Florida, biomass has a a very broad definition, according to the state legislature," says Karnas. "In some states, power from municipal solid waste wouldn't be considered a renewable."LiNeBrEaKThe reason: Experts dispute how carbon neutral garbage is. "It depends what's in it," says Smith of the Southern Alliance. "If it's mostly yard clippings and paper, that could mean very little carbon. If there's a lot of plastic, that's made by a fossil fuel, meaning it's releasing quite a bit of carbon."LiNeBrEaKWhat biomass is not is food. "No one is talking about using food for power," says John Bonitz of the Southern Alliance. "This is not corn and ethanol."LiNeBrEaKA growing number of critics are speaking out against subsidies for ethanol, saying they've raised food prices and contributed to food shortages in some parts of the world. "Food into fuel is clearly a dumb idea," says Lester Lave, an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.LiNeBrEaKIn Florida, biomass already produces 1,100 megawatts of power, according a recent study by Navigant Consultants. About half of that comes from 11 waste-to-energy plants that process local garbage and trash.LiNeBrEaKThe other half comes from the leftovers in the timber and sugar-cane industries, which use the power first for their own needs, then sell the remainder to utilities. The biggest plant is run by Florida Crysta1s near South Bay, producing 140 megawatts of power from bagasse, the term for cane waste after the sugar is squeezed out, and from Miami-Dade yard trash.LiNeBrEaKFlorida Power and Light, the state's largest utility, reports that in 2007 it purchased 1. 5 million megawatt-hours from biomass plants totaling 303 megawatts of capacity -- a tiny fraction of the 25 million megawatts that the utility uses.LiNeBrEaKCOSTS -- CHEAPLiNeBrEaKAround the nation, biomass plants have a long, well established history. More than half -- 53 percent -- of all renewables nationwide in 2007 came from biomass, according to the Energy Information Administration.LiNeBrEaKBiomass advocates point out that this waste produces baseload power -- meaning it can fuel plants around the clock -- while solar power usually operates about 20 to 25 percent of the time.LiNeBrEaKIn Burlington, Vt., the 50-megawatt McNeil power station has been operating successfully since 1984, using mostly left-over branches, leaves and stumps generated by people harvesting firewood or lumber.LiNeBrEaKPlant manager John Irving says McNeil breaks even at 5. 5 cents per kilowatt/hour. (To compare, the typical Florida utility customer pays the utility 10 to 13 cents/kWh.)LiNeBrEaKThe price for McNeil power fluctuates depending on alternative sources. "There were some times when oil/gas was very cheap when I'm sure our owners were thinking maybe we should have done something else," wrote Irving in an e-mail. But lately, the utility has been getting 10 or 12 cents/kWh, plus a three-cent bonus from Connecticut for providing clean energy. "They're pretty happy now," Irving says of the owners.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, much of the plant's costs are in labor -- harvesting the wood waste and getting it to the plant. "So that's economic development, compared to sending all your money to the Middle East."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Georgia Power proposes changing its 96-megawatt Mitchell Plant from burning coal to biomass. This would not only eliminate a source of the worst emitter of greenhouse gases but would also reduce fuel costs by 30 percent and operating-maintenance costs by 13 percent over the life of the plant, according to spokesman Jeff Wilson.LiNeBrEaKMost of the wood fuel would come from sources considered unusable by timber companies, Georgia Power says. The switch to biomass is estimated to create 50 to 75 new jobs.LiNeBrEaKIn Florida, Biomass Gas and Electric has deals to build three plants, including a 42-megawatt generator in Tallahassee. BGandE spokesman Keith McDermott says the contract will pay BGandE 7. 2 cents/kWh. "Obviously we know we can make the economics work. We're in the business to make money."LiNeBrEaKThe Navigant study reported most types of biomass power's present costs are one-tenth to one-third of solar power's. Even in 2020, assuming major technical improvements for solar, the study found that in one likely scenario, solar will be a viable power source at about 23 cents/kWh, while much of biomass will be at 0. 82 to 12 cents/kWh.LiNeBrEaKStill, Florida biomass producers complain they're not getting paid fairly. Florida Crystals and Covanta Energy, which converts garbage to power, say they often get only 6 or 7 cents/kWh from utilities. FPL reports that so far in 2008 it has paid about 4 cents/kWh for electricity produced by biomass resources -- about a third of what its customers pay the utility.LiNeBrEaKThese rates are generally based on "avoided cost of electricity," meaning a wholesale price that a utility says it avoids by buying alternative power.LiNeBrEaK"The utilities can low-ball us, and there's nothing that we can do about it," says Florida Crystals spokesman Gaston Cantens.LiNeBrEaKFPL spokesman Mayco Villafana says if the utility paid the biomass producers more, its customers would have to pay more. "In Florida, the rules are written to protect customers by ensuring that utilities don't overpay for the electricity they buy. Eliminating those rules would allow biomass producers to charge whatever they wanted with no protections for customers."LiNeBrEaK"The system isn't fair," says Joseph Treshler of Covanta Energy, which runs a waste-to-electricity plant in Hillsborough County. "The Legislature gives the utility full-cost recovery for constructing a renewable plant," meaning the utility has no risk and gets all the profit. "There is no incentive for them to look outside. They squeeze the independent."LiNeBrEaKGARBAGE INLiNeBrEaKPOWER OUTLiNeBrEaKWith power produced by municipal solid waste, the primary motive of local governments is to get rid of local garbage and trash without creating more landfills.LiNeBrEaKThe problem with burning garbage for electricity is that, well, it's garbage -- meaning it lacks the consistency of a regular fuel. One day's garbage might be filled with power, the next day's might be weak.LiNeBrEaK"It's not a particularly cheap way of making electricity," says Lave at Carnegie Mellon.LiNeBrEaKThe Navigant study reports that garbage power and farm waste (think pig manure) can be twice as expensive as some other forms of biomass. One scenario shows the price needed to justify using garbage power in 2009 will be 12. 58 cents/kWh, rising to 15. 66 in 2020, making it considerably more expensive than natural gas.LiNeBrEaKBroward has two garbage-to-electricity plants, managed by Wheelebrator Technologies, a division of Waste Management. Operating since 1991, the plants produce 134 megawatts of power, enough to serve 75,000 homes, save 2. 8 million barrels of oil and get rid of up to 4,500 tons of waste a day that would otherwise fill up dumps.LiNeBrEaKIn the Doral area of Miami-Dade, the Resource Recovery Facility processes 4,200 tons a day, producing 77 megawatts of power that serve about 50,000 homes.LiNeBrEaKThe Dade plant also converts 400,000 tons annually of yard trash into a carbon-free mulch. The facility then pays to ship most of that to plants like Florida Crystals', because the Dade generators are at capacity just with garbage.LiNeBrEaKPlant manager Hank Clements says the Miami Dade plant gets 3 to 8 cents/kWh, which cuts the county's garbage disposal costs by $27 million a year. He says the plant has high-tech emission controls that scrub many of the pollutants out before they get into the air.LiNeBrEaKStill, environmentalists have concerns. The Southern Alliance says plastics and paper are too often burned for power when they should be recycled. Plastics and metals can lead to pollution, and he's not certain about the quality of emission controls at garbage plants, says Smith.LiNeBrEaKEven so, Smith says his clean-air group has "made a calculated decision to go neutral" on garbage-energy, because environmental groups are allied with waste companies like Covanta in pressing the state to adopt a requirement that a certain percentage of power come from renewables.LiNeBrEaK"We have much more in common than we have differences," says Karnas. Burning garbage is "better than burning a pound of coal."LiNeBrEaKTHE LIMITATIONSLiNeBrEaKSince biomass tends to be bulky, location is an issue. "The rule of thumb is that if the distance is greater than 50 to 60 miles, then transportation cost becomes prohibitive," says Jarek Nowak of the Florida Division of Forestry.LiNeBrEaKThat's why biomass plants tend to be smallish -- ranging from under a megawatt to 50 or so. Compare that with FPL's oil and gas generators at Port Everglades, which total 1,200 megawatts.LiNeBrEaKMost wood-waste energy in Florida comes from forests in the north. One company there is Buckeye Technologies, which produces wood fiber used in such things as hot dogs and cosmetics. It uses the power of its 40MW plant to handle their own manufacturing needs, then sells what's left to the grid.LiNeBrEaK"We use every bit of the waste material for power," says Michele Curtis, Buckeye's wood supply manager. "The limbs and branches, the sawdust."LiNeBrEaKBuckeye and other timber users worry that a state renewable energy requirement might provide such high subsidies for burning wood that, like corn and ethanol, it could drive up costs of all wood products.LiNeBrEaK"It's not a level playing field when government puts incentives out there," says Curtis. "We are a believer . . . in green energy," but to keep timber prices steady, it wants limits set on the amount of wood used for energy.LiNeBrEaKIS GRASSLiNeBrEaKALWAYS GREENER?LiNeBrEaKSome companies say the best way to biomass is to grow nonfood crops, such as switchgrass or arundo donax, a large grass that can easily grow 30 feet high in Florida's warm climate.LiNeBrEaKFor the past two years, Progress Energy has been talking to companies that want to fuel a plant by growing arundo donax on up to 20,000 acres somewhere in Central Florida. The talks haven't gone far. One reason: Many environmentalists don't like arundo donax.LiNeBrEaKShirley Denton, past president of the Florida Native Plant Society, said her group is "definitely not comfortable" with the grass, which has "been demonstrated to be a highly invasive species" in other places, including California. She fears the grass in Florida could become another dominating non-native plant, like melaleuca, which has overrun wide areas.LiNeBrEaKIn December, Innovative Energy Group of Florida, a subsidiary of a Dubai company, said it had encountered "significant challenges" of finding land in Florida for arundo donax, according to a story on Greenwire.LiNeBrEaKBiomass Gas and Electric, which has plans for three plants in Florida that would use arundo donax, says it has received a permit for the grass from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, "but there have been requests for a hearing," says BGandE spokesman McDermott.LiNeBrEaKFPL, which is building three solar generators, has reservations about the grasses. 'If by 'biomass,' you mean generation produced from an energy crop such as switchgrass," says Villafana, "then we are concerned about the significant impact and pressure on land and animal habitat, both locally and elsewhere, and the environmental impact from incremental emissions of . . . contaminants that are produced by the entire biomass production/process cycle. . . .LiNeBrEaK"While clearly a renewable resource, we do not view this form of biomass as a clean resource, since the net impact on the environment is negative as compared to alternative forms of energy such as solar, nuclear and wind," Villafana wrote in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKBonitz of the Southern Alliance's response: 'FPL's attitude toward biomass is sad, because data show that Florida has plentiful renewable biomass resources that can help replace coal, petroleum, and natural gas for electricity. We do not need to wait on 'energy-crops' to begin freeing ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels."LiNeBrEaKTHE POTENTIALLiNeBrEaKHUGE OR LIMITED?LiNeBrEaKThe Navigant report estimates that biomass in Florida has the potential to produce somewhere between 6,000 and 15,550 megawatts more than exist now. That's the equivalent of three to seven times the amount of electricity of the two nuclear units FPL is planning.LiNeBrEaKOne potential source: At least 15 million acres of forest in Florida -- the vast majority of that in the northern part of the state. But not all of that should be used for biomass, say experts, because it could jack up timber prices.LiNeBrEaKFor garbage, the Navigant report says only 11 percent of Florida's municipal waste is now turned into energy. If it all was, it could add up to another 4,000 megawatts of power -- the equivalent of four nuclear generators.LiNeBrEaKNavigant dismisses another biomass possibility -- animal waste. Poultry litter and horse manure can add up to 880 million to 1. 6 billion pounds annually, but it's low-energy that could produce perhaps 90 megawatts -- at a far higher cost than other biomass.LiNeBrEaKThe study commissioned by the PSC doesn't offer much hope for more plants like Florida Crystals', concluding that "crop residues represent a modest resource in Florida, especially compared to other states with large cereal crops," such as Iowa.LiNeBrEaKNavigant estimates Florida crop residue could produce no more than 800 megawatts. Florida Crystals believes that figure is unfairly low.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of the numbers, biomass supporters vow to push on, "We're part of the low-hanging fruit," says Treshler of Covanta. "It's cheap power, and our waste is indigenous."

Biomass can be garbage (literally) or wood chips or sugar-cane remnants or grass.LiNeBrEaKStill, among energy experts, biomass has some strong supporters, and for good reason: Right now, virtually all the renewable-energy power in Florida comes from biomass, including three plants in Miami-Dade and Broward.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, it's cheap -- cheaper in some instances even than coal, which is generally considered the nation's least expensive way of producing electricity but is also the biggest producer of greenhouse gases that scientists say are heating up the globe.LiNeBrEaK"We're very strong supporters of biomass," says Stephen Smith, head of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. "In the short run, it will be a real workhorse." But he adds: "There are various shades of green in biomass. Some is better than others." LiNeBrEaKAs policymakers search for alternatives to fossil fuels that threaten to submerge South Florida under the sea, biomass has emerged as a leading possibility, much more plausible than wind in the state, but it comes with strong pluses and minuses.LiNeBrEaKBig business has gotten involved. Leading biomass producers -- including the multimillionaire Fanjul family with an electric plant burning sugar-cane leftovers -- have joined the push to require utilities to use more renewables and pay proper rates for them, which would mean the businesses could get decent revenue by expanding operations.LiNeBrEaKStill, many have concerns. "Not all biomass is created equal," says Gerald Karnas of the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists believe garbage is not as green as, say, wood chips. Others worry that arundo donax, a towering grass proposed by some as a biomass fuel, might spread unintentionally to many areas, including the Everglades, as have other non-native plants.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, major companies in North Florida that use wood products are concerned that state subsidies for renewable energy could drive up the prices of timber that are used for everything from paper to fat-free ice cream.LiNeBrEaKEven so, research prepared for the Public Service Commission is showing that biomass and solar are the two top practical renewables in Florida.LiNeBrEaK"The bottom line is that Florida is well positioned for growth in biomass," says Sean Stafford, a lobbyist for Florida Crystals, the Fanjul company. He points out that biomass does not have the "volatile price structure" associated with natural gas, the No. 1 energy source of Florida Power and Light.LiNeBrEaKWhat follows is a primer on biomass.LiNeBrEaKITS QUALITIES:LiNeBrEaKCARBON NEUTRAL?LiNeBrEaKSome biomass -- sugar-cane waste, wood chips -- is generally considered carbon neutral. As cane and trees grow, they soak up carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. That gas is released when the biomass is burned, meaning they produce energy without contributing to climate change.LiNeBrEaKGarbage is another story. "In Florida, biomass has a a very broad definition, according to the state legislature," says Karnas. "In some states, power from municipal solid waste wouldn't be considered a renewable."LiNeBrEaKThe reason: Experts dispute how carbon neutral garbage is. "It depends what's in it," says Smith of the Southern Alliance. "If it's mostly yard clippings and paper, that could mean very little carbon. If there's a lot of plastic, that's made by a fossil fuel, meaning it's releasing quite a bit of carbon."LiNeBrEaKWhat biomass is not is food. "No one is talking about using food for power," says John Bonitz of the Southern Alliance. "This is not corn and ethanol."LiNeBrEaKA growing number of critics are speaking out against subsidies for ethanol, saying they've raised food prices and contributed to food shortages in some parts of the world. "Food into fuel is clearly a dumb idea," says Lester Lave, an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.LiNeBrEaKIn Florida, biomass already produces 1,100 megawatts of power, according a recent study by Navigant Consultants. About half of that comes from 11 waste-to-energy plants that process local garbage and trash.LiNeBrEaKThe other half comes from the leftovers in the timber and sugar-cane industries, which use the power first for their own needs, then sell the remainder to utilities. The biggest plant is run by Florida Crysta1s near South Bay, producing 140 megawatts of power from bagasse, the term for cane waste after the sugar is squeezed out, and from Miami-Dade yard trash.LiNeBrEaKFlorida Power and Light, the state's largest utility, reports that in 2007 it purchased 1. 5 million megawatt-hours from biomass plants totaling 303 megawatts of capacity -- a tiny fraction of the 25 million megawatts that the utility uses.LiNeBrEaKCOSTS -- CHEAPLiNeBrEaKAround the nation, biomass plants have a long, well established history. More than half -- 53 percent -- of all renewables nationwide in 2007 came from biomass, according to the Energy Information Administration.LiNeBrEaKBiomass advocates point out that this waste produces baseload power -- meaning it can fuel plants around the clock -- while solar power usually operates about 20 to 25 percent of the time.LiNeBrEaKIn Burlington, Vt., the 50-megawatt McNeil power station has been operating successfully since 1984, using mostly left-over branches, leaves and stumps generated by people harvesting firewood or lumber.LiNeBrEaKPlant manager John Irving says McNeil breaks even at 5. 5 cents per kilowatt/hour. (To compare, the typical Florida utility customer pays the utility 10 to 13 cents/kWh.)LiNeBrEaKThe price for McNeil power fluctuates depending on alternative sources. "There were some times when oil/gas was very cheap when I'm sure our owners were thinking maybe we should have done something else," wrote Irving in an e-mail. But lately, the utility has been getting 10 or 12 cents/kWh, plus a three-cent bonus from Connecticut for providing clean energy. "They're pretty happy now," Irving says of the owners.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, much of the plant's costs are in labor -- harvesting the wood waste and getting it to the plant. "So that's economic development, compared to sending all your money to the Middle East."LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Georgia Power proposes changing its 96-megawatt Mitchell Plant from burning coal to biomass. This would not only eliminate a source of the worst emitter of greenhouse gases but would also reduce fuel costs by 30 percent and operating-maintenance costs by 13 percent over the life of the plant, according to spokesman Jeff Wilson.LiNeBrEaKMost of the wood fuel would come from sources considered unusable by timber companies, Georgia Power says. The switch to biomass is estimated to create 50 to 75 new jobs.LiNeBrEaKIn Florida, Biomass Gas and Electric has deals to build three plants, including a 42-megawatt generator in Tallahassee. BGandE spokesman Keith McDermott says the contract will pay BGandE 7. 2 cents/kWh. "Obviously we know we can make the economics work. We're in the business to make money."LiNeBrEaKThe Navigant study reported most types of biomass power's present costs are one-tenth to one-third of solar power's. Even in 2020, assuming major technical improvements for solar, the study found that in one likely scenario, solar will be a viable power source at about 23 cents/kWh, while much of biomass will be at 0. 82 to 12 cents/kWh.LiNeBrEaKStill, Florida biomass producers complain they're not getting paid fairly. Florida Crystals and Covanta Energy, which converts garbage to power, say they often get only 6 or 7 cents/kWh from utilities. FPL reports that so far in 2008 it has paid about 4 cents/kWh for electricity produced by biomass resources -- about a third of what its customers pay the utility.LiNeBrEaKThese rates are generally based on "avoided cost of electricity," meaning a wholesale price that a utility says it avoids by buying alternative power.LiNeBrEaK"The utilities can low-ball us, and there's nothing that we can do about it," says Florida Crystals spokesman Gaston Cantens.LiNeBrEaKFPL spokesman Mayco Villafana says if the utility paid the biomass producers more, its customers would have to pay more. "In Florida, the rules are written to protect customers by ensuring that utilities don't overpay for the electricity they buy. Eliminating those rules would allow biomass producers to charge whatever they wanted with no protections for customers."LiNeBrEaK"The system isn't fair," says Joseph Treshler of Covanta Energy, which runs a waste-to-electricity plant in Hillsborough County. "The Legislature gives the utility full-cost recovery for constructing a renewable plant," meaning the utility has no risk and gets all the profit. "There is no incentive for them to look outside. They squeeze the independent."LiNeBrEaKGARBAGE INLiNeBrEaKPOWER OUTLiNeBrEaKWith power produced by municipal solid waste, the primary motive of local governments is to get rid of local garbage and trash without creating more landfills.LiNeBrEaKThe problem with burning garbage for electricity is that, well, it's garbage -- meaning it lacks the consistency of a regular fuel. One day's garbage might be filled with power, the next day's might be weak.LiNeBrEaK"It's not a particularly cheap way of making electricity," says Lave at Carnegie Mellon.LiNeBrEaKThe Navigant study reports that garbage power and farm waste (think pig manure) can be twice as expensive as some other forms of biomass. One scenario shows the price needed to justify using garbage power in 2009 will be 12. 58 cents/kWh, rising to 15. 66 in 2020, making it considerably more expensive than natural gas.LiNeBrEaKBroward has two garbage-to-electricity plants, managed by Wheelebrator Technologies, a division of Waste Management. Operating since 1991, the plants produce 134 megawatts of power, enough to serve 75,000 homes, save 2. 8 million barrels of oil and get rid of up to 4,500 tons of waste a day that would otherwise fill up dumps.LiNeBrEaKIn the Doral area of Miami-Dade, the Resource Recovery Facility processes 4,200 tons a day, producing 77 megawatts of power that serve about 50,000 homes.LiNeBrEaKThe Dade plant also converts 400,000 tons annually of yard trash into a carbon-free mulch. The facility then pays to ship most of that to plants like Florida Crystals', because the Dade generators are at capacity just with garbage.LiNeBrEaKPlant manager Hank Clements says the Miami Dade plant gets 3 to 8 cents/kWh, which cuts the county's garbage disposal costs by $27 million a year. He says the plant has high-tech emission controls that scrub many of the pollutants out before they get into the air.LiNeBrEaKStill, environmentalists have concerns. The Southern Alliance says plastics and paper are too often burned for power when they should be recycled. Plastics and metals can lead to pollution, and he's not certain about the quality of emission controls at garbage plants, says Smith.LiNeBrEaKEven so, Smith says his clean-air group has "made a calculated decision to go neutral" on garbage-energy, because environmental groups are allied with waste companies like Covanta in pressing the state to adopt a requirement that a certain percentage of power come from renewables.LiNeBrEaK"We have much more in common than we have differences," says Karnas. Burning garbage is "better than burning a pound of coal."LiNeBrEaKTHE LIMITATIONSLiNeBrEaKSince biomass tends to be bulky, location is an issue. "The rule of thumb is that if the distance is greater than 50 to 60 miles, then transportation cost becomes prohibitive," says Jarek Nowak of the Florida Division of Forestry.LiNeBrEaKThat's why biomass plants tend to be smallish -- ranging from under a megawatt to 50 or so. Compare that with FPL's oil and gas generators at Port Everglades, which total 1,200 megawatts.LiNeBrEaKMost wood-waste energy in Florida comes from forests in the north. One company there is Buckeye Technologies, which produces wood fiber used in such things as hot dogs and cosmetics. It uses the power of its 40MW plant to handle their own manufacturing needs, then sells what's left to the grid.LiNeBrEaK"We use every bit of the waste material for power," says Michele Curtis, Buckeye's wood supply manager. "The limbs and branches, the sawdust."LiNeBrEaKBuckeye and other timber users worry that a state renewable energy requirement might provide such high subsidies for burning wood that, like corn and ethanol, it could drive up costs of all wood products.LiNeBrEaK"It's not a level playing field when government puts incentives out there," says Curtis. "We are a believer . . . in green energy," but to keep timber prices steady, it wants limits set on the amount of wood used for energy.LiNeBrEaKIS GRASSLiNeBrEaKALWAYS GREENER?LiNeBrEaKSome companies say the best way to biomass is to grow nonfood crops, such as switchgrass or arundo donax, a large grass that can easily grow 30 feet high in Florida's warm climate.LiNeBrEaKFor the past two years, Progress Energy has been talking to companies that want to fuel a plant by growing arundo donax on up to 20,000 acres somewhere in Central Florida. The talks haven't gone far. One reason: Many environmentalists don't like arundo donax.LiNeBrEaKShirley Denton, past president of the Florida Native Plant Society, said her group is "definitely not comfortable" with the grass, which has "been demonstrated to be a highly invasive species" in other places, including California. She fears the grass in Florida could become another dominating non-native plant, like melaleuca, which has overrun wide areas.LiNeBrEaKIn December, Innovative Energy Group of Florida, a subsidiary of a Dubai company, said it had encountered "significant challenges" of finding land in Florida for arundo donax, according to a story on Greenwire.LiNeBrEaKBiomass Gas and Electric, which has plans for three plants in Florida that would use arundo donax, says it has received a permit for the grass from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, "but there have been requests for a hearing," says BGandE spokesman McDermott.LiNeBrEaKFPL, which is building three solar generators, has reservations about the grasses. 'If by 'biomass,' you mean generation produced from an energy crop such as switchgrass," says Villafana, "then we are concerned about the significant impact and pressure on land and animal habitat, both locally and elsewhere, and the environmental impact from incremental emissions of . . . contaminants that are produced by the entire biomass production/process cycle. . . .LiNeBrEaK"While clearly a renewable resource, we do not view this form of biomass as a clean resource, since the net impact on the environment is negative as compared to alternative forms of energy such as solar, nuclear and wind," Villafana wrote in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKBonitz of the Southern Alliance's response: 'FPL's attitude toward biomass is sad, because data show that Florida has plentiful renewable biomass resources that can help replace coal, petroleum, and natural gas for electricity. We do not need to wait on 'energy-crops' to begin freeing ourselves from our addiction to fossil fuels."LiNeBrEaKTHE POTENTIALLiNeBrEaKHUGE OR LIMITED?LiNeBrEaKThe Navigant report estimates that biomass in Florida has the potential to produce somewhere between 6,000 and 15,550 megawatts more than exist now. That's the equivalent of three to seven times the amount of electricity of the two nuclear units FPL is planning.LiNeBrEaKOne potential source: At least 15 million acres of forest in Florida -- the vast majority of that in the northern part of the state. But not all of that should be used for biomass, say experts, because it could jack up timber prices.LiNeBrEaKFor garbage, the Navigant report says only 11 percent of Florida's municipal waste is now turned into energy. If it all was, it could add up to another 4,000 megawatts of power -- the equivalent of four nuclear generators.LiNeBrEaKNavigant dismisses another biomass possibility -- animal waste. Poultry litter and horse manure can add up to 880 million to 1. 6 billion pounds annually, but it's low-energy that could produce perhaps 90 megawatts -- at a far higher cost than other biomass.LiNeBrEaKThe study commissioned by the PSC doesn't offer much hope for more plants like Florida Crystals', concluding that "crop residues represent a modest resource in Florida, especially compared to other states with large cereal crops," such as Iowa.LiNeBrEaKNavigant estimates Florida crop residue could produce no more than 800 megawatts. Florida Crystals believes that figure is unfairly low.LiNeBrEaKRegardless of the numbers, biomass supporters vow to push on, "We're part of the low-hanging fruit," says Treshler of Covanta. "It's cheap power, and our waste is indigenous."

The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	FPL's efforts to conserve power usage spark battle: The simplest way to battle global warming is to use less electricity. But that basic idea has produced a bitter battle between environmentalists and Florida Power and Light.  	John Dorschner, The Miami Herald  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1413 words  	Dec. 22--In all the complex discussions about how to combat global warming, Vicki Eckels does her small part in her Fort Lauderdale home: She sets her air conditioning thermostat at 85 degrees, has stuffed extra insulation into her roof and runs the water heater only 90 minutes a day.LiNeBrEaKThen there's the roof, which isn't so small: It has state-of-the-art solar photovoltaic panels that provide about half of the power to her 1,500-square-foot house. What solar power she doesn't use is sent to the grid -- and she gets paid for it.LiNeBrEaKBottom line: She buys only about 500 kilowatt-hours a month from the utility -- about half that of a typical customer. Her monthly bill is about $60. LiNeBrEaKThat makes Eckels a woman of the moment: Part of the green movement that's sweeping the country to battle man-made climate change -- and part of the growing group of consumers who are searching for ways to pinch pennies in these touch economic times.LiNeBrEaK"I do what I can," Eckels says.LiNeBrEaKSuch energy conservation may seem like an inarguable good, but how to promote it has sparked a bitter debate between environmentalists, utilities and policymakers.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities, required by a 1980 law to teach customers to cut power usage, insist they're doing a lot. And customers are paying for it -- about two bucks a month on the average Florida Power and Light bill.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say power companies aren't doing nearly enough for that money. The Legislature agrees. It has ordered the Public Service Commission to find ways that utilities can do more for conversation, a path that may lead to making a fundamental change in the way utilities are paid.LiNeBrEaKOn a larger scale, policymakers are talking about the need for complex measures to combat man-made climate change by promoting renewable energy or using cap-and-trade systems to penalize companies that produce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKStill, one widely respected report, The Stern Review, concluded that "energy efficiency has the potential to be the biggest single source of emissions savings."LiNeBrEaKFor two decades, however, most of us have been using more power, not less. "In spite of more energy efficient appliances in the market, . . . electric usage per FPL customer has increased by approximately by 20 percent," says FPL spokesman Mayco Villafana.LiNeBrEaKTivos that run around the clock, televisions scattered around the house, cellphones charging, computers doing background projects in sleep mode, "smart" toasters with tiny sensors -- all soak up electricity.LiNeBrEaKOnly this year, with soaring energy prices slamming customers during a recession, usage by FPL customers dipped by 2. 8 percent in the third quarter, though much of that is attributed to common penny-pinching and empty, foreclosed houses.LiNeBrEaKEven so, the green movement is playing some part. New air conditioners, clothes dryers and many other appliances have been designed to use less energy. Thicker windows and insulation in attics also help.LiNeBrEaKSome of these actions are cheaper than others. Eckels paid $43,000 for the solar system in her home just south of downtown Fort Lauderdale. For that, she will get a $2,000 credit on her federal income taxes. She hopes to get a rebate of $20,000 from the state if new funding is provided for a solar program.LiNeBrEaKUsing solar, she says, has taught her the value of electricity. "I unplug everything when not being used," because many electronic appliances, particularly the more sophisticated, tend to keep running in background mode even when not being used.LiNeBrEaKShe uses efficient fluorescent bulbs, has some tinted windows, draws curtains to keep direct sunlight from overheating the house, uses a compost heap for garbage instead of having a disposal. And, oh yes, she drives a Ford Escape hybrid.LiNeBrEaKHelped by new regulations, Eckels participates in net metering, in which she gets credit from FPL for solar power she feeds to the grid that's equal to the rate that utilities receive from customers.LiNeBrEaKSo far, Eckels is not part of a mass movement. Only 176 of FPL's 4. 5 million customers have signed up for net meeting this year. Still, that's up from 27 in 2006 and 87 in 2007.LiNeBrEaKFor those who want to reduce consumption, FPL is ready to help, with plenty of advice on its website and by phone. The utility even offers to send a person to your home for a detailed assessment of how to cut power usage.LiNeBrEaKSuch actions are part of 21 energy conservation programs that FPL operates. They also include measures that reward businesses and residents who agree to cut their usage during peak periods, as well as sealing up windows for low-income customers. Such programs cost the average customer $2. 03 a month.LiNeBrEaKFPL boasts that 2006 federal data shows it's No. 1 nationally for "cumulative energy efficiency achievement." It says its conservation efforts over the past 30 years have meant it has not had to build 12 medium-size power plants.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are skeptical of some of FPL's claims. Stephen Smith, head of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, wrote recently to the Governor's Action Team on Energy and Climate Change, that FPL's claim to be No. 1 relates to demand reduction programs, paying customers to lower usage at certain times, and not overall energy savings.LiNeBrEaKMeasuring energy savings as percentage of total sales, FPL ranks No. 19 nationally, Smith wrote. "Energy savings, not demand reduction, is the path to reduced global warming."LiNeBrEaKCertainly, customers are paying. In a PSC workshop earlier this year, environmentalist Holly Binns said Florida utilities have collected $4. 15 billion from customers since 1981 to reduce electricity consumption, but consumption per customer has risen 44 percent in Florida while it declined by 28 percent in California, which was an early advocate of energy-efficient appliances and building codes as well as demanding aggressive programs from utilities.LiNeBrEaKAt that same meeting, John McWhirter of the Florida Industrial Power Users Group pointed out that it was an odd system when the law required those who profited from increased usage to teach consumers how to lower usage.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say the best way to make utilities perform better is to change the way they're paid. Earlier this year, they persuaded the Legislature to ask the PSC to develop a report on separating profit from the amount of electricity people use.LiNeBrEaKAt present, the more electricity customers use, the more the utility profits. Yet at the same time, state law requires that utilities teach customers to use less electricity.LiNeBrEaK"This is a perverse disincentive," the Souther Alliance's Smith says. 'Utilities are trying to aggressively get more revenue, while they say, 'How great we are in energy efficiency.' "LiNeBrEaKSmith and many other environmentalists say decoupling revenue from usage would allow the utilities to get a reasonable rate of profit, but that profit wouldn't increase when customers increase their usage. That way utilities could help reduce energy usage without hurting themselves, or so environmentalists theorize.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities are not enthused. "There is no evidence that decoupling leads to reductions in demand for electricity," says FPL's Villafana. "And given FPL's record as the nation's No. 1 utility for energy conservation, we are hard-pressed to see how decoupling could have done a better job" than FPL has already done.LiNeBrEaK"In addition, decoupling could harm customers by reducing the incentive for utilities to keep their costs as low as possible," Villafana says, because they would be guaranteed a certain profit and have no incentive to control costs.LiNeBrEaKSmith counters that a conscientious utility would still control costs. "They just hate to see a loss of their rapid growth." Decoupling "would set a very important tone."LiNeBrEaKBoth sides "acknowledge that revenue decoupling by itself does not provide a utility with an incentive to pursue energy conservation." Other programs would have to insist on performance goals.LiNeBrEaKIn the past several months, the PSC staff listened to everyone's statements on decoupling and drafted a report for the Legislature outlining the arguments but didn't come to a firm conclusion. "Questions remain," said the report.

The New York Times 		December 22, 2008 Monday   Late Edition - Final	Forest Plan in Brazil Bears the Traces of an Activist's Vision  	By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6  	951 words  	Twenty years ago, a Brazilian environmental activist and rubber tapper was shot to death at his home in Acre State by ranchers opposed to his efforts to save the Amazon rain forest.LiNeBrEaK  After his death at age 44, Francisco Alves Mendes, better known as Chico, became a martyr for a concept that is only now gaining mainstream support here: that the value of a standing forest could be more than the value of a forest burned and logged in the name of development.LiNeBrEaK  This month, Brazil took what environmentalists hope will be a big step forward in realizing Mr. Mendes's vision. The government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva introduced ambitious targets for reducing deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions in a nation that is one of the world's top emitters of this heat-trapping gas. LiNeBrEaK  The plan promises to make Brazil a more influential player in global climate-change discussions, helping to push the United States and the European Union to agree to emissions cuts and head off the adverse effects of climate change. It could also encourage more pledges from wealthy countries seeking to essentially pay Brazil to preserve the forest for the good of all humanity.LiNeBrEaK  But some environmentalists question whether the new targets, which would reduce Brazilian deforestation by 72 percent by 2017, are achievable in a country that has shown few signs of adjusting its development model as a major food provider to the world, especially in the midst of a global economic crisis. LiNeBrEaK  To achieve the first phase of planned cuts, Brazil would have to reduce deforestation next year by 20 percent, to less than 4,000 square miles. That would be the lowest amount per year ever recorded in Brazil, said Paulo Adario, the Amazon campaign director for Greenpeace in Brazil.LiNeBrEaK  Brazil's economy is centered on the export of agricultural products, like soybeans and beef, and commodities like iron ore.LiNeBrEaK  ''The Brazilian model is to be the food supplier to the world and a big supplier of ethanol,'' Mr. Adario said. ''The economy will continue to move in the same basic direction. There is no magic in Brazil.''LiNeBrEaK  Up until  now, Brazil's economic choices have driven much of the deforestation in the Amazon, he said. In the late 1960s and the 1970s, the military government encouraged landless families to settle in the region. Road-building, land speculators and ranchers followed, and the forests fell at a quickening pace. LiNeBrEaK  The burning and decomposition of trees produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Mendes organized tappers to confront crews and flew abroad to confront lenders paying for roads. His efforts to stop logging in an area planned for a forest reserve led to his death. Since his killing, on Dec. 22, 1988, more than 20 reserves have been created, protecting more than eight million acres.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Mendes was an early advocate of the idea that people who live in the forest could create livelihoods from sustainable forest resources, rather than the one-time economic benefit of cutting down trees. Carbon financing, the compensation of forest dwellers for pursuing sustainable industries, would provide an added incentive, which is vital given the uncertain markets for natural rubber and other non-timber forest products.LiNeBrEaK  ''The notion that we in the north will help pay for that climate service is an important development and represents the mainstreaming of the concept that Chico Mendes and those like him were pioneers in creating,'' said Richard H. Moss, the head of climate change programs at the World Wildlife Fund in Washington.LiNeBrEaK  The killings of Mr. Mendes and of Sister Dorothy Stang, a 73-year-old Catholic nun who was gunned down in 2005 for speaking out against logging in the Amazon, ratcheted up international pressure on Brazil to find ways to limit forest clearing without sacrificing development. LiNeBrEaK  ''Brazil was always on the defensive when it came to the question of climate change,'' said Carlos Minc, Brazil's environment minister. ''And now it has completely changed, passing a bolder plan than India and China.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Minc said the plan would help meet a demand of some of the more developed countries, including the United States, which has said it would not agree to firm emissions targets until less-developed countries that produce significant amounts of greenhouse gases do the same. LiNeBrEaK  Deforestation produces more than a fifth of human-generated carbon dioxide by some estimates. Some 75 percent of Brazil's carbon dioxide emissions come from deforestation, Mr. Minc said. LiNeBrEaK  Brazil's plan would sharply slice those emissions, reducing them by some 4. 8 billion tons by 2018. Some environmentalists contend that deals involving compensation for forest protection could weaken climate agreements in many ways. They also say the plan leaves the most difficult targets to the government that will follow Mr. da Silva's. His term ends in 2010. LiNeBrEaK  Still, it is viewed by some scientists and climate experts as major step forward. ''For the first time we have out in the open very clear goals for reduction in deforestation,'' said Walter Vergara, the lead climatologist for Latin America at the World Bank.LiNeBrEaK  The global recession could end up being a godsend by lowering demand for agricultural goods. LiNeBrEaK  But it could also slow the flow of technology needed to make industries more efficient and limit pledges from foreign governments like Norway, Sweden and Germany, whose payments would help preserve the forest. So far, those countries have not suggested that they would reduce their contributions, Mr. Minc said.  LiNeBrEaK  ''The global recession and the climate crisis don't necessarily have to be adversaries, with one competing for the resources of the other,'' Mr. Minc said.

The New York Times 		December 22, 2008 Monday   Late Edition - Final	A New Respect for Science  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 32  	345 words  	Though Barack Obama's cabinet appointments have received the big headlines, it is worth noting two important sub-cabinet choices. Both are scientists, committed to using rather than abusing science to address issues like climate change, and a welcome departure from the many ideologues and lobbyists that Dick Cheney assembled to advise President Bush on environmental matters. LiNeBrEaK  The first of these choices is Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, to run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the Commerce Department responsible for the health of the atmosphere and the oceans. LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Lubchenco is an expert on two grave threats to the oceans, both linked to global warming. One is acidification, which is destroying coral reefs, the other hypoxia, a condition that robs fish of the oxygen they need to survive. She has also been a powerful advocate for stronger federal and international efforts to protect declining fish species. LiNeBrEaK  We are also heartened by Mr. Obama's choice of John Holdren, a Harvard physicist, as his science adviser. Mr. Holdren has served as chairman of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as has Ms. Lubchenco. Both have argued strongly and repeatedly for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gases to avoid catastrophic climate change. LiNeBrEaK  Like Mr. Obama's earlier appointments -- in particular Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics, to run the Department of Energy -- these choices solidly affirm Mr. Obama's commitment to aggressively address the challenges of energy independence and global warming. LiNeBrEaK  The broader point, though, is what they say about his appreciation for the processes of science. That  was not much in evidence in the Bush administration, some of whose appointees edited and suppressed scientific documents  to serve the administration's political agenda.LiNeBrEaK  As Ms. Lubchenco observes, identifying a problem is not synonymous with solving it. But Mr. Obama has at least surrounded himself with serious scholars of some of the most critical issues of our times.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	An eroding mission at EPA  	By John Shiffman and John Sullivan, The Philadelphia Inquirer  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	5526 words  	WASHINGTON _ On Dec. 5, 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson approved an extraordinary document. It declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare _ a decision that would trigger the nation's first mandatory global warming regulations.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, a career scientist, knew that his draft would meet with resistance from anti-regulatory ideologues at the White House, but he believed the science was solid.LiNeBrEaKAccording to confidential records reviewed by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Johnson cited strong evidence: rises in sea level, extreme hot and cold days, ecosystem changes, melting glaciers, and more. Minor doubts about long-term effects, he wrote, were not enough to alter his conclusion.LiNeBrEaKTwo sentences in Johnson's draft stood out. In sum: "The U.S. emits more greenhouse gases from cars than most countries do from all pollution sources. This fact is so compelling that it alone supports The Administrator's finding." LiNeBrEaKAt 2: 10 p.m., Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the climate change draft to the White House as an attachment.LiNeBrEaKWhat happened next became Johnson's defining moment and cemented President George W. Bush's environmental legacy, serving as the low-water mark of a tumultuous era that has left the EPA badly wounded, largely demoralized and, in many ways, emasculated.LiNeBrEaKWhite House aides _ who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change _ knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it too controversial to rescind. So they didn't open it.LiNeBrEaKThey called Johnson and asked him to take it back.LiNeBrEaKThe law clearly stated that the final decision was the EPA administrator's _ not Bush's. Johnson initially resisted _ which Burnett admired _ but ultimately did as he was told.LiNeBrEaKOutraged, Burnett resigned.LiNeBrEaKEight months later, Johnson issued a new, censored version, a pale imitation of the original climate change document.LiNeBrEaKThe old muscular language _ including key sentences about U.S. car emissions and the irrelevance of any lingering doubt _ was gone. Most of all, the new document no longer declared global warming a danger to public welfare. The move effectively postponed any strong action on climate change well into the next administration.LiNeBrEaKThis was by no means the only example of how Johnson and an anti-regulatory Bush administration undermined the federal agency charged with safeguarding human health and the environment.LiNeBrEaK"The country and the environment have been on hold for eight years," said William K. Reilly, who led the EPA under President George H.W. Bush. "The scorecard is very, very disappointing. For a long time, conservatives have said follow the science, and in the climate change decision, (EPA) did not follow the science _ it abdicated leadership and responsibility."LiNeBrEaKJohnson, whose image over four years morphed from scientist to ideologue, will leave office as one of Bush's most loyal and controversial Cabinet members. His decisions alarmed environmentalists, infuriated his own scientists and led to calls from Democrats for his resignation.LiNeBrEaKCritics include Reilly and three other Republicans who have held the top EPA post. In interviews, they said Johnson should have exercised his legal authority to stand up to Bush on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Here we see a real failure of leadership," said Russell Train, EPA administrator during the Nixon and Ford eras. "EPA has become a nonentity."LiNeBrEaKJohnson, a savvy Washington native who grew up discussing politics at the breakfast table, said the former administrators should know that EPA chiefs can rarely please everyone.LiNeBrEaK"There's always those who say you haven't gone far enough, and others who say you've gone too far," he said. "I won't accept the criticism that I didn't care about or didn't do anything to advance the environment."LiNeBrEaKBush's chief White House adviser on the environment, James L. Connaughton, said the president believes Johnson has been an excellent EPA chief.LiNeBrEaK"He was a shining star from the outset," said Connaughton. "He has done as we would have expected and hoped."LiNeBrEaKIn the beginning, expectations for Stephen Lee Johnson were high. Even a few environmentalists in 2005 welcomed his appointment as EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaKBush pitched Johnson as a technocrat, the first EPA scientist to rise to the top spot, a person who had dedicated his career to environmental protection _ not a partisan politician. But the story line was misleading.LiNeBrEaKJohnson was not plucked from obscurity on merit alone. His transition from career bureaucrat to political appointee was set in motion by a Kentucky lobbyist, with a boost from then-senior White House aide Karl Rove.LiNeBrEaKAnd Johnson did not join EPA in the late 1970s for the primary reason hundreds of his left-leaning contemporaries did. He joined EPA, he said, because he wanted to learn more about government regulation, which he found onerous.LiNeBrEaKThese touchstones _ loyalty to the president and an anti-regulatory bent _ became themes of the Johnson era at EPA.LiNeBrEaKDuring his tenure, EPA funding fell dramatically, employee morale plummeted and priorities changed.LiNeBrEaKJohnson's proposed 2009 budget was $7. 1 billion _ $1 billion less than in 2005, and 26 percent lower than in 2001. Among the biggest cuts: $500 million less for states to improve sewer systems.LiNeBrEaKThe unions representing most of EPA's 17,000 employees protested not just the cuts, but heavy-handed efforts to censor science in ways that benefited business over the environment.LiNeBrEaK"It's sad to see," said former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who resigned in 2003 as Bush's first EPA administrator after repeated clashes with the White House. "It's a good agency and there's a lot of good people there, who will help you as long as they think you want to move forward. But if they think you're not serious about protecting the environment, they'll turn on you."LiNeBrEaKPerhaps one of the best insights into Johnson's vision for EPA can be found in written testimony he submitted to a Senate committee this year. In the document, Johnson laid out his top 11 goals.LiNeBrEaKNo. 1 was clean energy, particularly approving drilling for "thousands of new oil and gas wells" on tribal and federal lands. No. 2 was homeland security.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental enforcement and sound science ranked last.LiNeBrEaK"If it wasn't so sad, it would be laughable," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who chairs the committee with EPA oversight.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, who often begins work before dawn, has faced an unusual number of important environmental decisions _ on climate change, ozone, lead, perchlorate, mercury, sulfur dioxide, tail pipe emissions and wetlands.LiNeBrEaK"He's stepped into more hard decisions than any other administrator," said George Gray, who left an industry-funded research center at Harvard University to become EPA's senior science adviser. "It's been a very, very intense time."LiNeBrEaKCritics cite some of Johnson's lesser-known decisions as evidence that he tried to overhaul EPA to benefit business, not the environment. Johnson approved pesticide testing on human subjects, lowered the monetary value of a human life by $1 million, reduced air pollution reporting requirements for corporate farms and altered a chemical risk-assessment program that has slowed analysis to a crawl.LiNeBrEaK"What strikes me is the totality of what's happened, just one thing after another," said Francesca Grifo of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "They didn't just change the rules, they tried to change the playing field."LiNeBrEaKJohnson has been hailed by environmentalists on some fronts. For example, he recently killed the Yazoo Pumps Projects, a major Mississippi Delta flood control program that threatened to destroy 67,000 acres of wetlands. He also recently issued more stringent limits on lead, which were generally praised.LiNeBrEaKDuring the Bush administration, EPA also: cut diesel emissions from construction vehicles and trains by 90 percent; managed the Energy Star program, which guides consumers to buy energy-efficient products and use them wisely; and retrofitted 40,000 school buses to reduce soot.LiNeBrEaKEPA's list of recent achievements, as supplied by the agency's press office, include launching the WaterSense Program, to help households conserve water; conducting a comprehensive ecological study of the American coastline; and being named by American University one of the "Top 10 Places to Work in the Federal Government."LiNeBrEaKJohn O'Grady, treasurer of the national council of local EPA unions, scoffed at that last award.LiNeBrEaK"For someone who presumably came from us, inside the agency, he's seen as a wolf in sheep's clothing," O'Grady said. "Steve Johnson is the worst administrator in our history."LiNeBrEaKJohnson, who peppers his speech with biblical references, said he is proud of the work he has done in the past four years, his critics notwithstanding.LiNeBrEaK"There are times when you feel like you are in the fiery furnace, but I also know that for me, personally, I answer to a much higher calling," Johnson said.LiNeBrEaKHe rarely grants in-depth interviews, and during this tumultuous year he largely has limited media interaction to brief telephone news conferences.LiNeBrEaKBut early one morning this fall, for nearly two hours, Johnson held forth from a rocking chair on the porch of the elegant, 5,700-square-foot Colonial home that he designed himself on two acres in rural Maryland, about an hour from Washington.LiNeBrEaKA government man through and through, Johnson wore a black pin-striped suit, an EPA lapel pin and EPA cuff links. In the pocket of his crisp white shirt, he had an EPA pen.LiNeBrEaKHis wife, Debbie, a homemaker, served steaming black coffee and thick crumb cakes.LiNeBrEaK"People don't really know me," he said.LiNeBrEaKHe is, he said, as misunderstood as Bush.LiNeBrEaK"The president is really a very pro-environmental person," he said. "When we first talked, he used the phrase which is precisely, philosophically, where I've always been at EPA. He said, 'Steve, I want you to accelerate the pace of environmental protection while maintaining our nation's economic competitiveness.' "LiNeBrEaKIn other words, the men agreed that the official mission of the EPA _ "to protect human health and the environment" _ should be unofficially amended to keep economic impacts in mind.LiNeBrEaK"I identify very clearly with that vision," Johnson said.LiNeBrEaKBush and Johnson also share an anti-regulatory background.LiNeBrEaKConsider the story Johnson told The Inquirer about why he joined the EPA:LiNeBrEaKIt was 1979, and he was working at a private lab, Litton Engineering Laboratories, in Washington. A mentor suggested he get a job at the EPA, learn about regulations from inside government, and then return to industry.LiNeBrEaK"Regulations were really frustrating," Johnson said, recalling his decision at age 29 to join the EPA. "I wondered if they really understood what it was like to work in a laboratory."LiNeBrEaKJohnson insists that he is no ideologue, that he makes his decisions based on law and science independent of White House political pressure.LiNeBrEaKIf that's true, said the former Republican administrators, it's been tough to see.LiNeBrEaKWilliam Ruckelshaus, who served twice as administrator, once for Richard M. Nixon and once for Ronald Reagan, said he warned Johnson to be prepared to fight anti-regulatory advocates who work in every Republican White House.LiNeBrEaK"It's very unpleasant, but if you take the job, you've got to be ready to struggle to do the right thing," Ruckelshaus said. "It's not my impression that he enjoys that."LiNeBrEaKRuckelshaus said Johnson's reversal on climate change was especially revealing. Johnson's rationale for rescinding the White House e-mail _ suggesting that a new energy law suddenly addressed part of the problem _ was weak, he said.LiNeBrEaK"That was an excuse, not a reason," he said.LiNeBrEaKWhitman said Johnson was handicapped because he did not have the political clout other administrators brought to the job.LiNeBrEaK"I think he's a very decent guy and I'd hate to see his reputation questioned because of decisions that were made by others, where he was a loyal soldier," she said.LiNeBrEaKYet the climate change episode was a classic example of how political interference can benefit industry, she said.LiNeBrEaK"You see it again and again," Whitman said. "When something doesn't get done, the people you are trying to regulate are better off."LiNeBrEaKJohnson shrugs off such criticism. He believes in the Bush agenda and, like his boss, said his resolve is fueled by deep Christian beliefs.LiNeBrEaK"My faith is the compass that centers me," he said.LiNeBrEaKIt is a faith he developed early in life. Johnson's strongest association outside the EPA is his relationship with his alma mater, Taylor University, one of the nation's oldest evangelical colleges. He met his wife at Taylor and all three of his children are graduates.LiNeBrEaK"I liked the grounding, the moral compass, that Taylor offered," he said.LiNeBrEaKTaylor is in Upland, Ind., about 75 miles northeast of Indianapolis. As one enters the main campus, a bell tower with twin spires rises into view.LiNeBrEaKOne spire stands for faith. The other for reason. They are joined at the top.LiNeBrEaK"We think that's a good symbolic representation," said Taylor president Eugene Habecker. "Reason and faith need not be mutually exclusive, and that goes to the very heart of a Taylor education. ... We are so pleased it influenced Administrator Johnson."LiNeBrEaKJohnson majored in biology. At Taylor, that includes discussion of creationism.LiNeBrEaKTaylor biology professor Timothy Burkholder, who was Johnson's adviser, said, "We would adhere to the view that God is the creator of all things and in charge of our lives, and I think Steve recognizes that and did from the beginning."LiNeBrEaKAsked about this, Johnson declined to express his views on the evolution-creation question.LiNeBrEaK"It's not a clean-cut division," the career EPA scientist said. "If you have studied at all creationism versus evolution, there's theistic or God-controlled evolution and there's variations on all those themes."LiNeBrEaKJohnson declined to elaborate _ "perhaps after Jan. 20, I'll be happy to discuss it" _ except to say that it "as a practical matter has not been an issue" at the EPA.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, the Taylor influence on Johnson remains strong. In an EPA office filled with the usual accoutrements of a Cabinet member, one of the most prominently displayed items is Johnson's honorary doctorate from his alma mater.LiNeBrEaKSusan Hazen, a longtime confidante and senior EPA official, said Johnson's faith "gives him a sense of confidence in himself."LiNeBrEaKWhen Johnson was named EPA administrator, he presented Bush with a Taylor symbol from the Gospel of John, a servant's towel given to each graduate as a reminder to serve God and country.LiNeBrEaKAnd when Johnson stood before a Senate committee for confirmation, he introduced his pastor as well as the leader of a Washington group called Christian Embassy, a ministry for political leaders.LiNeBrEaKShortly after he took office, Johnson appeared in a Christian Embassy promotional video, where he spoke of holding 6: 15 a.m. Bible study sessions in his EPA office.LiNeBrEaKIn the video, Johnson sits on a white couch with an American flag in the background. He looks into the camera and says of his government job, "I can't imagine doing this without the Lord."LiNeBrEaKPrayer remains a central element of his life, and this includes his 24/7 job as EPA administrator, he told The Inquirer.LiNeBrEaK"Whether it's Christian Embassy or my church or people that I worship with, friends in Bible studies ... there's a lot of valuable life lessons, information, guidance and direction for me that's there."LiNeBrEaK"Just knowing that there's a group of people praying for you, who know there will be times when you are Daniel in the lion's den ... strengthens you."LiNeBrEaKJohnson's rise from career scientist to EPA chief began in 2001, when he made the jump from civil service bureaucrat to political appointee.LiNeBrEaKThe official White House version is that Johnson, who was the lead career toxics official at EPA, caught the eye of senior Republicans during routine transition briefings. Connaughton, the senior Bush adviser, cited Johnson's keen intelligence and management skills.LiNeBrEaKBut Johnson also got a political boost from an old friend, Washington lobbyist Charles Grizzle, whose clients include power companies, hospitals, shopping centers and a formaldehyde industry association. Grizzle is also a longtime friend of Rove; they met in the 1970s, when Grizzle chaired the Kentucky College Republicans and Rove chaired the national College Republicans.LiNeBrEaKGrizzle and Johnson met in the early 1990s. At the time, Grizzle was EPA assistant administrator, and Johnson had just been selected for a senior career executive mentorship program. Grizzle became Johnson's informal mentor.LiNeBrEaK"Steve and I became friends and kept in touch after I left EPA," Grizzle recalled. "After the 2000 election, I called Karl and suggested that he should take a look at Steve."LiNeBrEaKWithin weeks of the call, Bush named Johnson to the political post Grizzle had suggested _ assistant administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances.LiNeBrEaKCompared with other political appointees, many still learning their way around the cavernous EPA building, Johnson excelled. He made fast friends with Bush officials and connected with the EPA career staff.LiNeBrEaK"There were no surprises with Steve," said a former EPA political appointee. "He cuts an impressive figure and knows how to impress superiors. Steve has that down cold."LiNeBrEaKBut several other people who have worked closely with him say that too often politics trumped science. Former aides say the veteran scientist Johnson became subsumed by the rookie politician Johnson.LiNeBrEaKFour former Republican appointees said Johnson became so enamored by the perks of the job _ trips to Camp David, flights on Air Force One, fireworks on the White House portico _ that it affected his judgment, making him less likely to confront the White House.LiNeBrEaK"Here's a guy who labored in the bureaucracy for 25 years, then becomes assistant administrator, deputy and then administrator, and all of a sudden he's being invited to spend the weekend at Camp David," said one senior Republican appointee. "I think it really did turn his head."LiNeBrEaKJohnson dismissed such talk. The perks, he said, come with a tough job.LiNeBrEaK"It's all part of the wow factor," he said. "While those are fun and exciting events _ pinch-yourself type of events _ the reality is that you've been asked to make very difficult decisions and are part of a team, a Cabinet member ... ."LiNeBrEaKClearly, Johnson has been eager to execute the Bush agenda. John D. Graham, who was the regulatory guru of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2001 to 2006, said one of Johnson's biggest accomplishments as assistant administrator was the repeal of a Clinton-era ban on human pesticide testing.LiNeBrEaK"Johnson faced a dilemma," said Graham, now dean of the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs.LiNeBrEaKThe human testing studies were not perfect; some did not meet modern ethical standards, Graham said. But advocates were pushing for a ban regardless of their scientific value.LiNeBrEaKJohnson fixed that. He played a key role in reversing the ban, Graham said, fulfilling a goal shared by Bush and the pesticide industry.LiNeBrEaK"The White House loved Steve because he was the ultimate staffer," said another Republican colleague who worked at EPA. "He knew how to get things done."LiNeBrEaKWhen Whitman abruptly resigned in 2003, Johnson filled a void in the No. 2 slot _ as acting deputy administrator _ then remained when former Utah governor Michael Leavitt was named administrator. In 2005, when Leavitt got the job he really wanted _ secretary of health and human services _ Johnson became acting administrator. He lobbied for the top job, competing with three others.LiNeBrEaKHazen said she warned her friend that the second Bush term would be fraught with complicated, nuanced decisions, and was destined to be controversial.LiNeBrEaK"My question to him was: Do you really want this? You've had a phenomenal career. You are well-respected. Do you really want to be the one making these hard decisions, charting new territory?"LiNeBrEaKJohnson's success at restoring human testing while assistant administrator nearly derailed his Senate confirmation for the top job.LiNeBrEaKOne of the new human tests was the Children's Health Environmental Exposure Research Study (CHEERS). Funded with $2 million from the chemical industry, CHEERS proposed to record the effects of household pesticides on low-income children in Florida. EPA gave participating families $970, a video camera to record exposure and a CHEERS T-shirt, calendar and baby bib. EPA scientists would collect urine samples and the children would wear a watch-size sensor one week each month.LiNeBrEaKSeveral Democrats were aghast. Boxer and other Democrats put a public hold on his nomination.LiNeBrEaK"Ethics 101: Testing pesticides on small children and infants is wrong," Boxer said. "This is sick. It's a sick, sick thing."LiNeBrEaKEPA officials said the senators were overreacting, that CHEERS merely paid families already using pesticides to monitor their children. Johnson, who began his EPA career in the pesticide office, said that although EPA had no improper ethical intent, it could no longer overcome such an appearance.LiNeBrEaKHe canceled CHEERS _ though not other human testing programs _ and the senators removed the hold on his confirmation.LiNeBrEaKAsked if he killed CHEERS because of the Senate hold _ if he made a political decision instead of a scientific one _ Johnson replied, "That is an unfortunate characterization."LiNeBrEaKThe timing, Johnson said, was just a coincidence.LiNeBrEaKBoxer, when told of Johnson's recollection of events, fumed:LiNeBrEaK"He's lying."LiNeBrEaKLeaders of national environmental groups never expected a Bush-run EPA to be eco-friendly, but several welcomed Johnson's appointment.LiNeBrEaKAs a career scientist who had worked at EPA for a quarter-century, they figured he would act reasonably.LiNeBrEaK"I made a mistake," said Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope. "What surprises me is that the Bush second term is worse than the first."LiNeBrEaKKen Cook, who leads the Environmental Working Group, which advocates for stronger pesticide regulation, said he also feels betrayed.LiNeBrEaK"The day he was named administrator, Steve called to tell me he was excited and looking forward to working with me," said Cook, who was quoted in newspapers praising Johnson's appointment.LiNeBrEaK"That's the last time we ever spoke," Cook said. "It proved impossible for me to get a meeting with him."LiNeBrEaKJeff Ruch, who runs the advocacy group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said EPA staff hoped that Johnson, a career employee following a string of politicians, would usher in a new era of candor and respect.LiNeBrEaK"That just didn't happen," Ruch said, "If anything, he appeared less able to protect the agency from political interference."LiNeBrEaKFrustrated, several environmental groups began to simply sidestep EPA. They said they found corporate executives more receptive.LiNeBrEaK"After banging our heads into walls repeatedly," said Jacqueline Savitz of the advocacy group Oceana, "we figured out that we had a better chance of convincing private corporations to do the right thing than we did convincing EPA."LiNeBrEaKWhen, for example, the EPA refused to regulate waste water pollution from cruise ships, Oceana and other environmental groups approached Royal Caribbean Cruises directly. To date, Royal Caribbean has spent more than $100 million to retrofit its fleet, said senior executive Jamie Sweeting.LiNeBrEaK"We decided to look at this from a science perspective _ what the marine biologists told us _ rather than from a political perspective," he said. "In the end, we wanted to get out ahead of the problem and do the right thing."LiNeBrEaKWhile Johnson's tenure has been filled with controversial decisions, two flash points erupted back to back in December 2007.LiNeBrEaKFirst came the climate change e-mail incident on Dec. 5.LiNeBrEaKThen, about two weeks later, came Johnson's big decision on the so-called California waiver _ a request by 19 states for permission to enact stricter tail pipe emission standards.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia sought to reduce car emissions 30 percent by the 2016 model year. In 40 years, EPA had never denied a waiver request from California, but now the auto and oil industries were lobbying the Bush administration to reject it.LiNeBrEaKAn energy bill that included a new but weaker national standard was moving through Congress, and industry lobbyists argued that one national tail pipe standard was better than two.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA career scientists countered that California, given its pollution problems, both natural and man-made, was legally qualified to receive the waiver. In a series of PowerPoint presentations, staff scientists, economists, engineers and lawyers warned Johnson that if the waiver were denied, California was "almost certain" to sue and EPA would be "likely to lose."LiNeBrEaKSenior EPA scientists appealed to Reilly, the former administrator, to lobby Johnson and prepared for him talking points: "You have to find a way to get this done," the talking points read. "If you cannot, you will face a pretty big personal decision about whether you are able to stay in the job ... ."LiNeBrEaKReilly didn't use the talking points, but he did try to persuade Johnson that it was a states-rights issue, and also one of oil independence.LiNeBrEaK"The argument I received was that Detroit was up against its back to make these changes, but my answer was, 'You have enough time, until 2016, so why not let California drive the system?' " Reilly said. "I don't understand what's wrong with that analysis."LiNeBrEaKAs is his style, Johnson listened to staff presentations and repeatedly asked everyone in the room for an opinion. According to sworn statements by seven EPA participants, no one at EPA advised Johnson to deny California's request. Hand-written notes by meeting attendees supported this view, congressional investigators said.LiNeBrEaK"All agreed on granting waiver," scribbled one EPA official.LiNeBrEaKWhen Johnson traveled to the White House in early December, aides said they assumed it was to explain EPA's rationale.LiNeBrEaK"He went over there with our talking points about granting the waiver," said Burnett, the former deputy associate administrator who contributed $86,000 to Democratic candidates, "and when he came back from the meeting, he said he had been reminded of the president's policy preferences."LiNeBrEaKJohnson rejected California's request, he said, because greenhouse gases contribute to a global and national problem, not one limited to individual states.LiNeBrEaKEPA had not planned to release the decision immediately, but on Dec. 19 _ the same day Bush signed the new energy law that created a national fuel standard _ several reporters got wind of the decision.LiNeBrEaKJohnson rushed forth an announcement, tying the new energy law to the waiver.LiNeBrEaKThe hurried nature surprised EPA scientists and environmentalists, and drew the ire of two Californians who chair committees that oversee the EPA. They called the decision cowardly. Once again, they said, Johnson had caved to the White House.LiNeBrEaKThe White House called the decision brave.LiNeBrEaK"It was a classic example of Steve making a decision on the merits for the good of the environment and for the good of the economy _ classic," said Connaughton, the senior White House adviser. "Denying the waiver had no environmental consequence, and ... approving it would have caused massive economic disruption."LiNeBrEaKWhitman, who resigned from EPA in 2003 over a similar battle with the White House, said, "I think that argument is a little hollow."LiNeBrEaKIn interviews and his congressional appearances that followed, Johnson declined to directly talk about White House involvement. He said again and again, "It was my decision and mine alone."LiNeBrEaKCritics didn't believe him.LiNeBrEaKCiting e-mails and testimony of others, some Senate Democrats said Johnson's testimony that he acted alone was suspicious _ so suspicious they asked the FBI to investigate him for perjury.LiNeBrEaKFor Johnson, the California waiver decision marked the beginning of what would be a very rough year: The courts declared the pillars of his air pollution agenda illegal. The Union of Concerned Scientists issued a report documenting hundreds of instances of political interference with scientific work at EPA. Critics howled when he issued a more stringent ozone standard that fell short of the advice he received from his own science advisory panel.LiNeBrEaKExasperated, four Democrats called for Johnson's resignation.LiNeBrEaK"There are real human consequences whenever Administrator Johnson takes a dive," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.LiNeBrEaKOn the Senate floor, he said: "We have seen EPA's clear mission darkened by the shadowy handiwork of the Bush White House _ trampling on science, ignoring the facts, flouting the law, defying Congress and the courts, while kneeling before industry polluters, and all for rank and venal purposes."LiNeBrEaKBy late summer, congressional hearings took on such a prosecutorial tone that Johnson simply stopped showing up. At a final Senate oversight hearing in September, he refused to send anyone at all from the EPA.LiNeBrEaK"I wonder if he's still glad he took the job," mused Ruckelshaus.LiNeBrEaKJohnson said he is.LiNeBrEaKBut he bristled at the specter of being the subject of an FBI investigation. When asked about it, his eyes narrowed. He said hardball politics don't bother him, but the personal attacks are unfair.LiNeBrEaKHe isn't worried about the investigation, he said, because his testimony to Congress was accurate.LiNeBrEaK"I'm an experienced bureaucrat _ very experienced bureaucrat _ and I spend many hours practicing for hearings, and also have an outstanding command of the facts and figures," he said. "This too shall pass."LiNeBrEaKBut six months ago, he nearly resigned.LiNeBrEaK"Things were really wacky," said Gray, the assistant administrator for research. "It's a very difficult thing when people disagree with a science policy issue; they personalize it. Instead of being a disagreement about whether people are more like mice or rats, it's a question of: Is Steve Johnson a good person?"LiNeBrEaKSaid Hazen, his longtime friend: "You can tell when someone is sagging under the weight of this."LiNeBrEaKJohnson said Bush told him to hang in there. The EPA administrator prayed about it, and one day, while riding to work in the SUV driven by his security detail, he found himself reading a book of inspirational quotes by Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had said:LiNeBrEaK"I don't boast of being in God's will, I humbly pray that I am in his will."LiNeBrEaKJohnson took it as a sign that he should not resign.LiNeBrEaK"It was a providential reading," he said, "not an accident."LiNeBrEaKJohnson decided to stay on the job, in part, to see through the revised climate change findings.LiNeBrEaKIndeed, in July, to great fanfare, Johnson posted his new global warming document on EPA's Web site and published it in the Federal Register.LiNeBrEaKIt ran roughly 1,000 pages long, but it was far weaker than the one he had originally e-mailed to the White House in December 2007.LiNeBrEaKThe original document remains confidential _ EPA has allowed four U.S. senators to read it under closely guarded conditions _ but a draft was reviewed by The Inquirer. A comparison shows that the weakened public version Johnson released in July no longer contained his critical personal backing on several scientific findings, which would have made them official policy of the EPA.LiNeBrEaKMost of all, the revised document did not include Johnson's original declaration that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare.LiNeBrEaKJohnson instead echoed the White House's wishes and called for more study on global warming, delaying any dramatic government action until the next administration took office.LiNeBrEaKJohnson is known for his even temper, and his ability to keep cool under pressure, to stick to carefully rehearsed talking points. But in a second interview, when pressed about his about-face on the climate change, he grew exasperated.LiNeBrEaK"Look, I know there is a pent-up desire in the environmental community, whether it's former administrators or environmental advocates, to begin regulating greenhouse gases now," he said. "What I'm trying to do is provide some rationality to the debate based on the best available science ... that keeps in mind the economic consequences as well as energy security."LiNeBrEaKBut almost every person who has held Johnson's job says the science makes the next step clear, and that the revised climate change document represented an embarrassing whitewash.LiNeBrEaK"The difference between my time and now is that we had computer models," said Reilly, administrator from 1989 to 1993. "Now they have observations in Greenland and the Arctic and Alaska. We know this is upon us. It becomes increasingly indefensible not to act."LiNeBrEaKLee Thomas, EPA chief during Reagan's second term, said the United States has a responsibility to lead the world on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"If we don't do it, then who will?"

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	Program to reward environmentally conscious companies an EPA charade  	By John Sullivan and John Shiffman, The Philadelphia Inquirer  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	4638 words  	CHARLESTON, Tenn. _ In January 2005, residents near the chlorine plant here discovered that it was the biggest mercury emitter in the state. Environmentalists warned them against eating fish from their beloved Hiwassee River.LiNeBrEaKThey appealed to the plant's owners, Olin Corp., to do what 100 other chlorine producers had done: abandon a 19th-century process that emits tons of the dangerous neurotoxin. Olin refused.LiNeBrEaKIn fall 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency weighed in _ but not to take up the cause of residents.LiNeBrEaKInstead, EPA called Olin with an offer. Would the Charleston plant like to be enrolled in Performance Track, an elite green club of the nation's most environmentally progressive companies? LiNeBrEaKIn return, Olin could expect regulatory breaks, such as fewer inspections and loosened requirements on hazardous waste disposal, not to mention positive publicity.LiNeBrEaKSherry Neidich, who has lived half her life a mile downriver from Olin's plant, was stunned.LiNeBrEaK"The EPA is a toothless dog," she said. "What right does someone have to ruin my river? To poison our playground?"LiNeBrEaKHer children grew up fishing and swimming in the river's placid water, but her grandchildren, who live next door, aren't allowed near it. In fact, they'll be moving, to avoid further exposure.LiNeBrEaK"I love having them here, but I don't think it's safe," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration holds up Performance Track as a bold new approach that moves the EPA beyond its traditional role as enforcer of environmental laws. The new EPA collaborates with industry to encourage cutting-edge environmentally sensitive practices.LiNeBrEaKIt is precisely this voluntary approach that Bush's top environmental officials say is part of their plan to fight global warming _ to encourage companies to reduce greenhouse gases, rather than forcing them to do so.LiNeBrEaKBut a Philadelphia Inquirer investigation shows that what was conceived as an innovative stewardship program has become little more than smoke and mirrors. Performance Track offers a stark example of how the White House's pro-business ethic weakened the agency and slowed environmental progress.LiNeBrEaKAmong The Inquirer's findings:LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has recruited companies with mixed _ even dismal _ environmental records to become Performance Track members.LiNeBrEaKDespite offering members regulatory breaks and promoting the program as one that improves environmental performance, the EPA fails to independently verify that Performance Track companies actually reach their goals.LiNeBrEaKSome Performance Track members have paid fines to settle EPA accusations that they broke environmental rules. Since 2003, they have racked up more than 100 violations and paid $15. 25 million in fines _ including $10. 25 million paid by DuPont Co. for allegedly failing to provide information to the EPA about the health effects of a pollutant one of its plants spilled into drinking water.LiNeBrEaKAt least a dozen Performance Track members have actually increased the amount of toxic chemicals they pump into the air and water.LiNeBrEaKThe program has spent millions on publicity, but has become so desperate for new members that it has turned to gift shops and post offices with trivial environmental impact to pad its numbers.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA insists that the program _ which now numbers 548 members ranging from Fortune 500 companies to trailer parks _ is a success. The 42 newest members, inducted this fall, include a Maker's Mark distillery, a veterans center, two municipal incinerators and a Philip Morris cigarette plant.LiNeBrEaKSince 2001, the EPA said, Performance Track members report that they have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 310,000 tons, saved 3. 7 billion gallons of water and cut non-hazardous waste equivalent to that generated by 553,000 households.LiNeBrEaKXerox Corp., recently elevated to the most elite Performance Track status, has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2012.LiNeBrEaK"Performance Track was a good fit with what we were already doing and created an opportunity to network with other companies," said Xerox executive Catherine Reeves. "Performance Track pushed us to do more _ stretched us to think about setting goals three years into the future instead of one."LiNeBrEaKStephen L. Johnson, EPA chief since 2005, said the program encourages companies to brand themselves as environmentally conscious.LiNeBrEaK"I view that as an essential component of the EPA toolbox, now and for the future," Johnson said. "Who wouldn't want to encourage that?"LiNeBrEaKSkeptics say that there's no proof that Performance Track works, and that the EPA should not be praising industries that it is required by law to police.LiNeBrEaK"It's a clear pattern of corporate coziness, deficient accountability and disregard for the public good," said John Walke, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The EPA should get back to the business of enforcing clean water and air protections rather than spending precious time and money on PR for polluters."LiNeBrEaKThe EPA insists that enforcement has not slipped during the Bush administration. The agency measures its success by calculating total "commitments," including consent agreements. EPA said commitments since 2005 exceeded $45 billion, a figure it called a record sum.LiNeBrEaKBut by at least one more traditional statistical measure _ fines _ enforcement is down. Government Accountability Office figures show that overall, enforcement fines against polluters have declined from their peak of $292 million in 1999 to just $137 million in 2007.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, a Harvard-University of Pennsylvania study commissioned by the EPA found that companies involved in voluntary programs were no more likely to follow environmental regulations than others.LiNeBrEaK"One would think from the name _ Performance Track _ it would be attracting the best environmentally performing companies, and that can't be demonstrated," said the study's co-author, Cary Coglianese, associate dean of the Penn Law School and a leading expert on Performance Track.LiNeBrEaK"It's not something EPA should be claiming."LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track was created in late 2000, during the waning days of the Clinton administration, as a way to reward green companies and encourage them to do more than merely follow the rules.LiNeBrEaKCorporate applicants choose four environmental goals _ such as energy or waste reduction _ and must also promote "environmental stewardship" to the local community.LiNeBrEaKApplicants must not have had any pollution-related criminal convictions or pending civil suits for the last five years. They also must be in compliance with any court settlement and have had no more than two significant violations in the previous three years.LiNeBrEaKIn theory, a company under fire for its environmental policy should not be a candidate for Performance Track, much less a member.LiNeBrEaKBut records obtained by The Inquirer show that the EPA recruited Olin in 2005, several months after local residents began to complain about the mercury pollution.LiNeBrEaKOlin's plant in Charleston has not broken any laws or been cited for mercury-related violations since 2003. But the chlorine factory, roughly halfway between Chattanooga and Knoxville on the banks of the Hiwassee, is Tennessee's largest emitter of mercury.LiNeBrEaKLast year, state officials declared the Hiwassee "impaired." The state posted warnings, saying that eating some fish found there could increase the risk of serious illness in humans. It also warned that children, pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid the fish, since mercury can impair cognitive development in children.LiNeBrEaKState tests show levels of mercury in the largemouth bass are 25 percent above the EPA limit, and air tests by environmental groups put mercury concentrations six times above EPA guidelines.LiNeBrEaK"The closer you get to the plant, the higher the levels of the mercury," said Suzanne Wisdom, who lives near the plant and works for the environmental group Oceana, which organizes protests against Olin.LiNeBrEaKBeyond chlorine's well-known use as a disinfectant, it is also a key ingredient for hundreds of products _ from plastic to bulletproof vests to pharmaceuticals and vinyl.LiNeBrEaKThe Olin plant in Tennessee is one of a handful in the nation still yoked to the century-old method that uses mercury to make chlorine and alkali.LiNeBrEaKThese older plants use tons of mercury. In 2003, chlorine plants bought about 450,000 pounds of it. In 2006, as the number of chlor-alkali plants declined, mercury purchases fell to 58,000 pounds.LiNeBrEaKThey also lose tons of the hazardous element each year. The industry and the EPA say the element never reaches the environment because it disappears in plant equipment.LiNeBrEaKStill, when these plants were more common, the EPA studied them and said the average plant could not account for tons of mercury each year. In 2003, the EPA said in a public notice: "The fate of all the mercury consumed at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants remains somewhat of an enigma."LiNeBrEaKOlin is a major benefactor and employer in Charleston and in Cleveland, the county seat. Gary Farlow, who runs the local chamber of commerce, said Olin is well-respected in the community. "They're a very good corporate citizen," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn the area this spring, however, four local brothers circulated a petition at their public high school supporting a bill sponsored by then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama. Noting that chlorine producers could not account for more than 130 tons of mercury between 2000 and 2004, Obama unsuccessfully sought to ban mercury use in chlorine plants by 2012.LiNeBrEaK"The Senate bill might eventually pass, but it'll be too late to prevent a lot of damage," said Dillon Yost, 16, who pushed the petition along with his brothers, Grant, 14, and twins Ross and Mason, 18.LiNeBrEaKLeonard Scott, Olin's director of manufacturing technology, said converting the Tennessee plant to mercury-free technology would cost "hundreds of millions of dollars" and threaten nearly 1,000 jobs.LiNeBrEaKBefore joining Performance Track, Scott said, Olin spent $2. 6 million to upgrade its emissions equipment, including roughly $1 million on state-of-the-art mercury monitors. Since December 2006, he said, this has reduced mercury emissions by 63 percent _ down from around 1,084 pounds per year.LiNeBrEaK"Mercury is a very important issue to us," Scott said. "We live here, too."LiNeBrEaKOlin spokeswoman Elaine Patterson said, "The plant's use of mercury is always careful and controlled. ... Because of the hard work of the people in our Charleston plant, we continue to meet the established requirements for Performance Track."LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, the plant says it emits 420 pounds of mercury into the air and water per year. That's below the EPA's threshold _ a special limit created for the few plants that still use mercury. By that standard, Olin has been in compliance on mercury for the past five years.LiNeBrEaKBut Olin has been cited for other environmental violations. Since 2006, the year it joined Performance Track, Olin has been cited for two "significant violations," according to the EPA, although Olin has disputed one. Performance Track members who get three such violations are supposed to be expelled from the program.LiNeBrEaKWhen asked why Olin was invited into Performance Track given its track record in Charleston, its outdated technology, and its impact on the Hiwassee, EPA officials said the plant met its criteria.LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track's national manager, Daniel Fiorino, said few industrial factories had perfect EPA compliance records. He said Olin's record on mercury emissions was irrelevant to its continued membership in the program.LiNeBrEaK"When you look at our requirements and what they are doing, they meet our criteria," Fiorino said. "Does that make them a green company? That's a larger issue, I think. ... At some point, we would hope that they would move to the new technology."LiNeBrEaKJackie Savitz, a senior director at Oceana, which alerted Olin's neighbors about the mercury pollution, said it was troubling that the EPA ducked an opportunity to help a major polluter clean up its act.LiNeBrEaK"If these are the leaders, I'd hate to see the laggards," she said.LiNeBrEaKIn EPA's drive to boost its Performance Track membership, it's learned not to be too picky.LiNeBrEaKTo that end, Performance Track decided early on to make membership available to subsidiaries and individual facilities as opposed to simply parent corporations.LiNeBrEaKThe result: A company could have some of its facilities regarded as "environmental leaders" in Performance Track while its other facilities were accused of breaking environmental laws. For example:LiNeBrEaKMonsanto Corp. won an award from Performance Track for wildlife conservation in 2005, the same year the company accepted responsibility for employees' paying a $50,000 bribe in Indonesia to skirt environmental laws, according to the Department of Justice. When Monsanto tried to win Performance Track status for its world headquarters, records show, federal prosecutors strongly objected.LiNeBrEaKPfizer, which has nine plants in Performance Track, paid a $975,000 fine in June for allowing hazardous chemicals to leak into the air at its former factory in Groton, Conn.LiNeBrEaKIn July, Bristol-Myers Squibb, with two factories in Performance Track, agreed as part of a settlement with EPA to spend $3. 65 million to repair units that leaked ozone-depleting compounds into the air.LiNeBrEaKGiving companies with mixed records Performance Track recognition is troubling, said Penn's Coglianese, because the marketing value of being recognized as a green company is the main reason most companies join.LiNeBrEaK"There's no way for EPA to demarcate the public relations payoff on a facility-by-facility basis," Coglianese said, "and there's nothing to stop corporations from trumpeting one facility in Performance Track notwithstanding others that may well be laggards."LiNeBrEaKThe EPA administrator disagrees. Corporations are like families, Johnson says, and should be treated as such.LiNeBrEaK"Say you have two boys: One of your boys does an outstanding job and the other boy messes up. Is your family a problem? Or is your one son a problem?LiNeBrEaK"The critics would say, 'Wait a minute, that's just marketing,' because the impression is that they've got all their facilities in Performance Track," Johnson says. "What's the alternative? Do nothing? No. We need to be encouraging companies to do the right thing, and make sure that there is accountability."LiNeBrEaKThough Performance Track is but a small part of the EPA budget, it represents a big part of the agency's current strategy _ particularly with climate change. The program was among the first to embody this underlying philosophy: coax companies _ rather than coerce them _ to engage in green business practices.LiNeBrEaKBut from the start, the program has had its failings.LiNeBrEaKA month before George W. Bush became president, Performance Track welcomed 228 charter members. Almost everyone who applied was accepted, including some companies with questionable environmental records, such as U.S. Steel, near Pittsburgh. It was one of 82 companies asked to withdraw for failing to live up to the promise of the program, including 15 for repeated pollution violations.LiNeBrEaKThe program caught the attention of Rick Otis, a former American Plastics Council lobbyist and manager of the Bush 2001 transition team for the EPA. Otis, now an EPA deputy associate administrator, made Performance Track a priority.LiNeBrEaK"It was a recognition that this is no longer an experiment," he said.LiNeBrEaKSince then, Performance Track has more than doubled its membership to 548. The office has grown from five to 18 employees _ plus consultants _ and from an annual budget of $910,000 to $4,700,000.LiNeBrEaKAs early as 2005, internal records show, EPA enforcement officials discovered violations by Performance Track companies, and began to ask questions about compliance and corporate promises.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, these EPA enforcement officials prepared a confidential and comprehensive analysis of the program. The Inquirer obtained a copy.LiNeBrEaK"The data in this analysis clearly show that there is considerable non-compliance among (Performance Track) facilities and that many members who are widely touted as meeting or exceeding regulatory requirements actually do not," the analysis said.LiNeBrEaKAt the time, a check of enforcement records showed six Performance Track companies with serious environmental violations and 43 with other pending formal enforcement actions.LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track officials complained that the enforcement division's analysis was faulty because it was based on an EPA database riddled with errors. That database uses the same data EPA posts for public use on its Web site (www.epa.gov/echo).LiNeBrEaKEnforcement officials acknowledged errors but noted that the problem with bad data worked both ways _ the database wrongly identified at least 28 companies as Performance Track members, theoretically entitling them to lower inspection rates. Incredibly, one enforcement official noted in an e-mail, this included the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington state, made famous by the 1983 movie "Silkwood." Fiorino said this was a misunderstanding.LiNeBrEaKLast year, an EPA inspector general's audit confirmed some of the enforcement division's findings. "EPA had hoped to achieve ambitious goals through Performance Track, but EPA cannot show how its program can lead to the desired outcomes," auditors wrote.LiNeBrEaKOnly two of the 30 companies sampled by the inspector general met all four of the anti-pollution goals they set.LiNeBrEaKCoglianese's extensive research, some of it EPA-funded, said the EPA's claims that Performance Track is beneficial to the environment are simply rhetoric. There are no data to prove this, the Penn dean said.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, said Coglianese, data show that there's little difference between the environmental records of companies that join and companies that don't.LiNeBrEaKThe difference: "Companies who join Performance Track seem to do so because they seek attention," he said. They want that green EPA seal of approval.LiNeBrEaKJames Wilkins, environmental and safety manager at the Marathon Petroleum L.L.C. refinery near New Orleans, said that seal of approval was more important to his workers than for executives seeking regulatory benefits or good publicity.LiNeBrEaK"You get validation," said Wilkins, whose company joined Performance Track in 2002, a year after signing a consent decree with the Justice Department over air pollution.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Marathon received what EPA cited as one of the best benefits ever conferred on a Performance Track member: Louisiana expedited permits for a 70 percent plant expansion that will make the Marathon refinery the fourth largest in the nation.LiNeBrEaKWilkins downplayed the benefit. He said that while Marathon's application was moved to the top of the pile, this probably only saved a month on a yearlong process.LiNeBrEaKAnother critic, the advocacy group Environmental Integrity Project, studied Performance Track members' public toxic release reports. It found that seven large factories increased emissions after they joined the program _ by a total of 2 million pounds between 2000 and 2004.LiNeBrEaKEPA officials said the study contained errors _ though they have since decided to review such data to prevent this from happening again, they say.LiNeBrEaKBut an Inquirer review shows that some of the same Performance Track companies that Environmental Integrity raised questions about two years ago continue to increase toxic emissions. According to EPA's latest Toxic Release Inventory data, emissions at the Verso Paper factory in Jay, Maine, have increased 160 percent since 2001, to 1. 9 million pounds.LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track relies on states, which enforce most federal environmental laws, to ease regulatory oversight of its members. At least 19 states partner with the program, but others remain wary _ including Lisa Jackson, New Jersey's former Department of Environmental Protection chief and now chief of staff to Gov. Jon Corzine.LiNeBrEaK"For a long time, they tried to pressure us to partner and we said no," Jackson said in October, before she became an Obama transition adviser. "I think it's just one of those window-dressing programs that has little value."LiNeBrEaKFrancine Carlini, regional director for air quality in Southeastern Pennsylvania, said EPA had asked the state to dispense with some of its usual regulatory duties.LiNeBrEaK"It all sounds good ... but you can't give away the store to get that done," she said. "Imagine if we went to a landfill and they said, 'We're in Performance Track,' and we said we wouldn't inspect them. There is kind of a disconnect here. That's the problem."LiNeBrEaKBut Sharon Baxter, who runs Virginia's Environmental Excellence Program, which complements Performance Track, thinks it works well.LiNeBrEaK"Having that plaque on the wall is a huge motivator for management," Baxter said.LiNeBrEaKOne quality that Performance Track demonstrates consistently is loyalty to its members.LiNeBrEaKEven after companies are accused of violating environmental rules and pay huge fines, Performance Track is reluctant to kick them out.LiNeBrEaKConsider what happened when the program discovered that a member facility in Newark, Del., was under investigation for allegedly keeping important health information from the public.LiNeBrEaKThe Performance Track member was DuPont's Stine Haskell Research Center, which had been lauded by the EPA in 2004 and 2005 for, among other things, recycling mercury from the lab's lightbulbs.LiNeBrEaKDuring those same years, EPA's enforcement arm was pursuing the lab for withholding information about a likely carcinogen _ perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA _ used to make Teflon and other nonstick plastics.LiNeBrEaKDuPont began studying PFOA in the 1960s and by the 1980s suspected it was toxic to humans, according to the EPA.LiNeBrEaKIn 1984 the company realized that the chemical was turning up in the drinking water of nearly 50,000 people living near its Washington Works in West Virginia. By 1991, DuPont discovered that PFOA levels in the water there surpassed its own safety guidelines. The chemical was also accumulating in the bodies of DuPont workers.LiNeBrEaKToday, PFOA is found in the blood of almost all Americans, though no one is sure how it gets there, or how much is harmful.LiNeBrEaKIn 1997, the EPA asked the chemical giant for information on PFOA. The company did not provide any, though the Toxic Substances Control Act required it to do so.LiNeBrEaKJoe Kiger, an elementary school teacher who lives in Parkersburg, W.Va., said he received a letter in 2000 from his local water district explaining that there was PFOA in the water, but at a safe level.LiNeBrEaKThat made Kiger wonder.LiNeBrEaK"What's this chemical?" Kiger recalled thinking. "What's it doing in my water?"LiNeBrEaKHe says he called the EPA in Philadelphia and was advised to get an attorney.LiNeBrEaKThe following year, he sued DuPont, along with a group of citizens. They later uncovered documents showing the company had been concerned about PFOA since 1981.LiNeBrEaKIn July 2004, the EPA announced a formal enforcement action against DuPont, alleging the lab withheld information about the substantial risk of injury to human health or the environment.LiNeBrEaKA year later, DuPont paid a $10. 25 million fine, the largest civil penalty in EPA history at the time, and agreed to spend $6. 25 million on environmental projects. The company also paid a $107 million settlement to residents in West Virginia and Ohio for polluting their drinking water.LiNeBrEaKYet for more than a year, the DuPont lab remained in Performance Track. It was not until 2007 that the EPA asked the DuPont lab not to reapply to its program.LiNeBrEaKFive other DuPont facilities remain in Performance Track, including one that uses PFOAs.LiNeBrEaKIn settling the case, DuPont did not admit any liability. In a statement to The Inquirer, Mark Hause, DuPont's global environmental competency leader, said the company differed with the EPA on the interpretation of the reporting requirement. DuPont said it chose to withdraw its renewal application.LiNeBrEaK"In the letter acknowledging our withdrawal, EPA recognized that (Stine Haskell Research Center) is an environmental leader, and was an asset to the program," said Hause.LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track officials also praised DuPont in an interview with The Inquirer.LiNeBrEaK"If you compared a lot of those companies that are members of Performance Track to the general rating of chemical companies, you would find DuPont is considered to be an environmental leader," Fiorino said.LiNeBrEaKThe latest available EPA data show that the company, which had pledged to cut hazardous emissions, saw its total toxic chemical release by Performance Track plants rise 15 percent, to nearly a half-million pounds.LiNeBrEaKWhile the EPA has expended little effort to verify that Performance Track members keep their promises, it has spent millions marketing their achievements and trying to woo recruits.LiNeBrEaKThe program, funded with tax dollars, writes news releases for companies, heralds them on government Web sites, and plants positive stories in trade publications.LiNeBrEaKNo act of enthusiasm is considered too small. Lockheed Martin, the multibillion-dollar defense contractor, is praised on the Performance Track's Web site for proudly showing "its commitment to environmental excellence by flying the Performance Track flag over its Manassas, Va., facility."LiNeBrEaKOver the last four years, Performance Track has paid two outside consulting firms more than $4. 2 million.LiNeBrEaKLast year alone, records show, EPA paid ICF Consulting of Fairfax, Va., nearly $700,000, including $249,875 for member recruitment and $311,287 for "branding, outreach and communications."LiNeBrEaKThe other consultant, Industrial Economics Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., has received $2. 7 million to help run the program and operate its hot line, records show. Spokesmen for ICF and Industrial Economics declined to comment for this story.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, EPA placed public service announcements touting its corporate members' accomplishments in Forbes, Fortune and Business Week.LiNeBrEaKOne full-page ad claimed that Performance Track members cut water use by 3. 5 billion gallons: "That's a big drop in the bucket," the ad said.LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track helps companies look good in other ways too. In 2006, it arranged for several governors to write letters to member companies praising them for joining Performance Track.LiNeBrEaKDespite these efforts, recruitment has been slow. Records show that Performance Track has resorted to recruiting small fish _ companies that don't pollute much in the first place or members that aren't companies at all.LiNeBrEaKThese include the gift shop/cafeteria at the Statue of Liberty, three dozen post office facilities and even the EPA regional office on Arch Street in Philadelphia.LiNeBrEaKIn a November 2006 internal e-mail, one EPA staffer noted the potential of partnering with a quasi-government agency.LiNeBrEaK"Sure will up the numbers for Performance Track!!"LiNeBrEaKPerformance Track employees have struggled to come up with success stories, records show. In 2006, when a staffer went looking for examples of environmental good deeds, she came up short.LiNeBrEaK"Pickings were slim," she reported to a colleague in an internal e-mail. "I won't be able to come up with other examples ... because most companies do not provide very good information on HOW they accomplished their achievements."LiNeBrEaKIn fact, environmental gains achieved by Performance Track members are, in many cases, underwhelming.LiNeBrEaKA new Performance Track member, Rio Grande Village Store and RV Park in Texas, announced that its goal would be "turning off all equipment when not being used, computers on power saving mode ... ."LiNeBrEaKAnd in Fife, Wash., the postal distribution facility said that among its environmental "goals," it would recycle plastic _ and undeliverable bulk mail.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	Politics choke clean-air efforts  	By John Sullivan, Tom Avril and John Shiffman, The Philadelphia Inquirer  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	4725 words  	PHILADELPHIA _ Death came to Donora, a small steel town in western Pennsylvania, in the form of a black fog.LiNeBrEaKTrapped by unusual weather conditions in October 1948, a blanket of smokestack pollution killed 20 people and sickened thousands. Overwhelmed doctors scurried to fashion oxygen tents out of spare bedsheets. The mix of deadly pollutants was so thick that when the undertaker drove to pick up one of the dead, he simply got lost.LiNeBrEaKIt was the nation's most dramatic evidence of the dangers of air pollution, and it spawned a cleanup effort so successful that, today, many people rarely give a thought to the air they breathe.LiNeBrEaKYet in June 2005, a panel of scientists appointed by the Environmental Protection Agency determined that the air was still too dirty. LiNeBrEaKThe evidence was more subtle, but according to the latest studies, tiny particles _ similar to those that had fallen on Donora _ could shorten lifespans even at the invisible everyday levels found in much of the United States. No matter where the mix of particles came from _ trucks, buses, power plants _ their small size meant they could penetrate deep into the lungs.LiNeBrEaKThe panel recommended tougher rules to limit long-term exposure, a move that EPA's own scientists said could prevent thousands of premature deaths annually.LiNeBrEaKEPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson rejected their advice.LiNeBrEaKHis decision took the panel by surprise, but before long, it would fit into a familiar pattern.LiNeBrEaKOver the next three years, leading environmental scientists would denounce Johnson for substituting politics for science on key pollution issues _ from not regulating greenhouse gases blamed for global warming to delaying the assessment of toxic chemicals.LiNeBrEaKBut it was in a succession of decisions on air quality that Johnson's uneven application of science had perhaps the most severe impacts on human health.LiNeBrEaKIn the case of particles, a key element of Johnson's scientific justification was characterized by a top expert as "silly."LiNeBrEaKWhen considering restrictions on ozone, the chief component of smog, Johnson flatly rejected the recommendations of the nation's top 23 experts.LiNeBrEaKFor a new rule on airborne lead pollution, Johnson attempted to cripple the very panel created by Congress to advise him on all three decisions.LiNeBrEaKIn all three cases, it took a court order to get the EPA to make a decision.LiNeBrEaKAnd in all three cases, according to documents and interviews, Johnson chose to take a more industry-friendly course after pressure from the White House.LiNeBrEaK"What good is a scientific committee if you're just going to march to the White House and ask the president?" asked toxicologist Rogene Henderson, who was appointed by Johnson and chaired the panel during all three agency decisions.LiNeBrEaKJohnson, a career EPA scientist before taking the top spot in 2005, noted that the law gives him the final call on matters of science policy, and he said criticisms of him were unfair. While science is one of the "foundational principles" of a regulatory decision, he said, it's not the only one.LiNeBrEaK"For those who like the decision," Johnson said, "it's a great decision, and those who don't, you know, there's the 'you-caved-in.' "LiNeBrEaKThe chorus of "you-caved-ins" has grown among scientists and other critics who say that Johnson has allowed the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to unduly influence him _ and that he weighs economic concerns more heavily than public safety.LiNeBrEaKJohnson himself asked Congress this year to rewrite the Clean Air Act to allow him to take into account economic impacts when setting air pollution standards.LiNeBrEaKBut he vigorously denies that his rulings were in any way dictated by the White House.LiNeBrEaK"Every one of my decisions has been my decision. If they were not my decisions, I would not be here," he said.LiNeBrEaKGeorge Gray, EPA science adviser and assistant administrator for research, said his boss skillfully navigates the difficult task of incorporating sound science with effective public policy.LiNeBrEaK"He has a real challenge reminding people that science doesn't provide answers. It provides input and you have to use that in some kind of a broader process to inform decisions that you need to make."LiNeBrEaKThat process has been corrupted, says U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who chairs the Senate committee with EPA oversight.LiNeBrEaK"Almost every time he acts," Boxer said, "it's against his scientists."LiNeBrEaKThe danger of a short-term spike in pollution particles was illustrated by the 1948 deaths in Donora, and even more alarmingly four years later, when a smoky "fog" killed thousands in London.LiNeBrEaKScientists at the time had only crude ways to measure this emerging threat, known as particulate matter. And in the ensuing decades, as some experts began to explore the possibility that such microscopic particles were harmful over the long term, many had their doubts.LiNeBrEaK"A lot of people were very skeptical," said Henderson, the toxicologist. "It's not intuitive."LiNeBrEaKIn 1993, a Harvard study of more than 8,000 people in six cities began to convince the skeptics. Then came papers in 1995 and 2002, using data from several hundred thousand people, collected by the American Cancer Society.LiNeBrEaKThe clearest culprit seemed to be "fine" particles _ those measuring roughly \0 the thickness of a sheet of office paper.LiNeBrEaKFor every 10-microgram increase of fine particles per cubic meter of air, according to the 2002 study, there was an 8 percent increase in heart attacks and other cardiopulmonary deaths. It was a modest but statistically significant impact, and there was evidence of harm even in relatively clean cities.LiNeBrEaKThe findings held up even when other risk factors were taken into account: smoking, diet, occupation, exposure to other kinds of pollution.LiNeBrEaKThe six-city study, meanwhile, found that the dangers from fine particles were even greater. And new experiments suggested just how these unseen invaders might be doing their damage.LiNeBrEaKStudies on animals, for example, indicated that long-term inhalation of such particles causes inflammation, which in turn can lead to plaque buildup in the arteries.LiNeBrEaKStill unclear was whether particles emitted by certain sources were more harmful than others _ say, cement dust vs. diesel soot _ but collectively there was evidence of harm.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA was slow to act _ so slow that in 2003 the American Lung Association and others sued it to speed the review.LiNeBrEaKAs the law mandates, the agency weighed the evidence with the help of an in-depth review by a panel of independent scientists: the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.LiNeBrEaKArmed with the science panel's advice and detailed research by EPA staff, the administrator is charged with setting standards that are "requisite to protect the public health" with an "adequate margin of safety."LiNeBrEaKThe latest studies were not without uncertainty; the biggest one, for example, did not have information on whether smokers continued to smoke throughout the 16-year period.LiNeBrEaKBut for the science panel, the evidence was clear enough.LiNeBrEaKIts conclusion, in 2005, was that the daily limit for fine particles should be lowered sharply from 65 micrograms per cubic meter of air to 35 micrograms or below. That is, pollution readings in a given county would not be allowed to spike above 35 for more than a few days a year.LiNeBrEaKAverage yearly limits, the science panel felt, should be lowered from 15 micrograms per cubic meter to 14 or 13.LiNeBrEaKFor every decline of a single microgram in average levels, deaths would fall roughly 1 percent, the evidence indicated. That could translate into preventing thousands of premature deaths.LiNeBrEaKBut it would require significant pollution controls: from putting costly scrubbers on coal-burning power plants to mandatory cutbacks on engine idling of diesel trucks.LiNeBrEaKIn recent years, Philadelphia's fine-particle measurements have averaged about 15 micrograms per cubic meter of air _ on the cusp of meeting the standards. New York tends to be slightly higher, and Los Angeles is the nation's worst, at times above 20.LiNeBrEaKFine particles have been a special concern in Camden's Waterfront South neighborhood, where the problem is aggravated by a cement plant, other industry, and the steady rumbling of about 700 diesel trucks per day.LiNeBrEaKHenderson, the science panel chair, had been studying air pollution since 1967, publishing 240 articles. She had no doubt the rules needed to be tougher.LiNeBrEaK"Setting it at 15 didn't give any margin of safety," she said.LiNeBrEaKAll seven of the panel's charter members agreed, as did most of the additional 15 scientists who were brought in for their expertise.LiNeBrEaKThe only two to dissent were both former chairmen of the panel: George Wolff, a scientist at General Motors Corp., and Roger O. McClellan, a toxicologist with extensive experience both at an industry-funded group and at an independent research institute.LiNeBrEaKMcClellan said he did not think it was the role of scientists to recommend specific numbers, as the law gives that power to the administrator.LiNeBrEaK"I think we start getting on pretty thin ice when scientists start saying what is going to be an adequate margin of safety," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn September 2006, Johnson announced his decision. He cut the daily limit from 65 micrograms to 35 _ a dramatic reduction that fell within the range recommended by the scientists and his own staff.LiNeBrEaKThe annual average standard, on the other hand, Johnson left unchanged at 15 _ despite recent studies suggesting that this everyday background pollution killed even more people than occasional spikes.LiNeBrEaKHis explanation, published in the Federal Register, was curious:LiNeBrEaKThe big studies found evidence of premature deaths well below the existing 15-microgram pollution limit. But on average, the pollution level for the dozens of cities studied was about 18 micrograms. Since the existing standard was 15 micrograms, well below 18, Johnson decided it was already tough enough.LiNeBrEaKThe evidence of harm, he wrote, was strongest at the long-term average _ around 18 _ because that's where most of the data were.LiNeBrEaKYet a review of the data offers little support for Johnson's claim.LiNeBrEaKRoughly speaking, the data form a straight line on a graph: the cleaner the air during the years studied, the fewer people died.LiNeBrEaKAnd statistically speaking, that evidence is just as reliable at 13 or 14 as it is at the higher, average level that guided Johnson _ as measured by the width of what are called confidence intervals.LiNeBrEaKC. Arden Pope, who co-authored both the big studies the panel relied on, was puzzled by Johnson's focus on the average.LiNeBrEaKHe said it was a bit like looking at a group of people, a few of whom smoke two packs a day while most don't smoke at all. Under Johnson's logic, Pope said, it would be like concluding that it is safe to smoke the "average" amount, say, 10 cigarettes a day.LiNeBrEaK"It's silly," said Pope, a professor of economics at Brigham Young University.LiNeBrEaKYet Pope said he sympathized with the administrator, because improving air quality to conform with the Clean Air Act's "adequate margin of safety" is likely to be unrealistic.LiNeBrEaK"You've got the empirical evidence that looks like almost any pollution will hurt you," Pope said.LiNeBrEaKHow clean is clean enough? While lawyers may debate the meaning of "adequate," Johnson's own staff assembled some numbers: how many lives would be saved in each case.LiNeBrEaKSuch estimates are tricky, because no one knows how low you can go and still achieve additional health impacts. Experts consulted by the agency said Johnson's rule would prevent anywhere from 1,200 to 13,000 premature deaths each year, whereas tightening the annual standard by just one microgram would prevent somewhere between 2,200 and 24,000.LiNeBrEaKJason Burnett, a former EPA official involved in the rule-making process, said Johnson's decision to leave the standard alone was in keeping with the signals coming from the White House.LiNeBrEaK"They didn't want to tighten it, even though the vast majority of the evidence and the scientific advice we were receiving was to tighten it," said Burnett, who left the agency in part because he disagreed with the fine-particle rule.LiNeBrEaKWhen pressed, he declined to reveal details of when and how the pressure was applied.LiNeBrEaKBut several months before Johnson issued his decision, the White House OMB wrote him to express skepticism about the big studies upon which the science panel based its advice. In an April 2006 letter, the OMB's Donald R. Arbuckle, a senior official, urged further analysis and "a more complete characterization of the uncertainty."LiNeBrEaKThe new rule on particles has now been challenged in federal court by the American Lung Association, with a decision expected early next year. If the rule stands, the incoming Obama administration still could elect to revisit and toughen the standards, but the process could take years.LiNeBrEaKThrough a spokeswoman, the EPA declined to comment on Johnson's reasoning for leaving the annual pollution limit unchanged, citing the litigation. Under Bush, the agency did move to reduce particle pollution from buses and construction equipment. But legally speaking, the annual pollution limit is the driving force for cleanup efforts by the individual states, and by leaving it alone, Johnson left little impetus for change.LiNeBrEaKFor Henderson, what Johnson did was worse than a missed opportunity. Johnson's rule, she felt, did not provide the margin of safety required by the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaK"His decision contrasts with what the law clearly says," she said.LiNeBrEaKIn her lab in Albuquerque, N.M., Henderson was disappointed after the 2006 decision.LiNeBrEaKNow, her panel faced two more major air pollution reviews: ozone and lead. She hoped things would get better.LiNeBrEaKThey got a lot worse.LiNeBrEaKScientists know that ground-level ozone, the chief component of smog, kills thousands of people a year. Even small changes in ozone concentrations, just 10 parts per billion over the short term, can cause death rates to climb by 0. 5 percent, particularly among the elderly.LiNeBrEaKIn Philadelphia alone, the EPA estimates, dozens die each year.LiNeBrEaKThe noxious gas is formed by a chemical reaction when organic compounds and nitrogen oxides are exposed to sunlight. Those pollutants come from cars, power plants and oil refineries, among other sources.LiNeBrEaKIt also aggravates asthma and inflames the lungs _ "like a sunburn on the skin," the EPA says _ and on those days when levels are high, officials warn the vulnerable to stay indoors. When levels spike, so do hospital emergency room visits.LiNeBrEaKThe Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review ozone limits every five years, but the agency had not examined them since 1997, when it was set at 80 parts per billion. Ozone levels in the air are measured by about 1,200 ultraviolet monitors positioned across the United States.LiNeBrEaKIn March 2003, the American Lung Association and a cadre of environmental and public-health groups sued the EPA to force a review, and a judge ordered EPA to complete one by March 12, 2008.LiNeBrEaKThe law required Johnson to set two standards, a primary standard to protect human health and a secondary standard that would protect crops, plants and ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKThe science panel and EPA spent almost four years assessing the risk from ozone. They all agreed that the current standard of 80 parts per billion was too high.LiNeBrEaKBut what level of ozone was safe?LiNeBrEaKThe panel combed through 1,700 new scientific studies to see if they could determine how much ozone, mixed into the everyday cocktail of pollution, made people sick.LiNeBrEaKThese types of studies can establish relationships between pollutants and health problems, but it is easier to pinpoint a specific culprit in a controlled laboratory study.LiNeBrEaKFor that, the panel turned to William C. Adams, an exercise physiologist at the University of California at Davis. Adams had conducted two studies in which healthy adults directly inhaled a controlled amount of ozone at doses near the level that was being considered for the new safety standard.LiNeBrEaKBoth studies were paid for by the American Petroleum Institute.LiNeBrEaKThe studies showed a statistically significant effect when subjects inhaled ozone at the current level set by the EPA, 80 parts per billion. But some adults also showed a decrease in lung function when they inhaled ozone at 60 parts per billion.LiNeBrEaKIf healthy young adults found it harder to breathe with ozone at 60 parts per billion, the panel reasoned, then clearly more vulnerable populations were at risk at that level.LiNeBrEaKAdams later said he thought the panel placed too much weight on some of his findings, but the experts considered his arguments and disagreed.LiNeBrEaKIn October 2006, the panel recommended that Johnson set the primary level between 60 and 70 parts per billion.LiNeBrEaKIt also said Johnson should set a separate secondary standard, designed to address ozone's effects on a plant's ability to produce and store food. This secondary standard would limit cumulative ozone levels during daylight hours over three months. The panel recommended that the total not be higher than 15 "parts per million-hours" _ an environmental measure akin to man-hours.LiNeBrEaKBy February 2008, Johnson had reached a conclusion. In a draft to the OMB, he said the evidence for making a change to both the primary and secondary standards was "compelling."LiNeBrEaKHe set the primary standard at 75 parts per billion, higher than the recommendation. He set the secondary limit for protecting plants at 21 parts per million-hours _ also considerably higher.LiNeBrEaKBut the OMB would have to sign off on the rulings.LiNeBrEaKOn March 6, one week before the court-ordered ozone deadline, Susan Dudley, head of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, wrote to Johnson to say that the science did not justify a new secondary standard _ one that would be expensive to put in place.LiNeBrEaK"EPA has not considered or evaluated the effects of adopting a standard on economic values, personal comfort and well-being, as specifically enumerated in the Act," Dudley wrote.LiNeBrEaKIn a footnote, she noted that the EPA was obligated to consider any benefits of ozone.LiNeBrEaKThe next day, EPA Deputy Administrator Marcus Peacock sent a memo to Dudley saying EPA was unaware of any beneficial effects of ozone. Further, the science supported the tougher rule and the agency was barred under the Clean Air Act from considering cost when setting standards.LiNeBrEaKDudley sought to block the rule anyway.LiNeBrEaKWith the EPA and OMB in a deadlock, Johnson turned to the White House.LiNeBrEaKJohnson has refused to discuss what happened next, but a document prepared for his meeting with the White House on March 11 called the intended lowering of the secondary standard the most scientifically defensible.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA staff pointed out that in addition to the science panel, the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Park Service recognized the need for a separate secondary standard.LiNeBrEaKJohnson lost.LiNeBrEaK"The president has concluded that ... added protection should be afforded to public welfare by strengthening the secondary ozone standard and setting it to be identical to the new primary standard," wrote OMB's Dudley.LiNeBrEaKDudley's letter sparked a flurry of activity as EPA staffers were told to edit the final rule to reflect the White House's last-minute changes.LiNeBrEaKJohnson defended himself, saying the panel had gone too far; its recommendation was based on a "mixture of scientific and policy considerations." He did not have confidence, he added, in his own agency's scientific analysis. Adams, he noted, had his own reservations.LiNeBrEaKEPA staff members were appalled, calling the move "pure politics" in e-mails made public during a congressional investigation into Johnson's handling of the ozone standard. One questioned why a final version of the rule included a sentence about parks and forests, "since we're not really protecting any of them properly."LiNeBrEaKAnother manager wrote: "I know how incredibly frustrated and disgusted we all are at the moment."LiNeBrEaKThe last-minute shuffle also inflamed the science advisory panel.LiNeBrEaK"That's no way to set a standard, by fiat behind closed doors," Henderson said. "They have no shame."LiNeBrEaKBurnett, the former senior EPA aide who worked on the ozone decision with Johnson, said it was difficult to get the White House to understand the gravity of its decision.LiNeBrEaK"There were people at the White House who openly said they didn't believe smog causes health problems," he said. "How do you discuss policy with people like that?"LiNeBrEaKPanel members thought Johnson failed on both ozone rules.LiNeBrEaKIn a letter to Johnson sent April 7, the panel wrote that it did "not endorse the new primary ozone standard as being sufficiently protective of public health," especially the most vulnerable, and that it failed "to satisfy the explicit stipulations of the Clean Air Act."LiNeBrEaK"It's outrageous," said John Balmes, a physician who studies ozone and served on the panel.LiNeBrEaK"When you have a committee of 23 people from a variety of disciplines unanimously agreeing on the science," Balmes said, "and he says separately that there is too much uncertainty to follow the recommendations of the panel, a kind phrase would be 'B.S.' This is not a committee of wild-eyed radicals."LiNeBrEaKAbout the same time Henderson and the panel were considering ozone, they were also reviewing airborne lead.LiNeBrEaKIt was one pollutant everyone could agree was bad.LiNeBrEaKSince the 1970s, evidence had been piling up that airborne lead spewed from smelting plants, leaded gasoline and other sources impaired cognitive functioning in children.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA had not changed the standard since 1978.LiNeBrEaKThe agency's rationale was that it had already eliminated much of the danger of airborne lead when, in 1996, it banned leaded gasoline after a 25-year phaseout program.LiNeBrEaKBut some dangers remained.LiNeBrEaKIt was a fact well known to the Missouri town of Herculaneum, where a smelting plant had been in operation for more than 100 years. One study in 2001 showed that within a half-mile of the facility, 53 percent of children under 6 had high lead levels in their blood.LiNeBrEaKOn some of the town's streets, the lead dust along roadways was so prevalent that officials warned pregnant women and children under 6 to stay away.LiNeBrEaKThe plant, run by the Doe Run company, had violated emissions laws, and in 2002 part of the town was shuttered because it was too contaminated.LiNeBrEaKThe company said it has worked hard to reduce lead emissions by investing in new cleaner technologies. "It's our community, too," said Kent Martin, a spokesman for Doe Run. "That's why these standards needed to be upgraded."LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, an environmental coalition sued EPA to compel a review of the standard.LiNeBrEaKTo make their recommendation about where the new standards should be set, the panel would rely on the EPA "staff paper," a review of the more than 6,000 studies that had been conducted on lead and its effects over the last few decades.LiNeBrEaKThe staff paper is an essential part of any ambient air quality review, but Henderson and the panel noticed that the paper was not among the key documents the EPA provided.LiNeBrEaKHenderson asked for the paper, but was told that the agency had decided to change how air pollution reviews would be conducted.LiNeBrEaKIt was all laid out in a Dec. 7, 2006, memorandum from Peacock, the deputy administrator, to Gray, the EPA science adviser.LiNeBrEaKNow, the EPA would give the panel a "policy assessment" reflecting the agency's views. The policy assessment would be short on science and long on policy options, giving the administrator a wide berth in setting standards.LiNeBrEaK"It was done to give the administrator a way to control the process," said panel member Bruce Lanphear, a toxicologist and lead expert. Lanphear said he was so disgusted by what he saw as the undermining of the panel's role that he later moved to Canada.LiNeBrEaKThe policy assessment would be published in the Federal Register, and the EPA science panel would have to stand in line and comment on it just like the general public.LiNeBrEaKThus, reduced to the role of an outside critic, Henderson's panel would no longer shape and strengthen the EPA staff's scientific findings.LiNeBrEaKIn justifying the move, Peacock said the process would help improve efficiency, while ensuring that the best science from a broad field of experts would be considered.LiNeBrEaKThe panel was outraged. They were, after all, a creation of Congress, chartered under the Clean Air Act to serve as an objective scientific body in advising the EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaKThey demanded the paper.LiNeBrEaKThen they got a stroke of luck.LiNeBrEaKThe lead review had been prompted by a federal lawsuit, which meant the EPA would need permission from the presiding judge to alter the process.LiNeBrEaKThe coalition objected to the changes, and were joined by the state of Missouri.LiNeBrEaK"Certainly, in this case, after a draft Staff Paper has already been completed, it seems as if the agency is trying to hide the ball, not bring it into the light," Missouri Attorney General Jeremiah W. Nixon wrote in a brief he filed in the case.LiNeBrEaK"Missouri believes EPA's new procedure is deeply flawed and actually undermines the interests it purports to serve."LiNeBrEaKThe court ruled that the EPA would have to turn over the staff paper, as well as the policy assessment.LiNeBrEaKThat allowed a unique opportunity to compare the two and measure what effect the new process would have on future reviews.LiNeBrEaKThe results were alarming.LiNeBrEaK"If it had not been so serious, it would have been laughable," Henderson said. All 23 scientists on the lead review panel expressed concern over the regressive nature of the assessment.LiNeBrEaKThe panel wrote Johnson in January to say the agency's revised process "represented a remarkable weakening of the scientific foundation of the ... review process."LiNeBrEaKFor example, the policy assessment said Johnson should view as acceptable blood-lead levels in children considered so toxic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that they require treatment. The panel in a letter to Johnson in January called such a starting point "particularly troubling."LiNeBrEaKJonathan Samet, chair of the epidemiology department at Johns Hopkins University, wrote that the policy assessment was "an unacceptable result of a process that should be evidence-based but has clearly gone off course and lost its links to a substantial body of evidence."LiNeBrEaKThe assessment also suggested removing lead from regulation altogether, an option that had been considered and dismissed as "scientifically indefensible."LiNeBrEaKIt took the EPA nearly nine months to reply. When it did, the agency said that while the policy assessment was not as informative as it could have been, it was moving forward with the changes.LiNeBrEaKSo the agency's next move took the panel by surprise.LiNeBrEaKAfter more than two years of heated exchanges with the panel, and ruling against it in two prior air pollution decisions, Johnson followed the scientists' advice.LiNeBrEaKHe drastically cut the amount of lead allowed in the air to one-tenth the existing level _ from 1. 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air to 0. 15.LiNeBrEaKHenderson, whose tenure on the board ended this fall, praised Johnson's ruling, calling it a tough new standard.LiNeBrEaKYet in the days after his ruling, Johnson's legacy was tarnished again after it was revealed that, under pressure from the White House, there would be certain exemptions to the new lead rule:LiNeBrEaKTwo hundred of the 350 plants _ those that emit between a half-ton and 1 ton of lead a year _ would go unmonitored.LiNeBrEaKJohnson is fond of saying that he set the toughest air quality standards to date.LiNeBrEaKHenderson and other members concede that they are tougher, but not as strong as the science demands.LiNeBrEaKAfter 40 years studying the damage caused by air pollution, Henderson knows as well as anyone that science is fraught with uncertainty, and that answers are not always clear-cut. But when human health is at stake, she feels, there is one certainty: Science has an obligation to protect the public as best it knows how. The law requires it.LiNeBrEaK"When I came on, I thought we could establish the best possible standards to protect public health," she said. "In the end, I found that he was totally loyal to his boss. That was disappointing to me."

A-2  	703 words  	Confident that the Almighty has a tremendous sense of humor, I've taken the liberty in recent years of, um, refreshing the Christmas Story with the voices of some unlikely characters.LiNeBrEaKFirst it was the Pittsburgh Steelers' play-by-play guys: "Now here comes Joseph, and he's got the hand-off -- talk about your Immaculate Reception!"LiNeBrEaKThen it was someone who'd seen way too many ads for inventively named products: "Suddenly there appeared a Paxil of angels in the Spherion praising God ... 'Gloria in Cialis Airgo! Glory to God in the Prius!' " LiNeBrEaKThis Yuletide let's hear the Gospel of Luke's narrative from a few figures who made 2008 so memorable ...LiNeBrEaKBarack Obama: I won the coin toss, of course, so I'll get us started. Aaaand uh, it came to pass in those days that, uh, there went out a decree ... from, uh, Caesar Augustus ... that all the world should get a tax cut.LiNeBrEaKSarah Palin: You betcha! That's what John McCain woulda done!LiNeBrEaKJoe Biden: Well, respectfully, Barack, the text says "all the world should be taxed," and you know what -- this young couple, dirt poor, expecting a child, they stepped up and did their patriotic duty! They went all the way from Galilee to Bethlehem, probably on foot -- great for the environment, no donkey methane to contribute to global warming, which even then was already bad in the Middle East, which I know because I've studied the satellite photos taken 2,000 years ago and recovered in Area 51 --LiNeBrEaKObama: Joe, I need you to, uh, get started right away on renumbering the Library of Congress card catalog. Don't worry about how long it takes -- thanks, buddy ... OK, sorry about that -- where were we?LiNeBrEaKPalin: Mary was great with child, and believe you me, that's somethin' me and my daughter Bristol know a little about!LiNeBrEaKObama: Right. Aaaand the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. Aaaand she brought forth her firstborn son, wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn -- undoubtedly due to discriminatory practices, excessive deregulation and lax congressional oversight of the commercial hospitality industry.LiNeBrEaKJohn McCain: Well, that manger is still a heckuva lot bigger than the cell I occupied for five years as a prisoner in Vietnam!LiNeBrEaKObama: But it's smaller than any of your seven kitchens, John, and nobody cares.LiNeBrEaKPalin: C'mon you guys -- we got a job to do here and let me tell ya, it's easier than skinnin' a moose!LiNeBrEaKObama: Aaand there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields --LiNeBrEaKPalin: Pro-Judea Jews!LiNeBrEaKObama: -- keeping watch over their flock by night --LiNeBrEaKPalin: Clingin' to their spears and religion!LiNeBrEaKObama: Cut it out, hockey mom!LiNeBrEaKMcCain: My friends, you two aren't acting in a very bipartisan manner, as I've done for so many years in the Senate, reaching across the ai--LiNeBrEaKObama: Aaand lo!

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 22, 2008 Monday   SOONER EDITION	DEAR MR. OBAMA  		ARTS and ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. E-7  	318 words  	Between now and Jan. 20, the Post-Gazette will publish letters written by local students to President-elect Barack Obama, who will be inaugurated as the nation's 44th president. They will appear intermittently on the My Generation Page. The following are from fifth-graders at Liberty Elementary School. LiNeBrEaKb&gt; Dear President-elect Barack Obama,LiNeBrEaK/b&gt;LiNeBrEaKWhen you become president, I think you should push to help the environment and push to lower health-care costs. If you push to help the environment then the world be a nicer place for everybody. It would be good to stop global warming or slow it down a lot.LiNeBrEaKYou should give money to science groups that are trying to discover ways to stop global warming. You should encourage people to plant a tree or other plants on Arbor Day. You should reinforce the law that companies can't drop their chemical waste into the ocean. The animals that live in the ocean will live longer.LiNeBrEaKI think you should push to lower health- care costs because everybody needs health care to live. People won't become bankrupt because they paid their medical bill. People won't be afraid to go to the doctor's office because they are saving their money for something they think is more important.LiNeBrEaKZachary Lardas, age 10LiNeBrEaKb&gt; Dear President-elect Barack Obama,LiNeBrEaK/b&gt;LiNeBrEaKI am so happy you won the election. You are going to be a great president. The way you could help our country is by ending the war because citizens are getting killed and not having enough time to spend with friends, family, and to have fun.LiNeBrEaKYou could also make the gas prices lower. U.S. citizens are not going to pay for the gas because they won't have enough money. When they can't afford gas, they won't be able to visit different locations. But if they want to visit by plane, or train, both will be crowded, and planes cost a lot of money, too. Anyway, hope you have a great time in the White House.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKPeyton Skinker, age 11	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (90%); HEALTH CARE COSTS (89%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (78%); OIL and GAS PRICES (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); INSOLVENCY and BANKRUPTCY (51%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 P.G.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		December 22, 2008 Monday 	Fine choice for Energy  		COMMENTARY; Pg. 4  	391 words  	President-elect Obama has chosen splendidly in nominating as energy secretary Steven Chu, the nuclear physicist who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mr. Chu, who was the 1997 Nobel laureate in physics for his work in laser cooling of atoms, is also a fine administrator with expertise in the policy issues that he d confront running the Energy Department. In addition, he is an expert in biophysics and polymer science, which also may come in handy as he reviews alternative-energy proposals. Indeed, he has a record of virtually nonstop creativity. LiNeBrEaKMr. Chu has a keen interest in the need to swiftly develop alternatives to our dependence on fossil fuels, which is perilous both because of geo-political threats and because of pollution and global warming. And while he has a clear understanding of the current economics of the energy business, he also has the background and ability to anticipate its future economics. He seems well poised to lead a new culture of innovation at the Energy Department, which in the Bush administration has all too often acted as an agent for the fossil-fuel sector.LiNeBrEaKMr. Chu s nomination bodes well for prospects for a new U.S. leadership in facing the energy crisis. It is also a happy portent for the future of American science, and research and development, that a scientist and executive of this rank will lead the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama has recruited some very able people to deal with some onerous challenges. Soon we ll see how well they perform in the face of difficult and unpredictable events.LiNeBrEaKA caution here. Carol Browner, the very able Environmental Protection Agency administrator under Bill Clinton, has been assigned the task of being  energy coordinator  (or, as the press inevitably prefers,  czarina ). She ll be charged with making sure that Obama energy policy is applied coherently across the executive branch. That would include, for example, seeing that energy policy as implemented by the Interior Department, to be led by the estimable Ken Salazar, now a senator from Colorado, doesn t clash with whatever comes out of the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaKShe could make it all run smoothly, or, with her White House perch, cause destructive turf battles and undermine the ability of Messrs. Chu and Salazar to do their jobs. It will be an interesting bureaucratic ballet.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 22, 2008 Monday   FINAL Edition	New wetlands plan worries S.F. Bay fishing industry  	Brian Hoffman, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	1340 words  	When it's complete, it will be one of the largest wetlands restorations in U.S. history, a sprawling complex of critical habitat in the North Bay that scientists believe will benefit threatened and endangered species, provide a nursery for fish and even help ease the effects of global warming.LiNeBrEaKMany within the San Francisco Bay's fishing industry and some environmentalists, however, see the ambitious plan as a potential threat to fisheries, bird species and the very health of the bay.LiNeBrEaKWork on the Hamilton Wetlands Restoration Project began in 2001 after receiving congressional approval. The goal is to rebuild nearly 2,600 acres of wetlands in Novato at the site of a former army airfield and an adjoining parcel of land at Bel Marin Keys. LiNeBrEaKTo restore the wetlands, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state Coastal Conservancy are building up land using millions of cubic yards of sand and mud from dredging scheduled around the bay, with most of the initial material gathered from Port of Oakland deepening projects.LiNeBrEaKThe agencies started to fill in the land with dredge material in 2006, but at the current build rate - with each barge of material towed in, tediously offloaded and pumped to Hamilton - project leaders estimate it will take another 18 years to complete the project.LiNeBrEaKAquatic Transfer FacilityLiNeBrEaKTo speed things along, they have proposed an alternate way of storing the material and delivering it to the work sites. The agencies say the project time will be cut by eight to 10 years, saving as much as $300 million, if the changes are approved by a host of federal and state agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Bay Conservation and Development Commission.LiNeBrEaK"It would be a far, far more efficient way of getting the material to the Hamilton sites," said Peter Mull, an ocean engineer and project manager for what is being called the Aquatic Transfer Facility. "The way it works now, we only get a third of the amount of material that we are hoping for every year."LiNeBrEaKWhat the Army Corps of Engineers and Coastal Conservancy have proposed is to dig a 36-acre hole on the west side of San Pablo Bay just above China Camp, in a relatively shallow area prized for its sturgeon and striped-bass fishing.LiNeBrEaK Material from bay dredging projects would be delivered by barge on a steady basis, between June and November, and dumped directly over the massive ditch, where engineers believe the sediment quickly will settle. The collected material would then be pumped to the work sites, 24 hours a day.LiNeBrEaKFishing industry oppositionLiNeBrEaKNot everyone likes the plan. Bay Area fishermen say the increased turbidity - the suspension of sediment - in the bay is a sure way of ruining what's left of bay and regional fisheries.LiNeBrEaK"No one is opposed to restoring wetlands," said John Beuttler, conservation director of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance. "But the way we go about it is absolutely vital. We all remember the years where dredge spoils were wiping out the sportfishing on the bays. We simply cannot sustain that again."LiNeBrEaK In the 1980s, after a series of poor fishing seasons, anglers protested the wholesale dumping of dredge material around Alcatraz, where sediment mixed with the tide, clouded the bay and, fishermen believe, severely harmed fisheries and the entire food chain.LiNeBrEaK"Those were very bad years," said Jim Smith, a party-boat captain who has fished the bay since 1967. "You'd see them dump at Alcatraz, and there would be a brown cloud on the bay, going back and forth with the tide. There was mud all over the rocks. It ruined the fishing."LiNeBrEaKMull agrees that turbidity represents a serious detriment to the bay's health. By studying computer models and working on the environmental impact report, he believes the Aquatic Transfer Facility project actually will reduce the amount of suspended sediment in the bay.LiNeBrEaK"I know it seems counterintuitive," he said about letting dredge spoils settle into a hole in the bay, "but we estimate that we'll lose less than 3 percent of the material this way."LiNeBrEaKRebuilding wetlands fasterLiNeBrEaKMull said some 4 million cubic yards of dredge material is taken from the bay each year to reduce sediment deposits and deepen ports. Much of that material is dumped back into bay waters at Mare Island, at a site in the San Pablo Bay shipping channel and at Alcatraz, with some taken out past the Farallon Islands, to the edge of the continental shelf.LiNeBrEaKOnly about 1. 2 million cubic yards annually has been gathered for the wetlands restoration project at Hamilton using the current method, which has been limited by the slow process of working with off-loader equipment and further hampered by scheduling conflicts and mechanical breakdowns.LiNeBrEaK "With the transfer facility, potentially we can more than double the amount of material that can be used for wetlands creation," Mull said, "bringing the amount of material available closer to 3 million cubic yards. We can speed the restoration along that much quicker."LiNeBrEaKMull also stressed that the dredge material used in the restoration project is clean and rigorously tested to ensure that it is safe to use.LiNeBrEaKDavid Lewis, executive director of the conservation group Save the Bay, supports the proposed transfer facility. "We're waiting to see the final environmental impact report, but there will be some big advantages to this facility," he said.LiNeBrEaK"Looking at whether there would be enough turbidity to affect the fish, studies seem to show that there would not be a big impact from that," Lewis said. "The place they want to put this doesn't have a very fast current, and it's a little bit sheltered."LiNeBrEaK1980s problem revisitedLiNeBrEaKKeith Fraser, who has been selling bait from his shop at Loch Lomond Marina in San Rafael for 39 years and regularly fishes the waters off China Camp, strongly disagrees with talk that the project would not harm fish populations.LiNeBrEaK"The pit plan has the potential to be an even bigger problem for the ecosystem of the bay than the problems we faced in the early 1980s," Fraser said. "Like we found out with the Alcatraz fiasco, most marine life will vacate any area where the turbidity is high. We're talking about drastic effects to striped bass, sturgeon, halibut, salmon - all of our fish."LiNeBrEaKThe Marin Audubon Society also sees potential problems with the project.LiNeBrEaK"We don't have a position; we have a lot of concerns," said Barbara Salzman, the group's president. The proposed site "is pretty close to Gallinas and Miller creeks, and they have endangered species. That was not even addressed" in the environmental impact report.LiNeBrEaK"It also didn't properly address impacts on the middle of the bay, where there are diving ducks and other birds. I would say they have a lot of homework to do."LiNeBrEaKLewis sees the restoration projects at Hamilton Field and Redwood City's Bair Island, where another 2,600 acres are being restored, as a net gain for the overall health of the bay, which has lost 90 percent of its original wetlands to farming and urbanization.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to habitat and water-quality benefits, Lewis said the wetlands help to lessen global warming by sequestering carbon emissions. The wetlands also soak up tidal events and release them slowly.LiNeBrEaK"They really are one of the best assets in the fight against global warming and the coastal impact of rising sea levels," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut to attain the beneficial aspects of the wetlands at Hamilton Field, the area first needs to be restored, which means figuring out a way to safely and effectively bring in dredge material. LiNeBrEaKMull maintains that the Aquatic Transfer Facility is the answer.LiNeBrEaK"There will be less suspended material in the bay, and the wetlands will be completed faster," he said. "The idea here is simply to accelerate the process."LiNeBrEaKIf approved, Mull said, the Aquatic Transfer Facility could be in operation in early 2010.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 22, 2008 Monday 	Bogus BLM bidder: Cites ethics in scheme to derail drilling  	By Patty Henetz The Salt Lake Tribune  	BREAKING; Politics; Top Stories; News; State  	962 words  	Tim DeChristopher stood alone Friday when he placed bogus bids on drilling parcels near two Utah national parks, single-handedly sabotaging an oil- and gas-lease sale that caught the attention of Congress and the incoming Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKNow, the 27-year-old University of Utah economics student stands with powerful new friends, including Pat Shea, former head of the Bureau of Land Management; Utah's most prominent defense attorney, Ron Yengich; and hundreds of supporters promising to contribute to his legal-defense fund. LiNeBrEaKOthers led him to this point, inspiring DeChristopher to oppose a government he fears is leading the world to climate disaster. His mother, Christine, helped start the West Virginia chapter of the Sierra Club and took him as a small child to anti-coal rallies. Terry Root, a Stanford University scientist who worked with Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, put her hand on DeChristopher's shoulder and apologized for being too late to avert the worst effects of global warming. And Gore called on young people to commit acts of civil disobedience to stop greenhouse-gas belching coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaK"I don't ever want to have to look back at 2008 and know that there was still a slight chance that we could have done something to make a difference, and I didn't take that chance," DeChristopher said Monday. "Ethically, I have to pursue that chance."LiNeBrEaKThat pursuit could land him in federal court.LiNeBrEaKMelodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Salt Lake City, said Monday that her office hadn't seen the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's investigative report. Federal prosecutors likely will do their own inquiry on whether DeChristopher's case should be brought before a grand jury, which wouldn't happen for weeks.LiNeBrEaK"The process is just starting," Rydalch said. "It will take time to evaluate evidence and make a determination whether we will prosecute."LiNeBrEaKBLM spokeswoman Mary Wilson said Monday the agency was considering what to do next. " This is so unprecedented," she said, "we don't know what our options are."LiNeBrEaKOne possibility: Redo the lease auction. Normally, the agency must give 30 days' notice. But the BLM might be able to bypass that rule, Wilson said, by offering a shorter public-review period.LiNeBrEaKKathleen Sgamma, director of government affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, said her organization had no plans to take action against DeChristopher.LiNeBrEaK"We just hope the U.S. Attorney's Office makes sure this doesn't happen again," she said.LiNeBrEaKMainstream conservation organizations, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which opposed the lease sale, remained on the sidelines.LiNeBrEaK"It's not clear whether this individual has broken any laws," Executive Director Scott Groene said Monday. "But SUWA doesn't condone any illegal activity."LiNeBrEaKShea, who with Yengich is representing DeChristopher, said he stepped forward to help the student because when Shea was the BLM boss, anonymous protesters took destructive actions against the public-lands agency. By contrast, Shea said, DeChristopher has "integrity of purpose" that deserves protection in court.LiNeBrEaKBLM officials said DeChristopher bid $1. 8 million -- which he has neither the intention nor the money to pay -- for more than 10 lease parcels near Arches and Canyonlands while driving up other bids by about $500,000.LiNeBrEaKAfter other oil and gas bidders complained, BLM special agents escorted out DeChristopher and his roommate, Kent Boardman, for a closed-door interview as the auction proceeded.LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher said Monday -- during an interview at his ad-hoc strategy center at the back of the One World Cafe in Salt Lake City -- that his conversation with the agents was open and honest. He told them he believed the auction was the real fraud, that it had been rushed through to beat the clock on the lame-duck Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"I also felt it had been a threat to my future," he said, "and, in response to that, this was a conscious act of civil disobedience."LiNeBrEaKThe agents spent even more time with Boardman. DeChristopher said they may have been trying to determine whether there had been some kind of conspiracy.LiNeBrEaKRather, Boardman was surprised the first time his roomie raised bidding paddle No. 70.LiNeBrEaK"He said, 'What are you doing?' " DeChristopher recalled. Then, after DeChristopher won a bid, Boardman said, "'Do you have a plan?' "LiNeBrEaKDeChristopher said he acted because less brazen tactics weren't working to stop the drilling leases. To him, the big picture includes catastrophic famine, millions of refugees and an agricultural system killed off by climate disruption.LiNeBrEaKMeeting Terry Root, a speaker at this year's Wallace Stegner symposium at the U. law school, still resonates with DeChristopher: "There were things we could have done in the '80s, things we could have done in the '90s, but at this point, we're too late, my generation has failed you, and I'm sorry,' " the student recalled Root saying.LiNeBrEaK"That was a very powerful experience for me," DeChristopher said. "It really rocked me."LiNeBrEaKFrankly, he said, he was hoping for someone else to come along to take action. Yet in an essay he posted Saturday on the Web blog oneutah.org, DeChristopher quoted from June Jordan's 1980 "Poem for South African Women," when he wrote, "Hopefully all of us will realize that we are the ones we have been waiting for."LiNeBrEaKIt's down to the wire, DeChristopher said, "down to one of our last opportunities here in the next couple of years to make drastic changes in order to ensure a livable future."LiNeBrEaKDuring a "Democracy Now" radio interview Monday morning, DeChristopher reiterated that he was willing to do prison time, but preferred staying free.LiNeBrEaK"I don't want to be a martyr or anything like that," he said.LiNeBrEaKphenetz@sltrib.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); ETHICS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); NATIONAL PARKS (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (86%); AUCTIONS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (78%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (77%); LAWYERS (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (74%); POWER PLANTS (73%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (73%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (73%); WILDERNESS (73%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); GRAND JURY (63%)  		AL GORE (70%); BARACK OBAMA (58%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (92%) UTAH, USA (99%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  			Tim DeChristopher, Unversity of Utah student, disrupted the BLM oil and gas lease auction last week, p[hotographed at the Onel Cafe Monday, December 22, 2008 Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune Tim DeCristopher talks with reporters after he was escorted out of the BLM offices in Salt Lake City on Friday.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		December 22, 2008 Monday 	NEW ADMINISTRATION: SECRETARY OF FOOD  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A15  	538 words  	President-elect Barack Obama took a big step when he gave former Sen. Tom Daschle, his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, a broader mandate to coordinate health reform. For whatever reasons, the incoming administration has shied away from such a sweeping, intelligent approach to food policy. LiNeBrEaKGiven the president-elect's choice for a new agriculture secretary, perhaps that is just as well.LiNeBrEaKAt first glance, former Iowa Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack looks like a very traditional, even backward-looking selection. On farming issues, he supported agribusiness over Iowa counties' ideas about controlling huge pig feedlots and genetically modified plants. And he was a big fan of crop-based ethanol. We suspect Vilsack's oversight of the national forest issues that fall in the Department of Agriculture will be a learn-on-the-job undertaking fraught with opportunities to misunderstand Western issues.LiNeBrEaKObama's choice of Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., to head the Department of the Interior and its oversight of much of the Western range lands, is somewhat more encouraging because of his broad understanding of the public's rights to require protection of the environment. Salazar also understands what is involved with having cattle on the lands, having been a rancher himself.LiNeBrEaKWe liked the call of columnist Nicholas Kristof for a secretary of food. We need a reformer charged with transcending the 19th- and 20th-century idea of a Cabinet officer serving the needs of farmers. With that perspective, it would be possible to unite producers, consumers and government in delivering diets that are healthy for the people, the land and the economy.LiNeBrEaKBetween Salazar and Vilsack, however, there is no indication so far that either one of them will push a larger coordination of food, farming and lands policies to benefit consumers and public health in any comprehensive, new approach. Maybe it is wise for the incoming administration not to try to tackle too many big issues at once.LiNeBrEaKWe see room for the administration to create smarter food and environmental policies for agriculture over time. We hope, as does food writer Michael Pollan, that Vilsack will grow in national office, even though he told NPR that the appointment has the appearance of "agribusiness as usual." But Vilsack also is said to be a person of great integrity and dedication, which offers hope for growth.LiNeBrEaKTalking to NPR's Renee Montagne, Pollan summed up why it is so important to get out of the limited mind-set favoring promotion of big agricultural-related corporations: "The food system is responsible for about a third of greenhouse gases. It is responsible for the catastrophic American diet that is leading 50 percent of us to suffer from chronic disease, and that drives up health care costs."LiNeBrEaKThe economy seems likely to force Americans to make more of their grocery picks on the basis of cost. That makes it all the more important for the Obama administration to reform the larger system to promote healthier foods, sustainable agricultural practices and economic viability for smaller farmers and ranchers. While we won't hold our breath anticipating action within Obama's first 100 days, that's a part of the change he was elected to deliver.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 		December 22, 2008 Monday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	ANOTHER MARKET CRASH: RECYCLING  	LEONORA LAPETER ANTON, Times Staff Writer  	TAMPA BAY; Pg. 1B  	930 words  	Good news: We're recycling more than ever before.LiNeBrEaKBad news: No one wants to buy it.LiNeBrEaKIn the past two months, the market for recycled garbage has crashed.LiNeBrEaKSo drastic is the price drop for recycled plastic, newspapers and aluminum that some recycling contractors have started to stockpile with the hope that the market will recover.LiNeBrEaK"Not a whole lot is being sold," said Ron Henricks, manager for the state Department of Environmental Protection's recycling programs. "The Chinese have basically cut the water off and the domestic market in the U.S. is not developed enough to take all that's out there at this point." LiNeBrEaKIn the past, as much as 75 percent of U.S. recyclables went to China. Two months ago, that stopped, resulting in drastic dips in value.LiNeBrEaKFor example, in Pasco County, a shipment of 41,740 pounds of plastic bottles sold for $835 in November. A year ago, the same load would have fetched $6,261. Recently, 17 tons of aluminum sold for $15,050. A year ago, it would have generated $28,578.LiNeBrEaK"Sometimes you make money and other times you have to pay someone to take it from you," said Jennifer Seney, recycling coordinator for Pasco County.LiNeBrEaKThere have been crashes in the recycling market before. But never at a time when there has been so much pressure to recycle to reduce global warming and greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The demand is less but the push to recycle has gone up and that's a good thing because everybody wants to preserve natural resources," said Michelle Thornhill, a vice president of operations for the southeast division of SP Recycling, the company that handles Pinellas County's recyclables.LiNeBrEaKIn Florida this year, the Legislature directed the state to come up with a plan for what it would take to recycle 75 percent of all garbage. Now, Florida recycles about 24 percent.LiNeBrEaKIn many places, recycling is as easy as walking the items out to the curb. In the Tampa Bay area, Tampa, Clearwater and Hillsborough and Pasco counties are the largest areas that offer curbside recycling. Pinellas County has relied on dropoff sites, but is developing a plan that would provide curbside services throughout the county, even possibly in St. Petersburg.LiNeBrEaKTim Gutowski, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, suggests that if the market prices don't increase, you might see some recyclers going out of business or dumping their collections in the landfill.LiNeBrEaK"You may have to end up paying to recycle," he said. "The situation for the environment doesn't change though. It still has all those benefits."LiNeBrEaKJoseph Fernandez, solid waste program manager for Pinellas County, said no recycled trash from unincorporated Pinellas County is going to the landfill at this point. "It doesn't make sense to go through all that time to collect the material and not go to market," he said. "It's still cheaper in the long run - even if you have to pay to recycle it now."LiNeBrEaKThe solution, recycling advocates say, is for consumers to buy recycled goods over other items.LiNeBrEaK"It's not enough just to collect the stuff," Henricks said. "We have to create demand for stuff made out of recycled materials."LiNeBrEaKPrices of recycled itemsin the SoutheastLiNeBrEaKItem Price now(per ton) Price in July(per ton)LiNeBrEaKAluminum cans $1,350 $1,900LiNeBrEaKPlastics PET (clear bottles) $80 $420LiNeBrEaKNewsprint $45 $162. 50LiNeBrEaKAcross Florida, a recycled soda can or newspaper can take many different paths, depending on where you live, whether you have curbside recycling and how the recycling companies disburse the items. In Pinellas County alone, more than a dozen municipalities offer curbside recycling as part of their garbage pickup, while St. Petersburg and the county offer dropoff recycling. All handle recycled goods in different ways, and plastic bottles in Gulfport may not end up in the same place as plastic bottles in St. Petersburg. To demonstrate, we looked at the journey an item might typically make in unincorporated Pinellas.LiNeBrEaKFIRST: A total of 229,870 tons of materials wasrecycled throughout all of Pinellas County last year. Of that, Pinellas took in 1,870 tons at 13 dropoff centers in unincorporated parts of the county. Clearwater generates the most recycled materials through its curbside program with 6,581 tons collected last year.LiNeBrEaKSECOND: Pinellas has contracted with SP Recycling Co. to pick up the items from its dropoff bins. The company's trucks drop off paper, aluminum, plastics and cardboards at its facility in Largo, where it is divided into several bays.LiNeBrEaKNewsprint, paper and junk mail are shipped to the company's paper mill in Dublin, Ga. These items can become a newspaper on your doorstep within a few days.LiNeBrEaKPlastics, aluminum and tin are sent to Polk County's materials recovery facility. The items are placed on a conveyor belt. Aluminum is kicked off the conveyor belt with an electrical current. It is typically sent to processors that make aluminum cans for Anheuser-Busch. Tin, such as soup and bean cans, is removed with magnets and sent to a company called Tube City in Birmingham, Ala., where it is remade into steel ingots and resold.LiNeBrEaKPlastics end up in another area and are sent to several companies, depending on the type of plastic. Clear water bottles, for example, go to Mohawk Industries Inc. in Georgia to be made into carpets and rugs. Colored bottles that once held laundry detergent go to companies like KW Plastics in Troy, Ala., where they are ground, washed and sold in pellet form to companies that make things like portable bathrooms and garbage cans.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 		December 22, 2008 Monday   4 State / Suncoast Edition	NAME OF THE BIG GAME: SAVING THE PLANET  	SUSAN THURSTON, Times Staff Writer  	TAMPA BAY; Pg. 3B  	548 words  	The Super Bowl, and all the hoopla that surrounds it, is going super green.LiNeBrEaKFrom powering the stadium on renewable energy to donating leftover food to the hungry, the NFL is sponsoring initiatives to offset the environmental impact of the big game. LiNeBrEaK"We have a sense of responsibility to leave the host community better than we found it,'' said Jack Groh, director of the NFL's environmental program.LiNeBrEaKThe program began 16 years ago with basic recycling and has expanded to include food donations, green energy and tree plantings. New this year: measuring tree growth to calculate the greenhouse gas impact of planting new trees. While the NFL admits the efforts don't completely negate the Super Bowl - and all the beer cans, plastic forks and car trips it generates - the initiatives do make a difference. Here are some of them.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energyLiNeBrEaKFor the first time in Tampa, biomass from plant waste and, to a lesser degree, solar energy will power the stadium on game day and during the NFL Experience, which runs for five days.LiNeBrEaKTampa Electric Co. will buy biomass energy from a South Florida provider, which will ship it through transmission lines into the TECO system. Solar energy will come from TECO and other providers. In all, the stadium and NFL Experience will consume an estimated 187,000 kilowatt hours. By comparison, a typical house uses 15,000 kilowatt hours per year.LiNeBrEaKTECO officials estimate that powering the Super Bowl with renewable energy will prevent more than 313,500 pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of taking 19 cars off the road for a year. It will increase the stadium's cost by about $5,000, which the NFL and its sponsors will pay.LiNeBrEaKTree plantingLiNeBrEaKThe NFL, with help from the U.S. Forest Service and the Florida Division of Forestry, is planting 2,700 trees at a dozen sites in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties to help offset the game's carbon impact.LiNeBrEaKScientists will measure the trees annually to calculate their long-term environmental benefits using software developed by the Forest Service. The new program will track the amount of air pollution, carbon dioxide and stormwater the trees absorb and quantify the trees' effects of cooling, said Charlie Marcus, urban forestry coordinator for the state. Generally, it takes five to 10 years for a tree to start reducing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKLeftover food donationLiNeBrEaKPrepared party food that doesn't make it to buffet tables will be donated to America's Second Harvest of Tampa Bay, which partners with 350 charities and churches to provide food to the needy.LiNeBrEaKFood will come from various Super Bowl parties, including some private events not connected to the NFL or the Tampa Bay Super Bowl Host Committee. During the last Super Bowl, 90,000 pounds of food were donated.LiNeBrEaKMaterials donationsLiNeBrEaKAll building materials, decorations, office equipment and supplies used in the preparation of the Super Bowl will be given to nonprofit groups to use or sell for cash.LiNeBrEaKItems range from rolls of carpeting to signs to plants. Estimated value: more than $300,000.LiNeBrEaKUsed book and sports equipment donationsLiNeBrEaKAbout 90 local schools are collecting books and sports equipment to give to local children. The donation drive continues through Jan. 22.LiNeBrEaKFor information on where to drop off items, call (813) 242-5346.

The Washington Times 		December 22, 2008 Monday 	Obama's inconvenient truth  	THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	LETTERS; A18  	165 words  	I couldn't help noticing the irony of the confluence of the story "Obama science-tech team takes aim at global warming" (Nation, Sunday) and Deroy Murdock's "Global cooling?" (Commentary, Sunday). LiNeBrEaKIn the former, Barack Obama says "Promoting science [is] ... about listening to what our scientists have to say even when it's inconvenient - especially inconvenient" In the latter, astrophysicist and long-range forecaster Piers Corbyn is quoted as saying that "Global Warming is over, and Global Warming Theory has failed. There is no evidence that CO2 drives world temperatures or any consequent climate change. ... every year since 1998, world temperatures have been colder than that year, yet CO2 has been rising rapidly"LiNeBrEaKIn view of Mr. Obama's rhetoric about global warming, one wonders if Mr. Corbyn's "inconvenient truth" is something to which Mr. Obama would be willing to listen, particularly in a time when man-made stress on the economy is the last thing needed.LiNeBrEaKROBERT WILCOXLiNeBrEaKFalls Church	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); GLOBAL WARMING (92%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%) Obama's-inconvenient-truth  		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  		December 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Washington Times LLC All Rights Reserved  															
Wyoming Tribune-Eagle  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 22, 2008 Monday 	Central grad takes love of outdoors to great heights  	Baylie Davis, Wyoming Tribune-Eagle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	591 words  	Dec. 22--CHEYENNE -- Describing Scott Laursen, a 1993 graduate of Cheyenne's Central High, as "outdoorsy" would be an understatement.LiNeBrEaKEver since he was a kid he has loved being outside. His best memories are of fishing, hunting and camping with his dad.LiNeBrEaKToday, he takes his outdoorsy spirit into the wild, hoping to teach people about this planet by immersing them in untamed areas. LiNeBrEaKAfter high school, Laursen attended Saint Olaf College in Minnesota. There, he earned a degree in biology with a concentration in environment studies.LiNeBrEaKThe liberal arts background he got helped to shape his interest in the connections between culture and nature, he said.LiNeBrEaKHe graduated magna cum laude in 1997 and worked for Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources.LiNeBrEaKHe managed park ecosystems and reintroducing fire to areas of the state. He also spent several years working on projects like removing exotic and invasive plant species and reintroducing native plants.LiNeBrEaKIn 1998 he moved back to Wyoming to study ecosystem ecology at the University of Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKHe describes that as studying ecosystem processes as a whole, how everything is connected and how water, air and land work together.LiNeBrEaKHe graduated in 2001 and spent about a year studying historic vegetation and climate interactions in Wyoming. He researched climates from hundreds and thousands of years ago to better understand the current climate.LiNeBrEaKHe spent another several years researching threatened animal species in Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKIn 2004 he got involved in education programs through Wildlife Expeditions of the Teton Science Schools in Jackson and Natural Habitat Adventures in Boulder, Colo.LiNeBrEaKHe now takes small groups on one- or two-week expeditions in Yellowstone and Alaska with the goal of teaching them about humanity's role on the planet.LiNeBrEaKThe groups stay in cabins and simple hotels to observe wolves, polar bears, grizzlies, brown bears and orcas close up in their native environments.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is not just to learn about the natural world, but to learn about our impact in it," he said.LiNeBrEaKAlso, he now works with the Wyoming State Climate Office, studying historical climate patterns.LiNeBrEaKHumans settled on this land during a particularly wet season, he said. Land-use and water rights were established then, and now that the climate is closer to average, there is less water to go around.LiNeBrEaK"Water availability is going to be a huge issue in the state," he said.LiNeBrEaKAs for the current issues like global warming, Laursen says human impact on the planet is undeniable.LiNeBrEaK"We simply have been living outside of our means, outside of the Earth's means ... and we're realizing that that's not sustainable," he said.LiNeBrEaKHis mission, he said, is to understand the impact of humans' daily decisions on the land around them and to educate others about that impact.LiNeBrEaKAs for the future of his career, "I certainly will be involved in becoming a better naturalist," he said.LiNeBrEaKShari Goodwin, Laursen's older sister, said her brother is known for being the best at what he does. Their parents raised them to understand the importance of communication, she said.LiNeBrEaK"His form of communication is communicating with the natural world."

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	289 words  	Dec. 22--A new task force on climate change in Skagit County will start work next month, assuming that county commissioners name the 15-member citizens group as scheduled Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKThe Climate Action and Sustainability Task Force will work through 2009 on a Climate Action Program for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The commissioners passed a resolution in June to reduce regional emissions of greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 2000 levels by 2050.LiNeBrEaKSo-called greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide from vehicle exhaust, are responsible for increasing global temperatures.LiNeBrEaKCommissioners are scheduled to hear a presentation on the task force's plan for next year and appoint the 15 members at 10: 30 a.m. Tuesday in the commissioners' hearing room at 1800 Continental Place, Mount Vernon.LiNeBrEaKNo names have been proposed yet for the task force, county attorney Ryan Walters said Friday.LiNeBrEaKMore information on the county's climate change and sustainability program is on the Web at www.skagitcounty.net/sustainability.LiNeBrEaKAlso Tuesday, Commissioner Ken Dahlstedt will be sworn into office for his third term. Ron Wesen, elected to the commissioner's seat vacated by Don Munks, also will be sworn in during the ceremony, to be conducted by Skagit County Judge John Meyer at 4 p.m. in the hearing room.

The Boston Globe 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Genome mapper picked for presidential council  	Carolyn Y. Johnson Globe Staff  	NATIONAL; Pg. A27  	446 words  	A NEW PRESIDENTLiNeBrEaKA second local scientist - Eric S. Lander of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard - was tapped by President-elect Barack Obama yesterday to join his slate of high-profile advisers. LiNeBrEaKObama officially named Lander as cochair of a presidential council of advisers on science and technology. Lander, a biologist who focuses on human genome research, joins physicist John P. Holdren of the Harvard Kennedy School, whose selection was confirmed last week and made official yesterday.LiNeBrEaKLander is founding director of the Broad Institute, and a leader in trying to leverage the knowledge of the human genome to better understand basic issues in medicine and find cures for disease.LiNeBrEaKLander "was one of the driving forces behind mapping the human genome - one of the greatest scientific achievements in history," Obama said in his Saturday morning radio address, which focused on the importance of science in such issues as bioterror, global warming, and medical research. LiNeBrEaK"Today, more than ever before, science holds the key to our survival as a planet and our security and prosperity as a nation," Obama said. "It is time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and worked to restore America's place as the world leader in science and technology."LiNeBrEaKLander, he said, "will be a powerful voice in my administration as we seek to find the causes and cures of our most devastating diseases."LiNeBrEaKReached at home, Lander said that he had met with Obama twice so far and could not yet say what areas of science would be prioritized.LiNeBrEaK"It of course is an honor, but it's more the responsibility to serve right now," Lander said. "I can't think of a time when the problems and challenges facing the country - environment and energy, healthcare, education - had more to do with science and technology than they do today."LiNeBrEaKThe appointment adds to a strong slate of scientific appointments.LiNeBrEaKJane Lubchenco, a prominent environmental scientist from Oregon State University, internationally known for her work on marine and coastal issues, was chosen to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The Boston Globe 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Maine's GOP senators may control the moderate middle  	Sasha Issenberg Globe Staff  	NATIONAL; Pg. A1  	1028 words  	WASHINGTON - For years, Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins have been treated as conjoined political twins: a pair of moderate Republican women, often ideologically indistinguishable, ready to move as a unit whenever deals are being cut in the Senate's center.LiNeBrEaKWhen the chamber convenes next month under strengthened Democratic control, the duo from Maine will emerge as a likely balance of power on major legislation as Senate majority leader Harry Reid struggles to corral the 60 votes necessary to end a minority filibuster. LiNeBrEaK"They'll be knocking at the door of Collins and Snowe quite frequently," said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist who served earlier this year as a scholar-in-residence in Reid's office.LiNeBrEaKIn interviews last week, both Snowe and Collins volunteered themselves as bridges between the two parties, suggesting a willingness to find common ground on some of the elements of Barack Obama's agenda that could prove the most contentious, including economic stimulus, energy, and healthcare. Each senator said separately that Obama's campaign-year rhetoric about the need for consensus-building appears to open new possibilities for them to lead in a bipartisan fashion.LiNeBrEaK"I sense that President-elect Obama is truly genuine and forthright about getting to work across the aisle," Snowe said. "The White House and administration have not been bringing people into the process. ... If you're not willing to take the risk of working across the political aisle, you lose the chance to do major things for the country."LiNeBrEaKOthers agree that it could be, as Snowe suggests, a climate-changing moment for Beltway moderates.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration's way of dealing with them was `my way or the highway,"' said Christian Potholm, a Maine political consultant and Bowdoin College government professor. "I get the sense that with Obama, wherever he comes down on policy, that won't be his operating style: It's going to be a more open, more fluid dynamic. To that extent, they may be more important now than under the last administration."LiNeBrEaKDemocrats will begin the session with 58 or 59 members in their caucus, depending on the results of an unresolved, and still contentious, recount in Minnesota. Before recessing until Monday, the panel put Democrat Al Franken's lead over incumbent Republican Norm Coleman at a couple hundred votes with disputed ballots still outstanding, the Minneapolis Star Tribune said.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic leaders will often need at least one Republican to bring legislation to a vote.LiNeBrEaKBoth Snowe and Collins said they had been meeting with Obama's future Cabinet secretaries and White House aides to discuss their legislative priorities. Collins said that she recognized overlapping interests with Obama on healthcare and climate-change issues, based on conversations with Peter Orszag, the congressional-budget adviser whom Obama has named to run his Office of Management and Budget.LiNeBrEaK"I'm convinced by discussions I've had with the new OMB director and the vice-president-elect that the administration is going to tackle healthcare reform," Collins said. "I think the outlines of his plans are something I could work with."LiNeBrEaKSnowe said she wants to use her post as a senior member of the Finance Committee to help craft the stimulus package that Obama has indicated will be his leading legislative priority when he takes office.LiNeBrEaK"I'm prepared to play that role in order to focus on solutions," Snowe said. "The only way I know how to get things done is sitting down and working through the issues."LiNeBrEaKThe two are the most liberal Republicans in the chamber, according to ideological ratings developed by the National Journal based on 2007 votes. ("You have to be almost a political theologian to figure out the differences" between the two ideologically, said Baker.) They have played a crucial role in past Senate compromises, including the "Gang of 14" compromise over judicial appointments in 2005.LiNeBrEaKSnowe and Collins joined the majority of Democrats to support a recent auto-industry bailout backed by both Obama and President Bush. In that vote, they stood alongside two other Northern Republican moderates, Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter and Ohio's George Voinovich. They, too, are likely to also be targets of Reid efforts, although both are up for reelection in 2010 and potentially vulnerable to conservative primary challenges that could make them more wary of cross-party alliances.LiNeBrEaKSnowe and Collins are overwhelmingly popular in a state that has long rewarded centrists of both parties. This fall, amid national difficulties for Republicans, Collins was reelected against Congressman Tom Allen, a liberal challenger who did little to unsettle the incumbent's broad base of support. She ended up winning by 23 points, an even larger margin than Obama's in the state.LiNeBrEaKAs Democrats work to assemble a coalition capable of breaking a filibuster, Reid - along with future vice president Joe Biden and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, both experienced Capitol Hill negotiators - will have to weigh when it is best to approach persuadable Republicans and wavering Democrats with a carrot (support for pet causes) or a stick (threats of political retribution).LiNeBrEaK"I don't think you need to use a very big stick on them. ... If the Democrats need Collins and Snowe on something, they will be able to activate strong Democratic interest-group pressure in Maine," Baker said. "If there are important issues and Obama needs the votes, I don't think you're going to see them standing up as obstructionists."LiNeBrEaKThe circumstances, however, offer Maine's senators particular leverage in the coming session, which Collins said she would use to help wrest Pentagon shipbuilding contracts for Bath Iron Works.LiNeBrEaK"I think there is an opportunity here to help shape many things to take account of the special needs of the state of Maine," Collins said.LiNeBrEaKFor Collins and Snowe, the current situation mimics that of former Maine senator Margaret Chase Smith, who was far more effective under the Democratic administrations of Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson than she was when a fellow Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, occupied the White House, according to Potholm.

The Boston Globe 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	The Savior of the Seas Greg Stone has been working to defend our oceans for decades, but creating the world's largest marine protected area made 2008 his defining year.  	BY NEIL SWIDEY  	MAGAZINE; Pg. 28  	972 words  	BOSTONIANS OF THE YEARLiNeBrEaKHere's the thing about bold strokes of conservation: There are always lots of logical reasons why they shouldn't happen, at least not right then.LiNeBrEaKIn 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a law creating Yellowstone National Park. The idea - preserving an unspoiled ecosystem that yawned across more than 3,000 square miles - was at the time radical to the point of being preposterous. How else to explain why it would be a new country just emerging from a Treasury-depleting civil war that would step forward to create the world's first national park? Yellowstone happened only because it had a few relentless visionaries pushing for it and not many other people paying much attention. The massive new park received no federal funds, forcing its unpaid superintendent to moonlight at another job.LiNeBrEaKIt is impossible to imagine another Yellowstone being created today. There'd be so many private landowners and moneyed interests bickering about it that it would never get past its first public hearing. LiNeBrEaKIn fact, there aren't many great swaths of unspoiled green earth left to be preserved. The blue stuff is our best hope now, and nobody gets that better than Greg Stone.LiNeBrEaKWhat began nearly a decade ago with an unexpected invitation from a dive-boat captain in Fiji to explore the Central Pacific waters around the Phoenix Islands has turned into the cause of a lifetime for the 51-year-old Stone. The vice president of global marine programs for the New England Aquarium, Stone divides his time between Boston and New Zealand and has dived the world over. But everything changed for him in 2000 when he sank down into the pristine waters around the mostly unpopulated eight-atoll necklace that is the Phoenix Islands, located halfway between Hawaii and Fiji. As he gazed at the coral reef that looked dealer-showroom new, and he was swarmed by schools of fish so dense they blocked the sunlight and so diverse that some of them were unknown to science, Stone was blown away. "It must have been what it felt like for Lewis and Clark," he says. "We saw what the oceans were like a thousand years ago."LiNeBrEaKOther marine lovers might have been content to spread the news to their colleagues and move on, or to document the discoveries lurking below the surface. Stone did both those things. But he also decided to do more. He was determined to preserve this underwater wonderland so that divers a century from now might enjoy the same transformative experience, rather than finding yet another ecosystem ravaged by overfishing and pollution and all the other calling cards we humans tend to leave behind. And he knew that by limiting these human-caused stressors, the coral reefs would have a better shot of surviving the corrosive effects of global climate change.LiNeBrEaKStone spent years in shuttle diplomacy with the government of the tiny Micronesian Republic of Kiribati (KIR-ee-bahs) that controls the Phoenix Islands and the waters around it. He crafted a plan that would turn the area into a protected marine reserve and close it off from commercial fishing. Because fees from foreign commercial fishing companies accounted for a big chunk of Kiribati's annual revenues, Stone enlisted the environmental group Conservation International to create an endowment that would compensate the nation of roughly 100,000 people for the lost revenue. In 2006, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (phoenixislands.org) became a reality, but Stone didn't stop there. He deepened his partnership with Kiribati's president, Anote Tong, who was educated at the London School of Economics and has brought a forward-thinking approach to leading his nation.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this year, Kiribati officially doubled the size of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area - to more than 158,000 square miles, or about 50 times the size of Yellowstone - making it the largest marine protected area in the world.LiNeBrEaK"Greg has very much been the push behind this," Tong says. "We've become good friends. We trust each other, understand each other."LiNeBrEaKStone, who is married, grew up in Walpole and Framingham, compensating for his landlocked status by swimming at the Y and wearing his mask as he sat in front of the TV watching Jacques Cousteau specials and Sea Hunt. These days, he has wispy hair and a scruffy beard and a CV and passport that suggest a sort of swashbuckling Indiana Jones of the seas. In reality, he's a soft-spoken, modest guy who knows how to forge relationships. And that may explain his groundbreaking success as much as his relentless advocacy.LiNeBrEaKThat, and a lot of luck. In the winter of 2005, as he fretted about whether the Phoenix Islands plan would win approval, Stone watched a PBS documentary about NASA's Exploration Rover team and its hunt for evidence of past water on Mars. One of the planetary geologists featured in the documentary had spent 15 years trying to prove that a certain crater was once the site of an enormous lake. But after the rover landed, it became clear she'd been spectacularly wrong.LiNeBrEaK"You do research, do exploration, and you hope for a good outcome," Stone says. "But you can't guarantee that it will come."LiNeBrEaKHis legacy is far from done. Not long ago, as he was walking down a hot road in La Paz, Mexico, his cellphone rang. It was a Bush administration official who knew about his work in the Phoenix Islands and wanted some advice. Watching the clock wind down on his presidency, George Bush, who already had created one large marine protected area in the Pacific in 2007, was contemplating two more. He may not leave the White House with much of a green legacy, but he could well have a blue one.LiNeBrEaKStone smiles at the prospect of nations outdoing one another to lay claim to having the world's largest protected area. "I'm happy," he says, "to be in an arms race to protect the ocean."LiNeBrEaKE-mail Neil Swidey at swidey@globe.com	NATIONAL PARKS (90%); MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (90%); ISLANDS and REEFS (89%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (89%); SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES (78%); ZOOS and AQUARIUMS (78%); PUBLIC HEARINGS (72%); CLIMATE CHANGE (63%)  			BOSTON, MA, USA (93%) MASSACHUSETTS, USA (93%); HAWAII, USA (79%); NORTHEAST USA (54%) UNITED STATES (93%); KIRIBATI (92%); FIJI (92%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved  			PRESERVING PARADISE "It must have been what it felt like for Lewis and Clark.

Reg1  	1211 words  	GLOBE NORTHWEST 1 / REGIONLiNeBrEaKClimate change is causing more intense storms in Boston's suburbs, scientists say. That means more storm water is expected to flow over local streets in the coming years, picking up more oil, salt, and lawn fertilizer as it travels and dumping more of those pollutants in local lakes and streams.LiNeBrEaKTo handle the predicted deluges, scientists at a recent regional conference in Maynard recommend following the example of officials in Littleton: Plant perennials.LiNeBrEaKFor years, Littleton officials would close the public beach at Long Lake a few times each summer because of public health concerns over pollution from storm-water runoff. The town could have installed miles of pipe and built pumping stations and a treatment plant to keep the lake clean, but that would have cost millions. LiNeBrEaKInstead, using $630,000 in state grants and other funding, they built rain gardens - small patches of perennials planted on top of fresh soil and trap rock, created 1. 5 acres of new wetlands, laid down porous pavement and sculpted "swales," or small depressions in the land, that direct storm water underground, rather than into the lake.LiNeBrEaKSince 2002, when the work was completed, the beach hasn't been closed once.LiNeBrEaK"Let the natural contours take care of the water flow," said Savas Danos, who oversaw the Long Lake cleanup as general manager of the Littleton Electric Light and Water Departments. "You get more ground water, sediments are stopped, and nutrients that cause algae blooms are taken up by the plants. It's flood control."LiNeBrEaKDanos spoke earlier this month at the annual conference of the SuAsCo Watershed Community Council, a nonprofit that advocates for the health of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord rivers and surrounding areas. At the conference, experts said measures like Littleton's rain gardens are likely to become more common.LiNeBrEaKBetween 1948 and 2006, precipitation in Massachusetts and New Hampshire increased by 120 percent, said Iulia Barbu, a conference speaker and research assistant at the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center, which was created in 2004 to test ways to mitigate heavy rainfall.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is intensifying," said Barbu. "We have great potential for flooding."LiNeBrEaKGlenn Hodgkins, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey who spoke at the conference, said local rivers have been swelling earlier and with more intensity in recent years in part because of the increased precipitation. He believes the region's flood-control infrastructure will have to be expanded.LiNeBrEaK"Peak flows seem to be up in New England," said Hodgkins. "If peak flows are up, you'll need to be able to handle more water."LiNeBrEaKFederal and state officials have already taken steps to manage storm water in Massachusetts. Last month, the EPA proposed new rules in the Charles River watershed that compel landowners with 2 or more acres of parking lots and other impervious surfaces to reduce their storm-water runoff.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, the state Department of Environmental Protection instituted a similar rule statewide that applies to landowners with 5 or more acres, though inside the Charles River watershed the DEP also adopted the 2-acre rule.LiNeBrEaK"Storm water is the single largest cause of pollution today in the Commonwealth," said DEP Commissioner Laurie Burt at the conference.LiNeBrEaKLandowners have 10 years to comply with the state regulations. EPA officials are currently testing their proposed rules with a pilot program in Bellingham, Franklin, and Milford. It is unclear when they might expand the rules to all 35 communities in the watershed.LiNeBrEaKThe Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord rivers' watershed is especially vulnerable to pollution because development is quickly gobbling up the wilderness and open space that filters storm water flowing through the area, said Martin Pillsbury, manager of regional planning at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council.LiNeBrEaKIn 1999, the last time studies were conducted, the three rivers' watershed had 23,150 acres of impervious surface, or 12 percent of the watershed's area in total. In 1971, when the previous study was conducted, only 17,100 acres were covered.LiNeBrEaK"Clearly, growth and development over the last three decades of the 20th century resulted in a significant increase in impervious coverage," said Pillsbury.LiNeBrEaKAnother hydrologist at the conference, Scott Horsley of the Horsley Witten Group, said his business has grown as new water controls are slated to become either mandatory, as in the Charles River watershed, or popular, as in Littleton. His clients are discovering that rain gardens and swales are inexpensive but can be as effective at managing water as drains and culverts, which now require sophisticated equipment to conform to clean water standards, he said.LiNeBrEaKHorsley helps clients build rooftops with vegetation to capture rain water, porous parking lots with mesh concrete pavement that allow rain water to percolate downward, and other tools. Many of the measures are simple to undertake, he said, but they often aren't required by local regulations, so many builders don't bother with them.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, zoning regulations often require developers to build in ways that manage storm water poorly, Horsley said. Wide roads are often designed so that large fire engines have room to maneuver on them, for example, but they also create more impervious surfaces that speed water elsewhere rather than retaining the rain and recharging ground water.LiNeBrEaK"We're probably making roads wider than they need to be," said Horsley. "The only reason we're building those roads is because the local codes say that's the way they should be. The developers don't like them. The people don't like them."LiNeBrEaKKevin Maguire, a developer who recently completed 89 Oxbow, a 16-unit housing development in Wayland, said the town's fire chief waived the requirement for a cul-de-sac to allow fire trucks to turn around. That allowed Maguire to increase the density of the community and preserve more grassy surfaces to absorb rainfall.LiNeBrEaKEighty-nine Oxbow was a Chapter 40B project, meaning it was proposed under state rules that allow developers to bypass local zoning as long as one-quarter of the development is sold at affordable prices. The developer still needs to negotiate with the town on site plans to gain permission to build, however. In the case of 89 Oxbow, town officials wanted a "green" development, which Maguire was happy to provide.LiNeBrEaK"I'm just trying to build really good housing for people," he said. "When it comes to green, it can be done."LiNeBrEaKEighty-nine Oxbow has swales that keep water from running into the street, rain gardens that capture water, and rain barrels that store water to be used to water lawns. The development also has solar panels on its houses and other energy-saving features.LiNeBrEaKMost builders are open to smaller roads, rain gardens, and landscaping that controls flooding, said Jeff Rhuda, business development manager at Symes Associates, a Beverly-based commercial builder. In the end, he said, those measures are usually inexpensive compared with more traditional construction.LiNeBrEaK"You can either pipe the water, or you can build a nice swale on the side on the road and allow nature to do what nature does," said "Which do you think is much cheaper?"

The town could have installed miles of pipe and built pumping stations and a treatment plant to keep the lake clean, but that would have cost millions.LiNeBrEaKInstead, using $630,000 in state grants and other funding, they built rain gardens - small patches of perennials planted on top of fresh soil and trap rock, created 1. 5 acres of new wetlands, laid down porous pavement and sculpted "swales," or small depressions in the land, that direct storm water underground, rather than into the lake.LiNeBrEaKSince 2002, when the work was completed, the beach hasn't been closed once.LiNeBrEaK"Let the natural contours take care of the water flow," said Savas Danos, who oversaw the Long Lake cleanup as general manager of the Littleton Electric Light and Water Departments. "You get more ground water, sediments are stopped, and nutrients that cause algae blooms are taken up by the plants. It's flood control."LiNeBrEaKDanos spoke earlier this month at the annual conference of the SuAsCo Watershed Community Council, a nonprofit that advocates for the health of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord rivers and surrounding areas. At the conference, experts said measures like Littleton's rain gardens are likely to become more common.LiNeBrEaKBetween 1948 and 2006, precipitation in Massachusetts and New Hampshire increased by 120 percent, said Iulia Barbu, a conference speaker and research assistant at the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center, which was created in 2004 to test ways to mitigate heavy rainfall.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is intensifying," said Barbu. "We have great potential for flooding."LiNeBrEaKGlenn Hodgkins, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey who spoke at the conference, said local rivers have been swelling earlier and with more intensity in recent years in part because of the increased precipitation. He believes the region's flood-control infrastructure will have to be expanded.LiNeBrEaK"Peak flows seem to be up in New England," said Hodgkins. "If peak flows are up, you'll need to be able to handle more water."

The Boston Globe 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Green-light this water power  		EDITORIAL; Pg. D8  	467 words  	IT DIDN'T make page one headlines, but New England is in line to get a new infusion of electricity that will provide more power than the Seabrook nuclear plant, and with limited greenhouse gas emissions. It is the proposal of NStar and Northeast Utilities, which owns the Western Massachusetts Electric Co., to contract with Hydro-Quebec for 1,200 megawatts of the Canadian province's abundant hydropower. LiNeBrEaKNew England has long imported Quebec hydropower, especially in the summer months, when this region's electricity demand peaks. Under the proposed arrangement, which needs a green light from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Canadian electricity would be an even greater part of this region's year-round, baseload capacity. Federal approval is needed because the utilities plan a transmission line - on an existing right-of-way - into southern New Hampshire. The line would be exclusively for this power, so that it could be accessed when needed, and customers not using the power would be spared the line's cost. FERC prefers other utilities have use of lines as well. The commission should give the project its blessing.LiNeBrEaKThe least polluting and least costly way to meet the demand for electricity is to reduce it through conservation and greater efficiency. The utilities acknowledge that. But if they can get a competitive price for the imported hydropower, they can curb New England's dependence on gas-fired power plants, which now supply about 40 percent of the region's electricity. The cost of that fuel is one reason New England electric rates are among the nation's highest.LiNeBrEaKThat is not the only drawback to over-dependence on one fuel. The operator of the region's grid, ISO New England, recently issued a report raising concern about the threat to "system reliability" posed by the large and growing role of natural gas.LiNeBrEaKHydropower is not emission-free, but compared with fossil-fuel power it has the carbon footprint of Cinderella. The trees flooded over in Quebec behind the power dams decompose and emit methane, which bubbles up into the atmosphere. As a greenhouse gas, methane is 27 times as potent as carbon dioxide, but the total greenhouse effect, kilowatt for kilowatt, is still significantly less than a fossil-fuel plant's.LiNeBrEaKMassachusetts's new green energy law stipulates that a utility using imported hydropower does not get credit for it under the Renewable Portfolio Standard, which is aimed at encouraging solar, wind, and other renewable sources. But the hydropower's reduced carbon emissions would help utilities meet the requirements of the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.LiNeBrEaKThe utilities' proposal will have other regulatory hurdles to clear before the line is built and power flows south. At this stage at least, the plan deserves FERC's approval.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	After assembling Cabinet, Barack Obama must re-invent wheel: President-elect's eclectic picks have been tasked with massive change  	Peter Nicholas and Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	746 words  	Dec. 21--WASHINGTON -- The Cabinet of President-elect Barack Obama is a largely centrist and pragmatic-minded collection of politicians and technocrats without a pronounced ideological bent. Liberals are satisfied but not delighted. Conservatives say the nominees aren't as leftist as they'd feared. Powerful interest groups with conflicting agendas are appeased.LiNeBrEaKBut compared with what comes next, assembling the team was the easy part. LiNeBrEaKObama wants this Cabinet to market and put in place the most dramatic policy changes in the country since Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal: A mammoth program to improve roads and bridges; a health-care system that covers more sick people at less cost; limitations on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming; big investments in energy efficiency; middle-class tax cuts along with a tax hike on wealthy Americans. For Obama to impose this ambitious agenda, he'll need to make people angry. And that will strain the fragile political coalition he has painstakingly built.LiNeBrEaKIn the short term, Obama's Cabinet nominations strengthen him politically. Even Capitol Hill Republicans say they are reassured by his selections.LiNeBrEaK"His appointments overall are such that he's lived up to the best expectations of his rhetoric," said Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif). "He's choosing intellectuals and scientists and other notables that no one would disagree are good advisers to him. He's going to get the benefit of the doubt based on his appointments in many areas."LiNeBrEaKObama has picked an eclectic group.LiNeBrEaKIn choosing former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and revamp the nation's health-care system, Obama seems intent on avoiding the mistakes of the last major attempt to improve health care. When Bill Clinton pushed a health-care overhaul in 1993 -- an initiative led by his wife -- he was criticized for not working more cooperatively with Congress.LiNeBrEaKAs a Capitol Hill veteran, Daschle is less likely to repeat that mistake, health-care advocates said, predicting he would court members of Congress in ways the Clinton team never did.LiNeBrEaKRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health-care consumer advocacy group, said Daschle has already reached out to all sides of the reform debate. Meantime, doctors, insurers, and business and labor leaders are privately meeting to reach a consensus on how the new system should be designed.LiNeBrEaK"It's likely to be less contentious than last time," Pollack said. "Tom Daschle is an excellent listener. He has his own ideas, but he also has an excellent personal touch."LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, Obama often seemed reluctant to take concrete stands that might alienate important interest groups. Now that he is elected, some Washington lobbyists and elected officials point to emerging signs that he's willing to disappoint his political base.LiNeBrEaKThey cite the announcement that Rick Warren, the pastor who opposes gay marriage and abortion, will deliver the invocation at Obama's swearing-in. Gay rights leaders and others criticized the choice, citing Warren's support for a California ballot proposition banning same-sex marriage. But Obama's willingness to endure the backlash may foreshadow battles ahead.LiNeBrEaKIf Obama's Cabinet lacks a strong ideology, its main value may lie in the individuals' technical skills in delivering on the transformational agenda he promised.LiNeBrEaKInterest groups expect the beginning of a major push to curb greenhouse gases so as to confront the threat of global warming.LiNeBrEaKObama's "green team" selections include Nobel winner Steven Chu for secretary of energy; Carol Browner, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as energy and climate adviser; New Jersey's Lisa Jackson as EPA chief and Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar as secretary of interior.LiNeBrEaKAll have records of pushing anti-warming measures.LiNeBrEaK"These are people who understand the seriousness of the situation and realize we don't have much time" to act, said David Bookbinder, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKpnicholas@tribune.comLiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.com	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); POLITICS (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); HEALTH CARE (89%); LEGISLATORS (78%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (78%); HEALTH CARE REFORM (74%); EMISSIONS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (74%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (74%); LOBBYING (74%); TAX LAW (73%); TAX INCREASES (73%); INSURANCE (71%); GLOBAL WARMING (69%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (68%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (55%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (54%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); OBAMA HEALTH CARE REFORM (78%)  	General  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); TOM DASCHLE (82%); DARRELL E ISSA (54%); BILL CLINTON (53%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (89%) ILLINOIS, USA (89%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081221-TB-After-assembling-Cabinet-Barack-Obama-must-re-invent-wheel-1221  	Newspaper  	TB  	2008 Chicago Tribune   															
Daily News (New York) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	BAM TAKES SCIENCE COURSE. TAPS SLOAN-KETTERING CHIEF, GORE ADVISER FOR TOP SPOTS  	BY CELESTE KATZ DAILY NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT  	NEWS; Pg. 8  	393 words  	A NEW YORKER who captured the Nobel Prize for his genetics research will become one of President-elect Barack Obama's top science advisers.LiNeBrEaKObama has tapped Dr. Harold Varmus, a Long Island native and head of the city's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, as part of a new science and technology team that will tackle climate change, energy independence and health. LiNeBrEaKTaking a page straight out of Al Gore's global warming playbook, Obama said yesterday that advancing American science is "about listening to what our scientists have to say, even when it's inconvenient - especially when it's inconvenient."LiNeBrEaKUnderscoring Obama's focus on addressing global warming, the President-elect named John Holdren his director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.LiNeBrEaKHoldren, a Harvard physicist and energy expert, has been outspoken on climate change and advised Gore on his famed documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth."LiNeBrEaKObama's selections were heralded by some as an about-face from the Bush Administration's sometimes-strained relationship with the science community on issues like pollution and stem-cell research.LiNeBrEaKBut Varmus, who will work with MIT's Eric Lander on the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, told the Daily News that politics are far from his mind.LiNeBrEaK"What I'm focused on is the fact that we have some serious problems and we have a new President who is going to ask scientists to help solve them," said Varmus, 69.LiNeBrEaK"One of the things that really attracts me to Barack Obama is that he sees the connections in our society between education, science, health, energy [and] climate," he added.LiNeBrEaKVarmus, who grew up in Freeport, L.I., received a Nobel Prize in 1989 for his studies of genes that influence how normal cells grow into cancerous tumor cells.LiNeBrEaKIn his new advisory position, Varmus - who grew up frolicking on Jones Beach before attending Amherst College and Columbia Medical School - says he will remain in Manhattan and at his job overseeing Sloan-Kettering.LiNeBrEaKVarmus "is not just a path-breaking scientist, having won a Nobel Prize for his research on the causes of cancer - he also served as Director of the National Institutes of Health during the Clinton Administration," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKObama also named ecologist Jane Lubchenco as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ckatz@nydailynews.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); APPOINTMENTS (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); NOBEL PRIZES (89%); AWARDS and PRIZES (89%); CANCER (89%); MATH and SCIENCE EDUCATION (89%); RESEARCH (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); SCIENCE POLICY (78%); GENES and CHROMOSOMES (78%); GOVERNMENT RESEARCH FUNDING (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); CARCINOGENS (77%); WEATHER (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (74%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (74%); STEM CELL RESEARCH (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (71%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); GRADUATE and PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS (61%) BARACK OBAMA; APPOINTMENT; AIDE; SCIENCE; weather; HAROLD VARMUS  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); AL GORE (92%)  	NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%) NEW YORK, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 29, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Daily News, L.P.

Daily News (New York) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	FAST LANE. Looking back, 15 minutes at a time: 2008's short-term celebs  	BY GINA SALAMONE  	SUNDAY NOW; Pg. 18  	1929 words  	In a year when Joe the Plumber was just as popular as the presidential candidates who made him famous, there were plenty of other average Joes who jumped from the shadows into the spotlight.LiNeBrEaKSome caught our eye for their acts of courage, while others stood out for their shockingly bad behavior. Here are 15 people who will likely fade from our memory just as fast as they rose to fame in 2008.LiNeBrEaKMichael ForbesLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Standing up to Donald Trump. The Scottish fisherman had refused to sell his family farm to the Donald, who wanted the land for a $1. 5 billion golf resort he's building. Trump reportedly offered him $900,000 for his 23 acres on the coast of Aberdeenshire, but Forbes's response was, "He can go back to his own country and bother someone else." LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Trump later shot back, "Keep the land, we don't need it," and the Scottish government approved plans for the resort last month.LiNeBrEaKAlain RobertLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Climbing the New York Times building. The French daredevil - who has also scaled the Sears Tower and the Empire State Building - took on the challenge in June. Lunchtime crowds flocked to watch him scale the building at Eighth Ave. and 41st St. Robert made the climb without ropes, but with a message: When he reached the 15th floor, he unraveled a banner protesting global warming.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Later that day, a second climber - Renaldo Clarke of Brooklyn - got upset that the Frenchman had beat him to the stunt, and scaled the Times building himself. This month, Robert pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to three days of community service and fined $250.LiNeBrEaKAshley DupreLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Being Eliot Spitzer's prized prostitute. Known as "Kristen" by clients of the Emperors Club VIP escort service, Dupre allegedly cost the then-governor $4,300 for a romp at the luxury Mayflower Hotel in Washington last February. Dupre, who grew up in New Jersey but was living in a Chelsea high-rise at the time of the bust, told on her MySpace page of her dreams to be a blues singer. "I live in New York and am on top of the world," she shared. "I love this city and my life here."LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: The scandal led Spitzer to resign in March. It was later discovered that Dupre appeared in a "Girls Gone Wild" special, "Spring Break 2003," which included a "shower scene" and "girl-on-girl action." Her lawyer argued that Dupre was only 17 when the footage was shot, but "Girls Gone Wild" founder Joe Francis says he has "fake ID" on file that says she was 18 at the time. Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss has reportedly offered Dupre a book deal with her publishing company.LiNeBrEaKLaura FayLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Having Staten Island Rep. Vito Fossella's love child. Fay made headlines in May after Fossella was busted for driving drunk in Virginia. During the arrest, the boozed-up congressman told cops that he was headed to pick up his daughter to take her to the hospital. Fossella was later released into the custody of Fay, a retired Air Force colonel. Fossella, who's married and has three kids in Staten Island, later admitted he'd been having a long-term affair with FayLiNeBrEaKand was the father of her now-4-year-old daughter.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Fossella's been mum on whether he reconciled with his wife or made a new life with Fay. But he sported an unadorned ring finger at his recent DWI hearing, and his wife was absent from a luncheon in his honor. Looks like he's available, Laura!LiNeBrEaKMiladin KovacevicLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Allegedly beating a Brooklyn college student and fleeing the country. The 6-foot-9, 280-pound basketball player from Serbia is accused of assaulting fellow Binghamton University student Bryan Steinhauer at a bar on May 4. Witnesses say Kovacevic and two buddies stomped Steinhauer into a coma. Kovacevic was arrested, but days after he posted $100,000 bail, he fled the country with an illegally issued passport.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES:LiNeBrEaKSerbian cops caught up with Kovacevic in October and haveLiNeBrEaKkept him imprisoned in Belgrade while prosecutors build a case against him. At the end of November, a Serbian court extended his detention for another month for fear Kovacevic would flee if was released.LiNeBrEaKMindy McCreadyLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Further tarnishing Roger Clemens' reputation. She's been crooning country music for years, but her career didn't earn her nearly as much attention as she got when she was outed for having a decade-long affair with the married former Yankees pitcher. News about the romance that began when McCready was just a teen broke in April, as the government stepped up its investigation of whether Clemens lied under oath about using steroids.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: On Wednesday, McCready was hospitalized in Nashville after apparently trying to kill herself. The 33-year-old country music singer suffered a nervous breakdown in July and was treated at a Texas rehab center.LiNeBrEaKjoe PetckaLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Killing his girlfriend's cat. The Brooklyn wanna-be actor was arrested in April 2007 on charges of felony cruelty to animals. Petcka, who pitched for a Mets minor-league team in 1992 and had a small role in a 2001 episode of "Sex and the City," allegedly flipped out after an argument with his girlfriend in March. She claimed he returned to her apartment the next day and beat and kicked 5-year-old feline Norman to death.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES:LiNeBrEaKA Manhattan judge declared a mistrial in September when one juror refused to convict Petcka. But on Friday, he pleaded guilty; he faces up to 500 hours of community service at his sentencing March 2. Another of Petcka's ex-girlfriends recently came forward to say that she, too, had been a victim of his rage. While they were living together in 2002, she says, he deliberately slammed a metal door on her hand, slicing her finger.LiNeBrEaKWilliam LopezLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Streaking at his New York University graduation. The aspiring filmmaker from Long Island stripped off his pants during the Yankee Stadium ceremony in May. Wearing just boxers and socks under his purple gown, he ran across the field. A security guard knocked him down just before he reached home plate.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: He was arrested and issued a desk appearance ticket. "A lot of people came up to me outside the Stadium, parents even, saying it was their favorite part of the day," Lopez later said. "It was an honor to run on that field."LiNeBrEaKKrIstin DavisLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Running a high-end prostitution ring. The Manhattan madam was busted back in March on charges of laundering money from the business, which she ran out of her midtown apartment. The Web site for Wicked Models lured guys in by promising Ivy League-educated, multilingual women. And they went for a high price: As much as $1,600 an hour.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Davis spent four months in jail and was released in October after pleading guilty in exchange for no additionalLiNeBrEaKjail time. But the trouble for some of her former clients has yet to begin. She says she's writing a tell-all book called, "The Real Sex in the City: True Tales of the Manhattan Madam," which will reveal the exploits of her johns.LiNeBrEaK'CLARK ROCKEFELLER'LiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Posing as a Rockefeller and allegedly kidnapping his daughter. The German-born con man made headlines in July when he was accused of snatching his 7-year-old daughter, Reigh, nicknamed "Snooks," in Boston during a court-supervised visit. His ex-wife, Sandra Boss, made a videotaped plea for the child to be brought home. He was first described as a millionaire mathematician, but it was soon discovered he was broke, not a real Rockefeller, and had been lying about his identity for years.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: After sightings at Grand Central Terminal and elsewhere, the phony Rockefeller, whose real name is Christian Gerhartsreiter, was found in Baltimore with Snooks a week after they disappeared. In October, a Boston judge ordered Gerhartsreiter to be held without bail, citing his "ingenious capacity" for deception. His kidnapping trial is set to begin in March.LiNeBrEaKPeter CookLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Cheating on a supermodel. The architect became the talk of the Hamptons when he destroyed his marriage to Christie Brinkley by getting it on with his 19-year-old assistant. Cook tried to keep the juicy details private, but Brinkley got the trial opened to the media. In the end, Brinkley won custody of their two kids, and Cook got $2. 1 million from his ex - but not before we learned that Cook allegedly spent $3,000 a month on Internet sex sites and used a Webcam to broadcast himself masturbating.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: In October, Brinkley filed a restraining order against Cook that barred him from letting their kids watch his Barbara Walters interview. Later that month, the supermodel called the cops to try to stop Cook from flying with the kids on a single-engine airplane, offering instead to pay for them to travel on a bigger plane. Cook eventually took off with them on the smaller plane anyway.LiNeBrEaKRielle HunterLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Having an affair, and possibly a baby, with ex-Sen. John Edwards. Hunter achieved fame when the National Enquirer claimed that the former Edwards campaign staffer told a friend that she was carrying his child. The pair first denied it, but in August, Edwards admitted to cheating on his cancer-stricken wife and lying about it during his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But he denied being Hunter's baby daddy.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Hunter is reportedly working on a tell-all book. There's still no word on whether her daughter is Edwards', but the Enquirer may soon solve the mystery. The Daily News' Rush and Molloy heard that the magazine's reporters are in possession of one of the baby's dirty diapers, and hope to do a paternity test once they get hold of some of Edwards' DNA.LiNeBrEaKJoe (the Plumber) WurzelbacherLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Being John McCain's blue-collar icon in the final leg of the presidential campaign. When Barack Obama made a stop in Wurzelbacher's Ohio neighborhood in October, the plumber asked him if he'd have to pay more under Obama's tax plan. McCain mentioned the moment during a debate three days later, and the presidential candidates spoke of "Joe the Plumber" a total of 26 times that night. Wurzelbacher soon found himself fielding calls from Fox News and "Good Morning America."LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Wurzelbacher's looking to rake in far more cash than he made as a plumber. He's hired an agent and is after a book deal and country-music contract.LiNeBrEaKVeeramuthu KalimuthuLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Jumping onto the subway tracks to save a stranger. The Columbia University mechanic noticed a fellow commuter had fallen off the platform at the 116th St. stop on the 1 line in March. He jumped down onto the tracks and hoisted the unconscious man over his shoulder. Kalimuthu handed him off to someone on the platform just before a train roared into the station. Once he was sure the stranger was safe, the Queens mechanic continued on his way.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Kalimuthu was honored at City Hall ceremony a month later. A dozen of his Columbia colleagues were there to support him, along with his wife and three kids.LiNeBrEaKRuth VeredLiNeBrEaKFAMOUS FOR: Refusing to stop serving drinks at her Hamptons art gallery. Vered's Memorial Day weekend bash was busted when cops caught her serving wine and cocktails without a license. She decided not to disappoint the 200 fashionistas and socialites who were there for the opening of an exhibit by a celebrity photographer. Refusing to stop the flow of alcohol, she was dragged off to jail.LiNeBrEaKBEYOND THE 15 MINUTES: Vered was ordered to pay $200 in August, once her lawyer worked out a deal to drop the charges in exchange for the fine.

Kirk said it.LiNeBrEaK"He understands that space stretches," Silverberg told Reuters. "He understands that you can stretch time, compress space and therefore he can, in a sense, actually have six Santa months to deliver the presents."LiNeBrEaKIn other words, while it might seem to us that Santa circumnavigates the globe (and contends with millions of chimneys, not to mention glasses of milk and plates of cookies) in one night, in Santa's little corner of the space-time continuum, he has six months to complete his work.LiNeBrEaKMy head hurts.LiNeBrEaKSo what about the question about how Old Saint Nick gets all those billions of presents in a sleigh small enough to be pulled aloft by eight tiny reindeer (and Rudolph)? Professor Silverberg has an answer for that one, too -- nanotechnology.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, that Al Gore doll you asked for this Christmas (the one that laughs, cries, wets and will lecture you for hours on the dangers of global warming) starts out as a lump of soot, or a piece of candy. Santa puts said bit of natural material under the tree and, while he's munching cookies and reading your new edition of Sports Illustrated, he uses nanotechnology to grow the doll, the box it comes in and even the wrapping paper.LiNeBrEaKWhich goes a long way toward explaining why that sweater you got last Christmas didn't fit. Santa just didn't let it grow big enough. It had absolutely nothing to do with that fifth helping of pie.LiNeBrEaKAnd St. Nicholas does not exactly fly under the radar. Since 1955, the Air Force has tracked Santa during his global trek. Since 1958 that job has fallen to NORAD (now North American Aerospace Defense Command).LiNeBrEaKYou can track St. Nick beginning at 5 p.m. Enid time Wednesday, at the Web site, noradsanta.org. There will be up-to-the minute reports and streaming videos from Santa's various stops. Google software will output live images from NORAD's high-speed digital "Santa Cams," and Google Maps and Google Earth will follow Santa on his travels.LiNeBrEaKIf you want a more personal accounting of Santa's whereabouts, you can call NORAD's Santa hotline at (877) 446-6723 or e-mail noradtrackssanta@gmail.com Last year more than 1,000 volunteers answered almost 95,000 phone calls and received 140,000 e-mails from people the world over.LiNeBrEaKWhat about Santa flying through restricted military airspace, such as that surrounding Vance Air Force Base? U.S. Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters and the Jolly Old Fat Man himself met Friday at Andrews AFB, Md., and signed an agreement authorizing Santa to fly through military airspace to deliver gifts.LiNeBrEaK"Allowing him to use military airspace will ensure that the crowded sky won't mean empty stockings on Christmas morning," said Peters. "It just wouldn't do to have the 'Gridlock Grinch' stealing Christmas."LiNeBrEaK"Team Vance welcomes Santa Claus to its airspace each year," said 2nd Lt. Agneta Murnan, Vance's public affairs chief. "We track Santa's travels Christmas Eve night along with the North American Aerospace Defense Command."LiNeBrEaKSanta is, of course, a veteran and very skilled pilot. He's been flying since 384 A.D., give or take a year. And in all that time he has not had one reported incident. That fact has drawn the admiration of his fellow pilots.LiNeBrEaK"Santa Claus is an amazing pilot," said Col. Chris Nowland, commander of 71st Flying Training Wing at Vance. "Think about it -- we've flown 83,000 hours at Vance this year, but Santa flies millions of transport and delivery missions in the span of one night each year, with astounding accuracy. Santa manages to visit the homes of boys and girls at Vance Air Force Base, but if he needs use of our airfields or support on our flight line, we're there for him."LiNeBrEaKThere is word coming from the North Pole this has not been an easy year for Santa. He has received many letters from children asking for other things besides toys and games, things like a job for daddy, or for mommy to keep from losing the house to foreclosure.LiNeBrEaKA young lady I know asked Santa for a fringed buckskin jacket, like the ones cowgirls wear, one Christmas. She wanted that jacket more than anything in the world. Christmas morning came and, along with small gifts like candy, nuts and fruit, there was a letter addressed to her. It was from Santa, explaining that Santa was sorry, but he couldn't afford to give her that buckskin jacket that year.LiNeBrEaKIn today's faltering economy, Santa might have to write a lot of those letters.LiNeBrEaKWith the economy the way it is, we need Santa more this year than we have in many years -- even if we don't get everything we ask for.LiNeBrEaKMullin is senior writer of the News and Eagle.

The Fayette Observer (Fayetteville, North Carolina)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: A new chill for winter  	Tim White, The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.  	COMMENTARY  	567 words  	Dec. 21--Happy winter!LiNeBrEaKReally. It's winter. Today.LiNeBrEaKIt's the winter solstice, and never mind that the weather feels more like mid-fall.LiNeBrEaKNot that we haven't had wintry weather already. Just a few weeks ago, we saw snow flurries, and 20-degree overnight temperatures that put an end to my flower garden -- and, praise be, the mosquitoes.LiNeBrEaKFrom west to east, waves of paralyzing snow and ice storms have marched across the country's northern fringe. Las Vegas just got whacked by a snow storm, and so did the Pacific Northwest. In southern California, they had a dusting of snow in Malibu, where summer is reputedly an eternal condition. LiNeBrEaKSo much for global warming? I won't say that. I don't know if this epidemic of colder weather is a sign of climate change. It probably isn't, any more than a couple of hot or hurricane-plagued summers. One year, or even one decade, can't give that signal. When we measure climate, we're speaking of centuries. In those terms, we're in a period of about 300 years of gradual warming, although the trend's progress seems to have stalled a few years back. No matter what Al Gore's climate-modeling computers say, we may be entering a period of cooling. Or we may be in a climate blip that will soon reverse.LiNeBrEaKBut I may have spotted one measurable trend last weekend when I flew down to Florida for a long weekend with Mom. If the airplane I took last Saturday morning is indicative, this may be a lonely winter for Mickey Mouse and his friends. (But a great time for Florida residents who grump about mobs of tourists.)LiNeBrEaKThere were plenty of empty seats on my flight down -- a flight I take often, and which usually is full.LiNeBrEaKAnother hint about what's happening: The gate attendants announced that three or four of those empty seats were in the First Class cabin. Anyone who wanted extra leg room and a bit of pampering could upgrade for just 50 bucks. No takers. The seats rode empty to Orlando.LiNeBrEaKAs I drove to the coast from the airport, the road seemed less crowded than usual. So did the grocery store, when I stopped to pick up some lunch. On Sunday morning, I took an hour-long stroll on the beach and passed maybe half a dozen people -- this on an Atlantic beach that's lined with condos. A friend who works in an Orlando hotel told me business is down from 5 percent to 7 percent, but that's only because long-scheduled conventions are keeping occupancy rates up.LiNeBrEaKThat sure looks like a recession to me. But maybe it will be a good time, too. Maybe it will be a time when we rediscover simpler pleasures, and explore the fascinating places we have in our own backyards.LiNeBrEaKIf that happens, we'll be better for it. Even if Mickey is lonely.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, my best holiday wishes for all of you. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah and Happy Kwanzaa to all.

The Greenhouse Effect?LiNeBrEaKReindeer hooves give way to carbon footprints in Santa Goes Green, a science lesson set to music and performed at elementary schools including Duff Elementary in Arlington and Houston Elementary in Mineral Wells. LiNeBrEaKIn this show, the chestnuts aren't all that's roasting.LiNeBrEaKThe summary: "Melting ice caps, global warming, surfing reindeer!"LiNeBrEaKFrom a description: "The North Pole is going green this year.  ... Solar panels, LED light bulbs, new power sources."LiNeBrEaKSanta trades his sleigh for an electric cart. Children sing about "recycling" fruitcakes.LiNeBrEaKHey! Inconvenient season's greetings, everybody.LiNeBrEaKA Houston-area parent writing on the conservative Republican Lone Star Times blog did not leave filled with holiday spirit.LiNeBrEaK"It was the worst show I have ever seen," read a letter posted by "Shannon."LiNeBrEaK"I was tricked into sitting through a half-hour-long political statement on 'Global Warming.'"LiNeBrEaKThe parent bashed the musical's lesson as "laughable" and "propaganda," adding that the pageant "drained the joy of Christmas from my very soul."LiNeBrEaKBy midweek, her complaint had ridden the updraft to TheGlenn Beck Program.LiNeBrEaKOn Breitbart.tv, a headline read: "School Christmas Play Fans Global Warming Hysteria."LiNeBrEaKArlington schools spokeswoman Veronica Sopher said Duff parents saw the show, uh, warmly.LiNeBrEaK"It is strongly in line with what we teach," she said. "Recycling is definitely part of the message, and this matches the curriculum."LiNeBrEaKThe show was such a hit that Duff children performed an encore at a junior high, she said.LiNeBrEaKA Mineral Wells district spokeswoman said administrators had heard no complaints.LiNeBrEaKThe way I understand it, there is no longer much of a debate about whether the globe is warming.LiNeBrEaKReligious conservatives are debating whether it's humans' fault or heaven's will.LiNeBrEaKThe Milwaukee-based Hal Leonard Corp. sells Santa Goes Green. It's a new work by staff composers Mac Huff and John Jacobson.LiNeBrEaKCoincidentally, one company executive is from Fort Worth. Emily Crocker oversees choral music and directs the Milwaukee Children's Choir. She is best-known in Fort Worth as the daughter of Lora Holt, the "pie lady" who recently retired after baking for east-side restaurants.LiNeBrEaK"We see this as a program that harnesses kids' holiday energy and connects it to the science curriculum," Crocker said by phone.LiNeBrEaKOther songs include Power to the People -- a Boone Pickens solo? -- and Turn off the Pump (And Plug in the Sleigh).LiNeBrEaKCrocker hadn't heard about the Houston complaints. "A teacher in that school and a lot of kids worked really hard to present a great program," she said. "For somebody to make those comments -- that saddens me. This is meant to be fun and funny, not political."LiNeBrEaKNot like, say, a show about Christmas.LiNeBrEaKBUD KENNEDY 817-390-7538LiNeBrEaKBud Kennedy's column appears Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. 817-390-7538	CHILDREN (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); MUSIC (89%); CHRISTMAS (89%); PRIMARY and SECONDARY EDUCATION (78%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (78%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (78%); MATH and SCIENCE EDUCATION (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); MUSIC COMPOSITION (76%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (75%); SOLAR ENERGY (69%); BLOGS and MESSAGE BOARDS (67%)  	General  		MILWAUKEE, WI, USA (92%); HOUSTON, TX, USA (91%) WISCONSIN, USA (92%); TEXAS, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081221-FT-Fort-Worth-Star-Telegram-Texas-Bud-Kennedy-column-1221  	Newspaper  	FT  	2008 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   		HAL LEONARD CORP (63%)  													
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   ALL S EDITION	Obama names science team;  Team shows more aggressive response to global warming 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A3  	261 words  	WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama's selection Saturday of a Harvard physicist and a marine biologist for science posts is a sign he plans a more aggressive response to global warming than did the Bush administration. LiNeBrEaKJohn Holdren and Jane Lubchenco are leading experts on climate change who have advocated forceful government action. Holdren will become Obama's science adviser as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Lubchenco will lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees ocean and atmospheric studies and does much research on global warming.LiNeBrEaKHoldren also will direct the president's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Joining him as co-chairs will be Nobel Prize-winning scientist Harold Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Eric Lander, a specialist in human genome research.LiNeBrEaK"It's time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and worked to restore America's place as the world leader in science and technology," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKHe said promoting science means more than just providing money, but also is about ensuring facts and evidence are never twisted or obscured by politics or ideology.LiNeBrEaK"From landing on the moon, to sequencing the human genome, to inventing the Internet, America has been the first to cross that new frontier because we had leaders who paved the way," Obama said. "Leaders who not only invested in our scientists, but who respected the integrity of the scientific process."

The Houston Chronicle 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   2 STAR EDITION	2008 was ninth warmest year on Earth since 1880  	RENEE SCHOOF, Mcclatchy-tribune  	A; Pg. 4  	280 words  	WASHINGTON - The year 2008 was the ninth warmest year since instrumental temperature measurements began in 1880, and all of the nine warmest years have occurred in the past 11 years, NASA reported last week. LiNeBrEaKThe new data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and other government agencies adds to the evidence that scientists have been observing about a warming Earth as burning fossil fuels emits heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKNASA also reported that the January to November global temperature was 0. 76 degrees Fahrenheit above the average for the 20th century, and that the past year was cooler than any since 2000.LiNeBrEaKScientists note that global warming is a steady trend, but within it there are natural variations.LiNeBrEaKThe NASA report noted that "Eurasia, the Arctic and the Antarctic Peninsula were exceptionally warm, while much of the Pacific Ocean was cooler than the long-term average."LiNeBrEaKThe report said the relatively cooler temperature in the tropical Pacific was due to a La Nina, the cool phase of a natural temperature variation.LiNeBrEaKBritain's Met Office on Tuesday also said that La Nina was part of the reason 2008 was slightly cooler than earlier years this decade.LiNeBrEaKBy Britain's accounting, 2008 was the 10th warmest year on record dating back to 1850.LiNeBrEaKAll 10 of the warmest years have occurred since 1997, according to the Met Office.LiNeBrEaK"Human influence, particularly emission of greenhouse gases, has greatly increased the chance of having such warm years," said Peter Stott of the Met Office in a statement Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe Met Office also reported that global temperatures from 2000 to 2008 are nearly 0. 36 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average for 1990 to 1999.

The Houston Chronicle 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   2 STAR EDITION	Inventor: Evaporation units could cool Earth;  Some scientists find idea intriguing, others scoff at plan 	GREG GORDON, Mcclatchy-tribune  	A; Pg. 4  	812 words  	WASHINGTON - Ron Ace says that his breakthrough moments have come at unexpected times - while he lay in bed, eased his aging Cadillac across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge or steered a tractor around his rustic, five-acre property.LiNeBrEaKIn the seclusion of his Maryland home, Ace has spent three years glued to the Internet, studying the Earth's climate cycles and careening from one epiphany to another - a 69-year-old loner with the moxie to try to solve one of the greatest threats to mankind. LiNeBrEaKNow, backed by a computer model, the little-known inventor is making public a U.S. patent petition for what he calls the most "practical, nontoxic, affordable, rapidly achievable" and beneficial way to curb global warming and a resulting catastrophic ocean rise.LiNeBrEaKSpray gigatons of seawater into the air, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, and let Mother Nature do the rest, he says.LiNeBrEaKThe evaporating water, Ace said, would cool the Earth in multiple ways: First, the sprayed droplets would transform to water vapor, a change that absorbs thermal energy near ground level; then the rising vapor would condense into sunlight-reflecting clouds and cooling rain, releasing much of the stored energy into space in the form of infrared radiation.LiNeBrEaKMcClatchy Newspapers has followed Ace's work for three years and obtained a copy of his 2007 patent petition for what he calls "a colossal refrigeration system with a 100,000-fold performance multiplier."LiNeBrEaK"The Earth has a giant air-conditioning problem," he said. "I'm proposing to put a thermostat on the planet."LiNeBrEaKAlthough it might sound preposterous, a computer model run by an internationally known global warming scientist suggests that Ace's giant humidifier might just work.LiNeBrEaKEffects would be immediateLiNeBrEaKKenneth Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, roughly simulated Ace's idea in recent months on a model that's used extensively by top scientists to study global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe simulated evaporation of about one-half inch of additional water everywhere in the world produced immediate planetary cooling effects that were projected to reach nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit within 20 or 30 years, Caldeira said.LiNeBrEaK"In the computer simulation, evaporating water was almost as effective as directly transferring ... energy to space, which was surprising to me," he said.LiNeBrEaKAce said that the cooling effect would be several times greater if the model were refined to spray the same amount of seawater at strategic locations.LiNeBrEaKHe proposes to install 1,000 or more devices that spray water 20 to 200 feet into the air from barren stretches of the West African coast, bluffs on deserted Atlantic Ocean isles, deserts adjoining the African, South American and Mediterranean coasts and other arid or windy sites.LiNeBrEaKTo maximize cloud formation, he'd avoid the already humid tropics, where most water vapor quickly turns to rain.LiNeBrEaK"It does seem like evaporating water outside the tropics would be more effective," Caldeira said.LiNeBrEaKBuying time for researchLiNeBrEaKSeveral scientists who reviewed Ace's patent petition for McClatchy reacted with caution to outright derision over its possibilities, but some softened their views upon learning of the computer model.LiNeBrEaKIt would be relatively easy to design spraying equipment to carry out his plan to fill that water vapor deficit, but it would take a major international effort to install 1,000 large spraying devices, or thousands of smaller ones.LiNeBrEaKIf fully deployed, the 15,800 cubic meters of sprayed water per second would be equivalent to the flow at the mouth of the Mississippi River and would require enough energy to power a medium-sized city.LiNeBrEaKHowever, spraying only a portion of that amount for a decade would be enough to cool the equivalent of current man-made global warming, estimated to range up to 0. 76 degrees Fahrenheit, Ace said.LiNeBrEaKSuch cooling, he said, could buy mankind decades of time for more research and precision.LiNeBrEaKAce has his doubters, partly because he took the patent route rather than submitting his idea for scientific peer review. A patent certifies that an invention is unique, not that it would work.LiNeBrEaKDavid Travis, a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater professor who's studied clouds extensively, praised Ace's innovation, but said he's "generally opposed to geo-engineering" solutions and can't imagine evaporating water on a large enough scale to have a near-term effect.LiNeBrEaKCaldeira, who plans to submit his computer findings for peer-reviewed publication, is among scientists so concerned about sluggish progress in curbing greenhouse gases that they met last year to consider geo-engineering options.LiNeBrEaKOne thing is certain: Ace is dead serious. He's tenaciously compiled more than a thousand pages of research, sometimes during all-night binges despite a fight with cancer. He said he's invested large sums in patenting his global-warming inventions.

The Houston Chronicle 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   3 STAR EDITION	GOVERNMENT;  Energy policy shift likely to be seismic;  Key players on Bush and Obama teams contrast sharply	DAVID IVANOVICH, Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau, Staff  	BUSINESS; Pg. 1  	1519 words  	OutgoingLiNeBrEaKDick Cheney, 67LiNeBrEaKVice PresidentLiNeBrEaKComment: The former chief executive officer of oil field service giant Hallilburton Co. has been the Bush administration's point man on energy and forged a policy based on increased production.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy."LiNeBrEaKIncomingLiNeBrEaKSteven Chu, 60 LiNeBrEaKEnergy secretary designateLiNeBrEaKComment: Nobel Prize-winning physicist and Energy Department laboratory chief who could bring a scientific rather than ideologicial approach to energy policy.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "Stronger storms, shrinking glaciers and winter snowpack, prolonged droughts and rising sea levels are raising the specter of global food and water shortages. The ominous signs of climate change we see today are a warning of dire economic and social consequences for us all, but especially for the poor of the world."LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner, 53LiNeBrEaKEnergy coordinator designateLiNeBrEaKComment: Responsibility to oversee energy, climate and environmental efforts, was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency throughout Bill Clinton's presidency and is an environmental hawk.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "We can create jobs, curb greenhouse gas emissions, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and help restore America's leadership around the world by shaping an environmentally sustainable world economy."LiNeBrEaKKen Salazar, 53LiNeBrEaKInterior secretary designateLiNeBrEaKComment: Rancher and U.S. senator from Colorado given to western wear and conservationist attitudes. Salazar pushed through a ban, since lifted, barring the federal government from leasing federal lands for commercial production of oil and gas from oil shale deposits. Salazar said he supported looking at oil shale as a possible energy source but wanted production handled in the right way.LiNeBrEaKQuote: "I will do all I can to help reduce America's dependence on foreign oil."LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Many environmentalists are downright giddy.LiNeBrEaKThe election of Barack Obama, and his selection of what the League of Conservation Voters' Gene Karpinski calls the "dream green team" to fashion energy and environmental policy, heralds a dramatic shift from the energy priorities of the last eight years, on issues ranging from offshore drilling to climate change.LiNeBrEaKConsider two key players:LiNeBrEaKIn the Bush White House, energy policy was crafted by a former oil field services company executive - Vice President and former Halliburton Co. Chairman Dick Cheney.LiNeBrEaKIn the new administration, energy and environmental strategy will be coordinated by the longest-serving head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency - Carol Browner.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think there could be a greater contrast, in terms of their experience or their philosophy," said Wesley Warren, director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaKObama's energy team represents a "green sweep," said Kevin Book, an oil and energy policy analyst with FBR Capital Markets. It's made up of policymakers Book expects will view energy issues through an environmental lens.LiNeBrEaKNobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, nominated as energy secretary, has advocated finding scientific solutions to combat climate change while serving as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey environmental regulator Lisa Jackson will lead the EPA. Los Angeles' energy and environmental head Nancy Sutley will run the Council for Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKAnd Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., who received a 100 percent on the League of Conservation Voters' environmental scorecard for 2008, is Obama's choice for Interior secretary.LiNeBrEaK"Every single one of the energy policy decision makers has brought environmentalism as part of their energy policy platform," Book said.LiNeBrEaKTo be sure, some environmental activists are still unhappy with Obama's choices. Some have raised concerns that Salazar, a rancher, isn't "green" enough, while critics have accused Jackson of politicizing decision-making and suppressing scientific information while serving in New Jersey.LiNeBrEaK'We're thrilled'LiNeBrEaKBut after eight years of an administration focused on oil and gas drilling, Warren said, "We're thrilled."LiNeBrEaKLike President George W. Bush, Obama has repeatedly linked energy to national security.LiNeBrEaK"We know that the future of our economy and national security is inextricably linked to one challenge: energy," Obama said last week.LiNeBrEaKSpencer Abraham, who served as Bush's first energy secretary - even after calling for the elimination of the large, unwieldy Energy Department while serving as a Republican senator from Michigan - said security was the overriding issue that held the department's disparate elements together.LiNeBrEaKAnd for both administrations, energy has been viewed as a jobs issue.LiNeBrEaKFor the Bush White House, that meant expansion of domestic oil and gas drilling, and the new jobs that activity has brought.LiNeBrEaKFor the Obama team, the emphasis has been on creation of "green energy" jobs, from the high-tech workers trying to create new, cleaner technologies to what Book calls a "conservation army attacking leaky buildings with caulk guns and furnace filters."LiNeBrEaKThe Obama energy team is almost sure to take a more jaundiced view of oil and gas drilling than the Bush White House.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration has pushed relentlessly to give the oil and gas industry new areas to explore, whether in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or the federal waters offshore.LiNeBrEaKWhile the Arctic refuge remains off-limits, Bush lifted a presidential moratorium on drilling off the east and west coasts, while Republicans on Capitol Hill were able to force Democrats to allow a congressional drilling ban to lapse as well.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic lawmakers may find it hard to reinstate the congressional ban, but Obama could put a new presidential moratorium in place.LiNeBrEaK"What I said during the campaign was that I was open to the idea of offshore drilling, if it was part of a comprehensive package to achieve energy independence," Obama said when asked about the offshore drilling ban last week.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not thrilled with it simply lapsing as a consequence of inaction without broader thought to how are we going to achieve energy independence," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration, hoping to unlock a domestic resource estimated at 800 billion barrels of oil, has been grappling with Salazar over development of oil and natural gas from the oil shale formations in Colorado and other parts of the Rocky Mountain West.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Salazar and a group of allies on Capitol Hill attached language to a spending measure that blocked the administration from promulgating new rules to push oil shale development closer to commercialization.LiNeBrEaKLike the offshore moratorium, that ban was allowed to lapse. And the Bush administration's Interior Department quickly issued new rules to govern commercial development of oil shale, including offering discounted royalty rates.LiNeBrEaKThroughout his tenure, Bush also has insisted on building up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, resisting calls to release crude from the emergency oil stockpile even as oil prices reached record highs last summer.LiNeBrEaKJoe Terranova, chief alternatives strategist for Hartford, Conn.-based Virtus Investment Partners, predicts Obama, by contrast, will release oil from the reserve if prices jump back up to the $70 to $80 range in hopes of pushing prices back down.LiNeBrEaKClimate change divideLiNeBrEaKThe most striking difference between the two administrations may be in their approaches to climate change.LiNeBrEaKIn 2001, Cheney created an energy task force to help formulate the administration's energy strategy. And in creating that blueprint, his office sought extensive input from the oil and gas industry but only token participation from environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKIn the resulting 170-page report, climate change is first mentioned on page 52, with a noncommittal observation: "Scientists continue to learn more about global climate change, its causes, potential impacts and possible solutions."LiNeBrEaKAnd since that time, the administration has resisted calls for a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKLast year, the Supreme Court ordered the Bush administration's EPA to look at regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars under the Clean Air Act. Since that time, the agency has been engaged in a policymaking process that is widely viewed as a bid to run out the clock.LiNeBrEaKAnd just last week, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson declared the agency did not have to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industrial sources.LiNeBrEaKObama, by contrast, has called for creating a mechanism to cap greenhouse gas emissions and allow polluters to trade permits to emit carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKRep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., chairman of the House Science and Technology Committee, said Obama's energy team is all about this "nexus between energy and climate."LiNeBrEaKThat was evident last week when Obama, in introducing his energy team, raised the issue of Americans' "addiction" to foreign oil - "It constrains our economy, shifts wealth to hostile regimes and leaves us dependent on unstable regions"-and then immediately turned to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"These urgent dangers are eclipsed only by the long-term threat of climate change," Obama said.

The Houston Chronicle 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Choice of science advisers hints at Obama priorities;  Global warming, ocean protection, stem cells likely to be top issues 	GARDINER HARRIS, New York Times  	A; Pg. 4  	380 words  	WASHINGTON - In his selection of four top scientific advisers, President-elect Barack Obama has signaled what are likely to be significant changes in policies governing global warming, ocean protections and stem cell research. LiNeBrEaK"It's time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and worked to restore America's place as the world leader in science and technology," Obama said in a radio address on Saturday, when he announced the appointments.LiNeBrEaKJohn Holdren, a physicist and environmental policy professor at Harvard, will serve as the president's science adviser as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist from Oregon State University, will lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which overseas ocean and atmospheric studies and performs much of the government's research on global warming.LiNeBrEaKHoldren will also be a co-chairman of the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology along with the Nobel Prize-winning cancer researcher Dr. Harold Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Eric Lander, a genomic researcher.LiNeBrEaK"Whether it's the science to slow global warming; the technology to protect our troops and confront bioterror and weapons of mass destruction; the research to find life-saving cures; or the innovations to remake our industries and create 21st century jobs - today more than ever, science holds the key to our survival as a planet and our security and prosperity as a nation," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKLike Steven Chu, the energy secretary-designate, Holdren and Lubchenco advocate mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which the Bush administration opposed. Both served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Holdren said last year that the world needed to undertake "a massive effort to slow the pace of global climatic disruption."LiNeBrEaKLubchenco has documented enormous dead zones in oceans that have resulted from climate change and has advocated placing vast ocean areas off-limits.LiNeBrEaKVarmus is president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Lander is a professor of biology at MIT.LiNeBrEaKSeismic shiftLiNeBrEaKObama's administration is likely to usher in dramatic changes in energy policy.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	AeroVironment technology to be used at Port of Los Angeles  	Ryan Carter, Staff Writer  	BUSINESS  	684 words  	As the incoming presidential administration emphasizes renewable and cleaner energy, and defense remains a big priority, Monrovia-based AeroVironment Inc. is well-positioned to reap the benefits, analysts said.LiNeBrEaKAmong those benefits was the company's announcement Thursday that Balqon Corp., a developer of heavy-duty trucks and tractors, has purchased technology that will help it run more efficient and cleaner-running vehicles in the Port of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKBalqon purchased AV's new high-voltage PosiCharge fast-charge system as part of the port's program to replace internal combustion yard tractors with electric propulsion vehicles. LiNeBrEaKThe system can charge up to four heavy-duty electric dock yard tractors at a time, quickly pumping enough energy into them during short breaks. The powering system eliminates the need for battery swapping among vehicles, since the battery is always charged. It also makes the vehicles and the flow of port containers more efficient while helping to reduce emissions, they said.LiNeBrEaKEfficiency was vital for Balwinder Samra, CEO and president of Balqon, which this year won the right to build the port's electric-powered tractor fleet.LiNeBrEaK"In our applications it was important that we had a fast charger to reduce the charging time ... and that we were able to charge these vehicles during any type of downtime we had," he said. LiNeBrEaKSamra also pointed to the Monrovia firm's experience in the market.LiNeBrEaKAnd with cleaner air a hot topic and goal of local leaders, ports, cities and the Obama administration, AeroVironment officials are capitalizing on that experience.LiNeBrEaK"We've got our fast-charge technology, which we think can be instrumental in helping electronic vehicles of all shapes and sizes be much more practical," said Steve Gitlin, director of marketing strategy for AeroVironment.LiNeBrEaKBalqon Corp. manufactures all of the electric yard tractors at the port, which is in the midst of its Clean Air Action Plan, with a goal to cut air emissions in half by 2011, port spokeswoman Theresa Adams Lopez said.LiNeBrEaK"All these new technologies create new jobs, and it's cleaner running technology," she said. "It jump-starts green-collar jobs. It all is good ... new jobs for cleaner air."LiNeBrEaKAmong those jobs are those created by a company like AeroVironment, which is booming, analysts said.LiNeBrEaK"This is a firm that is absolutely on fire," said Erik Olbeter, an analyst who tracks the company for Pacific Crest Securities.LiNeBrEaKAnd the spark over its energy efficiency business has heated up in the last few months, he said.LiNeBrEaK"They've exceed expectations, and certainly as the country, the government and industry becomes more concerned with global warming, AeroVironment's (energy efficiency systems) business is very well positioned with products that not only reduce greenhouse emissions but also save money for companies."LiNeBrEaKBut interest in AV's unmanned aircraft system is also a major part of its business, Olbeter said.LiNeBrEaKThe firm is the market leader in manufacturing small, tactical, unmanned aircraft systems, he said.LiNeBrEaKJust this week, the firm announced that the Italian government cleared its military to fly the firm's unmanned Raven aircraft in Italy's airspace, citing the technology's ability to protect Italian land forces and fly over large populations without limits.LiNeBrEaKIn both cases, the company - founded in 1971 by Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a pioneering designer of human powered aircraft - is looking beyond the immediate uses of its systems.LiNeBrEaKCompany officials are looking beyond the military for use of its aerial systems. And they are looking beyond port and airport vehicle fleets for use of its electrical vehicle technology.LiNeBrEaKAs it stands, the fast-charge system now operating at the port powers thousands of material handling vehicles in airports, factories and distribution centers in North America, Gitlin said.LiNeBrEaKBut there's potential outside of factories and industrial plants, he added.LiNeBrEaK"We're working hard to meet with a lot of players in the emerging electrical vehicle market," Gitlin said.LiNeBrEaKThe interest is showing in the company's stock, Olbeter said.LiNeBrEaKIt closed at $36 a share Thursday, up $1. 19.

The Kansas City Star (Missouri)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	The Kansas City Star, Mo., C.W. Gusewelle column: Memories, but no money, in inadvertent artifacts  	C.W. Gusewelle, The Kansas City Star, Mo.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	659 words  	Dec. 21--Some families store their artifacts in the attic or, if the objects are particularly valuable, put them in a safe-deposit box.LiNeBrEaKWe prefer to preserve our precious mementos cryogenically -- that is, through low-temperature storage.LiNeBrEaKThe contents of the chest freezer in the basement have been in recent years something of a mystery. As nearly as I can recall, the last time the freezer was entirely emptied was during an ice storm and extended power outage sometime in the late 1980s. LiNeBrEaKIf I remember correctly, among the items I found were a large cookie bearing a colorful likeness in icing of my prize bird dog; a wild turkey with a tag that identified it as a 1989 kill, diminished by time and cold to only slightly larger than a guinea fowl; a pheasant bleached white as a bedsheet, given us by a friend on his return from an Iowa hunt; and several frost-encased objects whose ages might only be identifiable through carbon dating.LiNeBrEaKBut the final proof that our inventory management had spun entirely out of control came when we discovered -- not in the basement freezer but upstairs in the kitchen refrigerator -- a bottle of dill pickles with the notice on the label: Must be consumed before 1998.LiNeBrEaKThough a full decade out of date, the pickles looked perfectly good -- large, plump and very green, suspended in a fluid that also appeared green. Given time enough, of course, almost anything turns green.LiNeBrEaKIt occurred to me that those pickles were pieces of history.LiNeBrEaKIn the year they went in the bottle, William Jefferson Clinton still was president of the country. Except in Texas, George W. Bush was not even on the public's radar.LiNeBrEaKOsama bin Laden had yet to make a household name of himself. Saddam Hussein was a chum to whom we'd loaned money and given weapons for his war with Iran.LiNeBrEaKA good many otherwise rational folks, not all of them snake handlers and speakers in tongues, still believed that global warming, like evolution, was a subversive fiction.LiNeBrEaKGas was cheaper than bottled water. Houses were the best investment imaginable, and workers were giddy over the rate at which their 401(k)s were growing.LiNeBrEaKBankers and hedge fund managers were kings. Newspapers were considered licenses to print money. New stadiums were sprouting up like mushrooms, and anyone with an ounce of ambition could wind up a dot-com millionaire.LiNeBrEaKOur pickles had seen all that. Or, if they hadn't actually seen it, had been a part of those times and all that rich history. And it occurred there might be some way to turn that to advantage.LiNeBrEaKMy first thought was to maybe put them on eBay or Craigslist.LiNeBrEaKYou may think that sounds goofy. But I have a friend who gathered up a bucket full of acorns -- just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill oak nuts -- offered them on eBay and found a buyer in no time flat.LiNeBrEaKWith the right copy, you can sell anything.LiNeBrEaKMaybe: Pickles you'll die for.LiNeBrEaKOr Dills that will stun your guests.LiNeBrEaKOr One-time opportunity on extra large cornichons.LiNeBrEaKOr Just try to findtheseon your grocer's shelf!LiNeBrEaKI'd have done it, too, if I hadn't been so electronically challenged. Doing business on the Web is way beyond me.LiNeBrEaKAs it is, we've cleaned out both the freezer and refrigerator, and set the contents at the curb for the weekly pickup -- all of it securely packaged to prevent wandering dogs, stray cats and wild animals from possible harm.LiNeBrEaKWe're starting fresh.LiNeBrEaKFor this Christmas dinner, instead of turkey, there'll be one Cornish game hen apiece for the four of us. And henceforth, nothing comes into this house that can't be entirely consumed at one sitting.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Water vapor's effects on atmosphere are debated  	Greg Gordon, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	436 words  	Dec. 21--WASHINGTON -- Ron Ace's idea to cool the planet by evaporating water could provoke controversy because it collides head-on with a concern of environmental scientists: that water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas. LiNeBrEaKA recent Texas AandM University study, based on satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, warned that if water vapor levels in the atmosphere continue to rise, it "could guarantee" an increase of several degrees Celsius in the Earth's temperatures over the next century.LiNeBrEaKThese scientists warned of potential "positive feedback," in which water vapor traps heat near the surface, the warmer temperatures cause increasing ocean surface water to evaporate, producing even more water vapor, further heightening the trapping effect and beginning the cycle anew.LiNeBrEaKKenneth Caldeira, a climate scientist for the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University whose computer simulation of Ace's invention suggests it would significantly cool the planet, said that scientists are still trying to sort out the complicated role of water vapor.LiNeBrEaKAmong its mixed effects:LiNeBrEaK--It absorbs latent heat near the earth's surface and transports it to higher altitudes, for a cooling effect.LiNeBrEaK--When it condenses at higher altitudes, it releases the latent heat, which then can radiate into space, producing more cooling.LiNeBrEaK--It's a greenhouse gas, trapping heat and causing warming.LiNeBrEaK--It can form low clouds that reflect solar energy, a cooling effect.LiNeBrEaK--It can form more high clouds, which block some sunlight but mostly prevent the release of infrared radiation from below, another warming effect.LiNeBrEaKRobert Park, a retired University of Maryland physics professor, said scientists are right to worry that water vapor and other greenhouse gases could lead to thermal runaway -- a cycle where two or more factors feed off another to propel temperatures higher -- but that no one has proved that it's occurring because the atmosphere is so complex.LiNeBrEaK"This is what makes climate such a horrendously difficult thing to calculate . . . by far the most difficult calculation that man has ever attempted," Park said.LiNeBrEaKAce hopes that his global cooling invention will help settle the matter.LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Cooling is 'not evidence that global warming is slowing'  	Vin Suprynowicz  	D; Pg. 3D  	1163 words  	My relatives in New England are fighting their way out from under a giant ice storm. Here in Las Vegas it's been snowing all week, several weeks earlier than our usual one-day-a-year photo op of snow and icicles sparkling one of our palm-bedecked golf courses before melting away by afternoon. The National Weather Service calls it "a rare snow event."LiNeBrEaKWhy? It's getting colder. 2008 was the coolest year in a decade.LiNeBrEaKThe American mainstream press seem to know "team players" don't mention such inconvenient developments, but in the U.K., the esteemed Guardian reports, "This year is set to be the coolest since 2000, according to a preliminary estimate of global average temperature that is due to be released next week by the Met Office. The global average for 2008 should come in close to 14. 3C, which is 0. 14C below the average temperature for 2001-07." LiNeBrEaKHow stupid does this make politicians such as Barack Obama and the other suckers who have fallen for the "global warming" hoax as they race to say, "Never mind"?LiNeBrEaKActually, they haven't missed a beat. These guys are so "scientific" that the evidence of their own eyes and overcoats has become irrelevant. They now contend global cooling is just further proof of global warming. Honest.LiNeBrEaKSo-called "climate scientists" insist "The relatively chilly temperatures compared with recent years are not evidence that global warming is slowing," The Guardian reports.LiNeBrEaKUm ... Earth's cooling doesn't mean the Earth is cooling?LiNeBrEaK"Absolutely not," responds Dr. Peter Stott, the manager of understanding and attributing climate change at the Met Office's Hadley Centre. "If we are going to understand climate change we need to look at long-term trends."LiNeBrEaKYou might want to pause and savor that for a moment. This is the gang who keep telling us, "The Debate is over! Dissent no longer allowed! Man-made global warming is going to ruin the Earth!"LiNeBrEaKYet they now say cooling "is not evidence that global warming is slowing," and that, "If we are going to understand climate change we need to look at long-term trends."LiNeBrEaKIf we are "going" to understand climate change? Like ... in the future?LiNeBrEaKSure, the mean temperature may still go up for a few more years before it plummets. So? None of the great climate cycles of the past needed us to burn coal in our power plants to make them happen, and there's neither evidence nor any intuitive reason to believe the tiny percentage of atmospheric carbon dioxide we now generate makes any substantial difference, either.LiNeBrEaKWhen will the "Let us take over and wreck your economy so we can save you from the climate boogey-man" gang admit the earth is cooling again, and when will they admit, "OK, since cooling is worse than warming, and our own theory is that mankind can impact global temperature by what we burn, it's now your duty to hold back the Big Freeze by going out there and burning all the fossil fuels you possibly can, as fast as you can"?LiNeBrEaK(Don't even get me started on "carbon trading," a weird scam in which the buyer acquires an invisible commodity of no earthly use to him, and both buyer and seller can benefit if they overestimate the amount being "transferred.")LiNeBrEaKInstead, on Monday, President-Elect Obama ("Delay is no longer an option; denial is no longer an acceptable response") appointed as Secretary of Energy (a position and an office not authorized in the Constitution) Steven Chu, the confirmed global warming lunatic from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who says coal - the stuff that powered the industrial revolution, cheap coal which will last for centuries and which can be burned more cleanly now than ever before - "is my worst nightmare."LiNeBrEaKThis gang still intends to effectively ban both coal-fired and nuclear power generation. Do they believe they can meet our current demand with famously costly, unreliable, and toxic wind, solar and geothermal? (Look up the by-products of geothermal energy, some time. Then look up "battery farms.") Of course not. The gap can only be closed by "conservation," they'll admit when you take a pencil and start to work the numbers.LiNeBrEaKAnd what does "conservation" mean, precisely?LiNeBrEaKThey'd like us to think they mean just turning out the lights in our empty rooms, that kind of thing. But they don't.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama has said it, straight out. He, the Chosen One, has had it Revealed to Him that we can no longer use 25 percent of the world's energy when we have only 5 percent of the world's population.LiNeBrEaKThis is nonsense. All mankind uses less than 1 percent of the solar energy that streams past us every hour. Is it "unfair" that the Japanese eat "more than their fair per capita share" of the world's fish?LiNeBrEaKAre we now to be ruled by a depraved schoolchild obsessed with sharing the toys, granted the ability to carry forward that Ding-Dong School philosophy with powers reminiscent of the kid in the old "Twilight Zone" episode who could "wish people into the cornfield"?LiNeBrEaKWe should be proud that we've learned how to capture and harness the lion's share of the available energy in this system. It's not like we refused to share with others "the secret of coal" or "the secret of oil," is it? They saw how good it was; they've been racing to catch up to us ever since; that's the main reason the world has escaped the life expectancies of the Stone Age.LiNeBrEaKThere's a real world out there. Purposely, artificially impoverish the nation, force us to give up our competitive economic advantages, and we'll eventually go the way of the Carthaginians.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama gang mean for us to learn to survive at 55 degrees in the winter; and to hope the tourists will still come to Vegas when our air conditioning only lowers the temperature to 87 in the summer (assuming we can afford even that.) They plan to unionize and thus close down most of our remaining factories - the Chinese will make us everything we need, you see; we'll pay for it with the endless bales of green coupons printed by Ben Bernanke and the Elves in the Big Hollow Tree.LiNeBrEaKTo see Mr. Obama admit "Under my plan, electricity costs will necessarily skyrocket" visit http://www.climatechangefraud.com/.LiNeBrEaKIn a Zogby exit poll, 88. 4 percent of Obama voters expressed ignorance of the fact Obama said on the campaign trail that his policies would likely bankrupt the coal industry and make energy rates skyrocket. See the sample interviews at http://howobamagotelected.com/.LiNeBrEaKWhy did voters not know this? Because the mainstream press covered Wasilla, Alaska, like a glove, trying to dig up something on Sarah Palin's overdue library books. Meantime, when it turns out Barack Obama's Senate seat is for sale for a million bucks in Chicago, the press corps slaps their foreheads and exclaims in amazement: "More corruption in Chicago than there was in Wasilla?!

The New York Post 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	LA TO NYC: DROP DEAD - THE RECESSION ENDS WHEN HOLLYWOOD DESTROYS US  	Kyle Smith   	All Editions; Pg. 26  	708 words  	All I want to see every Christmas is New York getting walloped at the movies. It's an important contrarian indicator. Filmmakers are kind of like the French: they're okay with us when we're doing badly. You know we're doing well when they want to obliterate us. LiNeBrEaKThis season's apocalypse movie, "The Day the Earth Stood Still," begins disappointingly. It's about a master race of aliens bent on destroying . . . New Jersey? So where's the disaster?  LiNeBrEaKJust kidding. 1 In the movie, Giants Stadium gets eaten by a swarm of metallic bugs as an amuse-bouche on their way to turning Manhattan into their tasting menu. The usual by-thewaythere-is-a-rest-of-the-world montage informs us that London and Sydney are also getting hit, but Central Park, where a giant robot stands emitting death rays, is where the real action is. LiNeBrEaKAs usual, Hollywood doesn't even buy us a drink before we get nailed again. Why us? "Each era has its own particular answer," argues Max Page in his book "The City's End: Two Centuries of Fantasies, Fears and Premonitions of New York's Destruction." Page sifts through a history of stories about the destruction of this city dating to 1812. Often there is a lesson: In WWI, government posters showed the Statue of Liberty in flames to scare people into buying war bonds, the 1938 radio broadcast "War of the Worlds" carried a subtext about preparing for Hitler and many novels and movies kill New York so that faith in God might be reborn. LiNeBrEaKGreater cooperation with the Soviets is the message of "Fail Safe," "Planet of the Apes" and "Meteor," global warming brings "The Day After Tomorrow" and overpopulation leads to peopleeating in "Soylent Green." Movies in which New York doesn't deserve its beat-down ("Deep Impact," "Armageddon," "I Am Legend") are the exception. Usually we get it because we are sinners. See, for instance, the most infl uential sci-fi movie of our time, "An Inconvenient Truth."  LiNeBrEaKBut when New York was actually destroying itself, in the 1970s, Hollywood turned away. Seventies apocalypse wandered elsewhere - "The Omega Man" and "Earthquake" were set in LA, "The Towering Inferno" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" in San Francisco. Even Superman, who spent decades saving Metropolis from almost daily threat of destruction, pulled a Walter O'Malley in the 1978 movie, going to California to save it from falling into the sea. LiNeBrEaKNew York disaster movies in this period were about escaping the city, not saving it: New Yorkers are forbidden to leave in "Escape from New York" (1981)," "1990: Bronx Warriors" (1982) and "After the Fall of New York" (1983). Billy Joel, as Page notes, said it better than anyone in his 1976 sci-fi song "Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)": "They burned the churches up in Harlem. . . but no one really cared. It always burned up there before."  LiNeBrEaKAs the stock market climbed and "Ghostbusters" hit theaters in 1984, the city started to look worth defending again, but that movie also re-set the mood to comedy, inspiring a series of funny or campy fl icks implying that New York landmarks were disposable: "Independence Day" (1996), "Men in Black," (1997), "Godzilla" (1998). LiNeBrEaKHollywood deserted us again after 9/11, moving on to Baltimore (2002's "The Sum of All Fears" and 2007's "The Invasion") and San Francisco (2006's "X Men: The Last Stand," 2003's "The Hulk"). His incredibility restored this summer, "The Incredible Hulk" marked a huge milestone in the progress of Harlem: he stopped by to trash 125th Street and herald the city's post9/11 renaissance, joining fellow New Yorkers Doc Ock and the Sandman, the Legend vampires and the Cloverfi eld monster. Welcome, brothers and sisters. On the subway, I'd rather sit next to any of you than Williamsburg hipsters. LiNeBrEaKNow New York is hitting the skids again for real, though, and even Hollywood execs read the newspapers. (Well, the headlines.) Let's hope that in addition to the monster recession, there isn't a monster recession. Hollywood, please don't outsource our apocalypse industry to Boise and Phoenix. Let's compromise. Give us some movies in which Fuldzilla tears the sign off the Lehman Brothers building or an evil race of banker-backed aliens zaps the new ballpark in Queens. Call it "Citifield."

The New York Times 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	4 Top Science Advisers Are Named by Obama  	By GARDINER HARRIS  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 41  	440 words  	In his selection of four top scientific advisers, President-elect Barack Obama has signaled what are likely to be significant changes in policies governing global warming, ocean protections and stem cell research. LiNeBrEaK  ''It's time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and worked to restore America's place as the world leader in science and technology,'' Mr. Obama said in a radio address on Saturday, when he announced the appointments. LiNeBrEaK  John P. Holdren, a physicist and environmental policy professor at Harvard, will serve as the president's science adviser as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology. Jane Lubchenco, a marine biologist from Oregon State University, will lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which overseas ocean and atmospheric studies and performs much of the government's research on global warming.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Holdren will also be a co-chairman the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology along with the Nobel Prize-winning cancer research Dr. Harold Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Eric S. Lander, a genomic researcher.LiNeBrEaK  ''Whether it's the science to slow global warming; the technology to protect our troops and confront bioterror and weapons of mass destruction; the research to find life-saving cures; or the innovations to remake our industries and create 21st century jobs -- today more than ever, science holds the key to our survival as a planet and our security and prosperity as a nation,'' Mr. Obama said.LiNeBrEaK  Like Steven Chu, the energy secretary-designate, Drs. Holdren and Lubchenco advocate mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which the Bush administration opposed. Both served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Dr. Holdren said last year that the world needed to undertake ''a massive effort to slow the pace of global climatic disruption before intolerable consequences become inevitable.'' LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Lubchenco has documented enormous dead zones in oceans that have resulted from climate change and has advocated placing vast ocean areas off-limits to fishing and mineral exploitation. In an e-mail message on Saturday, she wrote: ''NOAA will play a central role in addressing pressing challenges of our time -- stabilizing the climate, restoring ocean health and coastal vitality. Jobs and a healthy environment go hand in hand -- and both are enabled by good science.'' LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Varmus is president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Dr. Lander is a professor of biology at M.I.T. and helped lead the effort to sequence the human genome.

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Ambitious green goals set for Metro Parks Tacoma  	Ian Demsky, The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	613 words  	Dec. 21--What would you guess is the biggest contributor to Metro Parks Tacoma's carbon emissions? Electricity? Natural gas? Office paper?LiNeBrEaKAccording to a consultant's analysis, it's staff commuting. Employees driving to and from work accounted for about 40 percent of the 4,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide created yearly by Metro Parks activities.LiNeBrEaKStrategies for making the agency more "green" and reducing its carbon footprint were laid out in a recent report by Sustainable Business Consulting of Seattle. LiNeBrEaKThe consultant recommended the agency cut its carbon footprint by 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 and 40 percent by 2020. Other goals include reducing water use by 50 percent of current levels by 2020 and eventually sending zero waste to the landfill.LiNeBrEaKThe Metro Parks Board hopes to dig deeper into the specifics of the findings early next year, Commissioner Ryan Mello said last week.LiNeBrEaKMello said the public expects the park district to be an environmental leader.LiNeBrEaK"It's my expectation that we fulfill that expectation and lead -- without affecting recreation and parks services," he said.LiNeBrEaKParks environmental educational coordinator John Garner said some of the recommendations were "quite ambitious."LiNeBrEaK"They'll challenge us as an organization," he said. "But the circumstance of climate change really does require increased efforts in the stewardship and sustainability realm."LiNeBrEaKAmong the consultant's recommendations: turning off computers at night, restricting air travel, not buying bottled water for meetings, setting all printers and copiers to automatically print double-sided, and purchasing green products such as EnergyStar-rated appliances.LiNeBrEaKMetro Parks has already been finding ways to be greener, said urban forester Kathy Sutalo, who heads up the parks district's Green Taskforce.LiNeBrEaKSome of those items include: reducing gas and electricity use, offering car-pooling incentives, adding hybrids to its automotive fleet, and limiting use of toxic cleaning products and fertilizers.LiNeBrEaK"We don't use synthetic fertilizers in most of our parks," Sutalo said. "Only on the sand-based sports fields, where the organic fertilizers don't work as well. We mainly use turkey poop."LiNeBrEaKGreen pest control methods have been used instead of pesticides at W.W. Seymour Botanical Conservatory in Wright Park since 1991, she said. They include soap sprays, rotating plants out and the occasional release of beneficial insects.LiNeBrEaKSeveral years ago, Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium cut its power usage for its popular Zoolights exhibit roughly in half by adding LED lights, Garner said. And the zoo purchases more "green power" -- generated from renewable sources such as wind and water -- yearly than is used for the entire display.LiNeBrEaKThe consultants noted that the zoo and Northwest Trek have already earned the highest certification level -- five stars -- by the EnviroStars organization, which means they "go well beyond others in their industry in their commitment to be environmentally responsible."LiNeBrEaK"It's something we're very proud of," John Houck, the zoo's deputy director, said in a recent interview. "We're already doing many of the things the consultants recommended out at the zoo. As a green organization, that's right in our wheelhouse."LiNeBrEaKIan Demsky: 253-597-8872	PARKS and PLAYGROUNDS (94%); CONSULTING SERVICES (91%); EMISSIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); FERTILIZERS (85%); ZOOS and AQUARIUMS (83%); SPORTS and RECREATION FACILITIES and VENUES (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); GREEN MARKET (76%); SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY (75%); BOTTLED WATER (74%); PHOTOCOPIERS (73%); PESTICIDES (65%); BOTANICAL GARDENS (64%); CLEANERS (61%); LANDFILLS (55%); MANAGEMENT CONSULTING (72%)  	Banking/Economy/Personal Finance/Stocks  		SEATTLE, WA, USA (79%); OLYMPIA, WA, USA (64%) WASHINGTON, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081221-TC-Ambitious-green-goals-set-for-Metro-Parks-Tacoma-1221  	Newspaper  	TC  	2008 The News Tribune   															
News and Record (Greensboro, NC) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   News and Record Edition	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  		CLASSIFIEDSDEAS; Pg. H2  	655 words  	Boosting liquor sales promises more troubleLiNeBrEaKI could not believe what I read about the state wanting to make more money by selling more liquor. Doesn't the state know alcohol causes car wrecks and deaths by people who drink too much? There are homes that break up because of alcohol. I feel sorry for children who have to grow up in a family that has trouble with alcohol.LiNeBrEaKI don't think it's an honor for Greensboro to run the largest ABC operation in Guilford County. LiNeBrEaKCarolyn CorbettLiNeBrEaKClimaxLiNeBrEaKMileage-tax proposal punishes fuel-efficiencyLiNeBrEaKThe state of North Carolina is considering a "road use tax" as reported by the News and Record on Dec. 16. The plan is to tax drivers by miles driven because of a reduction in gasoline tax revenues as cars become more fuel-efficient and motorists drive less. We were told to buy fuel-efficient cars and reduce driving to impoverish Saudi Arabia and save polar bears from the doom of global warming. Many of us have done so, and the state wants to punish us in return.LiNeBrEaKThe article also said GPS technology in vehicles can load information into a central database to calculate mileage and location. For example, a driver who crosses the state on I-95 and does not buy gas will be taxed. While the tax is bad enough, a government tracking the whereabouts of law-abiding citizens is exceptionally outrageous. I imagine if the GPS reports that a car exceeds the speed limit, a fine will be added to the bill.LiNeBrEaKIf revenue shortfalls are of concern to these lamebrains, I have two solutions: Simply raise the gas tax and/or reduce expenditures. The latter will never happen, as government and reduced spending are incongruous.LiNeBrEaKTom ImbusLiNeBrEaKBrowns SummitLiNeBrEaKBack to Roman timesLiNeBrEaKI just finished watching "I Claudius," a DVD miniseries that originally aired in the 1970s and is available at our splendid High Point Library. It is all about Rome and its emperors and how they manipulated the senate and government officials.LiNeBrEaKCorruption, sexual adventures, intrigue and murder were rampant, as Romans ostensibly attempted to build a republic. In 2008, our guys just don't wear robes.LiNeBrEaKEleanor SedonLiNeBrEaKHigh PointLiNeBrEaKStop the insanityLiNeBrEaKDoing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is commonly referred to as insanity. Nonetheless, that's pretty much what our federal government seems to offer as its solution to our current economic woes (i.e., "We'll just solve our $10 trillion debt problem by borrowing more money from the Federal Reserve").LiNeBrEaKWhat is the Federal Reserve? Is it federal? Are there any reserves? The truth is, it is not federal and the reserves are questionable.LiNeBrEaK"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws" - Mayer Amschel Rothschild (founding father of international finance).LiNeBrEaKWake up, America.

Yet, his response to the Blagojevich scandal has been anything but, and his transition team has refused to respond to even basic questions. Obama has sent confused, mixed signals by saying neither he nor his staff was involved, but he also says he is still gathering facts.LiNeBrEaKIt's become more apparent every day that someone on his staff, likely Rahm Emanuel, did have conversations with the disgraced governor.LiNeBrEaKObama told us he was a different kind of politician. It's time that he act like one and convince us he is not just another politician from the Chicago machine.LiNeBrEaKStephen BennettLiNeBrEaKMooresvilleLiNeBrEaKPark this new tax ideaLiNeBrEaKCan you believe it? For years, consumers have been ridiculed for driving SUVs, charged a gas-guzzler tax, offered incentives to purchase gas misers, and now our politicians want to salvage their big highway projects by taxing us per miles driven.

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	ABUNDANT RESOURCE READY FOR FAST TRACK  		OPINION; Pg. 21A  	840 words  	FPL poised for next-generation powerLiNeBrEaKIn 1931, not long before his death, Thomas Edison said: "I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power. I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that."LiNeBrEaKI hope we don't have to wait either. That is why I am so proud that Florida Power and Light Co. just broke ground on the state's first utility-scale solar power plant. The Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center will produce 75 megawatts of emissions-free electricity. LiNeBrEaKSince FPL Group has more than 38,000 megawatts of capacity nationwide, 75 megawatts might seem small. But when combined with the two additional solar plants we are building in Florida, we will reach 110 megawatts. When that 110 is added to the 310 megawatts we operate in California at the world's largest solar array, our solar capacity will exceed that of a medium-sized fossil fuel power plant.LiNeBrEaKJust 10 years ago, FPL Group operated fewer than 500 megawatts of wind power nationwide. Today, we have more than 5,800 megawatts of installed wind capacity, enough to power more than 1 million homes and businesses. Our investment in wind will reach nearly $8 billion by the end of this year. Solar is where wind was 10 years ago -- on the cusp of a dramatic expansion that promises to transform the way electricity is produced in the U.S.LiNeBrEaKThe Next Generation Solar Energy Center will help show the way. It will be the first "hybrid" energy center, merging solar thermal technology with a combined-cycle natural gas plant. Think of it as the "Prius of power plants."LiNeBrEaKThose of us in the electric power industry have a special obligation to take the threat of global climate change seriously. Our sector of the economy is responsible for 40 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions produced by the U.S. each year. We must get serious about dealing with what Al Gore calls our "planetary emergency," and the best way to do so is with a price on carbon dioxide that makes polluters pay for the heat-trapping gases they send into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKIf we succeed, our dependence on foreign energy will decline, renewable energy sources will receive a huge boost and carbon dioxide emissions will fall to levels where we might have a chance of averting climate change. If we fail, America will remain addicted to foreign oil and the internal combustion engine, clean energy will struggle to achieve cost competitiveness with fossil fuels and the slow march toward climate disaster will continue unabated.LiNeBrEaKWhen Thomas Edison said he would put his money on solar energy, he was speaking as a businessman with no knowledge of climate change. Today, solar energy is much more than a business proposition. It is one of the keys to a sustainable future.LiNeBrEaKLEW HAYLiNeBrEaKJuno BeachLiNeBrEaKEditor's note: Lew Hay is chairman and CEO of FPL Group Inc.LiNeBrEaKFlorida on solar's cutting edgeLiNeBrEaKThroughout Florida, companies are using one of the state's most abundant and reliable resources -- solar energy -- to generate power and create green jobs. A recent study for the Public Service Commission indicated that of all renewable energy sources in Florida, solar has the largest potential for peak power output and total energy generation.LiNeBrEaKIn early December, Florida Power and Light broke ground on the first concentrating solar power plant north of Palm Beach County. In July, FPL selected SunPower to build two solar photovoltaic plants. These projects would make Florida the country's second-largest solar energy producer.LiNeBrEaKThis summer, the Florida Municipal Power Agency signed a letter of intent with SunEdison to provide 10 megawatts of power. Seminole Electric Cooperative announced its intent to negotiate with Renovalia USA to build a solar thermal power plant.LiNeBrEaKLast year, the solar industry attracted $10 billion in investment, created more than 6,000 green-collar jobs nationwide and grew its domestic manufacturing by 74 percent. A 30 percent solar investment tax credit for businesses and individuals helped drive much of that growth. After numerous attempts since early 2007, Congress finally extended these tax credits for eight years in October.LiNeBrEaKIn Florida, 222 companies install, manufacture, or distribute solar energy products. A recent study by Navigant Consulting estimated that the extended tax credit would create 22,000 new job opportunities in Florida industry by 2016.LiNeBrEaKWe encourage the Obama administration and Florida's congressional delegation to enact policies that stimulate the growth of solar energy: improving the solar investment tax credits to ensure they work as Congress intended despite a tight credit market; government procurement of solar on federal buildings and lands; and a manufacturing tax credit for solar energy components.LiNeBrEaKWith the right government policies, solar power -- overwhelmingly supported by the public -- will put Floridians back to work while helping to create an abundant, secure, and clean energy future for our country.LiNeBrEaKRHONE RESCHLiNeBrEaKWashington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKRhone Resch is president of the Solar Energy Industries Association (www.seia.org).

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Culture of accumulation isn't sustainable  		REVIEW and OPINION; Pg. F01  	936 words  	As the U.S. economy continues to falter, several economic and management gurus have come forward with strategies designed to get it back on track. No one argues that several elements of our economy are broken and need to be fixed to put America back on the path to prosperity.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, the focus of too many of the suggested strategies designed to do so remains on restoring the national competitiveness of the United States. Two serious modifications to this approach are needed. LiNeBrEaKFirst, to meet America's potential on the world stage at this historic juncture, the U.S. should not focus on making the country's economy competitive vis-a-vis other nations, but instead on positioning the U.S. as a leader of a sustainable global economy. Our economic policies should not focus internally on seeking narrowly defined national competitive advantages but rather on international cooperative advantage.LiNeBrEaKAs a global leader and the hub of an interdependent international economic order, it is both our duty and privilege to develop global solutions. If the U.S. does not offer global solutions, Europe and China will create them independently.LiNeBrEaKIf the U.S. turns inward to bolster its own competitive advantage with little consideration of its impacts on others, it could lead other nations to follow suit and pursue insular and exclusionary strategies.LiNeBrEaKSecond, for any new economic strategy to take shape, it must have a compelling cultural vision. That vision cannot simply be to restore the U.S. to its past economic pre-eminence. It must be linked to the current global financial and climate crises -- both of which will surely destroy not just the American economy but also all of human affairs as they are currently structured.LiNeBrEaKI propose a vision of a sustainable, creative and equitable global economic order. The global economy must be fundamentally reshaped. The economic engine of spaceship Earth must be designed for a current population of 6. 7 billion people that will grow to more than 9 billion by 2042 and a simultaneous shrinking of other species at alarming rates.LiNeBrEaKGlobal gross domestic product in purchasing power parity terms in 2007 was $65. 6 trillion, with an average per capita GDP of $10,000. Consumption is highly skewed, with the poorest 10 percent of the population consuming 2. 5 percent and richest 10 percent consuming 29. 8 percent.LiNeBrEaKIf we let the current trends of credit and leverage, growth, production and consumption continue, the world economy could increase six-fold by the middle of this century, while massive poverty would persist and we would remain ecologically unsustainable and saddled with additional insecurity and wars over resources.LiNeBrEaKOur global system of capital accumulation that is premised on ever-increasing material consumption is not viable ecologically or socially. Consumption must be fundamentally reconsidered, examining needs for material versus nonmaterial goods and services. And we must understand the relationship of consumption to the patterns of production work.LiNeBrEaKTraditional material consumption, especially in the industrialized West, should and will decline. The current global financial crisis will reduce the size of many economies by 10 percent to 15 percent over the next five years. Instead of letting it happen haphazardly, we have the opportunity to be deliberative and direct that decline in ways that cause the least harm to the poorest.LiNeBrEaKEschewing material consumption opens space for spiritual, sensory and aesthetic consumption. Consumers are realizing that consuming more is not always better (think obesity), and many are recalibrating what is enough. Deliberate shrinking of traditional material consumption might no longer be a radical idea.LiNeBrEaKIn the U.S., we have 6. 5 percent unemployment that is expected to jump to 8 percent by the end of 2009 and perhaps as high as 10 percent. So there is a mad rush to create jobs. There is talk of stimulus packages, infrastructure build-out, job-creation tax rebates, etc. In these narrow discussions we are not examining the nature of work and its relationship to consumption.LiNeBrEaKCreating more "rivet-head" or 9-to-5 cubicle-inhabiting grunt jobs is self-defeating. It promotes traditional material consumption-driven lifestyles. We need jobs that are meaningful, creative and emotionally satisfying, and that will foster new thoughtful consumption habits.LiNeBrEaKWork itself can be made a source of consuming satisfaction. Agricultural, industrial and even post-industrial work represents forms of dehumanizing toil that cannot serve as the basis of productive human societies. Human drive for creativity is fundamental. Designing creative aesthetic work is as important as creating new jobs.LiNeBrEaKFinally, equity in distribution of prosperity needs urgent attention. Extreme unevenness in prosperity across the globe is a major security issue. In an age of cell phones and the Internet, information about lifestyles is broadcast instantly around the world. Disparities cannot be hidden. This knowledge is a source of moral quandary and class conflict. Extreme poverty fosters revolutions, violent control of resources, wars and terrorism.LiNeBrEaKTwenty percent of the world population not being able to meet basic human needs constitutes a huge pool of disenfranchised people spread over many countries. This is a formula for increased violence, organized crime, terrorism and insurgent wars. Ensuring that all humans have at least the minimum needed to survive and the opportunity to improve their lives is critical for global security and a renewed global economy.LiNeBrEaKPAUL SHRIVASTAVA is a professor of management at Bucknell University.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	GLOBAL PLAN // Few people understand that monumental task lies ahead  		EDITORIAL; Pg. F02  	792 words  	With everyone focused on the immediate econom ic crisis, little public attention is being paid to an even larger crisis barreling toward us: climate change.LiNeBrEaKThere are those who say global warming is nonsense, a hoax or worse, for which they have absolutely no scientific evidence. The fact is that the science in support of a warming planet is overwhelming.LiNeBrEaKIf anything, past projections of the consequences of climate change have been too conservative. Evidence is mounting that Earth is warming faster and with more dire consequences than previously believed. LiNeBrEaKIndeed, a new report from the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (www.climatescience.gov) warns that recent rapid declines in ice volume in Greenland and the West Antarctica Ice Sheet are expected to lead to rises in sea level that "substantially exceed" predictions made as recently as 2007 by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKThe world's nations are struggling to come to grips with the phenomenon, so far with little real success. Recent meetings in Poznan, Poland, to move toward replacing the far- from-adequate Kyoto Accord made little headway, in large part due to the political transition taking place in the United States.LiNeBrEaKWhile public support for action on climate change is growing, few people understand the monumental transition required to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon, in sufficient amounts to avoid runaway global warming.LiNeBrEaKMoving away from our reliance on fossil fuels is a challenge of the highest order, but it is imperative. Switching to alternative forms of energy needs to be accelerated. Greater efficiency in transportation, commercial and industrial sectors and in the home is essential and needs to be encouraged across the board.LiNeBrEaKWe need a global plan to address climate change, national plans, state plans, local plans and personal plans. We need a level of consciousness-raising that may well be unprecedented to motivate appropriate and considered changes.LiNeBrEaKIt should be recognized that there's no single simple or easy response to the challenge. Multiple steps are required on many levels, while being alert to dead ends and actions that might well create more damage than benefits. Most of all, we need to recognize the inadequacy of current efforts.LiNeBrEaKThe importance of leadership at the state level cannot be overemphasized, even with the expected strong engagement to come from the Obama administration. A Climate Change Advisory Committee established by Gov. Ed Rendell is actively engaged in formulating recommendations to be presented next fall.LiNeBrEaKWhile a number of the governor's energy initiatives that have made it through the Legislature will be helpful in reducing the state's "carbon footprint," the administration is, in fact, pursuing conflicting policies. On the one hand it is promoting and encouraging energy conservation and investment in renewable fuels, while on the other it is facilitating fossil-fuel extraction on public lands and the loss of forest cover.LiNeBrEaKThe state also lacks a sound strategy to develop wind and solar. The administration has done well in attracting windmill and solar manufacturers to Pennsylvania, but has done so in part by giving developers of these technologies virtually carte blanche to install them wherev er they want. The environ mental, legal and public conflicts that arise from the lack of sound direction on siting is not helpful to the fullest possi ble deploy ment of these two technolo gies.LiNeBrEaKWind and solar devel opers need to be willing to accept less than ideal conditions, such as not putting wind turbines on ridge tops, if they are to gain maximum roll out of these critically important technologies. With regard to solar, we need to make maximum use of commercial, industrial and residential rooftops, rather than facilitating ground arrays of solar panels.LiNeBrEaKTo accomplish these ends, the state needs to establish wind turbine siting criteria that channel these devices to appropriate locations. Likewise with solar.LiNeBrEaKAn entire other issue, no less important, is to address developmental sprawl, which needlessly destroys open space and undermines energy-efficient mass transportation.LiNeBrEaKThe state needs to invest in commuter rail beyond Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to encourage urban/suburban infilling in other metropolitan areas, such as Harrisburg, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and Allentown/Easton.LiNeBrEaKContinued preservation of open space is critical, because a future of high energy costs (likely despite the current downturn) enhances the virtues of local agriculture.LiNeBrEaKThere are a million things that can be done to retain some semblance of the planet -- and the life -- to which we have become accustomed. We need to begin now, and in a big way, or we won't get the job done in time.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Parking the car  		COMMENTARY; Pg. 6  	458 words  	Americans may be undergoing a transformation in their attitude toward cars. Even though gasoline prices have dropped, use of public transportation remains decisively up, and has been trending that way for a while. According to the American Public Transportation Association, subways, buses and commuter-rail systems had a 6. 5-percent increase in ridership from July to September. That happened even though the cost of gasoline peaked at over $4 a gallon in July and then began a sharp decline. LiNeBrEaKThe increase in public-transportation use was the largest quarterly jump in 25 years. At the same time, Americans drove 4. 6 percent fewer miles than in the previous quarter. LiNeBrEaKWill drivers flock back to the roads if gasoline prices continue to plummet? Possibly. One barrier, though, might be the squeeze on consumer credit (combined with joblessness). Tighter lending could be preventing some who need to replace their vehicles or make costly repairs from doing so.LiNeBrEaKBut even if significant numbers of drivers are unwillingly stalled, it seems plausible that some new long-term trends are nevertheless taking shape. Concerned about dwindling fossil fuels and increased global warming, many Americans wish to act. According to the Transportation Department, we were already driving fewer miles in April compared with a year earlier. And April was the sixth consecutive month of declines. In California, often a bellwether for automotive trends, sales of hybrid vehicles have been rising for two years. For just as long, gasoline purchases in the state have fallen.U.S. gasoline consumption has declined periodically before, most recently in the early 1980s. Americans  fondness for big cars rebounded, and could again. However, new fuel-efficiency standards are on the horizon, and should help keep the brakes on consumption.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Obama has promised a stimulus program aimed at nationwide infrastructure improvements. Such efforts should be ranked by their long-term value. Public-transit projects, especially those geared toward smart growth and improved environmental stewardship, should top the list. (In Rhode Island, keeping a statewide Rhode Island Public Transit Authority running is vital.)LiNeBrEaKDuring the November elections, voters across America approved a raft of transportation initiatives, many of them designed to boost mass transit. Americans appear ready to invest in efficient new alternatives to car travel. Given half a chance, they will use them.LiNeBrEaKThat doesn t mean that meanwhile they won t step up their use of automobiles when gasoline prices fall sharply, as they have lately. Indeed, figures from this fall indicate that they re doing just that.LiNeBrEaKPerhaps OPEC s decision last week to slash output to boost prices will put a stop to that!

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   All Editions	Ms. Jackson goes to Washington;  Garden State's environmental chief will now set nation's agenda 	By DENA MOTTOLA JABORSKA, Wire Services  	OPINION; Pg. O01  	1155 words  	WHEN LISA JACKSON accepted President-elect Barack Obama's appointment to head the federal Environmental Protection Agency last week, she made history.LiNeBrEaKJackson has built a solid track record of success in New Jersey, delivering many, although not all, of the environmental protections we'd hoped she would as commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKWhat Jackson did accomplish in New Jersey has prepared her well to partner with Obama on his environmental priorities. LiNeBrEaKThe task before her is large and historic: to undo the damage to environmental laws done under the Bush administration, to return scientific integrity to the workings of the EPA and to tackle what most think is the greatest environmental challenge we have ever faced: solving global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn grave tones, the scientific community's message to the world is that the time to act on global warming is now. It will be during Jackson's tenure as EPA administrator that America must develop and execute a plan to do so.LiNeBrEaKScientists have said that the next eight years are a hugely critical window of time to solve global warming, as current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already pose a danger to the planet. According to NASA scientist James Hansen, it will be necessary to begin immediately to reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere if we are to avert the most severe effects.LiNeBrEaKJackson, along with Governor Corzine, championed legislation to put New Jersey in the forefront of global warming solutions. Signed in July 2007, the New Jersey Global Warming Response Act commits the state to returning global warming pollution to 1990 levels by 2020 and cutting global warming pollution levels by 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKStrongest in the nationLiNeBrEaKAt the time of its passage, the New Jersey law was the strongest state action to reign in global warming pollution in the nation, spurring similar efforts elsewhere.LiNeBrEaKBut action to implement the Global Warming Response Act has been slow. Jackson has helped develop two strong plans to promote clean energy, energy efficiency and clean transportation since the bill was signed into law more than a year ago. But action to adopt policies to implement the law has been slow, with some languishing in the Legislature, stuck at the governor's office or sitting idle at one state agency or another since the start of the Corzine administration.LiNeBrEaKBy now, the Department of Community Affairs should have updated the state's building codes to make new homes and commercial buildings more energy efficient. The Department of Transportation should have strengthened its program to promote car-pooling and reduce single occupancy commuter trips. The Legislature should have acted on legislation to require that heating equipment and other appliances sold in the state use less energy. And the governor should have pushed through a package of policies to promote cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars.LiNeBrEaKCleaner fuelsLiNeBrEaKFor its part, the state Department of Environmental Protection should have already begun crafting specific policies to block new coal plant construction in the state and to phase out traditional gasoline over time to clear the way for cleaner fuels and technologies such as electric powered cars.LiNeBrEaKAnother historic challenge Jackson faces is reversing the damage to environmental protection during the past eight years. Much can be said about the many environmental rollbacks of the Bush administration, but three key ones are: a rollback of power plant pollution limits and enforcement of those limits, a denial of states' rights to set stronger tailpipe standards for car emissions and the undoing of endangered species stewardship by the federal EPA.LiNeBrEaKThe nation's land, air and water cry out for more protection. Besides reversing Bush administration rollbacks, priorities for Jackson's EPA should be protecting rivers and streams nationwide by fully enforcing the Clean Water Act, cleaning up hazardous power-plant air pollution and protecting Americans everywhere from toxic pollution such as the rocket fuel contaminating drinking water supplies in 26 states, including New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKRocket fuel contains perchlorate, a chemical that interferes with normal thyroid function, may cause cancer and persists indefinitely in the environment, but is unregulated by state or federal authorities. Limited testing of the state's drinking water for the chemical found high levels at a few sites in Middlesex County, but the full extent of the problem could be more widespread, with at least six companies manufacturing chemicals and explosives in the state that include perchlorate.LiNeBrEaKModels for actionLiNeBrEaKActions taken by Jackson in New Jersey could be models for action she might take in Washington as EPA head. On clean water, she, along with Corzine, gave all the state's waterways the protection of 50-foot to 150-foot buffers on both sides, which will limit development around waterways to prevent flooding and protect water quality. She extended even stronger protections in the form of 300-foot "no-build" zones around 600 miles of high quality waterways, including the Ramapo River in Bergen County, the Wanaque Reservoir in Passaic County and several waterways in Morris County: the Rockaway River, Pequannock River, and Oak Ridge Reservoir.LiNeBrEaKTo stem the loss of green space in the state, especially green space important for the survival of threatened wildlife, Jackson used her regulatory power to set aside more than 300,000 acres of environmentally sensitive lands ? forests, grasslands and coastal areas ? from developers' reach.LiNeBrEaKNo outsourcingLiNeBrEaKBut one of her recent priorities at the DEP, to reform New Jersey's cleanup program for toxic sites, should not be a model for national action. In past months, Jackson has been considering outsourcing the state's toxic site cleanup program to private consultants, a move that would likely lead to faster action, but could also lead to lower standards and sites that are not cleaned up as well as they should be.LiNeBrEaKStaffing levels at the state DEP are too low to manage the cleanup of New Jersey's 20,000 toxic sites. The solution is more staffing, not hiring outside consultants to do the work.LiNeBrEaKWe hope Jackson will not look to privatizing toxic cleanups at the national level, and with proper staffing at the EPA, we don't think she will. New Jersey's budget cuts gave Jackson little choice.LiNeBrEaKJackson's accomplishments in New Jersey foretell the kind of EPA head she will be, as does the person behind the accomplishments. She is known for her smarts, her commitment to science and the truth, and her uncanny ability to win folks over to her point of view.LiNeBrEaKShe faces an enormous challenge as EPA head, but she's up for it. If successful, her success will be ours in New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKDena Mottola Jaborska is executive director of Environment New Jersey, a citizen-based, statewide environmental advocacy organization.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   State Edition	Picks for science posts keen on global warming;  For science team, Obama selects people who call for more action 		GENERAL; Pg. A-10  	344 words  	 President-elect Barack Obama's selection yesterday of a Harvard physicist and a marine biologist for science posts is a sign he plans a more aggressive response to global warming than did the Bush administration. LiNeBrEaK John Holdren and Jane Lubchenco are leading experts on climate change who have advocated forceful government action. Holdren will become Obama's science adviser as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Lubchenco will lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees ocean and atmospheric studies and does much of the government's research on global warming.LiNeBrEaK Holdren also will direct the president's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Joining him as co-chairs will be Nobel Prize-winning scientist Harold Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Eric Lander, a specialist in human genome research.LiNeBrEaK "It's time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and work to restore America's place as the world leader in science and technology," Obama said in announcing the selections in his weekly radio address.LiNeBrEaK Holdren, 64, is a former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington who has pushed for more action on global warming. As Obama's top science adviser, he would manage about 40 Ph.D.-level experts who help shape and communicate science and technology policy.LiNeBrEaK Lubchenco, an Oregon State University professor specializing in overfishing and climate change, will be the first woman to head NOAA. A member of the Pew Oceans Commission, Lubchenco has recommended steps to overcome damage to the world's oceans from overfishing and pollution.LiNeBrEaK "The Bush administration has not been respectful of the science," she said this year. "But I think that's not true of Republicans in general. I know it's not. I am very much looking forward to a new administration that does respect scientific information and that considers it very seriously in making environmental policies."

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Dialog  		OPINION; Pg. F-3  	1168 words  	In wake of tollway rejectionLiNeBrEaKRegarding "Tollway project loses appeal to federal agency" (Commerce Dept. sees option to San Onofre" (A1, Dec. 19):LiNeBrEaKTraffic relief is critical for the movement of goods and services throughout the region. The completion of state Route 241 would provide a long-awaited alternate route to the often-congested Interstate 5. Although the the U.S. Department of Commerce ruled against traffic relief and economic growth in this case, I hope that the courts will overturn the decision. Writing as an Oceanside city councilman, I believe that construction and completion of this roadway would provide thousands of jobs to the region and the economic shot in the arm our state needs so badly.LiNeBrEaKJACK FELLERLiNeBrEaKOceanside LiNeBrEaKFueling the debate on climate change plansLiNeBrEaKRegarding "Dishonest debate/Credible climate policy skeptics are ignored" (Editorial, Dec. 8):LiNeBrEaKThe costs and benefits of action to address climate change is an important topic, but your claims of a "dishonest debate" are simply untrue. Multiple studies conducted by academic institutions, the state and industry have looked at the future economic impacts of proposed state policies, and most have projected net economic benefits.LiNeBrEaKFurthermore, what cannot be disputed is historical data. Analysis conducted by the University of California shows that over the last 35 years, California's ambitious energy policies have saved consumers $56 billion, generated 1. 5 million full-time jobs and $45 billion in payroll. Moreover, doing nothing carries the highest cost. UC researchers Fredrich Kahrl and David Roland-Holst estimate that climate damages, if left unaddressed, would result in $46. 6 billion in direct economic costs and billions more in indirect costs.LiNeBrEaKAs an economist with the California Climate Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, I believe the state's plan to tackle global warming is balanced, comprehensive and will create a healthier, more affordable future for all Californians. Now is the time to move forward to prevent the worst impacts of climate change from saddling our children, and theirs, with unsustainable costs.LiNeBrEaKCHRIS BUSCHLiNeBrEaKBerkeleyLiNeBrEaKNo walk in the park for East VillageLiNeBrEaKMelvin Shapiro ("Questioning plans for new downtown parks," Letters, Dec. 17) clearly shows his lack of geographical knowledge of downtown San Diego when he claims that East Village has its share of parks as he rattles off the names of parks that are allegedly close to our neighborhood. In fact, none of the parks he mentioned are close to the East Village -- certainly not close enough to be used by its residents in a practicable manner, anyway.LiNeBrEaKIf he were to take the time to walk through our neighborhood, he would realize in short order that a neighborhood destined to be one of the highest density areas in our city has virtually no green space for its residents. As an integral part of the massive development around Petco Park and the East Village, several parks were promised. It reflects poorly on the Centre City Development Corp. that five years later there is still not a single park. Our neighborhood has more than its fair share of homeless shelters, convicted felons in halfway houses and drunk tanks -- certainly we deserve the same amenities that other neighborhoods in the city receive.LiNeBrEaKJOEL SMITHLiNeBrEaKSan DiegoLiNeBrEaKAssessing actions in SacramentoLiNeBrEaKRegarding "Democrats try to break budget stalemate" (News, Dec. 18):LiNeBrEaKThis reflected the plan of the Dems to end-around the GOP and call the modified gas tax a fee. In other words, take a tax, modify it, put lipstick on it and call it a FEE! Assembly Speaker Karen Bass went as far to say the "fee" is revenue neutral. So why bring it up at all?LiNeBrEaKBoth sides have hard decisions to make. There will and should be some cuts. There will be some increased taxes. Both sides need to come to the table as the professionals that represent us. Forget the special interests, the PACs and the various other outside special interests. Do the right thing for those of us outside of Sacramento. You will be judged in the long run by your conscious and by us. You may have heard some snickering from your colleagues behind your back from the other 49 statehouses in the nation. Those whispered snickers will become a roar of hilarity if you can't pull yourselves together and stop the embarrassing ineptness.LiNeBrEaKBILL CHIPMANLiNeBrEaKPowayLiNeBrEaKRegarding "GOP offers budget plan that relies on deep cuts" (A1, Dec. 16):LiNeBrEaKI think it is time Republican voters demand that their GOP representatives drop their dangerous game that imperils the state. Trapped by their outdated ideology, Republican leaders offered a budget plan that promises to destroy the state. California once was a national leader in education, the environment and quality of life, but Republicans seem bent on turning California into Mississippi.LiNeBrEaKIt's high time that citizens recognize that the benefits we enjoy aren't free and that taxes are a necessary evil if we wish to maintain our quality of life. Democrats and the Republican governor have agreed to both spending cuts and some increase in fees and taxes, so it is now up to Republicans to get on board and save the state from disaster.LiNeBrEaKMore important, it is time for Republican voters to demand that their party leaders do their jobs because we will know who to blame when the state can't pay its bills and the economy spirals further downward. If Republicans thought their party was becoming increasingly irrelevant now, just wait until this plays out.LiNeBrEaKJOHN PUTMANLiNeBrEaKSan DiegoLiNeBrEaKIt would be foolish for our elected leaders to raise taxes. Most families make hard, prudent decisions about spending by cutting expenses to meet obligations. But our state legislators and governor refuse to accept the necessity for budget cuts as too painful and unattainable. If they increase taxes, consumption decreases with concomitant revenue reductions. More important, businesses will continue to fail or leave our state, already among the highest taxed and least business friendly in the country.LiNeBrEaKThe problem with our state budget is rooted in entitlement programs and perceived entitlements, including state jobs that can easily be outsourced to private industry, resulting in significant savings and preserving jobs in our communities. Outsourcing of non-core functions is one way to begin to solve the fiscal dilemma. Such functions can be done more efficiently and effectively by the private sector, but the governor has to make the case that this makes sense. Cities also could benefit immediately by competing non-core functions. In places where outsourcing has been tried, it works, and the same employees now on the state's and city's payrolls transfer to the private entity, assuming they can perform the tasks satisfactorily and at competitive, market-driven wages and benefits.LiNeBrEaKMy sense is that it will take a severe jolt, unlike any we have ever seen in our lifetimes, to shock us into reality. We cannot increase budget spending every year by assuming that revenues will keep pace.LiNeBrEaKJOSE LUIS BETANCOURTLiNeBrEaKBonita	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (78%); CITY LIFE (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (76%); TRADE REGULATORY ACTIONS (76%); LAND USE PLANNING (75%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (73%); RESEARCH (72%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (71%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); HISTORY (67%); PARKS and PLAYGROUNDS (65%); FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT (50%)  			SAN DIEGO, CA, USA (93%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 24, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The San Diego Union-Tribune   				UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (55%)  			LETTER TO ED;   								
The San Diego Union-Tribune 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Dialog;  America's finest blog 	Chris Reed  	OPINION; Pg. F-4  	941 words  	These are edited excerpts from editorial writer Chris Reed's Opinion blog. Readers are encouraged to respond to him at chris.reed@uniontrib.comLiNeBrEaKOnline: To check out Reed's blog, go to opinionblog.uniontrib.comLiNeBrEaKHow the California air board emulated Bush White House tacticsLiNeBrEaKOver the past eight years, the Bush administration has faced a steadily growing drumbeat of criticism over its readiness to play politics with decisions that should be driven by science. Critics have made their case convincingly. Someday soon, Californians will realize that the exact same thing has happened here -- but by a governor and officials with views opposite of the Bush team. LiNeBrEaKThis was my reaction last week after reading a distinguished group of scientists' detailed criticism of the sham science that the California Air Resources Board used to justify its recent decision to sharply cut down on diesel emissions.LiNeBrEaKTheir criticism precisely echoed the "peer review" economists' criticism of the study used to justify the air board's other big decision this month: approving a "scoping plan" for a 2006 climate-change law that will force a sharp shift to cleaner but much more expensive energy sources. That plan was defended on the literally incredible grounds that adding huge unique costs to California's economy could be done with few if any negative effects.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists who examined the diesel study faulted it for shoddy methodology, for the lack of expertise of its researchers, and for its cherry-picking of health and pollution data. James E. Enstrom, an epidemiologist with UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, also dropped a bombshell allegation: The ARB study's lead author and project coordinator, Hien Tran, was lying about his credentials.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists' warnings -- and Enstrom's now-confirmed allegations about Tran -- were ignored. Only after I begin digging into the matter last week did the air board launch a probe into whether Tran holds, as he claimed, a doctorate in statistics from the University of California at Davis.LiNeBrEaKNow that it's known Tran lied about his credentials, will the air board do the logical, honest thing and start from scratch on its diesel-regulation plan? Don't count on it. Instead, the air board will do the minimum possible to create the appearance of caring about the scandal. Remember, the board ignored Enstrom's bombshell until it was forced to respond.LiNeBrEaKWhy? Because in Arnold Schwarzenegger's state government, priority No. 1 is helping the governor in his frantic efforts to establish himself as a Global Green Giant. An air board scandal just might derail Arnold's quest to overtake Al Gore as environmentalists' leading pin-up boy.LiNeBrEaKMany adjectives come to mind to describe this state of affairs. I'll settle for this one: ridiculous.LiNeBrEaKUC president sided with legislator over threatened employeesLiNeBrEaKDuring University of California President Mark Yudof's recent visit with the U-T editorial board, he talked about how he was pressured by Democratic legislative leaders into restoring $4 million in funds for a bogus think thank that actually amounts to a taxpayer-funded union advocacy group. But he appeared far less candid in describing his dealings with the Legislature after a desperately needed bill protecting UC animal researchers from animal-rights terrorists was gutted by a powerful senator.LiNeBrEaKIn May -- after dozens of scary incidents, intimidation attempts and bombings -- UC officials got the Assembly to unanimously pass a bill giving animal researchers the same protection against cyberstalking provided to elected officials and abortion-clinic workers. It also would have made it easier to get injunctions against and pursue civil lawsuits against animal-rights extremists.LiNeBrEaKBut then Senate Judiciary Chairwoman Ellen Corbett -- an animal rights true believer -- quietly eviscerated the bill, so all it did was allow for misdemeanor trespassing charges against extremists who go to researchers' homes. Only after criticism from San Diego Union-Tribune and San Jose Mercury-News editorial writers did a bill more like what the Assembly passed reappear.LiNeBrEaKYudof, however, credited his staff. "I told them to go back and get a better bill. Eventually we did."LiNeBrEaKThis is a complete rewrite of history. When I was tracking this story closely in August, no one said anything about pressure from Yudof's office. Instead, incredibly enough, it was more concerned about criticism of Corbett. Wayne Hume, UC executive vice president, even wrote a letter to the U-T defending the senator!LiNeBrEaKSorry, that's craven. Hume should be ashamed. So should Yudof. Giving into pressure from legislators on a few million in a multibillion-dollar budget is one thing. Giving into pressure from legislators on possibly life-saving protections for UC employees is another entirely.LiNeBrEaKIs John Vasconcellos running DMV?LiNeBrEaKI renewed my car registration online last week, a simple process that took less than two minutes. When I was done, the DMV Web site had this message:LiNeBrEaKCONGRATULATIONS!LiNeBrEaKYour online registration renewal was successful!LiNeBrEaKHuh? The DMV thinks Californians are so starved for praise that successfully completing a short, simple transaction deserves a "CONGRATULATIONS!"?LiNeBrEaKIt made me think of former state lawmaker John Vasconcellos, who saw raising self-esteem as the key to societal bliss and in 1986 got the state government to create a task force promoting self-esteem.LiNeBrEaKIs he now running DMV? Advising it?LiNeBrEaKAlas, no. Googling shows Vasconcellos is retired and splits his time between Santa Clara and Maui, where he snorkels and swims every day. It would do wonders for most people's self-esteem if they could have a second home on Maui.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Unworthy of trust;  Air board ignored warning signs on controversial, costly proposals 		OPINION; Pg. F-2  	355 words  	For decades, the California Coastal Commission has been run by extremists with an aversion to private property rights. Now, a similar extremism has infected the California Air Resources Board. That is the only conclusion to draw from the air board's recent adoption of sweeping rules forcing a switch to cleaner but costlier types of energy and imposing costly new restrictions on vehicles using diesel fuel. On both measures, there were huge warning signs about the proposals -- red flags board members blithely ignored. LiNeBrEaKThe first measure -- the "Scoping Plan" to implement a 2006 law meant to reduce the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming -- prompted scathing criticism from prominent economists hired to evaluate its claim that it would yield broad economic gains. Two said the air board's study appeared to have been written to justify the plan, not evaluate it.LiNeBrEaKThe handling of the second measure was even more outrageous. Last month, James E. Enstrom, an epidemiologist with UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, began looking into the credentials of those responsible for the diesel study. Enstrom was motivated by dismay over the study's slapdash quality and its omission of crucial evidence. He found that the study's lead author and coordinator, air board scientist Hien Tran, did not have the degree he claimed -- a doctorate in statistics from the University of California Davis.LiNeBrEaKBefore the vote on the diesel regulations, Enstrom wrote the air board about his discovery, and told three members face-to-face.LiNeBrEaKAnd no one did a thing. Instead of starting from scratch -- or at least postponing approval until an internal investigation was completed -- the air board adopted sweeping rules based on work by someone who lied about his credentials.LiNeBrEaKWith the air board -- as with the Coastal Commission -- zealotry comes before honesty, fairness and common sense.LiNeBrEaKAs for Tran, the air board only began an internal investigation into his background after the Union-Tribune's inquiries. For all the board cared, Tran could have been a junior high dropout -- so long as his "findings" reinforced its extreme views.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		December 21, 2008 Sunday  Correction Appended	Colorado River may face fight of its life;  Increased toxins likely as energy companies seek oil, gas, uranium 	Abrahm Lustgarten and David Hasemyer, PROPUBLICA, STAFF WRITER  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	2063 words  	The Colorado River has endured drought, large-scale climate changes, pollution, ecological damage from dams and battles by seven states to draw more water.LiNeBrEaKNow the life vein of the Southwest faces another threat: Energy companies are sucking up the Colorado's water to support increased development of oil, natural gas and uranium deposits along the river's basin. The mining and drilling will likely send more toxins into the waterway, which provides drinking water for one out of 12 Americans and nourishes 15 percent of the nation's crops along its journey from Wyoming and Colorado to Mexico.LiNeBrEaKTapping the watershed is enticing because its resources could help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. The region could contain more oil than Alaska's National Arctic Wildlife Refuge. It has the richest natural gas fields in the country and plenty of uranium deposits.LiNeBrEaKBut scientists and water managers warn that in the rush to develop more domestic energy, the government is failing to understand that the river's economic and ecological value is as vital to U.S. interests as anything extracted around it. LiNeBrEaKThe river is so beleaguered by drought and past pollution that one environmental study called it the nation's most endangered waterway. Researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla said the river's reservoirs could dry up in 13 years, depriving regions such as San Diego County of their main source of water.LiNeBrEaKIn the eight years President Bush has been in office, the Colorado River watershed has seen more oil and gas drilling than at any time since 1984, when the government began keeping such statistics. Uranium claims have reached a 10-year high.LiNeBrEaKLast week, the administration auctioned off 359,000 acres of federal land for natural gas projects within range of two national parks near Moab, Utah. And a last-minute change in federal rules has paved the way for water-intensive oil shale mining in the watershed.LiNeBrEaKAs Bush tries to complete his agenda for development, water managers and politicians focusing on the Colorado River are asking which is more valuable: energy or water?LiNeBrEaKThe question will continue to be debated during the presidency of Barack Obama, who has said he will work to balance energy exploration with environmental protection.LiNeBrEaK"The decisions we are making today will be dictating how we will be living the rest of our lives," said Jim Pokrandt, a spokesman for the Colorado River Conservation District, a state-run policy agency. "We may have reached mutually exclusive demands on our water supply."LiNeBrEaKManagement divideLiNeBrEaKDetermining the best uses for the Colorado is complicated because there's no unified management.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department, which includes the Bureau of Land Management, oversees where the water goes but not what's needed to keep it clean. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for maintaining water quality, but it can't control who uses the river and doesn't conduct its own research. EPA officials also delegate much of their authority to the seven states that the river runs through.LiNeBrEaK"I don't know that there is, quite honestly, anyone that looks at an entire overview impact statement of the Colorado River," said Robert Walsh, a spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation, which governs the allocation and flow of the southern part of the waterway.LiNeBrEaKOil and natural-gas drilling in Colorado requires so much water that if its annual demand were satisfied all at once, it would be the equivalent of shutting off most of Southern California's water for five days.LiNeBrEaKConcerns also are being raised about contaminants the energy industry leaves behind.LiNeBrEaKCompany representatives say they adhere to environmental laws, but natural gas drilling has caused contamination across the West. Mining has a similar history of pollution.LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials and the Bush administration said America's reliance on foreign oil makes using all available energy resources at home a priority.LiNeBrEaK"I believe this country needs to offer domestic resources to be energy-independent," said Tim Spisak, a senior official who heads the BLM's oil and gas development group. "The way to do that is to responsibly develop public resources on our lands."LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. House and Senate are considering bills that would require better management of the nation's water assets. But some water managers said that's not enough. They want the president to create a national water authority -- or a Cabinet-level water czar.LiNeBrEaK"If you are really going to deal with water, the nation needs to deal with it in a far more comprehensive manner," said Brad Udall, a federal water researcher based at the University of Colorado and son of the late Mo Udall, a congressman from Arizona who championed environmental causes.LiNeBrEaKDuring Bush's presidency, the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the state of Arizona and the Metropolitan Water District -- the wholesale provider for Southern California -- have asked the Interior Department to proceed with caution as it approves record numbers of claims and leases for mining and drilling near the river.LiNeBrEaK"We have other sources of (energy)," said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District. "We don't have other sources of water."LiNeBrEaKThreat of pollutionLiNeBrEaKNew uranium-mining claims within five miles of the river have more than tripled -- to 1,195 from 395 -- in the past six years, according to a review of BLM records by the Environmental Working Group, a national organization that conducts research on a wide variety of health and ecological issues.LiNeBrEaKThe region already suffers from a decades-long record of contamination. The Metropolitan Water District points to a 16 million-ton pile of radioactive waste near a mill in Moab as a warning of what can happen when mining isn't carefully controlled.LiNeBrEaKThe mill closed in 1984, but the Grand Canyon Trust estimates that 110,000 gallons of radioactive groundwater still seep into the river each day. The first loads of waste aren't scheduled to be hauled off until next year.LiNeBrEaKIndustry officials say the Moab case is an outdated blight from the past.LiNeBrEaK"What gets my ire up is when we get compared to stuff that happened in the '60s. There is no argument from us now about being careful -- with an eye to preserving the environment," said Peter Farmer, CEO of Denison Mines, a Canadian company that operates seven U.S. uranium mines and a uranium mill in Blanding, Utah.LiNeBrEaKDenison recently spent more than $5 million to triple-line a waste pit and outfit it with leak-detection sensors.LiNeBrEaKRoger Haskins, a specialist in mining law at the BLM, said landmark environmental regulations in the 1970s prepared the industry for the 21st century. While it's still easy to stake a mining claim, projects now must undergo extensive environmental review before they can operate as mines.LiNeBrEaK"Whatever happens out there is thoroughly manageable in today's regulatory environment," Haskins said.LiNeBrEaKScientists say some degree of pollution is inevitable.LiNeBrEaKDrilling for uranium creates pathways where raw, radioactive material can migrate into underground aquifers that drain into the river. Surface water can seep into the drill holes and mine shafts, picking up traces of uranium and then percolating into underground water sources.LiNeBrEaK"There has to be some impact to downstream water," said David Naftz, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Salt Lake City who studies uranium mining.LiNeBrEaKA recent study found contaminated surface water at 15 of 25 mines that the EPA approved starting in 1969. Those sites used techniques the EPA had said would prevent pollution, according to the Environmental Working Group.LiNeBrEaKDanger from drillingLiNeBrEaKIn the past decade, a pattern of contamination also has emerged where natural-gas drilling has intensified. If drilling increases substantially across Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, it could imperil the river.LiNeBrEaKMost wells rely on a process called hydraulic fracturing, which requires as much as 2 million gallons of water plus small amounts of often-toxic chemicals for a single well.LiNeBrEaKIn February, a waste pit on a mesa overlooking the town of Parachute, Colo., leaked and allowed about 1. 6 million gallons of fluid to soak into the ground. The spill eventually reached the Colorado River.LiNeBrEaKColorado state records show that of about 1,500 spills in drilling areas since 2003, more than 300 have seeped into water.LiNeBrEaKDoug Hock, a spokesman for Canadian gas company Encana, which drills in Colorado and Wyoming, said the fears of pollution are exaggerated. He said Encana installs steel and concrete casing around its drill pipes, lines its waste pits and increasingly reuses its treated wastewater.LiNeBrEaK"We have put in place safeguards to protect the water," Hock said. "There is always a balance -- this country has a great demand for energy."LiNeBrEaKBecause the energy industry has been exempted from certain environmental rules during the Bush administration, it's difficult to gauge what the industry has done to the river.LiNeBrEaKThe mix of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing is now proprietary. Without knowing the ingredients, EPA officials and scientists can't determine which compounds to test for after a spill.LiNeBrEaKA September report from the University of Colorado Denver predicted that in 15 years, Garfield County, a drilling area bisected by the river, will have 23,000 wells, six times what it has now.LiNeBrEaKGetting oil from rockLiNeBrEaKNo project poses a greater threat to the Colorado River -- or better represents the choice between water and energy -- than mining for oil shale.LiNeBrEaKIn mid-November, the BLM approved a rule change that paved the way for extracting oil from rock deposits in Colorado and Utah. If the vast deposits are mined to their potential -- and it could be a decade before any of the projects move forward -- the reserves could help the United States make a significant leap toward energy independence.LiNeBrEaKGetting oil from the shale would be astronomically expensive. It also might require more water than the Colorado River can provide.LiNeBrEaKA recent study for the state of Colorado found that energy projects in the waterway's upper basin would stop the river's flow for nearly six weeks if all the water they required were tapped at the same time.LiNeBrEaK"It just comes down to how needy the nation is for energy," said Scott Ruppe, general manager of the Uintah Water Conservancy District in northeastern Utah. "If energy is short, then some of the other concerns might get pushed aside."LiNeBrEaKIn a few weeks, it will be up to Obama to set the priorities for managing the Colorado River. He could limit mining claims in ecologically sensitive areas and rigorously enforce existing environmental regulations. Once a lease is signed, though, it's nearly impossible to reverse.LiNeBrEaKObama also could try to undo some of the Bush administration's rules, but any changes wouldn't take effect for several years.LiNeBrEaKHis greatest opportunity to address the conflict between water and energy may lie not in undoing policies from the past, but in looking to the future.LiNeBrEaK"The (new) administration has an opportunity to start thinking about water as a national resource," said Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority in Las Vegas. "We have no rearview mirrors anymore."LiNeBrEaKCOLORADO RIVERLiNeBrEaKThe waterway starts in the snowfields of Wyoming and Colorado, then runs about 1,450 miles to Mexico.LiNeBrEaKDozens of creeks and streams feed into it.LiNeBrEaKThe river provides drinking water for more than 27 million people in seven states -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKRecreation areas along the river include Grand Canyon National Park. [][][] BEHIND THE STORYLiNeBrEaKAbrahm Lustgarten at ProPublica has reported for six months on how oil and natural gas drilling affects water supplies in the Rocky Mountain West.LiNeBrEaKWhen the Colorado River emerged as an important piece of his coverage, Lustgarten started working with The San Diego Union-Tribune's David Hasemyer, who has written about uranium mining's impact on the waterway for more than a decade.LiNeBrEaKTogether, they looked at the potential environmental and water-use consequences of increased mining and drilling in the river's watershed.LiNeBrEaKProPublica is an independent, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to pursue watchdog journalism in the public interest.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Engineering solutions  		OPINION  	480 words  	"Water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink."LiNeBrEaKSo lamented the Ancient Mariner. But so say many of us, bemoaning the lack of a reliable supply of water. LiNeBrEaKIt is tragic that we do not have the kind of far sighted political leadership of yesteryear that resulted in the Owens River and California aqueducts and the planning and execution of the Metropolitan Water District.LiNeBrEaKInstead, today, in Southern California (and elsewhere) we have a proliferation of water boards or agencies, obviously designed through litigation, to solve political appetites, rather than provide a coherent, long-term solution to the water needs of this area.LiNeBrEaKThese are nesting spots for a wide variety of local politicians, perhaps well-intentioned, appointed by their fellow politicians. This reminds me of a commentary I heard in Washington D.C. describing Congress as akin to a log floating down the Potomac, carrying hundreds of ants, each one believing that he (or she) was steering the log. This is not a creative forum for solving our water problems.LiNeBrEaKThis year, as in many recent prior years, we will again watch rain waters as they are swept out to sea. Once more, confounding the Ancient Mariner and his descendants.LiNeBrEaKDuring every recent lean water year various schemes are advanced to address this problem, primarily conservation (which is good, but has no long-term vision). These ideas range from more desalinization plants to floating Alaskan icebergs south (global warming not withstanding).LiNeBrEaKThere are also some very deep aquifers in a number of continental areas that could be examined. But how about one or two or 300 years from now? We need the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that gave us the Suez and Panama Canals, and earlier, the ancient European aqueducts.LiNeBrEaKOne suggestion I like is to import waters from Alaska and Canada through existing rivers and lakes augmented by aqueducts and canals, similar to the Owens River and California aqueducts. But, on a grander scale! This envisions storing surplus water in a permanent reserve such as the Rocky Mountain Trench (formed by the Continental Divide). It would create the ability to ensure a permanent supply of water, not only to the entire U.S., but to Mexico, as well. It would cost a few trillion dollars, over time, but worth it. As an engineer, I like this kind of approach.LiNeBrEaKLet's push our elected representatives for a solution to this problem!LiNeBrEaKJames E. Bihr, WhittierLiNeBrEaKA tall orderLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's challenge will be to transform campaign themes of "hope" and "change" into action to revive an ailing economy, expand health coverage and redirect America's foreign policy. A tall order to be sure.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama is smart by surrounding himself with competent people.LiNeBrEaKAnd undoubtedly Obama is inheriting a mess, but I believe the voters have chosen the right person to balance the needs of a struggling nation.LiNeBrEaKBernard Leyva, Whittier	EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); POLITICS (89%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (89%); AQUIFERS and WATERSHEDS (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (78%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (77%); RIVERS (76%); WATER RIGHTS (76%); LAKES (71%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (69%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (66%); ENGINEERING (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  		BARACK OBAMA (81%)  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); ALASKA, USA (92%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); NORTH AMERICA (79%); MEXICO (79%)  	December 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

He minimizes the effect even small increases in average global temperature will have on weather patterns and the geographic distribution of heat, rain, wind and the like. Lomborg also has a reputation for playing fast and loose with the facts, selectively citing studies that support his theses without much regard for their reliability or the existence of contradictory studies or research.LiNeBrEaKStill, his overall concept has merit. Our challenge is both to reduce our contribution to global warming (primarily by reducing CO"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_0 = "LOOKUP"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_1 = "2"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_2 = "emissions) and also to prepare ourselves to deal with the climate change that is already more or less certain to occur.

The Sunday Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   Sunrise Edition	New day, fresh policy in forests  	MICHAEL MILSTEIN, The Oregonian  	Local News  	1408 words  	SUMMARY: Falling prices   | Some environmental groups say they want to work with private owners to head off sales of forestlandLiNeBrEaKFall in wood products market redirects environmentalist concerns Some conservation groups now want to work with private owners to head off large sales of Oregon forestlandLiNeBrEaKNew day,LiNeBrEaKfresh policyLiNeBrEaKin forests LiNeBrEaKPressure forLiNeBrEaKhomesitesLiNeBrEaKspurs changeLiNeBrEaKMICHAEL MILSTEINLiNeBrEaKYou might guess environmental groups would be glad timber prices have collapsed to where loggers' chain saws have fallen silent and sawmills are shutting down.LiNeBrEaKInstead, they're nervous. If logging doesn't pay, the same timber companies some environmentalists have blamed for ruining the forest may get rid of the forest --selling off their prime real estate. Then subdivisions could grow instead of trees, absent the wildlife, clean water and other benefits forests typically present.LiNeBrEaKA rising number of environmental groups now want to help the timber industry stay in business by providing funds or other support. The question is whether they can save timber companies and mills reeling from the collapse of housing and construction.LiNeBrEaK"It's a new day --it's a new landscape," said Guido Rahr, president of the Wild Salmon Center in Portland. "We have to realize private-land timber companies are our friend. Once land gets broken up into smaller pieces, our ability to protect it is eliminated."LiNeBrEaKThough some logging practices can harm fish, he said, the loss of forests altogether is much worse. That's even more true as trees are increasingly counted on to soak up greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKSome land conservation groups such as Ecotrust, The Nature Conservancy, The Conservation Fund and Pacific Forest Trust have for years tried to protect prime forest by buying it or purchasing easements that limit development. But they cannot alone safeguard enough land.LiNeBrEaK"We do not at this point have the capital to be meaningful players," said Lawrence Selzer, president of The Conservation Fund, which is based in Arlington, Va. He said the solution is to work with large forestland owners to help them profit from their forests so they do not sell the land off.LiNeBrEaKAn estimated 1. 5 million acres of forestland is lost in the United States each year, said Constance Best, co-founder of the Pacific Forest Trust. So far, Oregon has not seen as much loss as many other states. Trees grow so well in Oregon it often makes more financial sense to hold onto the land.LiNeBrEaKBut as population grows and expands into rural areas, the real estate value of land may increasingly outweigh its value as forest.LiNeBrEaKRadical rethinkingLiNeBrEaKHolding onto working forests is the single largest conservation challenge facing the country, Selzer said. But some environmental groups have focused so much on trying to block activities such as logging, he said, they have a hard time shifting their sights to support continued cutting.LiNeBrEaK"The environmental community has spent 40 years perfecting the art of saying no and has almost no ability to say yes," Selzer said.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Doug Heiken of Oregon Wild does not see a high risk of forest sell-offs in Oregon, as long as land-use laws keep it under control. He said it's more important to reform clear-cutting and road-building practices, and warned about promoting the business prospects of timber companies.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a bit hesitant to make forestry a highly profitable enterprise, because it means there's going to be more logging," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe financial argument for maintaining private forests has steadily weakened for years, as wood that grows quickly in far-flung places like Brazil filled the world market and pushed timber prices down. That's good for consumers, but not for forest owners hoping to profit from long-term forestry.LiNeBrEaKIn pure dollar terms, with forests, "you're almost always better off selling it versus holding it," said Matthew Donegan, co-president of Forest Capital Partners, a Portland investment firm that owns and manages more than 2. 5 million acres of forest around the country.LiNeBrEaKIn Idaho, the company calculates that selling forest outright would bring in 6. 5 times more money than holding and harvesting it over the long term. In western Oregon, the payoff is not as great --selling brings in only 1. 5 times more than holding the land.LiNeBrEaKThat's because Oregon's land use controls make real estate development less lucrative and because trees grow well on the wetter west side of the state, Donegan said. Forestland loss has been minimal in western Oregon.LiNeBrEaKThe picture is different in northeast Oregon, though. Trees grow more slowly and sawmills have shut down, so it's more difficult to make logging pay. There, selling forestland generates almost three times as much revenue as holding it over the long term.LiNeBrEaKSupport industries fadeLiNeBrEaKThat illustrates the importance of holding onto logging infrastructure, including sawmills and a work force, in rural areas. In eastern Oregon, public lands are the main source of timber, but logging levels have dropped.LiNeBrEaK"Where are we going to get our loggers, where are we going to take our logs?" Donegan said. "Sure enough, those lands get developed because there's no other economic opportunities."LiNeBrEaKTraditional timber companies such as International Paper have sold much of their land to investment companies known as Timberland Investment Management Organizations and Real Estate Investment Trusts. Often the choicest parcels --where new homes could be built --are separated and sold on their own.LiNeBrEaKThough some of the investment companies aim to hold forestland for the long term, others may be more focused on generating revenues for investors.LiNeBrEaK"They are not generally long-term owners or long-term stewards of the land," Selzer said.LiNeBrEaKThe reason some forest owners maintain working forests is mainly because it diversifies their investments --and because they like owning forests, Donegan said.LiNeBrEaK"Most forest owners want to own forest and want to hold it and are looking for an excuse to hold it," Donegan said. "And yet, if a piece of land is worth 10 times more selling it than holding it in the long term, how can I handle my fiduciary responsibility if I'm blind to that?"LiNeBrEaKHe has identified four main strategies to close the gap in revenue between selling and holding forestland:LiNeBrEaK*  Boost the profitability of timber by growing it faster or more efficiently.LiNeBrEaK*  Generate more revenue beyond the timber. Forest owners might be paid for the greenhouse gases soaked up by their trees, for instance.LiNeBrEaK*  Sell development rights to the land. For example, conservation groups may buy easements that provides forest owners revenue while they give up the right to develop the land.LiNeBrEaK*  Restrict development through zoning, so it's not as profitable.LiNeBrEaKSome form of all the strategies are in play around the country. For example, Minnesota pays Forest Capital Partners $7 per acre of forestland per year in exchange for the company's commitment to manage the land sustainably and allow public access for recreation.LiNeBrEaKHe said such land conservation moves have become a major source of pride for the company.LiNeBrEaKIn 2001, the Pacific Forest Trust protected 7,200 acres of Douglas fir and hemlock forest in Lincoln County, known as the Van Eck Forest, with a conservation easement that prevents development but promotes sustainable forestry.LiNeBrEaKAdditional logging regulations could make forests less profitable and lead to more land sales, said Ray Wilkeson of the Oregon Forest Industries Council. It could also resurrect a version of Measure 37, which was supported by timber companies, opening the door to more development.LiNeBrEaKHe said his group will ask the Legislature next year to give forest owners more protection from regulations by allowing them to make claims for lost revenue caused by any new regulations in the future.LiNeBrEaKPolling by the forest industries council over the past 10 years shows that Oregonians did not support bans on clear-cutting --a profitable logging practice --if it means the land could be sold for development.LiNeBrEaK"They may not like the looks of it, but they understand that subdivisions affect their quality of life," Wilkeson said.LiNeBrEaKDonegan said collaboration between timber companies and the conservation community represents new and welcome opportunities.LiNeBrEaK"It's something where we can work constructively with the conservation community," he said. "There's a lot of fatigue in the industry from the timber wars, and this is moving past that."LiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689; michaelmilstein@LiNeBrEaKnews.oregonian.com	LOGGING INDUSTRY (92%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (91%); SAW MILLS (90%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); WOOD PRODUCTS MFG (90%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (90%); FORESTRY and LOGGING TRADE (90%); FORESTRY and LOGGING (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); BOTTLED WATER (89%); REAL ESTATE (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (88%); EMISSIONS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); EASEMENTS and RIGHTS OF WAY (71%); POPULATION GROWTH (54%); FORESTRY and LOGGING SECTOR PERFORMANCE (78%); HOME PRICES (78%)  			PORTLAND, OR, USA (73%) OREGON, USA (94%); VIRGINIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 22, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Sunday Oregonian All Rights Reserved  															
The Times-Tribune (Scranton, Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: NEPA priorities for new stimulus  	The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	537 words  	Dec. 21--President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats already are working on a two-year, $850 billion economic stimulus package that they plan to pass during the first two weeks of the new administration. Its focus will be infrastructure development and repair -- much of which is needed regardless of the economic crisis. LiNeBrEaKNortheast Pennsylvania is well-positioned for such a program, politically and in terms of legitimate need. Government leaders from throughout the region should work closely and quickly with Reps. Paul Kanjorski and Chris Carney and, especially, Sen. Bob Casey -- who is close to fellow Scranton native and Vice President-elect Joe Biden and Mr. Obama -- to establish a viable priority list.LiNeBrEaKMany of the projects that could benefit Northeast Pennsylvania also would meet multiple objectives already embraced by the administration.LiNeBrEaKA key candidate for inclusion should be restoration of passenger rail service from Scranton to the New York City area, with operations conducted by New Jersey Transit or Amtrak. That project also could result in service being restored all the way to Syracuse, N.Y.LiNeBrEaKThe project not only would generate substantial economic activity, but reduce traffic congestion, fight air pollution and global warming, conserve fuel and help re-establish an effective national rail passenger system.LiNeBrEaKLikewise, many sewer systems in the region are under federal orders to implement expensive upgrades. Scranton's system alone, for example, faces a project that could cost $150 million or more, and for which the sewer authority has begun to implement a series of substantial rate increases.LiNeBrEaKIncluding projects such as those in a national infrastructure effort would help to boost the economy while meeting federal objectives for cleaner waterways, which themselves would create further economic activity. Attending to such projects in this region would have the added benefit of accelerating the rehabilitation of the Chesapeake Bay, a separate federal/state initiative that has had intermittent success.LiNeBrEaKEstablishment of the region as Wall Street West, the secure back-up for New York-based financial markets, has been hindered by infrastructure and technical issues. Use of the stimulus for that project itself would help to boost confidence in the markets by ensuring their security.LiNeBrEaKPennsylvania, generally, has the nation's highest percentage of highway bridges that need urgent repair, and the state also lags in widely accessible broadband Internet.LiNeBrEaKThe objective is not simply to develop a project list, but to establish priority for projects that boost economic activity for the long term while meeting national objectives.LiNeBrEaKThe clock already is ticking. Local leaders should make sure that they and the congressional delegation are on the same page.

The Tribune-Democrat (Johnstown, Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Retired biologist on a mission to halt global warming  	Joe Gorden, Tribune-Democrat, Johnstown, Pa.  	SPORTS  	733 words  	Dec. 21--Ed Perry has put a lot of miles on his car in the past year, traveling the countryside on behalf of the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) and its campaign against global warming.LiNeBrEaKThat mission has brought the retired aquatic biologist to Johnstown previously, and will again when he speaks at Pitt-Johnstown early next year.LiNeBrEaK"We are trying to get our legislators -- our representatives at the federal level and our two senators -- to support legislation that will begin reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2 percent a year so that by the year 2050, we have an 80 percent reduction in our emissions," Perry said. "In that way, we are hoping to avoid the worst of the temperature increase that the scientist are predicting." LiNeBrEaKPerry is talking about the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, which proposes that the federal government set caps on carbon dioxide emissions from facilities such as coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKThe idea is to set those standards below present emissions, then require corporations who own such plants to obtain federal permits to continue to operate.LiNeBrEaKPresumably, companies with newer or more efficient systems that produce fewer emissions would be able to sell unneeded permits to inefficient operators, allowing both to stay in business, but creating incentives to modernize. By reducing the number of permits by 2 percent a year, the act presumably would achieve the 80 percent reduction in 40 years.LiNeBrEaK"It will not only be good for our air quality and reduce the impacts of global warming, but will be good for our economy and for our national security," Perry said. "If we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and go to a different economy, one based on our renewable energy, we are going to be able to create literally millions of new jobs re-powering America in a different energy future, and greatly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. No one is talking about shutting off the oil supply, or coal or natural gas. But, we have got to move to a new energy future by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and moving toward energy independence."LiNeBrEaKPerry's quest is to tell hunters and fishermen how global warming will affect their sports, and he's had some success. At least 60 state sportsmen's groups have signed a letter supporting the initiative.LiNeBrEaKPerry shows fishermen an Environmental Protection Agency map showing states likely to lose up to half of their trout and salmon habitat in coming years and which others -- among them Pennsylvania -- are expected to lose half to all of their trout habitat.LiNeBrEaK"The forecast for trout and salmon is not very good," he said. "It's not as clear for the hunter, at least in Pennsylvania. But, in other parts of the country, species like moose are already moving their range north. Moose populations in Minnesota have plummeted in the past 20-25 years as the winter temperatures have gone up substantially. Teal used to over-winter in South America. Now, they're over-wintering in marshes in Louisiana and Texas."LiNeBrEaKBut, not everyone is convinced the threat is as dire as the NWF claims, and there are those who don't believe global warming presents any threat at all.LiNeBrEaKFourteen Pennsylvania chapters of the Izaak Walton League and 22 Trout Unlimited chapters in Pennsylvania have signed the letter, as have three county affiliates of the Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs -- including Cambria County.LiNeBrEaKBut, the divide in public opinion, reflected in its membership, has kept the PFSC on the sidelines.LiNeBrEaK"We decided to stay neutral on the issue for now because we had people 100 percent supportive and people 100 percent opposed," said PFSC Executive Director Melody Zullinger. "We felt, because of the controversy, we would remain neutral."LiNeBrEaKThat neutrality cost the PFSC its long-term ties with the NWF, which denied the state's largest sportsmen's organization the chance to renew their affiliation because of what is said was a conflict of goals.LiNeBrEaKInformation: www.targetglobalwarming.org.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	2 trillion tons of ice have melted  	AP Wire Services  	News; Pg. A16  	675 words  	WASHINGTON (AP) More than 2 trillion tons of land ice in Greenland, Antarctica and Alaska have melted since 2003, according to new NASA satellite data that show the latest signs of what scientists say is global warming. More than half of the loss of landlocked ice in the past five years has occurred in Greenland, based on measurements of ice weight by NASA's GRACE satellite, said NASA geophysicist Scott Luthcke. The water melting from Greenland in the past five years would fill up about 11 Chesapeake Bays, he said, and the Greenland melt seems to be accelerating. NASA scientists presented their findings Thursday at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco.  LiNeBrEaKLuthcke said Greenland figures for the summer of 2008 aren't complete yet, but this year's ice loss, while still significant, won't be as severe as 2007. The news was better for Alaska. After a precipitous drop in 2005, land ice increased slightly in 2008 because of large winter snowfalls, Luthcke said. Since 2003, when the NASA satellite started taking measurements, Alaska has lost 400 billion tons of land ice. In assessing climate change, scientists generally look at several years to determine the overall trend. Melting of land ice, unlike sea ice, increases sea levels very slightly. In the 1990s, Greenland didn't add to world sea level rise; now that island is adding about half a millimeter of sea level rise a year, NASA ice scientist Jay Zwally said in a telephone interview from the conference. Between Greenland, Antarctica and Alaska, melting land ice has raised global sea levels about one-fifth of an inch in the past five years, Luthcke said. Sea levels also rise from water expanding as it warms. Other research presented at the geophysical meeting points to more melting concerns from global warming, especially with sea ice. "It's not getting better; it's continuing to show strong signs of warming and amplification," Zwally said. "There's no reversal taking place." Scientists studying sea ice will announce that parts of the Arctic north of Alaska were 9 to 10 degrees warmer this past fall, a strong early indication of what researchers call the Arctic amplification effect. That's when the Arctic warms faster than predicted, and warming there is accelerating faster than elsewhere on the globe. As sea ice melts, the Arctic waters absorb more heat in the summer, having lost the reflective powers of vast packs of white ice. That absorbed heat is released into the air in the fall. That has led to autumn temperatures in the last several years that are six to 10 degrees warmer than they were in the 1980s, said research scientist Julienne Stroeve at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. That's a strong and early impact of global warming, she said. "The pace of change is starting to outstrip our ability to keep up with it, in terms of our understanding of it," said Mark Serreze, senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., a co-author of the Arctic amplification study. Two other studies coming out at the conference assess how Arctic thawing is releasing methane the second most potent greenhouse gas. One study shows that the loss of sea ice warms the water, which warms the permafrost on nearby land in Alaska, thus producing methane, Stroeve says. A second study suggests even larger amounts of frozen methane are trapped in lakebeds and sea bottoms around Siberia, and they are starting to bubble to the surface in some spots in alarming amounts, said Igor Semiletov, a professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. In late summer, Semiletov found methane bubbling up from parts of the East Siberian Sea and Laptev Sea at levels that were 10 times higher than they were in the mid-1990s, he said based on a study this summer.

The Washington Times 		December 21, 2008 Sunday 	Obama science-tech team takes aim at global warming  	By Stephen Dinan, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A02  	443 words  	President-elect Barack Obama on Saturday said he will "once again put science at the top of our agenda" and announced a science-and-technology team designed to tackle global warming. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama tapped John Holdren, a physicist from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, to be his science adviser; named Harold Varmus and Eric Lander to round out the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology; and said he will nominate Jane Lubchenco to be administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama said science and technology can help provide jobs, but said as president he will look to his team for more than that.LiNeBrEaK"Promoting science isn't just about providing resources - it's about protecting free and open inquiry. It's about ensuring that facts and evidence are never twisted or obscured by politics or ideology," he said in his weekly radio address. "It's about listening to what our scientists have to say, even when it's inconvenient - especially when it's inconvenient."LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama didn't mention President Bush by name but appeared to be referring to the president when he said he wanted to "once again put science at the top of our agenda."LiNeBrEaKMr. Bush has faced criticism for not moving faster to try to cap greenhouse-gas emissions, which scientists say are contributing to warming of the planet. Mr. Obama's team is far more disposed to action: The president-elect has chosen several people for his Cabinet and advisory positions who have been outspoken on the need for carbon-emissions curbs.LiNeBrEaKMr. Holdren, as a professor and head of various science groups, has called for a boost in spending on science and for faster action to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We are not talking anymore about what climate models say might happen in the future," he told the British Broadcasting Corp. in 2006. "We are experiencing dangerous human disruption of the global climate, and we're going to experience more."LiNeBrEaKMr. Holdren has weighed in on other issues, including calling on the U.S. to issue a "no first use" policy for nuclear weapons and to take nuclear retaliation off the table as a response to chemical or biological attacks.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Mr. Obama and his family arrived Saturday in his native Hawaii for a 12-day holiday vacation on Oahu, the Associated Press reported. Mr. Obama, wife Michelle and their two young daughters spent most of the 10-hour, nonstop flight from Chicago in the front cabin of the United Airlines plane.LiNeBrEaKThe family in past years spent Christmas visiting Mr. Obama's maternal grandmother, who died Nov. 2. The Obamas are expected to hold a private memorial service for Madelyn Payne Dunham early this week.

The Washington Post 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   Every Edition	This Winter, Carve Out Some Time to Skate in Manhattan  		TRAVEL; Pg. P06  	1529 words  	In Manhattan, the magic of Christmas is frozen in ice -- and time. The city's many skating rinks capture a more innocent age, when kids believed in Santa, not gift cards. "It's a romantic idea to skate in New York, to look up and see the Christmas tree and have the snow falling down," said Peter Eurich, a vice president of the Skating Club of New York, the country's second-oldest organization of its kind (established in 1863). "It's definitely New York, and it's definitely an attraction."LiNeBrEaKEurich's favorite venue is Wollman Rink in Central Park. For one thing, this competitive ice dancer learned to skate here a dozen years ago, at age 59. In addition, during the club's early years, members practiced on a pond across the street from the Plaza Hotel, near the Wollman. Yet no matter where you carve your figure eights -- in midtown or uptown, surrounded by parkland or skyscrapers -- each of the rinks below is Claus-certified. (Note: Seaport Ice, a rink at South Street Seaport in Lower Manhattan, is expected to open this season as well.

A 17-foot-tall polar bear sits in the center of the 12,000-square-foot rink, twinkling with tiny lights and looking slightly stranded. Skaters also have views of the solar system hanging inside the Rose Center for Earth and Space, which abuts the outdoor venue. On the adjacent Arthur Ross Terrace, a placard teaches visitors about the plight of frozen regions because of global warming. Closes Feb. 28.LiNeBrEaKExtras: Cool down with a stroll through Theodore Roosevelt Park, below the rink. . . . Find warmth and sustenance at the Polar Bear Cafe in the North Galleria, which serves such skater delights as panini with Nutella and chocolate-covered animal crackers. . . .

The Washington Post 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   Regional Edition	The Clinton Conflict;  The former president's fundraising invites trouble. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06  	580 words  	THERE IS no getting around the uniquely difficult issues posed by the dual roles of Hillary Rodham Clinton as future secretary of state and former president Bill Clinton as the head of a foundation that raises money from foreign governments. Mr. Clinton's foundation does valuable work around the world on issues such as HIV/AIDS, climate change and economic development. Foreign governments provide critical support; Australia, Ireland, Great Britain, Sweden, Canada, France, Denmark, Norway and the Dominican Republic, among others, support the foundation's HIV/AIDS initiative, while Australia contributes to the climate change program. But Mr. Clinton's good works also fall squarely within the future domain of Ms. Clinton, and his commitment to continue to raise money for these programs while his wife is in office presents inevitable opportunities for conflict of interest and other difficulties down the road. Ms. Clinton and the future Barack Obama administration would be better served if Mr. Clinton were to direct his prodigious energies elsewhere for the duration of her service. LiNeBrEaKThe incoming administration secured the disclosure of past donors to the Clinton presidential library and foundation; this was an important and necessary step. Under the memorandum of understanding negotiated between the two camps, the names of future donors will also be released, albeit only on an annual basis, which seems a rather languorous schedule in this day and age. In addition, new donations from foreign governments will be scrutinized by government ethics officers. Countries that simply re-up existing pledges will be exempt from this review; only if a foreign country chooses to "increase materially its commitment" or a new country signs on will the foundation "share such countries and the circumstances of the anticipated contribution with the State Department designated agency ethics official for review."LiNeBrEaKBut however worthy the cause or uncontroversial the foreign government, it strikes us that such fundraising by the former president presents an unavoidable conflict. What is the standard for the ethics official to apply? Doesn't spurning a proffered donation from a foreign government risk creating its own diplomatic problems? What happens when Secretary Clinton, visiting Country X to press for, say, a climate change agreement, is informed by the prime minister that he's just written her husband a $10 million check for that cause? What about gifts from foreign governments seeking trade concessions or approval to purchase military equipment? Even if Ms. Clinton is not influenced by gifts to her husband's charity, the appearance of a conflict is unavoidable. The better approach would be to allow existing commitments to go forward but to forswear any new ones.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, the memorandum of understanding does not appear to contemplate any prior review of contributions by foreign individuals or corporations, or by U.S. companies or individuals with overseas entanglements. So consider -- because it already happened -- the case of a wealthy investor who is seeking business opportunities in, say, Kazakhstan. He gives millions to the Clinton foundation, visits the country with the former president and obtains the sought-after contract. No one in the Obama administration will vet such a gift in advance; the public will learn of it only with the yearly disclosure. The new administration is buying itself a heap of potential trouble with this arrangement.

The Washington Post 		December 21, 2008 Sunday   Every Edition	Buy Paper With the Planet in Mind  	Eco Wise  	SUNDAY SOURCE; Pg. N08  	416 words  	Even in this electronic era, paper continues to play an integral role in our daily lives. Americans depend on about 85 million tons of paper and paperboard a year to help us clean, organize, advertise, educate and much more, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, this pulpy product comes with environmental drawbacks. These include the loss of biodiversity associated with permanent forest destruction; an energy- and water-intensive production process that generates greenhouse gases and hazardous byproducts; and a life cycle that ends in a landfill or incinerator nearly half the time.LiNeBrEaKOf course, we have choices. We can lessen paper's environmental blow first and foremost by reducing our reliance (using cloth towels in the kitchen, printing on both sides of the sheet at the office, etc.). And, when we really need to use paper, we can make better-educated buying decisions.LiNeBrEaKHere are a few tips for purchasing eco-friendly paper:LiNeBrEaKBuy recycled. Doing so saves landfill space, supports green jobs and "reduces the total amount of resources you're using," says Susan Kinsella, executive director of Conservatree, a nonprofit organization that advocates using more sustainable paper.LiNeBrEaKStudy labeling carefully. Look for products that contain post-consumer waste (or material that has completed a full life cycle); the higher the percentage, the better. A chasing-arrows symbol may simply mean a paper product is recyclable, while the word "recycled" may refer to only a small percentage of recovered fibers.LiNeBrEaKDemand certification. A number of organizations certify that the virgin fiber used in a given paper comes from responsibly managed forests. Kinsella says the one environmentalists trust most is the Forest Stewardship Council. Check with your printer or paper supplier to see whether it carries FSC-certified lines.LiNeBrEaKConsider tree-free options. Some paper is now made from agricultural crops and residues, several of which have a higher yield per acre than some types of trees used in papermaking and may have other benefits. Tree-free material is available for personal use (think cards and invites), but before buying, investigate its origins and the farming practices used. For a list of suppliers, check out http://www.conservatree.org/treefree.html.LiNeBrEaKContemplate color. Paper bleached without the use of chlorine or chlorine derivatives is less polluting. Unbleached is another step up.

Jenny Shearer, The Bakersfield Californian  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	536 words  	Dec. 20--Reaction to The Canyons project moving forward was predictably mixed Friday, and recreation and environmental representatives said they will continue to raise concerns about the housing development's impacts. LiNeBrEaKThe project on the hills behind the bluffs in northeast Bakersfield received a recommendation for approval from the Bakersfield Planning Commission Thursday.LiNeBrEaKLocal Sierra Club chapter co-chairman Gordon Nipp said he'll watch what the City Council does with the project in February.LiNeBrEaKA lawsuit could be in the offing if global climate change issues aren't adequately mitigated, he said. Nipp and air quality consultants for The Canyons strongly disagree about the project's greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKA project proponent said the rumor mill about the project was finally quieted Thursday.LiNeBrEaK"The commissioners and the public were able to see factual evidence, in both the (environmental impact report) and our presentation, that really showed what the project was all about, all the high-quality aspects of the project," said Russ Thompson, president of R. Thompson Consulting in Atascadero.LiNeBrEaKThe public will benefit from using legally accessible, planned trails, he said.LiNeBrEaKIt took years for The Canyons to get to Thursday's meeting. Those delays were caused by majority property owner General Holding, said Michelle Beck, co-chairwoman of the Bakersfield Bluffs and Trails Committee. The company owns the majority of the project's 889 acres.LiNeBrEaKHer group's concerns involve building on 10 percent of the project lands, the natural canyons that haven't been disturbed.LiNeBrEaKGoing forward, she said she would write letters to "try to have them fix that 10 percent that's so horrible," she said.LiNeBrEaKThompson said those areas that will be cut and filled are visually isolated.LiNeBrEaKThe Canyons is home to the endangered Bakersfield cactus, and although the project reps and state Dept. of Fish and Game made progress about how to protect clumps and transplant others, the department still is concerned, said Julie Vance, a senior environmental scientist who supervises the endangered species unit.LiNeBrEaK"The take of cactus has not kept pace with sort of the concentration goals for cactus," she said.LiNeBrEaKA detail still to be sorted out is a chunk of land under a Williamson Act contract, a mechanism that preserves agricultural lands. It appears the land was removed from the contract in 1977 but cancellation fees weren't paid.LiNeBrEaKJordan Kaufman, assistant treasurer for Kern County, said it would appear they would have to do another resolution. It would have to go through the city, not the county.LiNeBrEaK"I would want at this point to turn this over to county counsel or the city attorney's office," he said. "I'm not going to make a legal determination at this point."LiNeBrEaK-- Staff writer James Geluso contributed to this report.

Birmingham News (Alabama) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday 	YOUR OPINIONS  		EDITORIAL; Pg. 8A Vol. 121 No. 282  	1187 words  	Charities need gifts in trying timesLiNeBrEaKI want to thank all of our donors for their support of Kid One this past year. Without you, we would not have been able to provide more than 13,000 rides to the doctor for many children and expectant mothers in Alabama at no cost to those families.LiNeBrEaKWith rising unemployment, a vastly fluctuating stock market and the rising costs of most everything, it is hard to present a case that everyone should continue their charitable giving. And yet I am going to make that plea. I know that in tough economic times most people tend to change their spending habits, including donations to charities, but it is during these times when your giving shouldn't stop - our need for your support is greater than ever before.LiNeBrEaKEveryone has the capacity to give something, and every little bit does help. Besides money, giving can be in the form of time, skills and tangible goods you may no longer need. I implore you to evaluate yourself on how best you can assist - all charitable organizations need gifts of all kinds in these trying times. LiNeBrEaKResearch charities and their missions and connect with a charity you have a passion for, whether you choose a charity involving children, animals or assistance for those suffering from catastrophic illness or events - your heart and passion for the organization will drive your giving.LiNeBrEaKThe need for your assistance is greater now than ever, and many families are feeling the effects of this downward economy. During this holiday season, let us all be thankful for what we have and share what we can with those less fortunate. Happy holidays.LiNeBrEaKKaren PeterlinLiNeBrEaKCEO/PresidentLiNeBrEaKKid One TransportLiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKFact is, global warming is realLiNeBrEaKIt is so frustrating when opinion is presented as actual fact. I want to hit a button and respond ''links please'' - which, online, means ''please give us your factual references.''LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. John McCain just got back from a fact-finding trip and was thoroughly educated and impressed by the facts showing global warming. But what does he know? He is the guy who lost the election.LiNeBrEaKWell, how about NASA's GRACE project? The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment uses satellite technology to measure the ''mass balance'' of a glacier or the net annual difference between ice accumulation and ice loss.LiNeBrEaKDramatic and scary: See CNN's ''Ice melting across the globe at accelerating rate.''LiNeBrEaKAnd remember when America's foremost scientists presented their report on global warming? The report was changed before it was publicly presented - not by scientists, but by White House lawyers.LiNeBrEaKA recent letter writer presented a strong opinion that sounded like fact, unsupported by scientists around the world, and we don't have any idea where he got his information. Maybe he is a member of the outgoing let's-pretend-thisis-not-happening administration.LiNeBrEaKPlease, do not be fooled by opinion presented as fact. A ''group of ecology nuts'' are, in actual fact, scientists here in America and around the world. Let's focus on the facts, not opinion.LiNeBrEaKMary Lou TaylorLiNeBrEaKPleasant GroveLiNeBrEaKThank God for global warmingLiNeBrEaKWhat would our temperatures be if not for global warming?LiNeBrEaKOn Dec. 14, the temperatures were lower than 20 below zero across the northern Plains, and a band of snow, freezing rain and sleet stretched from Kansas along the Ohio Valley to Maine.LiNeBrEaKMinnesota was hard-hit with temperatures of 32 below at Hibbing, 28 below at International Falls and a record-breaking 24 below at St. Cloud. Even parts of Kentucky and Tennessee were not spared, with dozens of schools closed by slippery roads.LiNeBrEaKI would hate to think what our temperatures would be without global warming. Thanks goes to Al Gore, who warns us about global warming and how we can control it.LiNeBrEaKLloyd T. Chastain Jr.LiNeBrEaKGardendaleLiNeBrEaKFat tax would send wrong messageLiNeBrEaKIn regard to the letter ''Tax nondiet soft drinks'' (The News, Wednesday), I like my sugar just fine, and I'm not obese.LiNeBrEaKThe letter writer made it sound as if people are overweight simply because of what they eat. That's wrong. Some people can't lose weight no matter how hard they try, and I don't think taxing people just because they are overweight is the right message to send.LiNeBrEaKSorry, but this is personal to me. I have had to watch my sister battle with her weight all of her life, and this is all while staying on the right eating program. And for a public example, look at Oprah Winfrey.LiNeBrEaKThis a very personal battle for those who deal with it on a daily basis.LiNeBrEaKLeslie WoodLiNeBrEaKHomewoodLiNeBrEaKState obsessed with footballLiNeBrEaKAs schools in Alabama face the biggest cuts in decades, our obsession with football continues unabated.LiNeBrEaKThe University of Alabama and Auburn University move coaches around like some churches move their pastors. Each time a new coach is hired, the football nuts seem to think this is the one with the magic touch.LiNeBrEaKI am reminded of a cartoon I saw many years ago. A newlywed couple was exiting the church, and crowds of well-wishers lined the walk. The new husband whispered to his bride, ''Did you ever want something really bad and after you got it, you didn't want it anymore?''LiNeBrEaKAs we look at the dismal situation facing our K-12 schools, we are again reminded we need a better way to fund our state. Of course, many benefit by the citizens being ignorant and will fight any meaningful change to our tax structure.LiNeBrEaKAs we see the football players in this state getting bigger and bigger, has anyone given any thought to the detrimental effect this may have on fighting obesity? How many of these players could pass a physical to enlist in our armed forces? We are putting a premium on weight, which not only sets a bad example for young people but also endangers the heavy players' lives in coming years.LiNeBrEaKCarl L. HessLiNeBrEaKOzarkLiNeBrEaKTax marijuana to fund schoolsLiNeBrEaKWhat a shame that Alabama students will be the first to suffer the effects of the economic downturn when Alabama already has some of the lowest per-pupil spending in the nation.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the most recent data I could find, Alabama on average spends a little more than $8,000 per student per year. Yet we spend a minimum of $13,000 per year to lock up a nonviolent citizen for smoking pot.LiNeBrEaKInstead of making responsible adult cannabis consumers a burden on state taxpayers by forcing taxpayers to pay for incarceration, why not regulate and tax marijuana like we do alcohol and tobacco and use the taxes collected to make our education system better? After all, we use the taxes from the sale of alcohol to fund the Department of Human Resources.LiNeBrEaKThere's a whole base of cannabis consumers in Alabama who would be more than happy to be taxed in exchange for a safe, regulated market.LiNeBrEaKNot only could we use the money raised in taxes for public education, we could also use it for drug-prevention education and to fund treatment for those addicted to harder drugs. It would be a superb deal all the way around.LiNeBrEaKIt's time to tap into the multibillion-dollar marijuana market in this country and start reaping the many benefits available as opposed to filling our prisons with people who don't belong there at the expense of our children's education.LiNeBrEaKTax us, please.LiNeBrEaKLoretta NallLiNeBrEaKAlexander City	CHARITIES (92%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); FAMILY (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (87%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (87%); CHARITABLE GIVING (79%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (77%); CHILDREN (77%); CONSUMER BEHAVIOR (76%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (71%); RESEARCH (71%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (68%); HOLIDAYS and OBSERVANCES (64%); SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY (50%)  		JOHN MCCAIN (52%)  	BIRMINGHAM, AL, USA (73%) ALABAMA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Birmingham News All Rights Reserved

Officials said there were about 70 participants from the energy, financial, and environmental sectors. More than 31. 5 million allowances were auctioned totaling about $106. 5 million. The "bulk" of Massachusetts' share will be used to develop a "new energy efficiency industry for jobs and energy cost savings," according to Governor Deval L. Patrick's office. That will include $5 million to train energy auditors, insulation installers, and other energy-efficiency technicians.

US District Judge Kenneth Karas in White Plains, N.Y., said federal marshals will take Israel, now at the Westchester County jail, to Devens Federal Medical Center in Ayer, Mass., next week for a physical and psychological workup. Devens was the prison that Israel was supposed to report to in June to start a 20-year sentence for bilking investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. Instead, Israel faked his suicide, leaving his SUV on a bridge north of New York City, and went on the lam for more than a month before surrendering.

Best Buy is offering two models of the phone for $189. 99 and $289. 99. That price includes free e-mail set-up from the company's Geek Squad service unit, a $30 value, said Scott Moore, vice president of marketing for Best Buy Mobile. The discount signals competition has intensified as cash-strapped shoppers limit purchases amid the US recession. While Wal-Mart has refused to comment on whether it plans to market the phone, store clerks contacted in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, and Washington said they will sell the device. Its price will be $197 and $297, technology site Engadget.com said Wednesday.

The changes, to be carried out by March 31, will yield savings of about $120 million a year and cost up to $65 million over the next several quarters, the company said. The actions expand on a 6 percent reduction disclosed in October. The maker of "Madden NFL" warned of additional cuts on Dec. 9, when it lowered its full-year revenue and profit forecasts because of slow holiday sales in North America and Europe.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	After assembling Cabinet, Barack Obama must re-invent wheel  	By Peter Nicholas and Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS  	730 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Cabinet of President-elect Barack Obama is a largely centrist and pragmatic-minded collection of politicians and technocrats without a pronounced ideological bent. Liberals are satisfied but not delighted. Conservatives say the nominees aren't as leftist as they'd feared. Powerful interest groups with conflicting agendas are appeased.LiNeBrEaKBut compared with what comes next, assembling the team was the easy part. LiNeBrEaKObama wants this Cabinet to market and put in place the most dramatic policy changes in the country since Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal: A mammoth program to improve roads and bridges; a health-care system that covers more sick people at less cost; limitations on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming; big investments in energy efficiency; middle-class tax cuts along with a tax hike on wealthy Americans. For Obama to impose this ambitious agenda, he'll need to make people angry. And that will strain the fragile political coalition he has painstakingly built.LiNeBrEaKIn the short term, Obama's Cabinet nominations strengthen him politically. Even Capitol Hill Republicans say they are reassured by his selections.LiNeBrEaK"His appointments overall are such that he's lived up to the best expectations of his rhetoric," said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. "He's choosing intellectuals and scientists and other notables that no one would disagree are good advisers to him. He's going to get the benefit of the doubt based on his appointments in many areas."LiNeBrEaKObama has picked an eclectic group.LiNeBrEaKIn choosing former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and revamp the nation's health-care system, Obama seems intent on avoiding the mistakes of the last major attempt to improve health care. When Bill Clinton pushed a health-care overhaul in 1993 _ an initiative led by his wife _ he was criticized for not working more cooperatively with Congress.LiNeBrEaKAs a Capitol Hill veteran, Daschle is less likely to repeat that mistake, health-care advocates said, predicting he would court members of Congress in ways the Clinton team never did.LiNeBrEaKRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health-care consumer advocacy group, said Daschle has already reached out to all sides of the reform debate. Meantime, doctors, insurers, and business and labor leaders are privately meeting to reach a consensus on how the new system should be designed.LiNeBrEaK"It's likely to be less contentious than last time," Pollack said. "Tom Daschle is an excellent listener. He has his own ideas, but he also has an excellent personal touch."LiNeBrEaKAs a candidate, Obama often seemed reluctant to take concrete stands that might alienate important interest groups. Now that he is elected, some Washington lobbyists and elected officials point to emerging signs that he's willing to disappoint his political base.LiNeBrEaKThey cite the announcement that Rick Warren, the pastor who opposes gay marriage and abortion, will deliver the invocation at Obama's swearing-in. Gay rights leaders and others criticized the choice, citing Warren's support for a California ballot proposition banning same-sex marriage. But Obama's willingness to endure the backlash may foreshadow battles ahead.LiNeBrEaKIf Obama's Cabinet lacks a strong ideology, its main value may lie in the individuals' technical skills in delivering on the transformational agenda he promised.LiNeBrEaKInterest groups expect the beginning of a major push to curb greenhouse gases so as to confront the threat of global warming.LiNeBrEaKObama's "green team" selections include Nobel winner Steven Chu for secretary of energy; Carol Browner, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, as energy and climate adviser; New Jersey's Lisa Jackson as EPA chief and Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar as secretary of interior.LiNeBrEaKAll have records of pushing anti-warming measures.LiNeBrEaK"These are people who understand the seriousness of the situation and realize we don't have much time" to act, said David Bookbinder, chief climate counsel for the Sierra Club.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday 	Secretary of Energy is nuclear proponent  	Letter to the Editor  	LETTERS; Opinion  	207 words  	Nuclear proponentLiNeBrEaKListening to Obama's introduction of his Energy Secretary he gave the impression that our future is wind and solar. Steven Chu is the current Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. He is highly qualified for the job that holds a Nobel Prize in physics (for developing methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light) with experience of running a prestigious National Lab. LiNeBrEaKHis bio notes 'He is also one of the nation's foremost and outspoken advocates for scientific solutions to the twin problems of global warming and the need for carbon-neutral renewable sources of energy. He has called these problems "the greatest challenge facing science" and has rallied many of the world's top scientists to address it.'LiNeBrEaKWhat you haven't read is that Chu has an opinion on nuclear energy. Just four months ago he was one of 10 directors of our national labs to put out a report entitled, "A Sustainable Energy Future: The Essential Role of Nuclear Energy."LiNeBrEaKEarly in the summary it reads, "Establish a national priority to immediately deploy advanced light-water reactors to meet our nation's increasing energy demand, while limiting greenhouse gas emissions."LiNeBrEaKLet's hope he brings this full picture to Washington.LiNeBrEaKJeff MillerLiNeBrEaKConcord	LETTERS and COMMENTS (93%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); PHYSICS (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (90%); WIND ENERGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (79%); EMISSIONS (79%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); SOLAR ENERGY (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (75%); ENERGY DEMAND (73%); NOBEL PRIZES (72%); AWARDS and PRIZES (72%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (50%)  		BARACK OBAMA (74%); STEVEN CHU (92%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (88%) CALIFORNIA, USA (88%) UNITED STATES (88%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  															
The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   Home Final Edition	Green sleeves;  Current events inspire winner of sweater contest 	Joe Blundo, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	FEATURES - LIFE and ARTS; Pg. 01D  	813 words  	Today we celebrate the audacity of Christmas sweaters.LiNeBrEaKMore than 150 readers (historically, an impressive number for this contest) participated in the seventh annual Holiday Art Project, which challenged entrants to turn a blank sweater into a work of art.LiNeBrEaKWe didn't require contestants to weave the financial crisis, the presidential election or global warming into their designs. But many did -- including the top winner. LiNeBrEaK"I was trying to think of an idea, and I could only think of negative things," said Jacquie Conley of Columbus.LiNeBrEaKThen Conley hit on the idea of a frugal sweater that addresses both the economy and the environment.LiNeBrEaKHer masterpiece, Circle of Life, employs plastic bags as yarn, then adds the silver seal from a coffee can, the red stripes from a seasoning packet, a red metal pull tab and arrows cut from the pull strip of a cheese packet.LiNeBrEaK"I was watching my trash for a week," she said.LiNeBrEaKConley, who most recently worked for First Data Corp. and does art as a hobby, also won top honors in the 2005 contest and an honorable mention in 2006. (She thus enters the Holiday Art Project Hall of Fame and will serve as a judge next year.)LiNeBrEaKHer entry was chosen to win first place ($75) by three judges: Charlie Zimkus, a Dispatch graphic artist; Jason Amatangelo, an artist and a packaging engineer who designed several of the "Brutus on Parade" statues this year; and Sarah Harpham, owner of Helen Winnemore Craft, a store in German Village.LiNeBrEaKThe judges liked that Conley managed to make something both socially conscious and attractive.LiNeBrEaK"Creative use of readily available material," Harpham said. "I like the pull tab and the squinchy ribbing."LiNeBrEaKTaking second place (and the accompanying $50) was Kara Bohach, who created Old World Stained-Glass Santa.LiNeBrEaKHer inspirations were her job as a designer for Franklin Art Glass and her Yugoslavian grandparents. \ "Using stained glass as an inspiration for a sweater is unique," Zimkus noted.LiNeBrEaKAmatangelo praised the composition (something you don't often hear mentioned in the context of Christmas sweaters).LiNeBrEaKKim Knueven, a nurse, placed third (winning $25) for Nights of Columbus, a watercolor-and-gel-pen design depicting the Columbus skyline after dark.LiNeBrEaKKnueven made the piece at Artful Evenings, a monthly art gathering at European Papers, 539 E. Town St.LiNeBrEaK"It caught my eye," Harpham said, "because it wasn't so Christmas-oriented."LiNeBrEaKEarning honorable-mention honors:LiNeBrEaK* The Sweater of Many Colors by Fran Alder of McArthur. She used embroidery floss and glitter glue on her three-dimensional sweater.LiNeBrEaK* Pop Art Frosty Sweater , reminiscent of Andy Warhol. Alyssa Moore of Reynoldsburg created it using felt-tip markers.LiNeBrEaK* Santa's Office , a colored-pencil drawing by Emily Palmer of Columbus. LiNeBrEaK* Another Ugly, Overpriced Gift That Nobody Wants , created on a computer by Rick Amicon of Columbus. It's a comment on greed and the federal bailout (as suggested by its $700 billion price tag).LiNeBrEaK* Yes, America, There Is a Santa Claus by Peggy Moran of Columbus, the top winner in 2007. Her cartooned sweater comments on the 2008 presidential election. (Sarah Palin appears as a well-dressed reindeer.)LiNeBrEaKAs always, eliminating noteworthy Holiday Art Project contenders was difficult. I created a few categories to call attention to other standout efforts (photos of these can be found at Dispatch. com/multimedia):LiNeBrEaK* Best use of a campaign sign: Joy by Benita Smith of Columbus. She used the symbolic "O" from the Barack Obama campaign as the centerpiece of her sweater.LiNeBrEaK* Best entry by a young artist: Happy Holiday by Nevada Casserly, 15, of Lancaster. She used gel pens and a pencil on her festive sweater.LiNeBrEaK* Best Hanukkah sweater: Happy Chanukah by Anita Freimark of Gahanna. She used a cloth napkin, ribbon and gold glitter to pay homage to the Jewish holiday.LiNeBrEaK* Best use of Elvis: Blue, Blue, Blue Christmas by Chris Lewallen of Westerville.

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday 	YOUR LETTERS  		OPINIONS; Pg. A13  	1407 words  	Why give homeless foreclosed homes?LiNeBrEaKRe "Miami activist puts people into foreclosed homes," Dec. 7: Isn't this like "robbing Peter to pay Paul"? This "businessman" in Miami is putting homeless families in homes lost by other families, now homeless due to foreclosure.LiNeBrEaKDoesn't it make more sense to help the original family stay in its own home rather than to become homeless? Isn't this man just switching homeless for homeless?LiNeBrEaKI guess there isn't enough profit for the "businessman" in helping the original family. LiNeBrEaKSherrie Mayer WilsonLiNeBrEaKKetteringLiNeBrEaKHHS should delay mandated changeLiNeBrEaKRecently, I became aware of an issue that would greatly impact small health-care providers, such as family medical practices. The Department of Health and Human Services is going to institute an unfunded mandate regarding ICD codes.LiNeBrEaKICD codes are used by almost all entities that come in contact with health care data. For example, ICD codes are used to classify types of medical conditions claimed in insurance claims.LiNeBrEaKCurrently, health-care entities use ICD-9 codes, and HHS wants to transition to ICD-10 codes by 2012. I support transitioning to ICD-10 codes, because it will help prevent things such as fraudulent insurance claims, but I'm adamantly opposed to starting the transition in 2012.LiNeBrEaKI believe the transition to ICD-10 codes needs to wait until 2013 - at the earliest. Since the transition is an unfunded mandate, it will cost health- care providers hundreds of thousands of dollars to institute ICD-10 codes. Large health-care providers, such as hospitals, won't have a problem with this, but small health-care providers will, because they have significantly less resources, causing them to need more time to institute the ICD-10 code.LiNeBrEaKI hope that HHS will take the concerns of people such as myself into account and push back the transition to ICD-10.LiNeBrEaKEthel ProttengeierLiNeBrEaKMasonLiNeBrEaKClimate alarmists would waste moneyLiNeBrEaKRe "4 harsh truths are clear about climate change," Dec. 4: Gwynne Dyer fails to mention the vast network of scientists who disagree with the global warming alarmists. This group is easily as large as the group of doomsayers, who, by the way, are the same group of scientists that declared global cooling the next huge catastrophe facing man in the 1970s.LiNeBrEaKThe Earth may or may not be warming, but that's what it does. It has been here for 8 billion years. In that time, it has cooled and warmed billions of times. Man has been industrialized for 250 years, but somehow, this current cycle, if true, is our fault, so let's spend trillions of dollars and stop technological progress here in the United States in a vain attempt to stop the Earth from doing what it has done forever, with or without us. This is a crazy waste of money.LiNeBrEaKI would like Dyer to explain why Greenland was a plentiful farming region 700 years ago without a hint of ice, but is now frozen tundra. For 700 years, the Vikings were not emitting greenhouse gases on Greenland, were they? Also, how are these scientists able to predict the precise temperature in the year 2150, but struggle to nail down what the temperature or precipitation will be on Wednesday? LiNeBrEaKBill RudlandLiNeBrEaKWashington Twp.LiNeBrEaKBush hater doesn't look at big pictureLiNeBrEaKRecently, a reader wrote that among other "failures," President George W. Bush has not caught Osama bin Laden ("'Man of faith' isn't always best leader," Dec. 6). Apparently the writer hasn't gotten past his typically liberal "Hate Bush" thinking. LiNeBrEaKIf he would read something other than the New York Times, he would find that, on many occasions in the 1990s, during the Clinton years, covert U.S. operatives had bin Laden in the cross hairs of a weapon, but were denied permission to squeeze the trigger by "highly placed" Clinton administration officials. I believe that permission would have been given under George W. Bush's leadership.LiNeBrEaKWould that have solved the entire problem? Probably not, but it would have sent a strong signal to the terrorist community that we will respond to attacks on Americans with force and specificity. A good read on the subject of why terrorists think they can attack America and Americans is in "The Iranian Time Bomb" by Michael Ledeen. It remains to be seen what the new administration will do when we are again attacked on American soil. I hope the response is swift and devastating.LiNeBrEaKJohn TonkinLiNeBrEaKLebanonLiNeBrEaKU.S. must join cluster bomb banLiNeBrEaKMore than 80 nations gathered in Oslo this month to sign a treaty banning cluster bombs. These bombs often leave unexploded, small "bomblets" on the ground. Many civilians have been killed or maimed by accidentally stepping on them, and children pick them up, thinking they are toys, only to lose their lives or limbs.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration has not only refused to sign the treaty, but has pressured others not to sign. What motivation could there be for such callous indifference to removing this danger? Perhaps as a favor to the manufacturers and exporters of them? LiNeBrEaKFortunately, President-elect Barack Obama has promised to take a serious look at the ban. We should also ask our senators and representatives in the new Congress to provide legislation for banning them before Jan. 20. This is just one important step in restoring sanity to our government and regaining respect from other nations.LiNeBrEaKFrank SwiftLiNeBrEaKWashington Twp.LiNeBrEaKYoung people need better sex educationLiNeBrEaKImplementing comprehensive sexual education into the daily scholastic lives of young adults and teenagers is a necessary and fundamental step in expanding their awareness of sexual protection and safety options. Ohio Sen. Teresa Fedor has introduced SB 385, the Comprehensive Sexuality Education Bill, which would provide accurate and essential sexual health information to individuals who need answers, but are unable to find them. This bill will allow students to receive instruction that will keep them and their partners safe from harmful sexual choices.LiNeBrEaKNinety-five percent of Americans have premarital sex, and it is only prudent to make sure that it is safe.LiNeBrEaKYoung people deserve access to vital sexual health information.LiNeBrEaKJennifer SpauldingLiNeBrEaKDaytonLiNeBrEaKPrint taxpayers some more moneyLiNeBrEaKIf I came up with the perfect scam by saying a person's home is worth $200,000 when it is really only worth $100,000, and this was copied 10 million times across the United States, this would break the banks, and then the American International Groups of the world. No one could borrow money, because what hasn't disappeared has been given out in bonuses.LiNeBrEaKNow the reality is that we will need more currency, followed by millions of people being out of work. The players can then call on Congress, which is playing Texas Hold 'Em and the players are playing Dirty Hearts without a play in their hand, yet asking for billions of dollars.LiNeBrEaKThe AIGs and the like bluff their way to billions and get it. Then they go to another game and get facials, manicures, massages and more. Meanwhile, the people who pay taxes and Congress have to ante up again.LiNeBrEaKThere is no cash, no money and no revenue, but there is available currency. When the players run out of money, they go to the housemen, who will print more.LiNeBrEaKWe are experiencing the largest job losses in more than 33 years. The name of the game is "Winner Take All." Print the taxpayers some money.LiNeBrEaKCurtis McDonaldLiNeBrEaKDaytonLiNeBrEaKPatrols better than checkpointsLiNeBrEaKOhio police spent a lot of officers' time and taxpayers' money Thanksgiving weekend to arrest five drunken drivers out of hundreds of cars stopped and inconvenienced at one DUI checkpoint on Saturday, Nov. 29.LiNeBrEaKIn the fight to get drunken drivers off the roads, Ohio's law enforcement agencies would likely make far more arrests if they spent their available patrol time roaming the streets looking for drunken drivers, rather than standing at roadblocks waiting for these drivers to come to them.LiNeBrEaKBecause they are highly visible by design and publicized in advance, roadblocks are all too easily avoided by the chronic alcohol abusers who comprise the core of today's drunken driving problem.LiNeBrEaKConversely, the number of DUI arrests made by roving patrol programs is nearly 10 times the average number of DUIs made by checkpoint programs, according to testimony by a Pennsylvania Department of Transportation official.LiNeBrEaKDayton-area residents and taxpayers would benefit from employing the most effective tactics to catch drunken drivers: roving police patrols.LiNeBrEaKSarah LongwellLiNeBrEaKWashington, D.C.LiNeBrEaKMs. Longwell is managing director of the American Beverage Institute.

The Fresno Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Vilsack and the Valley  	The Fresno Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	542 words  	Dec. 20--The nomination of Tom Vilsack to be President-elect Barack Obama's secretary of agriculture has drawn praise, for the most part, from farm interests and environmentalists alike. But there are some specific concerns for California and the Valley. LiNeBrEaKVilsack, the former two-term governor of Iowa, is well-versed in the highly subsidized commodity agriculture of the Midwest, but has little experience in the complex issues of California's agriculture, with its specialty crops and its controversial water problems.LiNeBrEaKBut Vilsack won't be able -- and shouldn't be permitted -- to overlook California, the largest agricultural producer in the nation at roughly $37 billion each year.LiNeBrEaKThat bounty is threatened by a number of problems, from foreign competition and the strength of the dollar to environmental concerns and the overarching issue of water supplies. Vilsack will need to get up to speed on those matters quickly, or his tenure may turn out to be a disappointment for Californians from every side of the debate.LiNeBrEaKGiven Obama's expressed determination to reduce greenhouse gases in the fight against global climate change, Vilsack will have an important role in the administration. Agriculture is responsible for as much as one-third of the greenhouse gases produced in the U.S., by some estimates.LiNeBrEaKVilsack is a major booster of corn ethanol -- not surprising for a former governor of Iowa. But on that score he may tangle with Stephen Chu, Obama's designee for secretary of energy, who is a fierce critic of using corn to make fuel instead of food.LiNeBrEaKThat debate will be important for California, which produces some corn ethanol now but could become a major source of other bio-fuels in the future.LiNeBrEaKIn another area, Vilsack could be a very good choice for California and the Valley. He will be in charge of many of the nation's nutrition programs, including those that affect children most profoundly. On Wednesday, he said the Department of Agriculture "must place nutrition at the center of all food assistance programs administered by the department."LiNeBrEaKThat's good news in the Valley, where childhood obesity is rampant -- ironically, often among the poor -- because of ignorance of nutrition needs.LiNeBrEaKBut a focus on better nutrition is also an economic opportunity for Valley farmers. Better nutrition is often as simple as "eat more fruits and vegetables," and who knows more about fruits and vegetables than Valley growers? Thus a push for better nutrition could also fuel a move toward a more sustainable economic environment for the Valley's farmers.LiNeBrEaKThat's a very great deal to pile on the plate of an ag secretary who hasn't even been confirmed by the Senate yet. But the Valley has a great deal at stake with this appointment.LiNeBrEaKTell us what you think. Comment on this editorial by going to fresnobee.com/opinion, then click on the editorial.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday 	The View from Drucker: The New Pragmatism  	Ira A. Jackson, Correspondent  	BUSINESS  	1182 words  	When we look at our nation today it seems that all we see are huge and overwhelming problems.LiNeBrEaKWe can start with the collapse of our financial system but it doesn't end there. There's global warming and the incredible transfer of our wealth - $700 billion every year - to oil-producing countries that are openly hostile to us. Hanging over all this is the terrorist threat. And then there is the very real underlying insecurity about healthcare, education and our overall quality of life.LiNeBrEaKThe question is: how do we even begin to address these problems?LiNeBrEaKFortunately for us, there are thinkers out there who are applying their insight, wisdom and experience to the question. One of these is Daniel Yankelovich, a national treasure and a public intellectual of the highest stature. LiNeBrEaKLast month he came to Claremont for our school's annual Drucker Day and he not only helped us kickoff the Centennial celebrations for Peter Drucker but he also laid out a path toward solving our seemingly intractable problems.LiNeBrEaKYankelovich is cut from the same cloth as Peter Drucker. Like Peter, he has spent a lifetime thinking, and a lifetime doing, creating and observing, analyzing and advocating. He's started companies, and introduced new ideas like the New York Times/Yankelovich Poll, now the New York Times/CBS Poll. He's started important non-profits like Public Agenda, which he now chairs. He cuts his teeth in business. He paid his dues in the classroom at NYU, Harvard and UCSD.LiNeBrEaKHe's written about major institutions, and the human condition, and the need for more active citizenship in eleven powerful books, including The Magic of Dialogue and Profit with Honor: The Next Stage of Market Capitalism. Daniel Yankelovich is the father of public opinion research. He's been a steward of great institutions like the Carnegie Foundation, the Kettering Foundation, Brown University, and great companies like CBS and Loral.LiNeBrEaKDrucker Day took place on a sunny and bright Saturday and Yankelovich brought his well-honed laser clarity to our current social, cultural and economic impasse.LiNeBrEaKHe started by noting that 85 percent of the American people think that we're on the wrong track. He also laid out the enormous problems we face, as I noted earlier. He then made a very interesting point. The U.S. has faced equal or greater threats in the past and we have overcome them: the Crash of 1929, the Great Depression, World War II, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King, the Vietnam War, and 9/11.LiNeBrEaKFor Yankelovich, our problems are solvable. As he said, "we have extraordinary resources: human, capital, corporate, technological, and scientific." Yet, as he also noted, while we have the potential to solve all these problems, there is a big BUT: "our nation's problem solving gift seems to have eroded, and eroded badly."LiNeBrEaKThat unique American gift has eroded, he said, due to massive denial, the grasping at straws, ideology over practicality, leadership pandering, polarization instead of cooperation and a deep public mistrust that is corroding our body politic.LiNeBrEaKYankelovich also made the point that the real underlying issue is cultural in nature. He said there's a wide gap between experts and the general public, cultural wars over core values, a public demand for voice without taking responsibility, technological hubris, the growth of self-isolating communities and a series of generations unaccustomed to sacrifice. The result, he said, is that when you add all this up, "you are forced to realize that the kinds of solutions that we're most familiar with, and that lie within our comfort zone, won't work on them."LiNeBrEaKDrawing on Drucker's approach to similar challenges, Yankelovich came to the conclusion that "you have to fight culture with culture." And then in a brilliant stroke, he said, "that means restoring a traditional American philosophy and habit of thought." He elaborated on this: "I believe that revitalizing our problem-solving culture of thought can best be done through what I'm calling `the new pragmatism."'LiNeBrEaKBy restoring this tradition (and also updating it), Yankelovich believes that we can deal with the cultural "obstacles" facing us now.LiNeBrEaKAs Yankelovich said, pragmatism is a distinctive American philosophy that focuses on cooperation. So, what is pragmatism? According to Yankelovich, the popular notion of pragmatism "means being open to compromise, to incremental solutions, to focus on the art of the possible, and to be more concerned with solving concrete problems than with grand visions." But he also said that beyond this popular sense of the idea, we need two other dimensions that allow it to truly help us solve the colossal problems at hand.LiNeBrEaK"One of them," he said, "is that it's very strongly value-driven, with a major focus on freedom of thought and action." The second dimension is that it's "committed to social experimentation as a fundamental way of knowing. It also presupposes a constantly evolving and changing society rather than a static culture."LiNeBrEaKSo how do we spread the "new pragmatism" into the culture at large?LiNeBrEaKFor Yankelovich, "it's going to occur through entrepreneurship and innovative thinking at all levels of society: individual, commercial, public, non-profit, private, institutional, and all of these in interlocking, interacting ways." LiNeBrEaKFinally, after walking us through a real-world example, how we might wean ourselves off of our addiction to oil, Yankelovich presented the tool that will help move this idea from the academic realm into a broader public dialogue and he calls that tool the "public's learning curve." The key, he said, is to accelerate that learning curve from the speed that it now travels, which in the case of some issues such as women's rights and slavery can take centuries. It's essential to move it from consciousness-raising to resolution in a much, much faster way. The issues we are facing are "time-gap issues," where the normal learning curve "is simply too slow given the urgency of the problem." Yankelovich and his colleagues are conducting research to accelerate this learning curve so that the move from the public's current position on these issues moves rapidly through all the obstacles we noted earlier.LiNeBrEaKWhat they have found so far is that leadership is critical. Explanatory journalism plays a key role. Bottom line: the new pragmatism is the start. Yankelovich believes that "it provides the common ground we need to revitalize our national gift for problem-solving."LiNeBrEaKI'm glad that we have thinkers like Yankelovich who are working on helping us all find a way to solve our worst collective problems. The new pragmatism is a great start. As the recent election shows, we live in a great democracy. We now have the chance with a new president and a new resolve to make headway with these problems by putting the new pragmatism into practice.LiNeBrEaKIra A. Jackson is the Dean of the Peter F.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	Obama picks global warming expert as science adviser  	Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	621 words  	Dec. 20--WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama's choice of John P. Holdren as his science adviser sends a strong signal that Obama sees global warming as an urgent problem and wants bold suggestions for action.LiNeBrEaKThe Harvard University environmental policy professor has argued that the world already is experiencing dangerous climate change as a result of fossil fuel combustion. He's said there's still time to avert catastrophe, but only with a strong and rapid global effort. LiNeBrEaKAt a recent talk in Washington, Holdren boiled it down to this:LiNeBrEaK"Without energy there is no economy. Without climate there is no environment. Without economy and environment there's no material well-being, there's no civil society, there's no personal or national or international security. And the problem is that the way we've been getting the energy our economies need is wrecking the climate that our environment needs. That is the essence of the problem."LiNeBrEaKHe said at the time that he hoped that the next administration would "really break its spear on the question of can we get a sensible climate policy with the Congress and the public behind it" in time to go to the final round of negotiations on a new international treaty late next year "and finally have a voice that is respected by other countries."LiNeBrEaKHarvard issued a news release Friday saying that Obama is expected to announce Holdren's appointment Saturday. The science adviser heads the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President.LiNeBrEaKHoldren has gone to China half a dozen times a year since 1984 to meet with Chinese climate and energy officials. Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious schools, named him this year as a three-year nonresident guest professor.LiNeBrEaKHoldren has said he thinks that if the United States leads with emission reduction requirements, China and the rest of the world will follow, because their countries already are suffering from water and agricultural problems.LiNeBrEaKHoldren has also said that scientists need to get better at explaining what's happening with more urgency. The term "global warming" could be part of the problem, he argued, because it implies something uniform, gradual and benign, and it's none of those.LiNeBrEaK"It is rapid compared to the capacity of ecosystems to adjust and, alas, rapid compared to our capacity as a society to adjust," he said. "We should be calling it global climatic disruption."LiNeBrEaKHoldren is a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the director of the science, technology and public policy program at the school's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. He also is the director of the Woods Hole Research Station.LiNeBrEaKHe earned Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in aerospace engineering and plasma physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. He's a specialist in nuclear arms control and nonproliferation as well as global climate change and energy policy.LiNeBrEaK"John is the very model of a policy-relevant scientist," Belfer Center Director Graham Allison said in a statement Friday. "He has a deep understanding of the dynamics of science and technology as drivers of the challenges society faces -- from climate disruption to nuclear danger -- and new opportunities for feasible solutions."LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday 	Nevada objects - 229 times  	Keith Rogers  	B; Pg. 1B  	1146 words  	LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKNevada reached a milestone Friday in its 30-year war to defeat the federal Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project by filing 229 challenges to the Department of Energy's license application for the planned repository 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.LiNeBrEaK"Clearly this is a seminal day for us," state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said at the Sawyer Building with Nevada Nuclear Projects Agency Director Bob Loux at her side. The state's petition was filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is expected to take at least four years to review the application and contentions.LiNeBrEaKLoux declared the project dead.LiNeBrEaK"I do believe it's truly over," he said. LiNeBrEaKThe pitfalls of entombing 77,000 tons of highly radioactive waste and spent fuel in a porous, volcanic rock ridge flanked by earthquake faults can't be fixed, he said.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Loux said, DOE's reliance on protecting waste containers from corrosion with a system of relatively short-lived titanium drip shields that haven't been invented and won't be installed until 100 years after the waste is buried is a major flaw.LiNeBrEaK"For the first time the Department of Energy is going to be legally accountable for its claims of safety that we believe are not accurate. ... Their claims will be disproved throughout this process," Loux said.LiNeBrEaKOfficials for the Yucca Mountain Project had little to say about the state's challenges.LiNeBrEaK"We've just seen them. So until we've had a chance to review them, we're not going to have any comment," project spokesman Allen Benson said.LiNeBrEaKOf the 229 contentions presented to nuclear regulators, most - 180 - pertain to safety. The entire document has roughly 1,200 pages plus some 300 pages of attachments and affidavits.LiNeBrEaKState scientists believe geologic conditions of the mountain coupled with under-estimated corrosion rates of waste containers could result in deadly radioactive materials escaping the repository sometime before the hundreds of thousands of years that the remnants reach peak doses. Some of the equipment described in DOE's application for emplacing containers by remote control and other elements such as drip shields to divert water either don't exist or haven't been tested.LiNeBrEaK"They have not accurately estimated ground water flows in the mountain," Loux said Friday as he continued to head the State Nuclear Projects Agency until his replacement is chosen in the wake of controversy over his approval of unauthorized salary hikes in the office.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Loux noted, DOE's license application doesn't address the possibility that the ridge top could erode and climate change could impact the integrity of the site.LiNeBrEaKThe Nuclear Energy Institute filed contentions as did Nye County's Nuclear Waste Repository Project Office.LiNeBrEaKAmong Nye County's contentions are concerns about climate change that could increase rainfall.LiNeBrEaK"Then more water could infiltrate into the mountain faster. It is important to determine how much water and the chemistry of the water that can reach an infiltrate the repository," Nye County officials said in a release late Friday.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Nye County filed a contention jointly with neighboring counties about the potential hazard from military aircraft in the area.LiNeBrEaK"DOE provides no basis for its assumption that the Air Force will restrict its activities in the repository vicinity," the release states.LiNeBrEaKThe institute, which is the lobbying arm of the nuclear power industry, submitted nine challenges covered in 307 pages.LiNeBrEaKThey focus on improvements to the repository's design, said Paul Seidler, senior director of the institute's Nevada office in Henderson.LiNeBrEaKThe institute, he said, "supports the Yucca Mountain Project and believes it is based on solid technical and scientific data."LiNeBrEaKBut Loux said the technical and scientific data is not as solid as DOE has portrayed it.LiNeBrEaKFor example, on the issue of corrosion of the alloy-22 waste canisters, Loux said, "once we read the license application, it is clear DOE has relied only on literature review and has actually done no research whatsoever."LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, the state's research, which he described as extensive, shows the canisters would corrode 50 years or 60 years after they are loaded with waste and placed inside the mountain.LiNeBrEaKReferring to the new administration under President-elect Barack Obama, Loux noted that it's "clear through statements from his transition team that they do intend to stop and terminate the Yucca Mountain Project at some point.LiNeBrEaK"And I think these contentions will also contribute to this notion that Yucca Mountain is not licensable and it's clearly not worth pursuing," he said.LiNeBrEaK"Once the scientific community and others who are following this program, those in the NRC and the other regulatory agencies as well as the industry look at the seriousness of these challenges ... it is clear that DOE has been relying on supposition, been relying on hypothesis and very little of their presentation and their safety case is really based on actual data," Loux said.LiNeBrEaKSo, what should be done with the waste?LiNeBrEaKSaid Masto: "For our purposes, I think it's safe where it is right now" in storage at out-of-state reactor sites across the country.LiNeBrEaKhighlights LiNeBrEaKSome of the contentions Nevada filed Friday with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over the Department of Energy's license application for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain are:LiNeBrEaKThe plans for an above-ground facility to age nuclear waste before loading it into a maze of tunnels in the mountain fails to meet required risk standards.LiNeBrEaKPost-closure plans lack adequate analysis of future wetter climate conditions.LiNeBrEaKThere's is no data to support DOE's assumption that drip shields, if installed a century later, will last long enough to effectively divert corrosive water around waste canisters.LiNeBrEaKImpacts of sabotage involving transportation of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain are deficient because DOE failed to evaluate "reasonably foreseeable attack scenarios."LiNeBrEaKThe application lacks relevant information about the risk of aircraft crashes near Yucca Mountain.LiNeBrEaKDOE ignores pertinent information about the risk of volcanic events in and around the mountain that would affect the performance of the geologic repository and its system of engineered barriers.LiNeBrEaKLAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKSafety challengedLiNeBrEaKCorrosion of drip shields for diverting water around nuclear waste containers is among the concerns Nevada sent to nuclear regulatiors Friday challenging the Energy Department's license apliation for a repository inside Yucca Mountain.LiNeBrEaKDrip shields - With the current design, water seeping through cracks in tunnel walls and ceiling is diverted by a titanium drip shield onto the funnel four beneath nuclear waste canisters.LiNeBrEaKSOURCES: U.S. Department of Energy, Neada Nuclear Waste Projects AgencyLiNeBrEaKMIKE JOHNSON/LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKContact reporter Keith Rogers at krogers@LiNeBrEaKreviewjournal.com or 702-383-0308.

Lebanon Daily News (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: Vote of competence  	Lebanon Daily News, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	558 words  	Dec. 20--President-elect Barack Obama is already delivering on one of the core promises of his campaign -- that government can be a force for good. By appointing qualified, competent people to fill environmental posts in his Cabinet, Obama is making a welcome U-turn from the Bush administration, which was marked by its willingness to ignore science in favor of cynical politics.LiNeBrEaKObama has named a slate of appointees to key environmental positions, including a Nobel prize-winning physicist, a former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and a former head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. All share a reputation for integrity, a trait that suggests they will put science before politics once in office. LiNeBrEaKAs encouraging as the appointments are, they are equally a reminder of President George W. Bush's missed opportunities. One of his first actions in office was to withdraw from the Kyoto Treaty on climate change. For eight years, the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases argued that global warming was still up for debate. For eight years, we have been spewing ever more pollution into the atmosphere and pretending it was someone else's problem.LiNeBrEaKUnder Bush, the EPA claimed it didn't have the authority to regulate carbon dioxide; it took the Supreme Court to tell it otherwise. Reports that documented global warming's reality were watered down at the administration's request, and even now the Bush administration is pursuing a reckless, end-of-days agenda in which it is trying to expand oil drilling and weaken environmental protections.LiNeBrEaKThis careless attitude toward facts and figures has been the dominant theme of Bush's two terms. It was there in the bogus intelligence reports that led to the war in Iraq, in the gutting of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that led to the failed response to Hurricane Katrina and in the failure to regulate the financial sector as it swallowed its tail.LiNeBrEaKObama can improve on Bush's performance simply by appointing qualified people and allowing them to do their jobs. For the most part, his early choices suggest he will do just that.LiNeBrEaKConsider Lisa Jackson, whom Obama tapped to lead the EPA. She spent 16 years in the federal agency and then became head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. She knows what a regulatory agency is supposed to do and has actually done it. She has a master's degree in chemical engineering.LiNeBrEaKObama also named Carol Browner, who was EPA administrator during the Clinton administration, as his energy czar. Browner has a hard-earned reputation as a tough regulator unafraid of battles with industry.LiNeBrEaKObama will inherit a nation already in the midst of a crisis, and the financial meltdown will occupy much of his -- and the country's -- attention. But by filling his Cabinet with qualified and capable candidates, the president can ensure that the next eight years are not a rerun of the last eight.

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	UC Merced researcher earns national honor for work on environment  	Danielle Gaines, Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	342 words  	Dec. 20--A UC Merced professor has been awarded the U.S. government's highest honor for scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers.LiNeBrEaKMonica Medina, an assistant professor in the School of Natural Sciences, traveled to the White House on Monday to accept the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. LiNeBrEaKNine federal departments and agencies annually nominate scientists and engineers whose work shows exceptional promise for leadership at the frontiers of scientific knowledge.LiNeBrEaKMedina is one of 20 winners nominated by the National Science Foundation, which also awarded her a $361,238 grant earlier this year. She will use the money to fund her work for the next five years.LiNeBrEaK"It's an amazing recognition," Medina said in a press release from UC Merced. "Besides validating my work, I feel with this award, NSF and the White House are recognizing the importance of basic research on topics related to climate change."LiNeBrEaKMedina's research examines how environmental changes, such as elevated water temperatures and toxic pollution, are affecting coral reefs, and how to conserve the endangered marine habitats.LiNeBrEaKMedina and eight other University of California scientists were among the 67 winners announced Monday. She is the second winner in the history of UC Merced.LiNeBrEaKShawn Newsam, an assistant professor in the School of Engineering, received the award last year.LiNeBrEaK"UC Merced has received this honor two years in a row," Dean Maria Pallavicini of the School of Natural Sciences said in a statement. "This is a remarkable testament to the world-class talent of our faculty and the research environment at UC Merced."

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	EDITORIAL: California needs a relevant GOP: The party of Reagan and Pete Wilson often forgets they put state's interests above ideology.  	Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	663 words  	Dec. 20--California's Republican Party is vital to this state's future.LiNeBrEaKA party that stands for free enterprise, fiscal integrity and personal responsibility provides an essential balance in our state Capitol, where members of the Democratic majority too often want to overregulate, overspend and assume that government is the answer to every challenge.LiNeBrEaKThe problem, however, is that the Republican Party has chosen not to be an effective force in recent years. LiNeBrEaKIts members have squabbled among themselves. It has been an inconsistent defender of individual liberties. In its efforts to regain market share, it has resorted to simplistic slogans and gimmicks such as no-tax pledges.LiNeBrEaKThe party's diminished clout is best illustrated by this year's budget impasse, which has allowed the deficit to swell to $42 billion.LiNeBrEaKAfter Republicans refused to discuss higher taxes in exchange for deep cuts to state programs during a November special sessions, Democrats and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger got fed up. They then explored ways to outflank the Republicans and prevent the state from running out of money by February.LiNeBrEaKThe result was a work of budgetary acrobatics, allowing higher fees and tax increases, along with $7 billion in additional cuts, to be enacted through a majority vote. Schwarzenegger ultimately rejected the final Democratic package, but not because it attempted an end run around the Republican and the two-thirds vote requirement to raise taxes.LiNeBrEaKIn an essay, GOP activist and blogger Jon Fleischman writes that Republicans "have abandoned the basic core principles that attracted votes to the party in the first place."LiNeBrEaKWe agree with Fleischman on this statement, but we differ with him on his historical reading of those core principles.LiNeBrEaKThe party of Abraham Lincoln has long cherished liberty, but has compromised this bedrock value with its opposition to gay marriage and abortion rights. It used to be a party of science and environmental protection, but now sides with coal companies that spread false claims about the peer-reviewed findings on global climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe party of Ronald Reagan has made the fight against taxes its top priority and vilifies Schwarzenegger for not being resolute on this issue. Yet its leaders often forget that both Reagan and Pete Wilson supported tax increases while serving as governor, putting the state's interests above ideology.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans make strong points that government on the federal and state level should be smaller, more efficient and more responsive to changing circumstances.LiNeBrEaKBut smaller government doesn't mean the total shutting down of government. Newt Gingrich succeeded in this on the federal level during the Clinton years, to the detriment of his party. Some Republicans seem determined to repeat his mistake here.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia needs Republicans to be players. It needs GOP leaders who will raise alarm bells about the long-term costs of state employee health benefits and pension obligations. It needs Republicans to push a platform of public accountability and transparency.LiNeBrEaKIt needs Republicans to lead an agenda of environmental protection that doesn't always rely on extra regulation. It needs Republicans who, in supporting public schools and higher education, are earnest about bringing manufacturing and high-paying jobs to this state.LiNeBrEaKMostly, California needs Republicans to be relevant. To get there, its leaders will have to move beyond obstruction to an agenda of engagement.LiNeBrEaKWhat do you think?

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   01 EDITION	How cold is it? So cold, it must be global cooling  		A; Pg. 11  	743 words  	How cold is it? So cold, it must be global coolingLiNeBrEaKBy apLiNeBrEaKap features,LiNeBrEaKWinter officially arrives with Sunday's solstice. But for many Americans, autumn 2008's final days already feel like deepest, coldest January.LiNeBrEaKNew Englanders still lack electricity after a Dec. 11 ice storm snapped power lines. Up to eight inches of snow struck New Orleans and south Louisiana that day and didn't melt for 48 hours in some neighborhoods.LiNeBrEaKIn southern California Wednesday, a half-inch of snow brightened Malibu's hills while a half-foot barricaded highways and marooned commuters in desert towns east of Los Angeles. Three inches of the white stuff shuttered Las Vegas' McCarren Airport that day and dusted the Strip's hotels and casinos. LiNeBrEaKWhat are the odds of that?LiNeBrEaKActually, the odds are rising that snow, ice and cold will grow increasingly common. As serious scientists repeatedly explain, global cooling is here. It is chilling temperatures and so-called "global-warming."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the National Climatic Data Center, 2008 will be America's coldest year since 1997, thanks to La Nina and precipitation in the central and eastern states. Solar quietude also may underlie global cooling. This year's sunspots and solar radiation approach the minimum in the Sun's cycle, corresponding with lower Earth temperatures. This echoes Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist Dr. Sallie Baliunas' belief that solar variability, much more than CO2, sways global temperatures.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the National Weather Service reports that last summer was Anchorage's third coldest on record. "Not since 1980 has there been a summer less reflective of global warming," Craig Medred wrote in the Anchorage Daily News. Consequently, Alaska's glaciers are thickening in the middle. "It's been a long time on most glaciers where they've actually had positive mass balance," U.S. Geological Survey glaciologist Bruce Molnia told Medred Oct. 13. Similarly, the National Snow and Ice Data Center found that Arctic sea ice expanded 13. 2 percent this year, or a Texas-sized 270,000 square miles.LiNeBrEaKAcross the equator, Brazil endured an especially cold September. Snow graced its southern provinces that month.LiNeBrEaK"Global Warming is over, and Global Warming Theory has failed. There is no evidence that CO2 drives world temperatures or any consequent climate change," Imperial College London astrophysicist and long-range forecaster Piers Corbyn wrote British Members of Parliament on Oct. 28. "According to official data in every year since 1998, world temperatures have been colder than that year, yet CO2 has been rising rapidly." That evening, as the House of Commons debated legislation on so-called "global-warming," October snow fell in London for the first time since 1922.LiNeBrEaKThese observations parallel those of five German researchers led by Professor Noel Keenlyside of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences. "Our results suggest that global surface temperature may not increase over the next decade," they concluded in last May's "Nature," "as natural climate variations in the North Atlantic and tropical Pacific temporarily offset the projected anthropogenic (man-made) warming."LiNeBrEaKThis "lull" should doom the 0. 54 degree Fahrenheit average global temperature rise predicted by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Vatican of so-called "global warming." Incidentally, the IPCC's computer models factor in neither El Nino nor the Gulf Stream. Excluding such major climate variables would be like ESPN ignoring baseball and basketball.LiNeBrEaKSo, is this all just propaganda concocted by Chevron-funded, right-wing, flat-Earthers? Ask Dr. Martin Hertzberg, a physical chemist and retired Navy meteorologist.LiNeBrEaK"As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the constant regurgitation of the anecdotal, fear mongering clap-trap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice to science," Hertzberg wrote in Sept. 26's USA Today. "From the El Nino year of 1998 until Jan., 2007, the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere near its surface decreased some 0. 25 C (0. 45 F). From Jan., 2007 until the spring of 2008, it dropped a whopping 0. 75 C (1. 35 F)."LiNeBrEaKAs global cooling becomes more widely recognized, Americans from Maine to Malibu should feel comfortable dreaming of a white Christmas.LiNeBrEaKDeroy Murdock is a columnist with Scripps Howard News Service and a media fellow with the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.

Because of the large number of calls, we cannot publish all comments. We also may edit some comments for length and clarity.LiNeBrEaKClinic is doing good workLiNeBrEaK*The editorial on the drug rehab facility in Daphne is absolutely correct. I was in Mercy for rehab of a surgical nature, and never knew the thing was there. They're in there of their own free will. It's a wonderful thing, especially for that area.LiNeBrEaKThey brought it on themselves LiNeBrEaK*In Daphne, opposition has been raised against a drug and alcohol treatment center. A caller claims that addiction to drugs and alcohol is a disease, and that people do not choose to become that way. Did someone force those people to start that way of life? Whatever happened to just saying no?LiNeBrEaKPlease save Santa a seatLiNeBrEaK*I'm very concerned about the effects of global warming on the polar ice caps. If they keep melting at the present rate, Santa's going to be sharing an iceberg with the polar bears.LiNeBrEaK'Already stretched to the limit'LiNeBrEaK*Once again, we read an editorial on how we need to raise property taxes in this state. When the economy is off and people lose their jobs, income taxes go down. But property taxes stay the same. It's a problem for families already stretched to the limit.LiNeBrEaKWhy the secrecy about TB?LiNeBrEaK*Regarding the TB case in the shipyard in south Mobile County: Why didn't the health department release the name of the shipyard? If you're a salesman calling on that facility, you'd probably like to get yourself checked.LiNeBrEaKPolice officers are playing fairLiNeBrEaK*The cops chase all. They chase thieves, crackheads, speeders and drunks. They're out there busy, and they're doing the best they can. Try to appreciate them.LiNeBrEaKThose patrols give us comfortLiNeBrEaK*We appreciate the police patrolling in the crack neighborhoods. We haven't had to call you in a long time for protection, because you're always there.LiNeBrEaKDreaming of drug-free streetsLiNeBrEaK*If the cops caught all the crackheads in your neighborhood, then the drug dealers would leave. Maybe they'd all get out, too. Wouldn't that be nice?LiNeBrEaKStill grieving tabby's fateLiNeBrEaK*My heart goes out to the family who lost their Lab at the hands of the animal control agency. We lost a beloved 15-year-old tabby like that. She was taken to a so-called shelter, which was actually a death row for her. The rule was not to euthanize for three days, in case the family came, and we were there on Day Two. But they had already put her to sleep. That was 12 years ago.LiNeBrEaKToo much killing going onLiNeBrEaK*If the animal control people can't control an animal any other way than to kill it, then they need a new profession.LiNeBrEaKShuttle would enhance parkLiNeBrEaK*I like the idea of having a space shuttle at the Battleship Park. We've got all the other cool planes and stuff. Why not have a space shuttle?LiNeBrEaKLet older folks be true guestsLiNeBrEaK*At this time of year, make your elderly and invalid relatives guests of honor at your Christmas table. Don't expect them to provide food for the meal. After all, they provided meals for you when you were young, and you will get a greater blessing.LiNeBrEaKYoung gentlemen fixed flatLiNeBrEaK*Thanks to the two young men who came to my rescue today who fixed my flat tire. And thanks to your parents for raising two very chivalrous young men. God bless you both. Merry Christmas.LiNeBrEaKA left hook on Christmas morningLiNeBrEaK*I see in Yesterday's News from 100 years ago: "Electric Utilities for Christmas - Your wife would appreciate an electric flat iron." I bet she would. She'd hit you right in the head with it.LiNeBrEaKThose are two terrible namesLiNeBrEaK*To the parents naming their child after Adolf Hitler: Why would you want to? He's a mass murderer. Same for bin Laden. Why would you name your child after an enemy of our country?LiNeBrEaKStick Madoff in jailLiNeBrEaK*About that Bernard Madoff: Don't just slap him on the wrist. They should've given him a $10 million bail. If that had been me and I'd ripped someone off for $1,000, I wouldn't be getting a bail. I'd still be sitting in jail.LiNeBrEaKWishing all the best to ObamaLiNeBrEaK*I didn't vote for President-electLiNeBrEaKObama, but I sincerely hope he turns out to be the greatest president this country has ever seen or ever will see.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   Sunrise Edition	Resurrecting the dead zones  		Editorial; Pg. C08  	438 words  	SUMMARY: Oregon State University's Jane Lubchenco is exactly the right person to lead NOAALiNeBrEaKResurrecting the dead zonesLiNeBrEaKW e don't toss around the words "brilliant" and "genius" lightly or too often. But they're exactly the right words to describe President-elect Barack Obama's choice to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. LiNeBrEaKThat Jane Lubchenco teaches marine biology and zoology at Oregon State University is also a nice plus for our state. But her world-renowned research on climate change, the nation's fisheries and ocean dead zones (including those off the Oregon coast) makes her the perfect person to run a critical agency.LiNeBrEaKActually, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is a $4 billion constellation of federal agencies, including the National Weather Service, the National Ocean Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The research they do, together, will drive any Obama effort to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKAnd the fact that Obama picked Lubchenco to oversee them shows he's serious about addressing it. Now. In his first term. It can't be put off.LiNeBrEaKNo one is better qualified than Lubchenco, either, to lead a national effort to restore ocean health. A member of the Pew Oceans Commission, Lubchenco understands the quadruple whammy of overfishing, pollution, coastal development and climate change --and the steps we need to take to reverse the oceans' decline.LiNeBrEaKThe 61-year-old professor is also ideally suited to help resurrect the dead zones that the Bush administration is leaving behind in a different sense, scattered across federal agencies. Across many areas of research, the administration has systematically suffocated science, when it was at odds with Bush policy.LiNeBrEaKNot only has Lubchenco worked to restore science as a prime policy driver, she's also pushed scientists themselves to take a more active role in public affairs. Many shy away from the spotlight, don't return journalists' calls and, when they do present their findings, tend to "bury the lead," failing to illuminate the value of their work.LiNeBrEaKLubchenco founded the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program to reverse the trend. "A key role of science is to inform people's understanding and decisions," she has said.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   Sunrise Edition	Conditions boost fish populations off Oregon coast  	MICHAEL MILSTEIN, The Oregonian  	Local News  	415 words  	SUMMARY: Upwelling   | An influx of nutrient-rich water could bring a salmon boom in a few yearsLiNeBrEaKConditions boost fish populations off Oregon coast An influx of nutrient-rich water could bring a salmon boom in a few years Conditions boost fish populations off Oregon coast LiNeBrEaKMICHAEL MILSTEINLiNeBrEaKAfter years of poor ocean conditions that left birds starving and sea life dwindling, this year brought a healthy influx of cold, nutrient-rich water along the Oregon coast that will make it the best year for fish in decades, scientists say.LiNeBrEaKSurveys along the coast from Newport north to La Push, Wash., found more juvenile chinook salmon than seen in 11 years of surveys, researchers said.LiNeBrEaKThat suggests the Northwest could see a salmon boom once those fish mature and migrate back to home rivers in the next few years. If so, it would represent a contrast to the past few years.LiNeBrEaKThe key to ocean productivity off the Oregon coast is upwelling of deep, cold water rich in nutrients. The water typically nurtures prolific marine ecosystems, but for several years before 2008 the upwelling has been erratic and hasn't provided the nutrients essential to fish and other coastal life.LiNeBrEaKScientists say the return to positive conditions may be connected with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate pattern that shifts between warm and cool cycles in periods of 20 to 30 years.LiNeBrEaKThis year, the pattern was cooler than it has been since 1955, said Bill Peterson, a biologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service who is based in Newport and affiliated with Oregon State University's College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences.LiNeBrEaK"We usually see cold-water conditions for a few months once upwelling begins in late spring and early summer," Peterson said. "Since April of 2007, though, we've been in a constant 'summer state' ocean condition, which is something we've never seen in more than 20 years of sampling. And we're not sure why."LiNeBrEaKUpwelled nutrients nurture masses of phytoplankton that are rich in fat and provide food for small fish such as anchovies and herring, which themselves become food for salmon and other predators.LiNeBrEaKWhile surveys did not turn up as many juvenile coho salmon as scientists had hoped, they found more than twice as many juvenile chinook salmon than they have in more than 10 years. Researchers said that this year seabirds were getting plenty to eat and that it was also a good year for lingcod and other rockfish.LiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689; michaelmilstein@LiNeBrEaKnews.oregonian.com	COASTAL AREAS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); FISHERIES (78%); OCEANOGRAPHY (78%); OCEANS (76%); BIOLOGY (75%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE (75%); RESEARCH (75%); METEOROLOGY (75%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (73%)  			OREGON, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  															
Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Teen, Santa cheer Guard dependents  		OP-ED; CHEERS and JEERS; Pg. A09  	542 words  	CHEERS to Brendan McCarthy, 16, a Susquehanna Twp. High School junior who organized a Christmas party at Hershey's Chocolate World for families of Pennsylvania National Guard members deployed overseas. Brendan, an aspiring Marine, even managed to get a surprise visit from Santa, who also gets CHEERS for taking time from what has to a hectic schedule this month.LiNeBrEaKCHEERS to Sen. John Wozniak of Johnstown, who this week made what I'm told is his annual rounds through the state Capitol playing Christmas music on his saxophone. Senate staffer Cindie Watkins of Harrisburg made it a point to call and "lobby" for a CHEERS. Cindie says the tough times made the music particularly soothing this year. LiNeBrEaKCHEERS to Canine-Americans for doing more than just barking up the tree -- or helping "water" it -- during the Yule season. The local Dog Scouts of America Redfern Ramblers Troop 171 will lend a paw to Salvation Army bell ringers at the Macy's entrance at the Harrisburg Mall tonight. The group promotes responsible pet ownership, an important message at a time of year when some make impulsive decisions to get a pet or give one as a gift. Do your homework first and think through all that goes with having a pet.LiNeBrEaKBack to my evil twin, "The Grinch," and JEERS to the double-standard for CEO salaries and those of athletes and celebrities. Yes, the news out of Wall Street is outrageous, but C.C. Sabathia signs a $161 million contract with the New York Yankees to throw a baseball and there's barely a ripple. The same applies to the millions raked in by Hollywood stars and other entertainers that are part of the reason for inflated ticket prices for movies, concerts and sporting events.LiNeBrEaKJEERS to another double standard that jumped off the page this week. Monday's Patriot-News had a story and photo of President-elect Barack Obama meeting with Al "The rest of you conserve energy while I live in a huge energy-sucking mansion" Gore on global warming. A second story and photo about Obama and his daughters buying a Christmas tree says after the purchase they "headed back to a waiting sport utility vehicle." I feel people should drive what they darn well please, but if you talk it, walk it.LiNeBrEaKCHEERS to President-elect Obama, however, for his selection of former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary, picking the Pittsburgh native over Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff, who did everything but run TV ads begging Obama to select him. If the self-promotion, including taking his taxpayer-funded state vehicle to D.C. to lobby for the job, didn't turn off Obama, Wolff's record should have. He has been far too cozy with corporate agriculture and the ag department under his watch originally bungled Gov. Ed Rendell's efforts to crack down on "puppy mills."LiNeBrEaKCHEERS to Pennsylvania First Lady and federal Judge Marjorie O. Rendell for leading an effort to have local judges and lawyers conduct monthly civics classes for eighth graders in the Harrisburg School District. This is only the latest effort on this front by Mrs. Rendell, who commendably has recognized the civics vacuum in schools today and has tried to do something about it.LiNeBrEaKJOHN TROUTMAN is an editorial writer for The Patriot-News: 255-8104 or jtroutman@patriot-news.com	CHRISTMAS (91%); PETS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); CELEBRITIES (89%); LOBBYING (89%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (83%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (77%); BASEBALL (75%); MUSIC (75%); MUSIC GENRES (70%); WIND INSTRUMENTS (70%); ARTISTS and PERFORMERS (70%); SPORTS and RECREATION (69%); SPORTS (69%); SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (67%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (64%); WAGES and SALARIES (64%); EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (64%); MOTOR VEHICLES (60%); BROADCAST ADVERTISING (60%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); ACTORS and ACTRESSES (69%); HIGH SCHOOLS (78%)  		BARACK OBAMA (83%); TOM VILSACK (51%)  	HARRISBURG, PA, USA (90%); NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%); PITTSBURGH, PA, USA (73%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (92%); IOWA, USA (92%); NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 20, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  	hrn  	2008 The Patriot News Co.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Backyard bird count // Volunteers play important role in tracking condition of species  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A09  	343 words  	One of the more pleasurable scenes this time of year is spotting a blazing red cardinal perched on a snow-tinged evergreen.LiNeBrEaKBut amid declining open space, climate change and other environmental threats this greeting-card-like setting shouldn't be taken for granted. LiNeBrEaKPreserving bird species is the objective of volunteers who will be helping today with the Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count in the Harrisburg area. The count started Sunday and continues through Jan. 5, but today is the designated date for our region.LiNeBrEaKBirding enthusiasts will head, some before dawn, with binoculars, bird guides and check lists to collect data that will be forwarded to experts.LiNeBrEaKThis event requires a bit of expertise on the part of participants. Another equally important survey is coming up, however, in which beginning and general backyard birders can participate on a less formal basis, and from a window in the comfort of their own homes.LiNeBrEaKThe 2009 Great Backyard Bird Count, headed by Audubon and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, will be held Feb. 13-16. Volunteers count birds according to species as little or as long as they want each of the four days.LiNeBrEaKData from this simple exercise goes into the Avian Knowledge Network, which holds 36 million records used by scientists to study such things as: LiNeBrEaK* The affect of snow and cold temperatures on bird populations.LiNeBrEaK* The location of winter finches and other species that appear in large numbers during some years, but not others.LiNeBrEaK* The timing of bird migrations in comparison to previous years?LiNeBrEaK* How are bird diseases, such as West Nile virus, affecting birds in different regions.LiNeBrEaK* The differences in bird diversity in cities as opposed to suburban, rural and natural areas?LiNeBrEaK* Species that might be undergoing worrisome declines.LiNeBrEaKThis is a great way for the many backyard birding enthusiasts -- hanging a feeder qualifies -- to have a fun winter-time activity while also giving new meaning to the phrase, "for the birds."LiNeBrEaKINFOBOX: ON THE WEB Information on the 2009 Great Backyard Bird Count: www.birdsource.org/gbbc	BIRDS (95%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (77%); SCIENCE NEWS (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); CHRISTMAS (71%); TROPICAL DISEASES (64%); VIRUSES (64%); WEST NILE VIRUS (72%) John Troutman  			HARRISBURG, PA, USA (90%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 20, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  	hrn  	2008 The Patriot News Co.

Pioneer Press (St. Paul, Minnesota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	Study: Carbon cap will cost jobs: Business group's findings questioned  	Leslie Brooks Suzukamo, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	664 words  	Dec. 20--If Midwest states go ahead with a regional effort to cap production of greenhouse gases, Minnesotans could end up with higher electric bills and 21,000 fewer jobs, according to a study by a group representing Minnesota businesses.LiNeBrEaKPartners for Affordable Energy says it would be better if Minnesota waits for a national or global effort to limit the production of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. LiNeBrEaK"A regional approach is not going to solve the problem with greenhouse gases," said Bill Blazar, senior vice president of public affairs at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which was part of the business group.LiNeBrEaKBut supporters of the effort to limit greenhouse gases as soon as possible questioned the study's conclusions and said waiting would further damage the environment.LiNeBrEaKThe study by Partners for Affordable Energy, released last week, focuses on the economic impact of Minnesota's goals to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with global warming by 15 percent by 2015 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe business group represents iron and coal mining, agriculture, rural utilities, grocers and printers, among others. They want to ensure Minnesota's efforts don't lead to energy costs that put them at a disadvantage to competitors in other states, said Christina Pierson, executive director for the group.LiNeBrEaKPartners for Affordable Energy commissioned an economic analysis in reaction to proposals for a regional exchange from Gov. Tim Pawlenty andLiNeBrEaKthe Midwest Governors Association. The study assumed Minnesota would be part of a Midwestern cap-and-trade system that limits the amount of greenhouse gases companies can produce, but also lets those companies trade emissions credits with one another. Companies that reduce their emissions below their limit could sell credits to companies that don't.LiNeBrEaKThe system is supposed to create a marketplace that rewards companies that reduce emissions the most.LiNeBrEaKBut the effort would be costly, the study said. Minnesota households would see a 17 percent increase in electricity prices by 2015, and the state's industries would pay 33 percent more for power then, forcing some companies to close or be bought out, the study said.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade system would cost Minnesota a net 21,000 jobs by 2015, factoring in new "green energy" jobs that could be created by conservation and renewable energy initiatives, the study said.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the greenhouse gases produced by the rest of the country would wipe out any reductions made in Minnesota, study author Anne Smith said.LiNeBrEaK"One needs to ask the question, does Minnesota need to take this on itself?" she said.LiNeBrEaKBut one environmentalist said waiting for a national or international mandate could result in greater damage.LiNeBrEaK"Now is not the time to wait," said Kevin Reuther, legal director of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.LiNeBrEaKAnd an executive of Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility, expressed skepticism about the report's conclusions.LiNeBrEaKThe projected business increase of 33 percent is "unrealistic," said David Sparby, president of Northern States Power-Minnesota, an Xcel company. And although he said he hadn't run the numbers, he estimated the 17 percent household increase by 2015 could be no more than the effect of inflation. Xcel is not part of the partnership group.LiNeBrEaKPawlenty believes states can play a role in crafting energy policy, and he is awaiting the results of an economic analysis from the Midwest Governors Association, his spokesman Brian McClung said.

San Antonio Express-News 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   STATEandMETRO Edition	your turn  		EDITORIAL; Pg. 1B  	524 words  	Give us some answersLiNeBrEaKSeems like every time there's a concern with TxDOT, the public seems to get the same message: "We'll study the problem." And the answer seems to come, most of the time, from a hired spokesperson. LiNeBrEaKFor example, after Tuesday's multiple-crash scenario on slick roadways in the wake of questionable de-icing methods, we read this in the Express-News: "We're not sure what's causing the accidents, but we're planning to study and investigate," said Laura Lopez, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Transportation's San Antonio office.LiNeBrEaKYou know, folks, it hasn't been that long ago that we would get the answers from the superintendent or chief engineer at TxDOT, and usually they had the answer because that was part of their job. Additional work or something obviously has deflected their interest in telling the public what's wrong when a problem arises.LiNeBrEaKJoe Schott,LiNeBrEaKCastrovilleLiNeBrEaKHistory's verdict will differLiNeBrEaKSo Shirley Davis thinks George W. Bush is a disgrace and will go down in history as our worst president ever ("Defining lame-duck," Your Turn, Dec. 12). I hear that sentiment often, but it always seems to come from those who don't have a problem with the undisciplined adolescent from the previous administration who compromised the office of the presidency for sex.LiNeBrEaKI predict those same shallow thinkers will be in denial when history looks back and acknowledges that the reason we haven't been attacked since 9-11 is because Bush aggressively took the fight to the terrorists.LiNeBrEaKJack WrightLiNeBrEaKProving a negativeLiNeBrEaKIt continues to puzzle me that defenders of the current Bush administration cite as one of his supposed accomplishments that, because the United States has not suffered another terrorist attack on its territory since Sept. 11, 2001, George W. has "kept us safe."LiNeBrEaKWhile conjuring up proof of negatives, supporters might as well add to their list of Bush successes the facts that we have not been struck by a huge meteorite or forced by a new ice age to move to the equator. But that would beg the question of why our government of the past eight years was shamefully inept at anticipating and dealing with the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and that it has done almost everything in its power to deny or downplay the existence of global warming.LiNeBrEaKIf Bush deserves credit for keeping us safe from terrorism, then he deserves credit for the deaths of over 4,000 American servicemen and women, the deaths of countless innocent Iraqi, Afghani and Pakistani citizens who just happened to be in the way of our "war on terror," and for creating the best recruiting tool for al-Qaida and its allies that they could ever have imagined.LiNeBrEaKDanny Root,LiNeBrEaKBulverdeLiNeBrEaKFirst prize dishonorLiNeBrEaKI have to disagree with the report, "Alleged Madoff fraud has global exposure," (Business, Tuesday). This is not, as the article suggested, the world's largest Ponzi scheme.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   FINAL Edition	Obama science picks said to herald policy shift;  THE PRESIDENCY IN TRANSITION 	David Perlman, Chronicle Science Editor  	Main News; Pg. A8  	690 words  	President-elect Barack Obama's decision to name two of the nation's most prominent scientists to crucial roles in his administration was being heralded in the scientific community as a signal that the new president is serious about taking on the challenges of climate change and creating a new energy policy for the nation.LiNeBrEaKObama is expected today to name John P. Holdren, 64, a former professor of energy and natural resources at UC Berkeley who is now at Harvard, as his science adviser and executive director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. LiNeBrEaKHe also reportedly has settled on Jane Lubchenco, 61, a world-renowned marine biologist and expert on the ocean environment at Oregon State University, to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The influential agency measures the pace of global warming, tracks hurricanes, predicts the weather and monitors the health of the world's seas.LiNeBrEaKTheir impending selection, along with the naming last week of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu to head the Department of Energy, is seen as the surest sign yet that Obama will reverse Bush administration policies on energy and global warming.LiNeBrEaKNobel physics laureate Burton Richter, a former director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, noted that by giving Holdren the title of science adviser he is sending a subtle message that the physicist will be brought into the White House fold. By contrast, Richter said, President Bush's current director of the science policy office, John Marburger, a physicist, was never given that title and his influence has been minimized in the current administration. LiNeBrEaKRichter said Holdren is an "outstanding" choice.LiNeBrEaKHoldren's early research examined the still unfulfilled promise of thermonuclear fusion energy, and at UC Berkeley - where he remains an emeritus professor - he created and headed the Energy and Resources group whose members have led groundbreaking research on energy generation as well as conservation.LiNeBrEaKHe also has long been involved in nuclear weapons policy as well as climate change and energy issues and knows the political world inside the Washington Beltway intimately.LiNeBrEaKBruce Alberts, a noted biochemist and molecular biologist at UCSF, and as former president of the national Academy of Sciences is a Beltway-savvy editor in chief of Science Magazine, called Holdren and Chu, an internationally noted expert on solar energy, biofuels, and climate change, "a great pair." LiNeBrEaK"John is a fantastically talented leader, completely on top of both environmental and energy problems and opportunities," Alberts said.LiNeBrEaK"We need a new start for the position of science adviser" and Holdren is the right selection as he and Obama are known to think alike on many scientific issues, he said.LiNeBrEaKDonald Kennedy, a neurobiologist and former president of Stanford as well as Alberts' predecessor as editor of Science, also praised Holdren's selection.LiNeBrEaK"A great appointment, and my favorite from Day 1," Kennedy said in an e-mail message. "He and Chu will be a terrific combination on energy and climate and also on nuclear nonproliferation and other national security issues."LiNeBrEaKHoldren's selection also drew praise from the country's leading supporter of teaching evolution in public schools. LiNeBrEaK"Holdren is a physical scientist who is very comfortable dealing with biology, and this scientific multilingualism is ideal for a post like science adviser," said Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education that monitors school district clashes between Darwin supporters and advocates of "intelligent design," or creationism.LiNeBrEaK"It is obvious that science is going to have a much higher profile during the next administration than it has in decades, and this is long overdue," Scott said.LiNeBrEaKBoth Holdren and Lubchenco have served as presidents of the American Association of Science and won MacArthur Foundation "genius awards."LiNeBrEaKLubchenco served two terms as a member of the National Science Board, appointed by President Bill Clinton, has been president of the International Council for Science, and is a trustee and vice chair of the Environmental Defense Fund.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	GARDEN STATE BRIEFS  		BUSINESS; Pg. 030  	398 words  	Sovereign cutting jobsLiNeBrEaKSovereign Bank, the banking unit of Sovereign Bancorp, said yesterday it is cutting 1,000 jobs, or 8. 3 percent of its work force, in an effort to reduce costs amid the economic downturn. LiNeBrEaKThe regional bank, which currently has about 12,000 employees - some in New Jersey, said jobs will be cut during the remaining weeks of 2008 and into 2009.LiNeBrEaKThe decision to cut jobs comes as Sovereign Bancorp is selling the remaining stake in itself to Spanish bank Banco Santander. Santander is buying the remaining roughly 75 percent stake it does not already own in Sovereign. The deal, announced in October, originally valued the remaining stake in Sovereign for $1. 9 billion, or about $3. 81 per share. The sale is expected to close during the first quarter.LiNeBrEaK- Associated PressLiNeBrEaKState to receive $15MLiNeBrEaKNew Jersey will receive $15 million to fund energy conservation and clean energy programs as a result of the nation's second auction of carbon dioxide emission allowances.LiNeBrEaKThe auction, a program aimed at reducing greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, raised $106. 5 million for the 10 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states participating in the capand-trade program. Called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, advocates view it as a model for a national program to curb global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn the auction, the allowances were sold for $3. 38 ton. Under the program, it requires energy produces to buy enough allowances to cover every ton of carbon dioxide they emit.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	Obama rounds out his Cabinet President-elect announces labor, trade and transportation leaders  	ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND WILLIAM BRANIGIN, WASHINGTON POST  	NEWS; Pg. 003  	857 words  	President-elect Barack Obama announced the final selections for his Cabinet yesterday, naming Rep. Hilda L. Solis of California as labor secretary, former Dallas mayor Ron Kirk as U.S. trade representative and Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois as transportation secretary.LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference in Chicago, Obama also named Karen Gordon Mills as his choice to head the Small Business Administration. LiNeBrEaK"Together with the appointees I've already announced, these leaders will help craft a 21st-century economic recovery plan with the goal of creating 2. 5 million new jobs and strengthening our economy for the future," Obama said in introducing the four.LiNeBrEaKHe said he has filled out his economic team "at an earlier point than any president in history" in part because the challenges of addressing the nation's economic problems are so daunting.LiNeBrEaK"It will take longer than any of us would like - years, not months," Obama said. "It will get worse before it gets better. But it will get better if we are willing to act boldly and swiftly."LiNeBrEaKIn response to questions, he declined to put a dollar figure on a proposed economic recovery package that some analysts estimate could cost up to $1 trillion. But he said economists "from across the political spectrum" agree that "we're going to have to be bold when it comes to our economic recovery package" in order to get the economy back on track.LiNeBrEaKIn introducing Solis, Obama said the Labor Department under the Bush administration "has not lived up to its role either as an advocate for hard-working families or as an arbiter of fairness in relations between labor and management." Solis will change that, he said.LiNeBrEaKWith his selection of Solis, a liberal member of Congress, Obama also appears to be moving toward his goal of promoting "green-collar jobs," which are aimed at increasing energy efficiency through projects such as retrofitting. Solis has placed a high priority on expanding such jobs during her tenure in Congress.LiNeBrEaKHowever, she is better known for her efforts on energy issues than for her work on matters relating to labor. She sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee - but not the Education and Labor Committee.LiNeBrEaKSolis, who was born in Los Angeles in 1957, is the third Hispanic chosen for the Cabinet (in addition to Bill Richardson and Ken Salazar), and the fifth woman (after Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, Janet Napolitano and Lisa Jackson). She also represents another Obama pick for his Cabinet or top staff who originally backed Clinton in the Democratic presidential primaries. Solis was an avid supporter of the former first lady, but as the primaries ended she was aggressively courted by Obama as part of his effort to win over Hispanic voters.LiNeBrEaKIn all likelihood, the next labor secretary will spend much time contending with the looming battle over the Employee Free Choice Act, legislation Obama supported that would make it much easier for unions to organize workers but that business groups adamantly oppose. One group issued a statement denouncing her support of the legislation.LiNeBrEaK"Solis's co-sponsorship of the misnamed Employee Free Choice Act, a much-desired bill by organized labor that eliminates workers' right to a secret ballot vote in organizing elections, signals that Obama's Department of Labor will toe the line for union bosses," said J. Justin Wilson, a senior research analyst at the Center for Union Facts.LiNeBrEaKAmong Solis's previous accomplishments: sponsoring a bill, signed into law in 2003, granting citizenship to immigrants after a year of service in the military, rather than three years as previously required.LiNeBrEaKObama will install Kirk as the steward of his trade policies. The first black mayor of Dallas, Kirk ran unsuccessfully for one of Texas's U.S. Senate seats in 2002. Since leaving office, he has been a partner at the Houston-based law firm of Vinson and Elkins.LiNeBrEaKAmong his priorities will be following up on Obama's campaign promises on trade, including stiffer enforcement of trade pacts, particularly the environmental and labor protections in the North American Free Trade Agreement. China, which has been accused of manipulating its currency in recent years to gain trade advantages, is expected to be another item high on the trade agenda.LiNeBrEaKThe choice of LaHood as transportation secretary was confirmed by Democratic officials earlier this week but was not formally announced by Obama until today. The 63-year-old Republican lawmaker, who is retiring after representing a rural downstate Illinois district in Congress since 1995, would play a major role in overseeing the huge public works program the administration plans to implement to stimulate the flagging economy.LiNeBrEaKHe joins Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has agreed to stay on after serving in the same role in the Bush administration, as the second Republican in the Obama Cabinet.LiNeBrEaKAs transportation secretary, LaHood would be in a charge of an agency that oversees much of the nation's roads and rails, as well as its air traffic control system.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 20, 2008 Saturday 	N.Y. gets emission program funds: The $42M earned by the state can help pay for energy efficiency efforts  	Brian Nearing, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	504 words  	Dec. 20--ALBANY -- The state raised nearly $42 million to help fight global warming under the nation's second auction of carbon dioxide emissions allowances by 10 northeastern states in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. LiNeBrEaKOverall, states sold allowances for 31. 5 million tons of CO2 _ at $3. 38 per ton _ and cleared more than $106 million at Wedneday's on-line auction to help pay for various state-level energy efficiency and CO2 mitigation programs.LiNeBrEaKThe allowance price was up about 10 percent from the first RGGI auction in September. And demand was up, with 69 bidders seeking more than three times as many allowances as were offered. The first auction drew bidders.LiNeBrEaK"Once again the results prove that distributing allowances via auctions in a carbon dioxide cap and trade program can be successful. We look forward to developing a partnership with the Obama Administration to create a strong federal climate action plan," said state Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Pete Grannis, who also is board chairman of RGGI Inc.LiNeBrEaKUnder the program, states will auction allowances several times each year, with the next auction scheduled for March 18. Other RGGI states include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.LiNeBrEaKPlants that emit low levels of CO2 would need to buy fewer allowances, which provide an owner with the legal right to emit CO2, while less-efficient operations would need more allowances. Allowances can be sold and traded like any other commodity among owners.LiNeBrEaKIn 2015, the program will reduce available allowances by 10 percent over the next four years to force down CO2. Power plants account for about a quarter of the state's CO2 emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe New York Energy Research and Development Authority will decide how to spend the state's auction proceeds, which could total more than $217 million for 2009 based on this week's auction price. The state has vowed to use the money for energy efficiency, alternative energy and carbon mitigation programs.LiNeBrEaK"We are working on developing a concept paper and operating plan for how to use RGGI proceeds," said acting NYSERDA President Bob Callender.LiNeBrEaKThe state also intends to make "clean coal" research eligible for RGGI funding support, added state Deputy Energy Secretary Paul DeCotis.LiNeBrEaKThe state has already put in $6 million toward an experimental coal-fired power plant in Chautauqua County, planned by the Jamestown Board of Public Utilities and several coal- and energy-related firms.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   Final Edition	Check your zones first  	VIJA SEVIER Ask a Master Gardener  	Scene; Pg. D6  	413 words  	Q: My gardening books list hardiness zones for plants. What are these and what is Tulsa's zone? Brad C. Tulsa A: Hardiness zones listed for plants and seeds are provided as a guide for selections compatible with local temperatures.  LiNeBrEaKThese zones are very useful, and they come in two varieties: one for low and another for high temperatures. The plant cold hardiness zone map was created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and will soon be revised. There are 11 zones Zone 1 is the coldest, and each subsequent zone is 10 degrees warmer. Each numbered zone is further divided into parts A and B. Originally, Tulsa was in zone 6 (6B), which has an average minimum temperature 10 below zero to zero degrees. However, our temperatures have been above average since about 1990, and a revised map will probably show Tulsa to be in zone 7(7A) with a low temperature range of zero to 10 degrees. A 100-year record of temperature averages is available at the Oklahoma climatological survey online at tulsaworld.com/100yearrecord. The American Horticulture Society has also created a plant heat-zone map with 12 zones based on the yearly number of days with temperatures greater than 86 degrees. Tulsa is in Heat Zone 8, with an average 90 to 120 days above this level. These zones are useful, and Tulsans generally should purchase plants rated for cold hardiness Zone 7 and Heat Zone 8. Be aware, however, that microclimates exist, which may allow you to stretch the cold tolerance of plants. Microclimates are places sheltered from wind, and they may be near heat-retaining structures, such as stone buildings or bodies of water. A southern slope is another useful warm microclimate. A plant that is questionably tolerant of the cold in Tulsa may think it lives in Dallas if planted in one of these areas. A discussion about climate is never without controversy. There are many opinions about zone ratings, and organizations other than the USDA have their own hardiness maps. Additional information about zones and climate changes may be accessed through the Master Gardener Web site, listed below.

The Washington Post 		December 20, 2008 Saturday   Regional Edition	A Good Record on Cutting Emissions  		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A16  	138 words  	The Dec. 6 news story "Report Says 2 Global Programs to Curb Emissions Fall Short"  gave the impression that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions rose by several percentage points under President Bush. LiNeBrEaKYet the analysis did not include the effect of greenhouse gas "sinks," which remove or sequester greenhouse gases. Expanding forests and managing land better can create sinks.  Including sinks, the most recent United Nations data show that, while net U.S. greenhouse gas emissions rose steadily from 1990 to 2000, under President Bush, emissions declined 3 percent between 2000 and 2006. Among the major economies, the United States was second only to France, which benefits from much more zero-emission nuclear power, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKJAMES L.

Akron Beacon Journal (Ohio)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Assembly work  	The Akron Beacon Journal, Ohio  	COMMENTARY  	669 words  	Dec. 19--Of all the items on the agenda of President-elect Barack Obama, none is more ambitious than his intention to curb greenhouse emissions while crafting a comprehensive energy strategy. The objectives work in tandem, to be sure. The task also requires confronting a slew of obstacles -- economic, political, diplomatic and technological, for starters. The encouraging thing is, the president-elect has gathered a strong team to take up the challenge.LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu, a Nobel Prize winner in physics and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has been tapped to serve as the secretary of energy. If the office rarely makes the headlines, the responsibilities are broad, including maintenance and development of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. Obama has in mind a great leap in the area of alternative energy sources. Chu will take the lead. In that way, he is an intelligent pick. At Lawrence, he has sponsored research into biofuels and solar energy. He will bring a practical approach, the expertise to know what is possible and by when. LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner most ably led the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton years. Obama wants her to serve as the coordinator of energy and climate policy, leading the environmental equivalent of a national security or economic council. The idea is sound. Gathering the necessary authority will not be easy. What will aid Browner is (again) her expertise and practicality, and her deserved reputation for prevailing in tough legal and bureaucratic fights.LiNeBrEaKThe element of expertise cannot be overstated, especially in view of the past eight years, the Bush team often disdainful of solid science. Knowledge and experience combined in the president's choice of Lisa P. Jackson to run the EPA and Nancy Sutley to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Jackson led the state EPA in New Jersey (after serving under Browner at the federal level). Sutley has been the top environmental adviser to the mayor of Los Angeles (again, after serving with Browner).LiNeBrEaKObama wants to attack the energy and climate challenges on three fronts. He talks about including "green" initiatives in an economic stimulus package, investing in such items as more energy-efficient buildings and homes (no small energy savers). He proposes plowing substantial resources into improving the fuel-efficiency of cars and trucks, plus new cleaner sources of energy. Finally, he has in mind congressional approval of a cap-and-trade program, leveraging market forces to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKIf expectations are high for the new president, no one should think that George W. Bush alone stood in the way of progress. The barriers still will be plentiful. Dealing with climate change requires a global effort, the likes of China and India doing their part. It requires a makeover of the transmission grid, sources such as wind power not yet suited for broad access. It involves an embrace of nuclear power.LiNeBrEaKThese are just a few of the required steps. A report issued this week by Environment Ohio made plain the consequences to this state if the problem isn't sufficiently addressed. The study noted the risk of the water level of Lake Erie declining by 3 feet to 6. 5 feet during the next 70 years, altering the shipping industry, putting stress on the regional economy. The state's forests will be strained, even the Buckeye tree retreating to Michigan, of all places. The report isn't a scare tactic. It is a fair reading of the science. It reflects the pressure on the Obama team to succeed. Fortunately, they are well prepared for the job.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Harder to keep on trucking: New emission rules hamstring truckers  	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	487 words  	Dec. 19--Amid the hype over this week's adoption by the state Air Resources Board of new regulations to curb greenhouse gases, much less attention was given to the ARB's companion action regarding diesel trucks. LiNeBrEaKWhile the costly, largely unnecessary plan to enforce 2006's Global Warming Solutions Act ultimately will be more broadly felt throughout California's economy, the new diesel regulations probably will be felt sooner. It will be a multibillion-dollar blow to an already aching economy.LiNeBrEaKBy 2011, diesel truck operators must begin adding exhaust filters, at about $10,000 each, and replacing trucks beginning in 2012, at about $100,000 or more per vehicle. The ARB concedes truckers' total cost to be $5. 5 billion, a huge sum even in good economic times. The industry says costs will be closer to $10 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe trucking industry apparently doesn't dispute the state's claim that diesel exhaust is unhealthy and contributes to air pollution. But truckers complain that added costs will squeeze many companies out of business, and others will leave the state. The industry unsuccessfully requested more time to replace fleets with cleaner vehicles. Complaints like Southern California trucker Mark Binkley's failed to sway the ARB board, which imposed the costly rules on about 400,000 California-licensed vehicles and another 500,000 out-of-state trucks doing business here.LiNeBrEaKThe ARB admits the state's diesels are getting cleaner every year, but not clean enough fast enough to satisfy Sacramento's unelected bureaucracy. Previously the ARB imposed similar mandates on tractors and bulldozers. At that time the agency also similarly stepped outside its area of expertise, presuming to tell private businesses how much they can afford and remain profitable. We suspect a large motivation for the ARB was the possibility of it losing billions of dollars in federal funding if the state doesn't meet other arbitrary federal clean-air standards.LiNeBrEaKTaxpayers also will be saddled with huge costs. Adding insult to injury, the ARB will make $1 billion in subsidies available to truckers to ease the financial pain.LiNeBrEaKThe ARB contended that new regulations could save billions of dollars in health care costs. The difference is that while health care savings could occur, the costs to the trucking industry certainly will. Once again, on its own terms and timing, the government has imposed huge costs on the private sector, hoping to improve life, while certainly making life harder in the process.

The Bemidji Pioneer (Minnesota)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Lehmann pushes for 'green' city  	The Bemidji Pioneer, Minn.  	COMMENTARY  	515 words  	Dec. 19--While not at the forefront of public attention, Bemidji Mayor Richard Lehmann has actively worked to make it known that Bemidji is a "green community," with its residents concerned over the environment. LiNeBrEaKIt's a natural -- we live in an area rich of natural beauty and a strong desire to protect what we have here, from the lakes, the rivers to the woods. Mayor Lehmann realizes that, and has earnestly sought to equate Bemidji with causes that promote a clean environment and best uses of our fragile natural resources.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this week, Mayor Lehmann joined nine other Minnesota mayors in signing the Pickens Pledge, calling for an energy independence plan within the first 100 days of the Obama administration. They join more than 150 mayors across the nation who believe green jobs and clean renewable energy are the path to energy independence and economic stability.LiNeBrEaKThe Pickens Pledge, in support of T. Boone Pickens' plan, outlines investments in power generation from domestic renewable resources such as wind and using abundant natural gas resources for transportation fuel. Minnesota now has more than 60 wind farms added in the past 20 years, which will be needed to meet Minnesota's new renewable energy standard, which requires 30 percent of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2020.LiNeBrEaKGov. Tim Pawlenty's call for "Green JOBZ" areas offers another option, estimating it could grow 114,000 jobs in the green sector by 2030. Duluth Mayor Don Ness, also a pledge signatory, said more than 300,000 freight tons of wind turbines shipments passed through the Port of Duluth last year, compared to 34,000 tons in 2005.LiNeBrEaKBemidji may also play an important role in a green economy, in seeking "clean" manufacturers of energy products or in providing cellulostic raw materials in the production of a new generation of ethanol.LiNeBrEaK"For America to be competitive in a new global economy, we must invest in technologies that help reduce our dependence on foreign oil," says Duluth's Ness. "This is an important moment in American history, we have the opportunity to develop a vibrant green economy that will strengthen the integrity of our nation's balance sheet and put Americans to work."LiNeBrEaKMayor Lehmann is also on record in indicating this community wants energy development that won't further deteriorate the environment. He joined about 800 other cities representing nearly 80 million people in signing the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, which provides a dozen ways of reducing global warming pollutants.LiNeBrEaKBemidji's mayor has made it clear that we want to be called a "green community," and that effort should be welcomed as clearly in our benefit.

The Boston Globe 		December 19, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Obama chooses Harvard physicist A restored role for scientists  	By Carolyn Y. Johnson, Globe Staff and Bina Venkataraman, Globe Correspondent  	NATIONAL; Pg. A1  	882 words  	In a sign that President-elect Barack Obama intends to elevate science to greater prominence, John P. Holdren, a Harvard physicist widely recognized for his leadership on energy policy and climate change, will be appointed White House science adviser this weekend, the Globe confirmed yesterday.LiNeBrEaKA representative from one of the institutions with which Holdren is affiliated said Obama will announce Holdren's selection during a Saturday morning radio address. That person, who has direct knowledge of the appointment, declined to be named. LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives for Obama and for Harvard refused comment.LiNeBrEaKThe news, coming in the same week as Nobel laureate physicist Steven Chu's appointment as secretary of energy, was heartening for the scientific community.LiNeBrEaKMany scientists have objected to the Bush administration's policies, from restrictions on embryonic stem cell research to the pace of action on climate change.LiNeBrEaK"I think they'll be restoring the role of science in the federal establishment," said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Cambridge-based advocacy organization. "We've got a bunch of people across the [new] administration who get it."LiNeBrEaKIn 2004, Holdren joined other prominent scientists to sign a letter accusing the Bush administration of undermining and censoring scientists.LiNeBrEaK"When scientific knowledge has been found to be in conflict with its political goals, the administration has often manipulated the process through which science enters into its decisions," the letter said.LiNeBrEaKHoldren, who was an adviser to the Obama campaign and a member of a scientific advisory committee to President Bill Clinton, is a specialist on energy, climate change, and nuclear proliferation.LiNeBrEaKHe is a professor of environmental policy and director of the Program on Science, Technology, and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. He also directs the Woods Hole Research Center, an ecological research hub in Falmouth, and is a former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the nation's premier organization of scientists.LiNeBrEaK"John brings enormous strengths in two areas of science policy: energy and the environment," said Sheila Jasanoff, a colleague of Holdren's and a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who has written extensively about the role of scientific advice in democracies. "I think if he is appointed, he will send a signal to the scientific community, which has been disenchanted in the current administration, that science is very important and will be listened to." One important area in which he is not as expert, she noted, is bioethics.LiNeBrEaKKevin Casey, director of federal relations at Harvard, said that appointing a science adviser early sends a clear signal that the adviser will be a valued part of the leadership team.LiNeBrEaK"I think attracting these kinds of scientists in their fields - both their scientific heft and their international leadership itself - sends a signal that these positions will play an important role in the administration," said Casey.LiNeBrEaKDuring the presidential campaign, Obama received the endorsement of Nobel laureates and outlined policies that were praised by the scientific community, including plans to elevate the post of science adviser to a senior-level position.LiNeBrEaKSince being elected, Obama has explicitly said that issues such as global warming and alternative energy will be a priority.LiNeBrEaKThe recent appointments, scientists said, were an encouraging sign.LiNeBrEaK"That can only mean that the administration at the highest levels is listening to respected scientists, whereas over the last seven years, certainly in the stem cell-policy area, the people who have been advising the administration aren't even card-carrying stem cell scientists," said Dr. George Q. Daley, a principal faculty member of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.LiNeBrEaKColleagues and observers said Holdren's appointment makes sense because his experience fits well with major issues that will soon face the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaK"I think he has been a really staunch advocate for thinking about nonproliferation and climate, and that would be consistent with what we have heard about an Obama administration," said William Clark, a colleague at the Kennedy School.LiNeBrEaKThe likelihood of Holdren's appointment was first reported yesterday afternoon on ScienceInsider, the news blog of the science association. The blog reported that Holdren had planned to attend a staff meeting at the Kennedy School yesterday, but flew to a meeting in Chicago with Obama's transition team.LiNeBrEaKAlan Leshner, chief executive of the association, called Holdren an "enlightened appointment" and praised Obama's choices.LiNeBrEaK"It says that we are going to have science leaders in the federal government who are genuine experts on each of the issues that are so central to bringing the United States back to its prominent position in the world," said Leshner. "We have never had quite this array of scientists in federal government leadership positions."LiNeBrEaKAlso yesterday, The Washington Post reported that Jane Lubchenco, a prominent marine biologist at Oregon State University, had been picked to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Chattanooga Times and Free Press (Tennessee)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Tennessee: License plate to promote smaller carbon footprint  	Pam Sohn, Chattanooga Times/Free Press, Tenn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	374 words  	Dec. 19--The Tennessee Urban Forestry Council is offering drivers a way to compensate for some of the carbon emissions impact of their cars: a new state license plate honoring trees. LiNeBrEaK"Trees remain the cheapest, most effective means of drawing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere," said Jennifer Smith, the council's executive director. "By supporting our license plate program, you help us continue our work."LiNeBrEaKIf driven 1,000 miles a month -- which the forestry council cites as an average -- even fuel-efficient cars emit 3. 5 tons of carbon annually, Ms. Smith said. That requires 17 mature trees to offset the impact of a single car every year, even more for larger size pickups and sport utility vehicles.LiNeBrEaKEach $35 "Trees Make a Difference" license plate will produce $17. 50 for the council, which will apply the money to continue tree plantings and arboretum programs, she said.LiNeBrEaKBut there is a catch. The council must pre-sell 1,000 license plates before June 30, 2009 in order for the state to manufacture the tags.LiNeBrEaKThe Tennessee General Assembly authorized the council's opportunity to offer the plates. All orders will be fully refunded if 1,000 orders are not received.LiNeBrEaKChattanooga Forester Gene Hyde, who also is chairman of the Chattanooga Green Committee, said he already has ordered his trees tag.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's a great idea," he said. "No. 1, it puts the message out to the general public and raises money for education and tree planting."LiNeBrEaKA single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide at a rate of 48 pounds a year and release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support two human beings, according to Ms. Smith. Trees also reduce the greenhouse effect by shading homes and offices, reducing air conditioning needs up to 30 percent, according to the council and the U.S. Forest Service.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 19, 2008 Friday 	MY WORD  	By Rich Godfrey My Word  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Letters; News; Local  	617 words  	FREMONT WAS chosen in 2008 by Popular Science as one of the 50 greenest cities in the United States.LiNeBrEaKOur city has a strong track record for hillside protection, recycling and promoting energy conservation.LiNeBrEaKBased on the city staff's recent analysis of the Green Task Force (GTF) 20 recommendations, however, we face an uphill challenge in coming years. A very brief summary of the GTF recommendations and the city's subsequent analysis (available at city of Fremont Web site   Nov. 18, City Council report   www.ci.fremont.ca.us) are as follows.LiNeBrEaKMost significantly, city staff chose to increase their commitment to reduce greenhouse gases. Staff chose 25 percent over the Green Task Force target of 15 percent because "several cities within Alameda County are setting a goal of 25 percent." This implies the city is committed to implementing a strategy that can achieve the 25 percent reduction from 2005 levels. LiNeBrEaKStaff supported some but not all of the recommendations for implementation of the climate control process. They didn't support some low-cost recommendations that would allow for substantial greenhouse gas reduction measures. (e.g., "appointing a Transit Development Manager and providing a cost/benefit analysis of the multiple alternate transportation modalities", "make city-owned land that is not currently under development or scheduled for development within the next seven years, available for use as community gardens.")LiNeBrEaKStaff did not adopt a public outreach program to encourage alternative commuting one day per week.LiNeBrEaKWhy should we care? As the presidential election indicated, most Americans are concerned about the impact of global warming.LiNeBrEaKHowever, making substantial changes in how we travel, how we build our houses or how we get our energy can interfere with priority No. 1   the economy.LiNeBrEaKIt may seem unrealistic for Fremont to take on a national and international issue. But there are advantages of continuing to be a leader. As the fourth-largest city in the Bay Area, we're going to be compared with other communities for our success in achieving greenhouse gas reduction.LiNeBrEaKCities of Alameda County have had their carbon dioxide production calculated through an international software methodology produced by ICLEI (International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives), an organization that Fremont has joined.LiNeBrEaKWe produced around 2 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2005. Imagine the difficulty, assuming population increase, of cutting back 500,000 tons a year.LiNeBrEaKIt won't happen by just planting a tree in the backyard, although that's a reasonable start. But if our city does succeed in its goal, we'll have a closer and stronger community, and we'll provide an example for cities around us.LiNeBrEaKIf Fremont hopes to achieve a 25 percent greenhouse gas reduction by 2020, it will need a strategy that it doesn't yet have.LiNeBrEaKThe most promising opportunity is the environmental section of the general plan, slated for completion in 2009. A comprehensive transit plan and more building code requirements are essential.LiNeBrEaKStill, the greatest challenge is whether Fremont citizens care enough to change how they purchase and use energy.LiNeBrEaKSince the municipal government produces only 1 percent of the city's greenhouse gas, our political leaders can only point in the right direction.LiNeBrEaKWhen 2020 arrives, don't plan on driving to awards ceremonies. If we're successful, we could always celebrate at home.LiNeBrEaKRich Godfrey is a surgical oncologist working at Kaiser Fremont and Hayward. He has lived in Fremont for the past 20 years and served on the Downtown Planning Commission, the Fremont Energy Advisory Panel and chaired the City of Fremont Green Task Force. He is a long-term member of Tri-City Ecology.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 19, 2008 Friday 	Editorial: The cleaning of California's air  	MediaNews editorial  	OPINION; Editorials  	585 words  	ON ONE DAY recently, California air regulators ushered in a new climate plan that puts the emissions hammer down on state utilities, refineries and large factories. Then, the next day, the state adopted the toughest diesel emission standards for trucks and buses in the nation. So much for that tough economy standing in the way of cleaning our air.LiNeBrEaKThe state Air Resources Board is now holding the worst polluters accountable for heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions, which if met, will change the way you travel, the way utilities produce power and the way businesses use electricity. The board outlined how individuals and businesses would meet a landmark 2006 law that mandates the state would cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. LiNeBrEaKA total of 31 new rules affecting virtually all facets of life were adopted with the belief that one day Californians will see more efficient public transportation, housing near schools and businesses, and utility rebates for homes that become more energy efficient, among other things.LiNeBrEaKThe air board followed that with new diesel rules where, starting in 2011, accelerates the replacement of thousands of polluting trucks and buses that are not as clean as newer models with federally-mandated emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKObviously, the board felt despite a global financial crisis and a state budget deficit projected to surpass $41 billion by 2010, the process has to begin to make good on the 2006 law called the Global Warming Solutions Act.LiNeBrEaKCalifornians need to understand that their utility bills will rise and the cost of fuel-efficient cars will not be cheap. Odds are good businesses that incur additional costs will likely pass it on to consumers.LiNeBrEaKThe new diesel regulations will cost businesses, school districts and transit agencies $5. 5 billion over 16 years. This alone could close some companies and put more strain on schools and public transportation. We could also see businesses either move from California or resist coming here in light of these new regulations.LiNeBrEaKBut the question is when do we start the process toward cleaning our air? Californians are dying or suffering each day with our bad air.LiNeBrEaKThink about our students; a recent study by the USA Today rated three Berkeley schools located near a steel foundry as being impacted by industrial pollution. A San Leandro school, in the same study, was impacted by a company in San Leandro, a pipe factory in Union City, the steel foundry in Berkeley and a refinery in Rodeo, which clearly shows how widespread the damage these polluters can cause.LiNeBrEaKConsidering that half of all Californians live near a freeway, state officials project the new rules will save 9,400 lives between 2010 and 2025. And that tens of thousands of hospital admissions are linked to air pollution, the state estimates a savings in health care of $68 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe truth is we can't afford not to begin the process, but we need to move forward carefully. The average Californian needs, for instance, to afford cleaner cars or residents will continue to work on their older models.LiNeBrEaKThe average Californian cannot be gouged by utilities who may use these new rules as a way to raise prices. And big polluters who benefit from a cap-and-trade program need to be scrutinized closely so they, indeed, lower emissions in a timely manner.LiNeBrEaKWe need to carry through with these regulations because the air won't clean itself. It's going to be a strain on our economy and we may not meet all of our deadlines, but this is a bold start that needs to happen.

The Denver Post 		December 19, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Letters To The Editor  		Pg. B-10  	977 words  	Interior chief needs to understand public landsLiNeBrEaKThe choice of our senator, Ken Salazar, may seem like a coup coming from Colorado, but as the owners of our public lands, do we want a former rancher managing our public lands?LiNeBrEaKThe post should go to someone who not only knows public land policy, but someone with environmentalist credentials. Ranchers have been the scourge of many environmentalists for their poor use of our natural heritage, the public lands. They over-graze, they feel the land belongs to them, often fencing out the public from public access, and are in constant battle with the BLM and other federal public land management agencies on getting cheaper and more access to the public lands. LiNeBrEaKThe post of the manager of one-fifth of our nation's land should be someone who not only knows the land management issues in the West, but is also an environmental advocate. The management policy for these lands contributes greatly to the global warming issue. We need someone who is concerned about the environment as well as the respectful management of our public lands. Al Gore would have been a better choice.LiNeBrEaKKeith Francis, MorrisonLiNeBrEaKIndian issues should be a priority for SalazarLiNeBrEaKRe: "Knotty issues at Interior put Salazar on tightrope," Dec. 17 news story.LiNeBrEaKYour article omitted any reference to the huge responsibilities and massive failures of Indian programs run by the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaKIndian programs and management of Indian lands and trusts are supposed to be a major part of Interior's work. Interior is the principal agency in government dealing with Indians.LiNeBrEaKYour omission may have clearly identified the major cause of the Indians' problem in this country: We remain invisible. Few people see us and fewer still care about our plight.LiNeBrEaKLiterally hundreds upon hundreds of congressional reports, court opinions and government studies have described the horrific treatment of Indians and their property. The century-old pervasive mismanagement by Interior of Indian trusts has been shown repeatedly in the 12-year-old class action suit filed in the D.C. Federal District Court in 1996. Yet when it comes to describing the role of the Interior Department, even a journal as knowledgeable as The Denver Post fails to put Indians on its radar.LiNeBrEaKIndians are literally dying because of the actions and neglect of Interior. Somebody needs to see them. Somebody needs to care. Surely the next secretary of Interior is one of those people who should have this as a high priority.LiNeBrEaKElousie Cobell, Browning, Mont.LiNeBrEaKThe writer is the lead plaintiff in the Cobell vs. Kempthorne lawsuit filed in D.C. District Court in 1996.LiNeBrEaKCongratulations, but what's up with the hat?LiNeBrEaKFirst of all, I would like to say congratulations to Ken Salazar on his appointment. Second of all, I would like to thank him for nationally embarrassing all Coloradans by wearing his hat on television. While I will profess my ignorance to the etiquette of wearing a cowboy hat, Salazar looked like a fool. It is the equivalent of wearing a baseball cap while giving a speech.

Homan, DenverLiNeBrEaKImagine a government-services holiday Re: "Instead of bailouts, U.S. should try a tax holiday," Dec. 8 letter to the editor.LiNeBrEaKIf we have a two-month tax holiday, as letter-writer Gregory Pitman suggested, we should have a corresponding two-month moratorium on government spending - absolutely no tax funds being spent for two months.LiNeBrEaKThat would mean that if your roads develop potholes or you have broken stoplights, they would not be repaired. RTD light rail and buses are tax-supported and would stop running.LiNeBrEaKSince most schools and libraries are tax-supported, they would close and the kids stay home for two months. If you need a policeman or fireman, don't call for help, because they are tax-supported. We would disband our military since it is also tax-supported.LiNeBrEaKWith no tax-paid judges, close the courts. Also, prison guards would be on a two-month holiday; open the prison doors and let the inmates go their own way. If you have a loved one in tax-supported care centers or hospice care, you will need to take them home and you can change grandpa's diapers.LiNeBrEaKI would suspect paying for all of these services would cost more than the tax savings from a holiday. It would also move us back closer to the cave age.LiNeBrEaKCharles W. Smedly Jr., LittletonLiNeBrEaKConvicted Pakistani has only himself to blameLiNeBrEaKRe: "Seeking justice?

Rashid, a Pakistani citizen, left his family in Lakewood just days after the 9/11 attacks to enter an al-Qaeda training camp along the Afghanistan border.LiNeBrEaKOnce back in Colorado, Mr. Rashid understandably attracted the interest of the FBI-coordinated Joint Terrorism Task Force of local, state and federal law enforcement officials. He later assaulted a juvenile in Arapahoe County in an unconnected incident, was tried and convicted by a jury, and was deported.LiNeBrEaKHaroon Rashid's case is indeed tragic for his family - and for U.S. armed forces battling al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Clinton raised $131M from foreign rulers  		NATIONAL; Pg. A9  	226 words  	WASHINGTON -- Hoping to allay conflict-of-interest concerns as his wife prepares to become secretary of State, former President Bill Clinton on Thursday released a donor list that shows he has raised as much as $131 million from foreign governments -- including Saudia Arabia, Dubai and Norway -- for the William J. Clinton Foundation. LiNeBrEaKMore than 200,000 patrons who have given nearly $500 million since the foundation's inception in 1997 were identified by name only. The disclosure provides a window into a charity that had guarded the identities of its donors -- countries, companies and individuals with vital, sometimes less than altruistic, interests in U.S. foreign policy.LiNeBrEaKClinton's foundation has focused on providing health care, particularly for people with AIDS in underdeveloped countries. It also works to promote economic growth in Africa and Latin America, combat global climate change and deal with such issues as childhood obesity in the United States.LiNeBrEaKMany of the top donors are staunch campaign supporters of Bill and Hillary Clinton. They include Los Angeles entertainment mogul Haim Saban, who is a strong backer of Israel, producer Stephen Bing and Chicago billionaire Fred Eychaner.LiNeBrEaKWhen Barack Obama selected Hillary Clinton to be his secretary of state, he made clear that the former president would have to disclose the foundation donors.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Labor nominee known for energy expertise;  Congresswoman named to Cabinet post; former Dallas mayor picked for trade rep 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A3  	338 words  	WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama was to announce the final selections for his Cabinet today, naming Rep. Hilda Solis, D-Calif., as labor secretary and former Dallas mayor Ron Kirk as U.S. trade representative. The two were to be in Chicago to be formally announced, along with Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., Obama's choice for transportation secretary. LiNeBrEaKWith his selection of Solis, a liberal member of Congress, the president-elect appears to be moving toward his goal of promoting "green-collar jobs" -- those that help promote energy efficiency, through projects such as retrofitting, something Solis has prioritized during her tenure in Congress.LiNeBrEaKSolis is better known for her effort on energy issues than for her work on matters relating to labor; she sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee -- but not the Education and Labor Committee.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, labor leaders embraced the decision to name Solis, whose father was a Teamsters shop steward in Mexico, to the post. Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, praised her selection, saying, "Hilda Solis has never backed down from the good fight to make the American Dream available to all."LiNeBrEaKSolis is the third Hispanic chosen for the Cabinet (in addition to Bill Richardson and Ken Salazar), and the fifth woman (in addition to Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, Janet Napolitano and Lisa Jackson).LiNeBrEaKIn all likelihood, the next labor secretary will spend much time on the Employee Free Choice Act, legislation Obama supported that would make it much easier for unions to organize workers but that business groups adamantly oppose.LiNeBrEaKObama will install Kirk as the steward of his trade policies. The first black mayor of Dallas, Kirk ran unsuccessfully for one of Texas's U.S. Senate seats in 2002. Among his priorities will be following up on Obama's promises on trade, including enforcement of trade agreements.

Khaleej Times (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Myrna Fires Children's Imagination  	Adam Zacharias, Khaleej Times, Dubai, United Arab Emirates  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	334 words  	Dec. 19--DUBAI -- Lebanese film-maker actress Myrna Makaron has high hopes as Children's Cinema programmer for Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF). LiNeBrEaK"I always try to look for not just the story, but for what children can learn," said Myrna. "Not just messages like peace or tolerance, but also about other cultures, countries and languages. This will push children to be more curious and they will start doing their own research."LiNeBrEaKNow in its third year, the section featured five children's movies from around the world, as well as a three-day animation workshop from more than 60 children. Among Myrna's handpicked films is the brand new French animation film Mia et le Migou (Mia and the Migoo), about a little girl who crosses a magical forest looking for her father and encounters numerous strange characters on the way. "It's a wonderful film," said Myrna, "because indirectly the filmmaker is talking about global warming and how to take care of our earth, but in a dreamy, fairytale way."  "A guaranteed tear-jerker is Japanese feature Inu To Watashi No Ju No Yakusoku (10 Promises to my Dog).LiNeBrEaK"It's a wonderful film, but heartbreaking- everybody will cry at the end," Myrna said.  Myrna first entered the world of cinema after studying film-making in Beirut, and later theatre at the Sorbonne in Paris. She is based in Germany, where she is currently writing her first feature film -- a love story with the working title The World is Pink.  Her last short film Berlin Beirut was screened at more than 65 festivals worldwide and won nine awards.LiNeBrEaKadam@khaleejtimes.com	FILM (91%); MOVIE INDUSTRY (90%); ARTS FESTIVALS and EXHIBITIONS (89%); ANIMATION (78%); FESTIVALS (78%); ANIMATED FILMS (78%); FILM GENRES (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (52%); FILM SCHOOLS (73%)  	Arts  		BEIRUT, LEBANON (90%); BERLIN, GERMANY (67%); PARIS, FRANCE (56%) DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (92%); EARTH (72%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (95%); LEBANON (90%); GERMANY (67%); FRANCE (56%); CENTRAL EUROPE (52%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081219-KJ-Myrna-Fires-Children-s-Imagination-1219  	Newspaper  	KJ  	2008    		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (64%)  													
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Utilities seek stimulus money to improve energy efficiency  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	600 words  	WASHINGTON _ A utility association that represents 70 percent of the U.S. power industry joined environmental and energy groups Friday in calling on Congress and the new administration to jump-start the economy by helping Americans save energy.LiNeBrEaKThe groups suggest that any economic recovery package Congress passes early next year include $33 billion that mostly would go to state and local governments for programs such as weatherizing houses, schools, businesses and government buildings. To get some of the money, states would have to agree to follow the lead of Idaho, California and other states and let public utilities make money on efficiency investments.LiNeBrEaK"In our industry, energy efficiency is now a core business," as important as building power plants and transmission lines, said Tom Kuhn, the president of the Edison Electric Institute, an association of the nation's shareholder-owned electric companies, which joined in making the recommendations. LiNeBrEaKEnergy experts say that saving energy is the quickest, cleanest and cheapest way to add to energy supplies and reduce global warming. For utilities, improved efficiency is a less expensive way to make more energy available than building new plants is.LiNeBrEaKKuhn's organization joined with the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council last month in calling for regulatory changes nationwide that would allow utilities to charge ratepayers for investments in energy efficiency. Friday's proposal would require states to make those changes in order to qualify for some of the federal money that the groups want to see spent on energy savings in buildings. Congress is expected to debate a stimulus plan early next month.LiNeBrEaKThe investments that utilities make include such things as installing programmable thermostats or "smart meters" that show residents how much electricity they're using and how much it costs at any given time. Utilities also would be allowed to adjust rates so that they don't lose money from selling less electricity.LiNeBrEaKSome states already have incentives, but Kuhn's group wants them spread nationally so that energy-efficient buildings become as common as recycling bottles and newspapers is today, he said.LiNeBrEaKNew technology makes it possible to save energy without sacrificing comfort, Kuhn said. Utilities, he added, can improve efficiency on such a large scale that the costs are reduced and the savings are significant.LiNeBrEaKThe United States is the largest energy user in the world and the least efficient one among developed countries, said Kateri Callahan of the Alliance to Save Energy.LiNeBrEaKShe said that the recommendations to spend federal money on efficiency projects would create tens of thousands of construction jobs, lower monthly power bills and help build a more sustainable energy system.LiNeBrEaKThey'd also reduce greenhouse gases by the amount that Germany produces annually, said Peter Lehner, the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaKThere's a "tremendous backlog" of energy savings available, and the return on efficiency investments will be paid "many times over" to Americans, Lehner said.LiNeBrEaKEven California, where energy use is 40 percent less than the national average, "has really only begun to scratch the surface of energy efficiency," he said.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Obama picks global warming expert as science adviser  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	659 words  	WASHINGTON _ President-elect Barack Obama's choice of John P. Holdren as his science adviser sends a strong signal that Obama sees global warming as an urgent problem and wants bold suggestions for action.LiNeBrEaKThe Harvard University environmental policy professor has argued that the world already is experiencing dangerous climate change as a result of fossil fuel combustion. He's said there's still time to avert catastrophe, but only with a strong and rapid global effort.LiNeBrEaKAt a recent talk in Washington, Holdren boiled it down to this: LiNeBrEaK"Without energy there is no economy. Without climate there is no environment. Without economy and environment there's no material well-being, there's no civil society, there's no personal or national or international security. And the problem is that the way we've been getting the energy, our economy's need is wrecking the climate that our environment needs. That is the essence of the problem."LiNeBrEaKHe said at the time that he hoped that the next administration would "really break its spear on the question of can we get a sensible climate policy with the Congress and the public behind it" in time to go to the final round of negotiations on a new international treaty late next year "and finally have a voice that is respected by other countries."LiNeBrEaKHarvard issued a news release Friday saying that Obama is expected to announce Holdren's appointment Saturday. The science adviser heads the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President.LiNeBrEaKHoldren has gone to China half a dozen times a year since 1984 to meet with Chinese climate and energy officials. Tsinghua University, one of China's most prestigious schools, named him this year as a three-year nonresident guest professor.LiNeBrEaKHoldren has said he thinks that if the United States leads with emission reduction requirements, China and the rest of the world will follow, because their countries already are suffering from water and agricultural problems.LiNeBrEaKHoldren has also said that scientists need to get better at explaining what's happening with more urgency. The term "global warming" could be part of the problem, he argued, because it implies something uniform, gradual and benign, and it's none of those.LiNeBrEaK"It is rapid compared to the capacity of ecosystems to adjust and, alas, rapid compared to our capacity as a society to adjust," he said.LiNeBrEaK"We should be calling it global climatic disruption."LiNeBrEaKHoldren is a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the director of the science, technology and public policy program at the school's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. He also is the director of the Woods Hole Research Station.LiNeBrEaKHe earned Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in aerospace engineering and plasma physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. He's a specialist in nuclear arms control and nonproliferation as well as global climate change and energy policy.LiNeBrEaK"John is the very model of a policy-relevant scientist," Belfer Center Director Graham Allison said in a statement Friday. "He has a deep understanding of the dynamics of science and technology as drivers of the challenges society faces _ from climate disruption to nuclear danger _ and new opportunities for feasible solutions."LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKHarvard's news release about Holdren: http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/press-releases/holdren-named-obama-s-science-advisorLiNeBrEaKA speech by Holdren, "Meeting the Climate-Change Challenge," given in Washington on Jan. 17: http://www.ncseonline.org/Conference/Chafee08final.pdf	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); SCIENCE POLICY (89%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); EMISSIONS (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); ENGINEERING (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (77%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); RESEARCH (76%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (75%); POWER FAILURES (75%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (73%); COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGIES (71%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN F KENNEDY (50%)  	UNITED STATES (95%); CHINA (93%)  	December 20, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081219-BC-OBAMA-SCIENCE  	Newspaper  	WA  	2008 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   		SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT LLC (54%)  		HARVARD UNIVERSITY (84%)  				WASHINGTON   							
The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Miami Beach planting new trees to restore green canopy: Miami Beach is adding new vegetation to its urban landscape and will have at least 2,500 new shade and palm trees by the end of the year.  	Tania Valdemoro, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	371 words  	Dec. 19--Miami Beach is at the halfway mark of an effort to plant thousands of new trees in city streets, parks and golf courses within four years. LiNeBrEaKBy the end of 2008, Miami Beach will have at least 2,500 new shade and palm trees throughout the city, said Chris Latt, the city's urban forester.LiNeBrEaK"It's a one-time response to all the trees that we've lost from hurricanes Katrina and Wilma," Latt said.LiNeBrEaKThe $1. 5 million reforestation project aims to increase Miami Beach's tree canopy by 5,000 trees by 2010.LiNeBrEaKLatt estimates the city's tree canopy is currently less than 10 percent. Most successful urban areas have tree canopy rates double or triple that figure, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe trees can only be planted on city property, not private land.LiNeBrEaKAnd the Parks and Recreation Department has to wait until the capital improvements program office finishes its water, sewer and sidewalk construction before its workers add trees to neighborhoods. Still, new trees bring a host of environmental benefits to Miami Beach, such as controlling stormwater runoff, adding shade, and absorbing pollutants and carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming, Latt said.LiNeBrEaK"And it makes the city look nice," he said.LiNeBrEaKSo far, city workers have planted at least 50 varieties of trees, such as mahogany, live oak, wild tamarind, royal poincianas, buttonwood and sea grapes.LiNeBrEaKWithin city parks, they have added short leaf and strangler fig trees.LiNeBrEaKPalm trees are part of the game plan too. City workers have planted sable, royal and coconut palms.LiNeBrEaKBut like many other city projects, the tree canopy program is facing cuts.LiNeBrEaKNext year, plantings will be scaled down to 800 trees, compared to 1,400 this year, said Latt.LiNeBrEaKOnce the project is finished, he said he hopes the city can set aside money to maintain the trees. Typically, 2 percent of trees die every year, Latt said.

Unfortunately, there wasn't.LiNeBrEaK I am in the Army Reserves and while not deployed I am a resident of Shorewood. It is very disturbing that, while I am away, the Great Lakes are being ruined by invasive species. I cannot do a whole lot to help from here, but I will send as many e-mails as I need to. LiNeBrEaK I was optimistic over the past several years because it seemed the three rivers in Milwaukee finally were getting cleaned up.

Community columnist Jack Bruss suggested in the Dec. 11 "Inconvenient thoughts on global warming" that this is just an environmental cycle our tiny planet is going through. The hype is all about padding the pockets of an inept government and big business. Could be!LiNeBrEaK Global warming aside, most agree that our tiny planet has finite resources. It takes these resources to support "our puny little human race." Sustainable practices, conservation and developing alternatives for these resources are critical, whether our tiny planet is warming or not. Just think: If we treat our resources responsibly, we won't have to waste any more time discussing global warming - even if it's happening.LiNeBrEaK Steve BurlesonLiNeBrEaK SussexLiNeBrEaKLook at successesLiNeBrEaK I was somewhat bemused after reading comments by community columnist Jack Bruss regarding "possible" global warming and arguing that the government doesn't do anything well enough to help the problem.LiNeBrEaK First, I looked at the glass of water I was drinking, the contents of which are safe, clean and cholera-free in public systems anywhere in the United States, thanks to governmental action. The roads I drive on have standard traffic rules and regulations promoting safe travel; police from our local level to the Justice Department work together to protect the life and liberty of citizens; schools exist throughout the country to ensure basic education with access to higher education; our food supply and the standard measurement of car fuels are inspected for safety; elections ensure that democracy at all levels of government regularly functions, allowing our civil society.LiNeBrEaK Are all of these programs perfect? No, evidently only its critics are.

The other is an overture to conservative Christians who rankles some Obama supporters.LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Rick Warren, who will give the invocation, is one of the most influential pastors in the United States, and a choice that has already caused problems for LiNeBrEaKObama.LiNeBrEaKWarren is a Southern Baptist who holds traditional religious beliefs and endorsed California's Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage. But he also wants to broaden the evangelical agenda to include fighting global warming, poverty and AIDS.LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Joseph Lowery, 87, is considered the dean of the civil rights movement. For the benediction at the Jan. 20 swearing-in, he says he will pray that the "spirit of fellowship and oneness" at the inauguration endures throughout Obama's presidency.LiNeBrEaK"He gets a lot with these choices," said David Domke, author of "The God Strategy: How Religion Became a Political Weapon in America."LiNeBrEaK"Here's a guy who wants to run a progressive administration getting a substantial lift in his wings from the nation's most popular evangelical," Domke said. "But he balances that with Joseph Lowery, who speaks to the more liberal, social justice and African-LiNeBrEaKAmerican heritage."LiNeBrEaKBy picking Warren, Obama is sending another signal, about his willingness to upset liberals by tilting to the center. Gay-rights groups are demanding that Obama rescind the invitation because of Warren's opposition to same-sex marriage.LiNeBrEaK"By inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration, you have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table," said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a letter to the incoming president.LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference Thursday, Obama said he is a "fierce advocate for equality for gay and lesbian Americans." But he said he will build relationships with people of opposing views, and wants his inaugural to reflect that goal.LiNeBrEaK"That dialogue, I think, is part of what my campaign's been all about: That we're not going to agree on every single issue, but what we have to do is to be able to create an atmosphere when we - where we can disagree without being disagreeable and then focus on those things that we hold in common as Americans," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn the past several decades, inaugural prayer has most often been the job of evangelist Billy Graham, who forged relationships with every president from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush. Dubbed "America's pastor," Graham is now 90 and off the public stage.LiNeBrEaKHis son, Franklin, stepped in for his father and gave the invocation at Bush's 2001 swearing-in. Bush's personal pastor, the Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell, an African-American Methodist from Houston, was chosen to give the inaugural benediction twice. Caldwell supported Bush in both his presidential campaigns, then backed Obama in 2008.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama no longer has a personal minister. He resigned his membership at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago following an uproar over incendiary parts of sermons by his longtime pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.LiNeBrEaKObama instead turned to two preachers who could set a tone for his administration.LiNeBrEaK"I'm overwhelmed. I'm very grateful. I'm humbled and honored," Lowery said in a phone interview. "When we worked on the Voting Rights Act in the '60s, we hoped and felt that one day there would be an African-American president. I honestly can say I didn't think I'd live long enough to see it."LiNeBrEaKRICHARD VOGEL/Associated PressLiNeBrEaKAbove, Barack Obama, left, appears with the Rev.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Obama should give the 'all aboard' for a national bullet train network  	By Juleyka Lantigua  	COMMENTARY  	477 words  	President-elect Barack Obama should build a national bullet train network. It is in keeping with his pledge to jolt the economy back to work and to take seriously the crisis of global warming. LiNeBrEaKBullet trains operate at speeds between 150-300 mph. Networks of such trains are commonplace in Japan, France, Germany, Italy, England and many other countries.LiNeBrEaKImagine being able to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco in just two and a half hours. This would be possible with a bullet train.LiNeBrEaKHigh-speed railway systems bring enormous economic, social and environmental benefits.LiNeBrEaKEconomically, a coast-to-coast high-speed rail network would put Americans back to work.LiNeBrEaKIn California alone, planners estimate creating nearly 160,000 construction-related jobs to plan, design and build the system, with an additional 450,000 permanent jobs by 2035. Overall, the state anticipates more than $1 billion in annual revenue from the rail system.LiNeBrEaKWith the system in place, it would be cheaper and easier to travel between major cities. Professionals could avoid airport hassles. Families could afford vacations _ and without enduring countless hours in crammed vehicles.LiNeBrEaKBullet trains significantly improve the environment. Some can carry more than 1,300 passengers, so such trains could remove hundreds of thousands of cars per year from highways, thereby reducing the toxins cars release into the air. California officials project that building a network in their state would save 12. 7 million barrels of oil per year by 2030, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 12 billion pounds per year.LiNeBrEaK"The choices that we make will help determine the type of country and world we leave to our children and grandchildren," Obama said recently.LiNeBrEaKEstablishing a national high-speed passenger train service would go a long way toward ensuring a positive legacy.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKJuleyka Lantigua is a writer for Progressive Media Project, a source of liberal commentary on domestic and international issues; it is affiliated with The Progressive magazine.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	It's our duty to help poor nations clean up  	By A. James Barnes  	COMMENTARY  	781 words  	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. _ The United States and other highly developed nations should provide financial and technological assistance to China and other developing countries to facilitate their use of clean and sustainable energy technologies.LiNeBrEaKIdeally, such assistance would be structured as part of an agreement where all the major developed and developing countries agree to cap and then reduce their emission of greenhouse gasses. But, we should not delay such assistance pending a comprehensive global agreement; it is in our national economic interest as well as our national security interest to provide it _ and we have a moral imperative to do so as well.LiNeBrEaKAs the Council on Foreign Relations notes, "Unchecked climate change is poised to have wide-ranging and potentially disastrous effects over time on human welfare, sensitive ecosystems and international security." We should take reasonable measures within our control to address this prospect, even if at times it may allow others to "free ride." LiNeBrEaKForty percent of the carbon dioxide currently in the atmosphere came from the United States and Western Europe _ and will remain there for 100 years. Last year China is thought to have overtaken the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases _ but the Chinese still emit about one-fourth as much carbon per person as the typical American. Life on earth as we know it cannot be sustained if going forward the rest of the world even approaches our emission levels.LiNeBrEaKWe need a technological revolution to avert the dangers of long-term global warming. Our resources and RandD capabilities are crucial to creating that revolution. We should involve the developing world in demonstration projects _ and the development of cost-effective options will speed their acceptance/utilization of such technologies and willingness to agree to limits those technologies will make possible.LiNeBrEaKThe United States faces the prospect of having to invest billions of dollars to adapt to the climate change that will take place. It can be more cost effective to help other countries avoid contributing to the buildup of greenhouse gasses that will occur if they use dirty, inefficient or unsustainable technologies. As the old saw goes _ "an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure." And, increasing the global demand for low-carbon technologies that we develop can boost jobs in this country.LiNeBrEaKOur vulnerability to global climate change pales in comparison with those faced in the equatorial regions and the southern hemisphere.LiNeBrEaKExtreme weather events, such as floods, cyclones and droughts, along with sea level rise, have the potential to create sustained human tragedy and political instability. We inevitably will have to step forward to deal with the humanitarian and national security aspects of such impacts. We should take reasonable steps now to try to avoid or minimize the risks of such events _ or to reduce their severity _ rather than waiting to cope with the human tragedies after they occur.LiNeBrEaKThe United States is the most prosperous country in the world, we generate far more carbon per person than most, that carbon will remain in the atmosphere for many years, and its effects will be very disproportionally felt in other countries.LiNeBrEaKYet, in recent years we have taken the position that we don't want to reduce our carbon footprint because it might impose unacceptable costs and restraints on our economy.LiNeBrEaKHow can we in good conscience ask poorer countries to restrain their hopes for economic development and to avoid coming up to our per capita levels of carbon emission _ and not be willing to help? That is morally indefensible.LiNeBrEaKAs the old Indian saying goes _ the earth is not inherited from our fathers but is borrowed from our children. We should act responsibly to pass a viable earth on to all the children of the world.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKA.

The New York Times 		December 19, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	E.P.A. Ruling Could Speed Up Approval of Coal Plants  	By MATTHEW L. WALD and FELICITY BARRINGER  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2  	696 words  	Officials weighing federal applications by utilities to build new coal-fired power plants cannot consider their greenhouse gas output, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency ruled late Thursday. Some environmentalists fear the decision will clear the way for the approval of several such plants in the last days of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK  The ruling, by Stephen L. Johnson, the administrator, responds to a decision made last month by the Environmental Appeals Board, a panel within the E.P.A.,  that had blocked the construction of a small new plant on the site of an existing power plant, Bonanza, on Ute tribal land in eastern Utah.  LiNeBrEaK  The Supreme Court ruled last year that the agency could regulate carbon dioxide, the most prevalent global warming gas, under existing law. The agency already requires some power plants to track how much carbon dioxide they emit. LiNeBrEaK  But a memorandum issued by Mr. Johnson late Thursday puts the agency on record saying that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant to be regulated when approving power plants. He cited ''sound policy considerations.''LiNeBrEaK  His said in the memorandum that each year, about 275 new sources of pollution, from power plants to apartment buildings, must obtain permits saying that they will not significantly decrease air quality. Mr. Johnson wrote that the decision he overruled had confused the federal and state agencies that issue these permits. LiNeBrEaK  ''Given the confusion,'' the memorandum said, ''the best path forward is to establish a clear interpretation'' of what can be considered a pollutant to be regulated. LiNeBrEaK  ''The current concerns over global climate change should not drive E.P.A. into adopting an unworkable policy of requiring emission controls'' in these cases, he said.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Johnson  rejected a new line of attack by environmental groups. In the wake of the Bush administration's failure to decide if carbon dioxide could be regulated under existing laws, environmental groups pursued a new strategy in fighting proposed coal plants like the one in Utah.LiNeBrEaK  They asserted that because carbon dioxide must already be monitored under federal laws, that monitoring is tantamount to regulation. Therefore, they argued, its impact must be considered before new plants are approved. Last month the appeals board said the argument could be used, but was not required. On Thursday the administrator overruled the board. He said that simple monitoring cannot be considered regulation.LiNeBrEaK  John Walke, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement, ''It's a marvel to behold an E.P.A. action that so utterly disdains global warming responsibility and disdains the law at the same time.''LiNeBrEaK  Jeff Holmstead, a former E.P.A. official who now works with the Electrical Liability Coordinating Council, said the Johnson memo ensured that the incoming Obama administration had increased freedom to make its decisions on the status of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK  ''I think if you're Lisa Jackson,'' whom Obama has chosen as Mr. Johnson's successor, ''you have to be pretty grateful,'' he said. ''She has the opportunity to go through a rule-making and see how to deal'' with the issue.LiNeBrEaK  Vickie Patton, deputy general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, estimated that as much as 8,000 megawatts of new coal-fired power plants could win swifter approval as a result of the ruling.LiNeBrEaK  Opponents of coal plants list several  in the late stages of the approval process that could be affected by the decision Thursday. LiNeBrEaK  ''There are a bunch that they are going to argue now don't have to consider carbon dioxide, and which will be beyond the reach of the incoming Obama administration,'' said Bruce Nilles, director of the anticoal campaign at the Sierra Club, an environmental group. LiNeBrEaK  He listed a proposed $1. 25 billion plant, called Pee Dee, that Santee Cooper, a South Carolina utility, is seeking to build and that won state approval on Tuesday; a project in Rogers City, Mich., that the Wolverine Power Cooperative Electric is seeking to build; and another project in Utah, a small plant sought by Consolidated Energy in Davis County. That one would run on petroleum coke, which is also carbon-rich.

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., Ernest Jasmin column: Critic's picks: Top 10 albums of 2008  	Ernest Jasmin, The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	868 words  	Dec. 19--Santa ain't the only guy with a list he needs to check once or twice around this time or year. We critics are pretty busy, too, as we rank the best and worst in pop music.LiNeBrEaKAnd my last two columns of 2008 will be dedicated to such ranking. And what's more, you'll be able to go online to check out a couple of new lists for this year. LiNeBrEaKI'm posting an amended 2007 list, something I've been thinking of doing for a while since (a) some albums stand the test of time better than others, after the initial excitement wears off, and (b) I can't stay on top of every release, and every year there are great albums I hear too late to add to my favorites list. Mark Lanegan Band's "Bubblegum," C.S.S.'s "Cansei de Ser Sexy" and the Hold Steady's "Boys and Girls in America" come to mind.LiNeBrEaKAlso, I'll be posting the biggest Critic's iPod installment of the year, with sound bites and YouTube clips from 50 songs from 50 artists that made up my 2008 soundtrack.LiNeBrEaKBut before you move on to all of that, check out my 10 favorite albums of '08:LiNeBrEaK1. "Modern Guilt," Beck: Beck and producer Brian "Dangermouse" Burton team up for a lean 33 minutes that celebrates their love of both '60s pop and hip-hop. Now middle-age and obviously reflecting on his own mortality, the normally quirky Beckster delivers some of his darkest lyrics to date -- darker even than 2002's melancholy masterpiece "Sea Change."LiNeBrEaKHe channels new millennial dread on the title track, a bluesy nod to the Doors' "People Are Strange." He makes global climatic catastrophe sound like a rowdy go-go party on the infectious "Gamma Ray" and even briefly ponders suicide on weepy album closer "Volcano."LiNeBrEaKBut the haunting high point is psych-rock epic "Chemtrails," with Beck donning an eerie falsetto as he sings about seas of humanity "swallowed by evil." Long-time collaborator Joey Waronker puts on one hell of a drum clinic.LiNeBrEaKThis was a killer walk-off number when Beck headlined at Bumbershoot this year.LiNeBrEaK2. "London Zoo," The Bug: England's Kevin "The Bug" Martin has been one of my favorite electronic producers for a while, thanks to the creepy, atmospheric dub and hip-hop experiments he's put out with one of his other projects, Techno Animal.LiNeBrEaKAnd for this, the first album recorded under the Bug moniker in five years, he's recruited a gang of Caribbean-inflected vocalists -- the likes of Ricky Ranking, Spaceape and Warrior Queen -- to act as tour guides for a psychotropic journey through London's grimier side.LiNeBrEaK3. "Vampire Weekend," Vampire Weekend: I was suspicious of this New York band's massively hyped debut album in early '08, but couldn't long resist the sunny, Afro-pop influenced vibe.LiNeBrEaKFrontman Ezra Koenig sounds kind of like a young Sting, minus the pretentious Nabokov references. OK, they've got a song called "Oxford Comma," which is a little pretentious, I guess. But is that one of the smartest, catchiest pop songs of the decade or what?LiNeBrEaK4. "Third," Portishead: It took 11 years for this Bristol, England, band to get around to album No. 3. Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow and company eschew the spy-movie samples, hazy production and hip-hop scratches that got them branded the world's greatest "trip-hop" band for fresh, foreboding grooves. This could have been No. 1 with a shorter edit of repetitive lead single "Machine Gun," and if that ukulele track "Still Waters" weren't such a jarring mismatch.LiNeBrEaK5. "Feed the Animals," Girl Talk: Ever wonder what it might sound like if Diana Ross, Metallica, the Carpenters, Lil Mama and Ol' Dirty Bastard got together for a jam session? Probably not, because you're not insane. Besides, you don't have to guess thanks to "Like This," my favorite cut from Greg "Girl Talk" Gillis' mash-up masterpiece.LiNeBrEaKBut with an album that reportedly features hundreds of unauthorized samples, the countdown has begun for this guy getting sued into permanent poverty.LiNeBrEaK6. "Dear Science," TV on the Radio: TVOTR throws a big, arty dance party, makes cryptic political statements on yet another ambitious offering.LiNeBrEaK7. "Santogold," Santogold: Santi White's debut features a compelling dance sound that's part new wave, dub and hip-hop.LiNeBrEaK8. "The Slip," Nine Inch Nails: Trent Reznor may have given this one away for free, but with tracks like "Echoplex," "Lights in the Sky" and "Demon Seed" in the mix, this one was worth the investment once the limited edition CD/DVD set came out.LiNeBrEaK9. "Fleet Foxes," Fleet Foxes: Euphoric vocal harmonies and a shimmery, reverb-drenched sound lift this Seattle band's debut above most of the trendy alt-country pack.LiNeBrEaK10. "Narrow Stairs," Death Cab for Cutie: Death Cab takes risks on the new disc, but score big with epic, eight-minute lead single "I Will Possess Your Heart," and "Every Breath You Take" style stalker song for a new generation.LiNeBrEaKErnest Jasmin: 253-274-7389	RANKINGS (90%); MUSIC (89%); POP and ROCK (89%); MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS (77%); HIP HOP CULTURE (77%); RAP MUSIC (77%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (76%); ARTISTS and PERFORMERS (72%); CLIMATE CHANGE (67%); COMPUTER and ELECTRONICS MFG (64%); MILLENNIUM (62%); SINGERS and MUSICIANS (77%)  	Entertainment  		LONDON, ENGLAND (51%) WASHINGTON, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%); CARIBBEAN ISLANDS (55%); ENGLAND (51%); UNITED KINGDOM (51%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081219-TC-The-News-Tribune-Tacoma-Wash-Ernest-Jasmin-column-1219  	Newspaper  	TC  	2008 The News Tribune   	NASDAQ-NMS:GOOG  														
The Oakland Tribune (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Oakland takes aim at restoring local economy  	Kamika Dunlap, The Oakland Tribune, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1055 words  	Dec. 19--OAKLAND -- Eleven months ago, Pat King was a successful loan officer making about $10,000 a month. Today, the economic crisis has left the unemployed single mother living on pennies to raise her 17-year-old son in West Oakland.LiNeBrEaK"I saw it coming," said King, 45. "Loans were flying out the air, and people could put anything on paper. Then slowly loans that I was trying to get approved started to be more difficult, and the industry began to put in more restrictions." LiNeBrEaKKing is among scores of Oakland residents who are struggling, out of work or in serious financial trouble. She said she is "just hanging on day by day" and not living out the American dream.LiNeBrEaKThrough the CalWorks program, King receives temporary financial assistance and employment-focused services based on state guidelines for her income, property and family size.LiNeBrEaKSo far this year, nearly 2 million Americans have lost their jobs. Unemployment is at 7. 1 percent in Alameda County and 8 percent statewide.LiNeBrEaKIn the shadow of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, city officials and community leaders have banded together. They say it will take a strong local effort to support President-elect Barack Obama's plan for a major economic recovery and jobs-creation package.LiNeBrEaK"We need a game-changing strategy," Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums said Thursday at City Hall. He was joined by Councilmember Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary), Councilmember-elect RebeccaLiNeBrEaKKaplan, the Urban Strategies Council and ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.LiNeBrEaKThey gathered as a part of a national coalition to launch the "Jobs and Economic Recovery Now!" campaign. The economic recovery plan is the largest U.S. public works program since the interstate highway system and includes projects to repair bridges, roads, as well as create green-collar jobs to reduce energy and global warming emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The Green Jobs Core was pioneered in Oakland to fight poverty and pollution," Dellums said. "We can help lead the country in a new direction and open up a level of employment that's extraordinary."LiNeBrEaKThe group agreed that saving the economy and the environment are equally important and urged residents to create the "change they want to see locally."LiNeBrEaKDellums, who was appointed Thursday to serve on the United States Conference of Mayors' Working Group on the MainStreet Economic Recovery Plan, said the panel will be meeting with Obama's economic team to discuss how to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, grass-roots groups, including the Alameda County Community Asset Network, are working in conjunction with "Bank on California," a new initiative by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and former President Bill Clinton to help low-income families build savings.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is to help the "unbanked," many of whom are poor or immigrants, gain access to banking services including prepaid debit cards, penalty-free fee accounts, credit repair services and financial coaching and counseling.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the Brookings Institution, 11 percent of California's 25 million residents do not have checking or savings accounts. About 21 percent of African-American households and 24 percent of Latino households do not have a bank account. The goal of the program is to create 100,000 accounts in two years among residents in San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and Fresno.LiNeBrEaKJohn Brauer is a founding member of the asset network and executive director of the Workforce Collaborative. The Oakland-based nonprofit provides job readiness and placement services to people with little work history or who face barriers to employment, including homelessness or records of incarceration.LiNeBrEaK"In this economy, the folks we serve are the last hired and the first fired," Brauer said. "I think people now more so than ever are looking for training as a necessity to compete better."LiNeBrEaKCommunity and city leaders say addressing the economic recession and neighborhoods impacted by the foreclosure crisis will take a multilayered strategy. ACORN has teamed with the Urban Strategies Council, a nonprofit community building and advocacy agency, to restore blighted neighborhoods and redevelop vacant residential properties.LiNeBrEaKThrough a community land trust, they plan to purchase and rehabilitate 200 bank-owned properties in Oakland and sell the houses -- but not the land -- at low-interest loans to residents. By maintaining ownership of the land, the land trust could keep the prices of the homes affordable and gain income as a trust from the appreciation of the land.LiNeBrEaKAndy Nelsen, director of Economic Opportunity Programs at the Urban Strategies Council, said the public-private partnership will help create so-called "green-collar" construction jobs and neighborhood stability and stimulate the local economy.LiNeBrEaK"Banks and lenders have left us with a real mess to be cleaned up in urban areas," he said. "But a stimulus package gives us a chance to turn this into a real opportunity."LiNeBrEaKReach Kamika Dunlap at 510-208-6448 or kdunlap@bayareanewsgroup.comLiNeBrEaKShort on cashLiNeBrEaK-- About one in four Bay Area households, orLiNeBrEaK24. 7 percent, has incomes too low to meet basic needs.LiNeBrEaK-- One in four people older than age 15 in Alameda County don't have bank accounts or rely on check-cashing services.LiNeBrEaK--In Alameda County in 2006, 30 percent of tax filers at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites had no checking account and 59 percent had no savings account.

NOAA's many divisions conduct the nation's study of oceans, weather and global warming.LiNeBrEaKThose divisions include the National Ocean Service, National Weather Service and National Marine Fisheries Service, which has jurisdiction over ocean fishing and is charged with protecting imperiled Northwest salmon and steelhead.LiNeBrEaKThe fisheries service's responsibility for salmon gives it a dominant say over activities that affect Northwest fish, from logging to the operation of hydroelectric dams.LiNeBrEaKLubchenco has been advising Obama's transition team on science issues, said Jack Barth, another OSU professor. Lubchenco had been on a trip to Australia in recent weeks, but she interrupted her travels there Thursday to head to Chicago, where Obama is announcing his appointments.LiNeBrEaK"I've always been amazed by her ability to see the big picture and cut to the chase," Barth said. "She's going to be a very strong voice for oceanic and atmospheric science and marine ecology."LiNeBrEaKLubchenco has actively encouraged fellow scientists to better communicate their research to the public and has urged controls on greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. She helped lead a panel created by Gov. Ted Kulongoski to develop an Oregon strategy on climate change.LiNeBrEaKJohn Byrne, a former OSU president who headed NOAA during the Reagan administration, learned of Lubchenco's selection Thursday and said she is an ideal pick. "It's been great for Oregon State to have her here, and it's a big kudo for Jane and for Oregon State," Byrne said.LiNeBrEaKA former president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Ecological Society of America, Lubchenco has won many of the top awards in her field, including a so-called genius MacArthur Fellowship. She is widely respected within the science community and has long spoken strongly of the need to protect marine ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKBut her advocacy of setting aside marine reserves has made her something of a lightning rod in some parts of Oregon. Coastal communities, for instance, are suspicious that such reserves will close off important fishing grounds.LiNeBrEaK"It's somewhat disappointing that they are not getting someone who's a little bit better versed in fisheries," said Rod Moore, executive director of the West Coast Seafood Processors Association in Portland. While it's positive to have an Oregonian so high in the Obama administration, he said, "I hope she remembers there's a seafood industry that's important to our coastal economy."LiNeBrEaKMore say by scientists?LiNeBrEaKHowever, environmental and ocean protection groups quickly sent out press releases Thursday praising Lubchenco's appointment. They characterized her as being perhaps the strongest conservation voice appointed to a leadership position in the new administration.LiNeBrEaKHer selection suggests that the new administration sees scientists playing a direct role in the development of national policies on key environmental issues such as global warming.LiNeBrEaK"She is one of those rare people who can sit at the intersection of science and policy," said David Festa, vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, on which Lubchenco is vice chair of the Board of Trustees. "That's even more important right now because of the magnitude of the challenges facing us."LiNeBrEaKShe has warned of the collapse of many fisheries, at least in part because of overfishing.LiNeBrEaK"The awakening view is that living oceans are both more valuable as well as more vulnerable than we have commonly appreciated," she told the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.LiNeBrEaKLubchenco testified before Congress earlier this year, pushing for public education and more funding for research. She also said the nation must reduce greenhouse gas emissions while making protection of ocean ecosystems one of its highest priorities.LiNeBrEaK"Dead zones" researchLiNeBrEaKShe has been closely involved in OSU research into unusual "dead zones" that have appeared off the Oregon Coast in recent summers, suffocating marine life such as crabs and starfish. OSU scientists have tied the dead zones to unusual weather patterns that they say may be related to global warming.LiNeBrEaKHowever, researchers had a difficult time persuading NOAA agencies to join research into the dead zones, Barth said. "That's something she could help with immediately," he said.LiNeBrEaKLubchenco has also warned that greenhouse gases are turning the ocean more acid, which could undermine the marine food chain by making it impossible for many ocean creatures to build their shells.LiNeBrEaK"Climate-related stresses compound many previously existing stresses on ocean ecosystems," Lubchenco told Congress. "If society wishes to continue to benefit from the bounty and the beauty of the oceans, it will need to implement new and significantly more effective policies than currently exist."LiNeBrEaKMichael Milstein: 503-294-7689; michaelmilstein@news.oregonian.com	FISHERIES (92%); OCEANOGRAPHY (91%); WEATHER (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); OCEANS (89%); RESEARCH (89%); SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (78%); SCIENCE POLICY (78%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (78%); METEOROLOGY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); JURISDICTION (73%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (64%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (64%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (52%); DAMS and RESERVOIRS (50%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); TED KULONGOSKI (52%)  	OREGON, USA (98%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	December 20, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  				NATIONAL OCEANIC and ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (57%)  											
Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	Obama's Cabinet should help the nation kick bad energy habits  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	620 words  	The following editorial appeared in the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, Dec. 18:LiNeBrEaKDominated by lobbyists for the oil industry, the task force Vice President Dick Cheney convened early in the Bush presidency laid the groundwork for the administration's dangerously antiquated approach to meeting the nation's energy needs.LiNeBrEaKIts core recommendation _ to open more federal land to oil, coal and natural-gas development _ largely led officials for the next eight years to ignore conservation efforts and the need to develop clean, alternative energy. LiNeBrEaKCarbon emissions that cause global warming rose. Serious efforts at curbing the nation's reliance on fossil fuels largely froze. And good-faith efforts at convincing policy makers of the error of their ways were ignored or silenced.LiNeBrEaKFinally, though, the winds are changing. This week, President-elect Barack Obama named his top energy and environmental team. And fortunately, its members signaled their intention to reshape the nation's energy market so it can kick its dependence on unstable, U.S.-hating, oil-rich countries. They spoke of the urgency to invest in green technology and infrastructure projects to help rejuvenate the economy. And they promised that science _ not political expediency _ will drive their efforts.LiNeBrEaKWhat a relief. A NASA scientist who sounded warnings about climate change got censured by the Bush administration. Pleas from 60 leading researchers asking the administration to stop suppressing scientific knowledge for political purposes went nowhere.LiNeBrEaKScience, not politics, should drive the nation's energy policy under Nobel-prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, tapped by Obama to lead the Department of Energy. As director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Chu has argued for controlling greenhouse-gas emissions. He researched solar and biofuel alternatives.LiNeBrEaKObama's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson, helped New Jersey limit carbon emissions in her role as that state's environmental regulator. She's an engineer.LiNeBrEaKNancy Sutley, selected to steer the White House Council on Environmental Quality, led efforts to improve water and air quality as Los Angeles' top energy and environment official.LiNeBrEaKAnd Carol Browner, who fought air pollution as EPA chief in the Clinton administration, should help Obama steer his agenda through a political minefield as his energy czar.LiNeBrEaKBut there's the rub for the incoming administration. No one questions its earnestness in wanting to help reduce carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050; its wanting to train millions of workers to install solar panels and build rail systems and plug-in hybrid cars; and its wish to pass green legislation that will show the world the U.S. is ready to lead on reducing carbon emissions globally.LiNeBrEaKBut most everyone in Washington knows the breadth of its ambition will trigger explosions, planted by short-sighted businesses and government opponents wary of what it will do to their profits and long-held positions of power. Its cost and complexity also should present challenges.LiNeBrEaKIt will fall to Browner _ an old hand at navigating tripwires from her days running Florida's Department of Environmental Regulation _ Obama and the rest of his team to get Washington to accept enough of their science-driven agenda to make a difference.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Sentinel on the World Wide Web at http://www.orlandosentinel.com.

The Paducah Sun (Kentucky)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Ice Capade  	The Paducah Sun, Ky.  	COMMENTARY  	813 words  	Dec. 19--Picture this: With the banquet hall uncomfortably warm, servers place glasses of ice water, filled to the brim, on the tables before all the delegates at the global warming conference. But most of the delegates are too mesmerized by the speaker to notice.LiNeBrEaKThe climate scientist on the dais reveals how rapidly Arctic ice is melting, predicting this will cause ocean levels to rise, flooding coastal cities. LiNeBrEaKBut the proof that it will never happen is right before their eyes. As the warm temperature in the hall melts the ice in the glasses, no water overflows onto the table.LiNeBrEaK"It's called the Archimedes principle," said Dr. James O'Brien, professor of meteorology and oceanography at Florida State University, in an interview this week with Fox News.LiNeBrEaKA research scientist with 40 years' experience, O'Brien calls himself a "green" and thinks it is plausible that human activity can affect climate. But he says the warnings of rising sea levels are nothing more than a "major scare tactic used by the global warming people."LiNeBrEaK"I call it a fourth grade science experiment. Take a glass, put some ice in it. Put water in it. Mark level where water is. Let it melt. After the ice melts, the sea level didn't go up in your glass of water."LiNeBrEaKThe professor was responding to a Monday editorial disguised as a scientific report by Associated Press "science writer" Seth Borenstein. The article, beneath the alarmist headline "Obama left with little time to curb global warming," exposes the group-think that pervades the mainstream media, as well as an embarrassing loss of journalistic objectivity.LiNeBrEaKTake this morsel: Borenstein refers to global warming as "a ticking time bomb that President-elect Barack Obama can't avoid."LiNeBrEaKThe science writer, whatever that is, was just getting warmed up. "The 10 hottest years on record have occurred since Clinton's second inauguration (1996). Global warming is accelerating. Time is close to running out, and Obama knows it."LiNeBrEaKActually, since 1998, the second warmest year in the century and a half that records have been kept, global temperatures have cooled. Keep up, man.LiNeBrEaKBorenstein quotes President-elect Obama after a meeting with global warming guru Al Gore: "The time for delay is over; the time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it must be dealt with in a serious way."LiNeBrEaKMemo to Barack: A few hundred scientists around the globe have been telling us something entirely different. Dr. O'Brien, for example. And Dr. David Deming, geologist and geophysicist at the University of Oklahoma. The iconoclast professor, upon reading the AP article, said, "If the issues weren't so serious and the ramifications so profound, I would have to laugh at it."LiNeBrEaKHe added, "What he's doing here is he's writing a polemic and reporting it as fact, and that's not right. It's not reporting. It's propaganda."LiNeBrEaKSo what are the facts? "The mean global temperature, at least measured by satellite, is now the same as it was in the year 1980," Dr. Deming said. "Sea ice globally is also the same as it was in 1980."LiNeBrEaKFox News also quoted Dr. Michael R. Fox, nuclear scientist and chemistry professor at the University of Idaho. "These kinds of temperatures cycle up and down and have been doing so for millions of years," he said. "It's silly to lay it all on man-made carbon dioxide." He said El Nino was responsible for the high global temperatures of 1998, and other natural phenomena -- suns spots, solar winds, solar irradiation -- may affect temperatures on earth.LiNeBrEaKOf AP writer Borenstein, Dr. Fox said, "One guy like him can be very destructive and alarming." Not to mention embarrassing for the journalism profession.LiNeBrEaKOne might ask how it is that, if the Arctic ice is melting so much faster than previously predicted, we aren't seeing the precipitous rise in ocean levels that Al Gore won an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize warning us about.LiNeBrEaKThe answer is found in Dr. O'Brien's fourth grade science experiment: "When the Arctic Ocean melts, it never raises sea level because floating ice is floating ice, because it's displacing water. When the ice melts, the sea level actually goes down."LiNeBrEaKLast June, candidate Barack Obama predicted that humankind would look back on his election as "the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal."LiNeBrEaKThe gullible megalomaniac was so wrong that he may have been right after all.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   Final Edition; All Editions	Global warming's effect on region likely to worsen, group predicts  	Michael Scott, Plain Dealer Reporter  	METRO; Pg. B2  	485 words  	ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKWe may not have melting icecaps on Lake Erie or stranded polar bears in Sandusky, but global warming is already adversely affecting Ohio, and it's going to get worse. LiNeBrEaKThat's the opinion of the advocacy group Environment Ohio, which held simultaneous news conferences Wednesday in Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo and Cincinnati to release its report: "What's at Stake: How Global Warming Threatens the Buckeye State."LiNeBrEaKThe 34-page report, available at environmentohio.org, says that regional changes from an altered global climate could in some way affect the jobs of more than 1. 9 million people in Ohio - representing nearly $127 billion of the state's economy - if warming continues unabated through 2050.LiNeBrEaKMost climate scientists agree that global surface and water temperatures are generally increasing, especially since the advent of the industrial age, because of the emission and atmospheric accumulation of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. Ohio is ranked fourth in the United States for carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKEspecially threatened would be the Great Lakes shipping industry (146,000 jobs and a value of $16 billion) because lake lev- els are already falling.LiNeBrEaKScientists project that Lake Erie could drop 3 to 7 feet over the next 30 years because warmer water evaporates more easily and ice cover diminishes during winter.LiNeBrEaKThat could lessen the amount of raw material that lake freighters can carry and make dredging of Lake Erie harbors critical.LiNeBrEaKThe report includes maps that project an altered shoreline for Sandusky Bay and Toledo.LiNeBrEaKBut the state's recreation (hunting and fishing, which generates 48,000 jobs and $2. 9 billion in revenue), farming (1. 6 million jobs and $93 billion) and timber (119,000 jobs and $15 billion) industries are also likely to suffer from the results of even a slightly warmer climate, the report said.LiNeBrEaKWhy?LiNeBrEaKBecause for hunters and anglers, a warming climate could eventually lead to the disappearance of certain favored animal and fish species; for farmers, it could lead to a water crunch and more battles against insects as they emerge sooner in the spring; and for the timber industry, it could result in hardwoods gradually moving north and being replaced by softer pine and other trees.LiNeBrEaKThe state is also likely to face the contrast of more drought and flooding from more severe storms. Further, health issues will increase as heat stress and asthma worsen.LiNeBrEaKBut the group and other partners at the news conferences said they also didn't want to dwell only on the bad news.LiNeBrEaK"We're not trying to come off all gloom and doom but make the case that we need to invest money to make money in a new, green economy," Marnie Urso of Audubon Ohio said.LiNeBrEaKAnd Environment Ohio spokeswoman Michele Fisher said: "We're calling on federal and state officials and all of us to do what we can to prevent the worst effects of climate change now - before the drastic changes come later."

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   All Editions	Carbon offsets: A great, green holiday gift  	By JAMES M. O'NEILL, STAFF WRITER, North Jersey Media Group  	LOCAL; Pg. L03  	702 words  	So you?re still stumped about what to give the people on your Christmas gift list who already have everything? If they?re concerned about the environment, you could buy them carbon offsets.LiNeBrEaKOrganizations across the country that sell carbon offsets say they?re seeing increased demand over last year for the offsets as gifts, despite the bad economy. Some of the providers, such as San Francisco-based TerraPass, have added marketing gimmicks, such as chocolate bars to go along with the offsets.LiNeBrEaKThe organizations sell offsets at a going rate of about $10 per ton of carbon emissions, then take that money and invest it in projects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, one of the significant contributors to global warming. LiNeBrEaK* Maryland-based Carbonfund.org, for instance, invests in reforestation projects in Louisiana, Kansas, Nicaragua and China. It also supports the IdleAire, Inc. Truck Stop Electrification project, which reduces tailpipe emissions from 18-wheelers that transport consumer goods. A device affixed to truck cabs eliminates the need to keep the engine running for power during rest stops.LiNeBrEaK* TerraPass invests in projects that reduce methane, another greenhouse gas, such as the construction of anaerobic digesters on dairy farms to process the methane from cow dung and feed it into generators that produce electricity for the farms.LiNeBrEaK* NativeEnergy in Vermont invests in Native American, farmer-owned renewable energy projects, such as wind turbines in Native Alaskan villages.LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Fletcher Harper said he?s giving out several carbon offsets as gifts this Christmas, 15 to 20 tons in all. He?s done it before. Harper is the Episcopal priest who runs GreenFaith, a New Brunswick-based interfaith group that helps religious organizations use energy from renewable sources. When he gave carbon offsets to his mother and brother last year, they opened the presents and asked, "What?s this?"LiNeBrEaK"I expected that kind of reaction, and that was fine because I wanted to use the gifts as a way to explain the whole concept of carbon offsets," Harper said. "People are intrigued by the gift. It makes them feel invested in the whole issue of global warming through a gift made out of love."LiNeBrEaKThose who buy offsets as gifts tend to be people with college degrees and who already trend green in their life choices, whether driving a hybrid car or lobbying their congressman on environmental issues, said Erik Blachford, CEO of TerraPass.LiNeBrEaKCarbonfund.org estimates that the average American?s activities each year produce about 24 tons? worth of carbon emissions. The organizations selling offsets have packaged their products in various combinations. Some offer sales in 1-ton increments for $10 each. Others have packages that cover the carbon emissions produced by driving one?s car or heating and lighting one?s home. They also provide "carbon calculators" on their Web site so purchasers can figure out emissions based on their particular car model, or the miles traveled on a plane flight.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Defense Fund recently created a Web site that lists the major carbon offset suppliers and some of the projects they?re investing in. The Web address is carbonoffsetlist.org.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists caution that one should ask about the projects an organization invests in before buying offsets. "Real offsets are projects that would not have happened otherwise," said Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, a project to buy up rainforest land for preservation is an important environmental move, Tittel said, but won?t in itself reduce carbon emissions. A project designed to reforest large areas that had been clear cut will reduce emissions. Many of the organizations only invest in projects that are certified by an independent third party as truly reducing emissions.LiNeBrEaKBuying offsets doesn?t cancel out a person?s responsibility to reduce their own carbon footprint, said Dena Mottola Jaborska of Environment New Jersey. On its Web site, Sustainable Travel International, another carbon offset provider near Portland, Wash., puts it this way: "Offsetting energy isn?t an excuse to pollute. It?s a way to take responsibility for pollution that can?t be avoided."LiNeBrEaKE-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com	CARBON OFFSETS (94%); EMISSIONS (91%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (90%); METHANE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); CHRISTMAS (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (87%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); LOBBYING (78%); TRENDS (77%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (74%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (74%); BIOREMEDIATION (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (72%); DAIRY FARMING (71%); AGRICULTURAL WASTES (71%); RELIGION (69%); REFORESTATION (69%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (68%); NATIVE AMERICANS (68%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (68%); WIND POWER PLANTS (65%); CLERGY and RELIGIOUS (64%); WEB SITES (50%) POLLUTION; GIFT; ENVIRONMENT; ENERGY  			CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); NEW JERSEY, USA (91%); LOUISIANA, USA (79%); VERMONT, USA (79%); MARYLAND, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 23, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 North Jersey Media Group Inc., All Rights Reserved  		IDLEAIRE TECHNOLOGIES CORP (56%)  	PHOTO, ASSOCIATED PRESS - Despite the slumping economy, organizations across the country that sell carbon offsets are seeing increased demand over last year.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 		December 19, 2008 Friday 	San Diego's transportation future  	Duncan McFetridge, McFetridge is president of SOFAR, whose mission includes preserving our environment through good city-building and containing urban sprawl.  	OPINION; Pg. B-7  	864 words  	The federal economic stimulus package presents San Diego with an unprecedented opportunity to build much-needed infrastructure for the community. For example, just when we thought that enhancing public transit in our region was impossible, federal funds may soon be available. Yet, rather than use this opportunity to address this vital gap in our transportation system, the San Diego Association of Governments is considering spending the vast majority of federal funds (which could be as high as $10 billion) on new highway projects.LiNeBrEaKSANDAG's approach couldn't be more misguided. History teaches that it is simply impossible to build our way out of highway congestion. Further, new highway construction rests on the false premise that our land and energy supplies are inexhaustible. In fact, this nation's over-dependence on the automobile ravages our natural resources, creates unlivable cities and plays a huge role in our looming climate change crisis. LiNeBrEaKThe transportation sector is the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in California, accounting for about 40 percent of these emissions. Just last year, the California attorney general weighed in on SANDAG's massive road-building program, stating that it "will significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions at the same time that the state has mandated reducing those emissions significantly." We will be unable to slow down global warming, much less stop it, unless we can reduce the public's reliance on the automobile.LiNeBrEaKFour months ago, everyone was talking about the skyrocketing price of gas. Today, this has almost become a non-issue. President-elect Barack Obama calls it our pattern of "shock and trance." Fuel costs soar, and Americans are in shock; fuel costs decline, and we fall back into our trance, lulled into a false sense of economic security. Yet, we all know that it is just a matter of time until gas prices rise again. And, next to housing, transportation is the second-highest household cost for most Americans.LiNeBrEaKFor all these reasons, investing in public transit makes sound economic sense for San Diego and its residents. In fact, Americans are clamoring for alternatives to the automobile and demanding that we decrease our dependence on foreign oil. According to Reconnecting America, Americans took more than 10 billion trips on transit in 2007, saving 1. 4 billion gallons of gasoline -- the equivalent of a supertanker leaving the Middle East every 11 days.LiNeBrEaKSANDAG should listen to the county's residents, who have made clear that the agency's outdated approach to the region's transportation is not working. When surveyed in 2000, an overwhelming majority of the community said they wanted an efficient, effective transit system and affordable homes. When they were surveyed again in 2006, 60 percent of residents had considered leaving San Diego due to the high cost of housing and endless commutes. Ignoring these signals, our elected leaders and developers have given San Diego residents what they do not want and do not need -- and all at a staggering economic and environmental cost.LiNeBrEaKIt is time for San Diego to follow in the footsteps of other U.S cities that are choosing to build in a sustainable manner. Portland learned, more than 30 years ago, that it was impractical to build enough roads to satisfy drivers' demands -- and, more important, that attempting to do so would cause major impacts to the community and the environment. Consequently, no major new highways have been built in Portland for 25 years.LiNeBrEaKPortland is thus the poster child for how investment in transit infrastructure results in sustainable communities. Tellingly, while America's No. 1 "green" city has some of the nation's highest transit ridership, it also has some of the lowest foreclosure rates, lowest home devaluation and most affordable homes in the country.LiNeBrEaKThe evidence is clear. Cities such as Portland prove that public transportation creates more livable communities with fewer environmental impacts. Interconnected transit networks provide better access to population centers, intercity rail, bus stations and airports. By enhancing transit networks, we can leverage the benefits of new transit investment and foster sustainable development, including affordable housing.LiNeBrEaKThese transit networks also will effectively address climate change, high fuel prices and congestion, enabling us to shift to a greener economy. San Diego's tragedy is in not planning ahead to meet a changing world.LiNeBrEaKThe economic stimulus package is San Diego's greatest opportunity for change in many years. Accordingly, we must ask ourselves certain fundamental questions: Do we invest in and plan for a sustainable future, or do we continue the mistakes of the past? Do we respond to the needs of the community by investing in transit, or do we simply build new freeways leading to poorly planned developments? Forward-thinking cities such as Portland show us the way. America's cities and natural resources are its greatest assets, and this country's national security lies in their sustainable use for the future.LiNeBrEaKOnline: SOFAR at sofar.org.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	EPA memo reverses climate change ruling: Memo ? Clean-air law doesn't apply to greenhouse gases  	Judy Fahys, The Salt Lake Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	650 words  	Dec. 19--Green groups say the nation's top environmental administrator has dropped "a lump of dirty coal" into Americans' Christmas stockings with a memo that says there is no reason to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of coal plants.LiNeBrEaKBut an electric-industry spokesman called the memo by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Steven Johnson "brave." And he asserted that, without its findings, more than 20 different industrial sectors, along with offices, schools, apartments and hospitals, might have been subject to "costly and inflexible permitting requirements." LiNeBrEaK"If EPA had embraced any other interpretation and determined carbon to be subject to regulation," said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability CoordinatingLiNeBrEaKCouncil, "the result could have been catastrophic for the structure of the [Clean Air] Act, the resources of the agency, the U.S. economy and even the environment itself. "LiNeBrEaKUtah has become ground zero for the fight over whether the federal Clean Air Act should be taken into account when new coal-fired power plants are built.LiNeBrEaKJust before Labor Day weekend in 2007, the EPA issued a permit for a power plant on the Ute Indian Reservation in eastern Utah. And, in doing so, the agency opted against considering the climate-change impacts of the proposed plant's emissions.LiNeBrEaKIt was a signal to watchful environmentalists, state regulators and industry on how federal regulators would interpret a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from earlierLiNeBrEaKin the year. In effect, the court cleared the way for regulating greenhouse gases under the clean-air law.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA's permit for the Bonanza plant would have allowed South Jordan-based Deseret Power Electric Cooperative to add a 110-megawatt waste-fuel plant to its generating station south of Vernal in Uintah County.LiNeBrEaKWhatever happens now will have national implications, since there are more than 100 coal plants in process or under appeal, including two other ones in Utah.LiNeBrEaKLast month, a decision by the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board basically told federal regulators, either come up with a better reason why you think global warming pollutants should not be regulated in new power plants or else set a policy on how you will begin regulating them nationwide.LiNeBrEaKDeseret Power officials were not available for comment after hours Thursday.LiNeBrEaKBut Kathy Van Dame of the Wasatch Clean Air Coalition called the latest development "really bad news."LiNeBrEaKAnd Joro Walker, a Salt Lake City environmental attorney, said the memo snubs a key appeals board's directive: that any EPA decision on how to handle greenhouse gases must be reviewed and commented on by the public.LiNeBrEaK"It's a last-minute effort to influence policy" before the Obama administration takes office, said Walker. "But it's not going to work because it was not done properly."LiNeBrEaKIn Utah, the outcome is likely to affect two other proposed power plants.LiNeBrEaKOne is the 270-megawatt Sevier Power coal-fired plant proposed for Sigurd. The state-issued license for that plant is being reviewed by the Utah Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKThe other is the 900-megawatt Unit 3 of the Intermountain Power Plant in Delta, which has been appealed to the Utah Air Quality Board.LiNeBrEaKNeither proposal has been reviewed for the potential impact of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that are blamed for climate change. But, if the EPA opts to begin regulating those pollutants, environmental groups could argue that tougher pollution controls are necessary or the plants shouldn't be built at all.LiNeBrEaKfahys@sltrib.com	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (93%); POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); CHRISTMAS (79%); HAZARDOUS WASTE FUELS (78%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (72%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (72%); SETTLEMENTS and DECISIONS (71%); DECISIONS and RULINGS (71%); APPEALS (69%); INDIGENOUS PEOPLES LANDS and GOVERNMENT (66%); SUPREME COURTS (64%); LAW COURTS and TRIBUNALS (64%)  	Crime/law  	BARACK OBAMA (50%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (79%) UTAH, USA (96%) UNITED STATES (96%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081219-ST-EPA-memo-reverses-climate-change-ruling-1219  	Newspaper  	ST  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune   				US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%); SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES (54%)  											
The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	Gay leaders angered by Obama prayer pick  	Meredith May and Leslie Fulbright, Chronicle Staff Writers  	Main News; Pg. A1  	909 words  	San Francisco's gay community, which threw its political weight behind Barack Obama's campaign, is protesting the president-elect's decision to invite an evangelical pastor known for anti-gay comments to give the inaugural prayer.LiNeBrEaKRick Warren, pastor of the 20,000-member Saddleback Church in Orange County, was a major force in the passage in November of Proposition 8, which eliminated the right of gay people to marry in California.  LiNeBrEaKWarren invited Obama to his church during the presidential campaign and more recently ignited a major controversy when he compared same-sex marriage to pedophilia, incest and polygamy during a video interview posted on Beliefnet.com and widely circulated on YouTube.LiNeBrEaKObama, who opposed Prop. 8 but has also said he opposes same-sex marriage in favor of civil unions, defended his choice at a news conference Thursday, saying, "a wide range of viewpoints" will be presented during the inaugural ceremonies on Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaKWarren and Obama do share some common ground, especially regarding Warren's work in Africa on AIDS/HIV issues and his efforts to build schools there.LiNeBrEaKAnd Warren, who also opposes abortion, has drawn ire from within his own ranks for associating with Obama.LiNeBrEaKBut gay leaders and supporters in San Francisco and across the nation said they are having a hard time understanding how a man who they see as associated with hate speech is worthy of giving the inaugural prayer. It is directly counter, they say, to Obama's campaign theme of unity and his promises to heal a legacy of cultural and racial divisiveness in his new administration.LiNeBrEaKEquality California, which led the fight against Prop. 8, has gathered 8,000 signatures since Wednesday night asking Obama to choose someone else, said Executive Director Geoff Kors.LiNeBrEaKSeveral gay civil rights groups issued Web statements asking Obama to reconsider, including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Religious Leadership Roundtable and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.LiNeBrEaKMayor Gavin Newsom, a strong supporter of gay marriage, knows Warren personally. He said he has conflicting thoughts on Obama's decision. LiNeBrEaK"Rick Warren is one of the most prolific religious leaders in the world, so from that perspective it is not a surprising choice," Newsom said in a phone interview. "He is redefining the evangelical movement by expanding it beyond guns, gods and gays to issues of poverty and global warming and peace."LiNeBrEaKNewsom disappointedLiNeBrEaKThe mayor said the decision is painful for the gay and lesbian community, especially in California, where people are still reeling from the passage of Prop. 8.LiNeBrEaK"The gay community has every right to be upset," Newsom said. "I hope people appreciate that Rick Warren was not just indirectly involved but very involved in taking people's rights away. I'm disappointed, but I understand the decision.LiNeBrEaK"Rick Warren is not someone who has been a champion of gay rights, and the president-elect could not be naive to that, yet he felt that the other attributes outweighed that," Newsom said.LiNeBrEaKWarren's other attributes are not enough for state Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco. LiNeBrEaK"His work on HIV/AIDS is laudable, but that doesn't change the fact that he thinks I am a second-class citizen and should be denied fundamental rights guaranteed to me in a constitutional democracy," Leno said.LiNeBrEaK"My concern is the selection of Rick Warren goes far beyond Proposition 8. He has spent a lifetime disparaging and disregarding the LGBT community," Leno said.LiNeBrEaKObama's choice appears to fulfill his campaign promise of bringing opposing groups together to heal, said Sue Kuipers, the youth pastor at Christ's Community Church in Hayward, whose Christian parishioners spent 40 days studying Warren's book, "The Purpose Driven Life."LiNeBrEaK"It's sad that it's become political," Kuipers said. "We can agree to disagree, but that shouldn't interfere with our ability to pray for each other as a nation."LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco Supervisor Bevan Dufty first heard of Warren's selection in a text message from a friend in South Africa.LiNeBrEaKDufty said he is perplexed but is giving Obama the benefit of the doubt.LiNeBrEaK"It's difficult to understand, but I would like to look back on this in a year or two and see it was a longer-term effort to heal division in this country," he said. "Maybe strategically we'll see something positive in this in the future, but right now, it doesn't make much sense."LiNeBrEaKSignal of anti-gay policies?LiNeBrEaKAndrea Shorter, campaign director for And Marriage 4 All, a Northern California gay marriage advocacy organization, is worried that Obama's choice could signal four more years of anti-gay presidential policy.LiNeBrEaK"Rick Warren is clearly divisive and anti-gay. He is a kinder, gentler dose of Jerry Falwell and Oral Roberts. He presents himself as a warm and fuzzy new-age version of the same old stuff," she said. LiNeBrEaK"I think Obama did this because he has been under such scrutiny throughout the campaign about his legitimacy as a person of Christian faith. Maybe he sees this also as a way to give a nod of thanks and gratitude to voters who come from the evangelical right." LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Amos Brown, head of the San Francisco NAACP, campaigned heavily against Prop. 8.LiNeBrEaK"I'm very upset. I can understand that Obama wants to be inclusive but not at this moment in his life and the life of this nation. We should be pulling people together. It is most unfortunate. Rick Warren belongs to a conservative evangelical group that is divisive and in some regards mean-spirited."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	Call for ideas on living in a warming world;  Competition asks designers to 'climate-proof" Bay Area 	John King, Chronicle Urban Design Writer  	Metro; Pg. B1  	624 words  	The impacts of climate change are a hot topic among scientists and environmental activists. Now the Bay Conservation and Development Commission wants to hear from another perspective: the design community.LiNeBrEaKThe state agency is preparing to launch a $125,000 competition that will invite architects, planners and engineers to bring innovative proposals "to climate-proof the Bay Area," in the words of the competition outline.LiNeBrEaKThe aim isn't to stop climate change from happening, say officials, or to build impregnable levees. The goal is to get designers thinking creatively about how to prepare for a world where the sea level might climb several feet - inundating large portions of the developed region unless something is done. LiNeBrEaK"We are looking for ideas that can lead to future standards about how to deal with rising tides," said Brad McCrea, a development design analyst for the commission. "We want to move the discussion forward."LiNeBrEaKThe commission Thursday approved a $25,000 contract with David Meckel to manage the competition. This means selecting the design jury as well as framing the rules - such as deciding whether design teams will be asked to look at specific sites or respond to broader issues.LiNeBrEaK"There's an opportunity to suggest ideas that can be applied to our bay but have universal access," said Meckel, whose design competition work is a sideline to his role as director of research for the California College of the Arts. "If one of the results is a solution for protecting low-lying freeways, for example, other cities are welcome to steal it."LiNeBrEaKAs now envisioned, $10,000 awards would go to each of the five entrants who present the most innovative schemes for adapting our urban region to natural changes. The current timetable calls for the competition to be launched in the spring and conclude by the end of 2009.LiNeBrEaKGiven the relatively modest prize, Meckel suggested it's unlikely that major architectural and/or engineering firms will respond.LiNeBrEaK"More likely we'd get something from three young staffers in the back room" of a large firm, said Meckel. "It's a great way for emerging talent to step out."LiNeBrEaKStill, commission officials say they're looking for provocative and plausible examples of what the competition brief calls "resilient shoreline development techniques."LiNeBrEaK"We all want it to go beyond cool-looking ideas," McCrea said. "What's needed are multidiscipline solutions ... that go beyond what we think of when we talk about 'protecting the shoreline.' "LiNeBrEaKThe competition is the latest sign of how a commission created in 1965 to keep the bay from shrinking now grapples with the opposite problem: projections that show climate change could lift the level of the bay by more than a yard at high tide by 2050.LiNeBrEaKLeft unchecked, this would submerge much of Silicon Valley as well as stretches of Highway 101 on the Peninsula. Marin County subdivisions along Richardson Bay would be imperiled; so would the Oakland and San Francisco airports.LiNeBrEaKOther coastal regions face similar impacts - which is why the commission wants the competition to have as wide an impact as possible. Current plans call for presenting the top entries in public forums and a competition catalog.LiNeBrEaKAnother factor that might draw attention: the novelty.LiNeBrEaK"There's been nothing with a focus like this that I've heard of in this country," said G. Stanley Collyer, editor of Competitions, a professional quarterly.LiNeBrEaK"Ideas competitions can really have value if people take them seriously," Collyer said. "If this one comes up with interesting ideas, it could be a model for other communities."LiNeBrEaK"What's needed are multidiscipline solutions ... that go beyond 'protecting the shoreline.'

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 		December 19, 2008 Friday 	The Local Buzz, Dec. 19  		BUSINESS  	466 words  	CPUC approves transmission lineLiNeBrEaKSAN FRANCISCO - The California Public Utilities Commission voted Thursday to approve the Sunrise Powerlink, a 120-mile, $1. 9 billion transmission line that will be built in the San Diego region and increase the reliability of the state's power grid. LiNeBrEaK"Today's vote demonstrates California's commitment to clean, renewable energy," said Bill Keese, co-chair of Californians for Clean and Reliable Energy and former Chairman of the California Energy Commission. "The CPUC realizes that in order to tap into the green energy needed to meet California's ambitious goals to combat climate change, we must build the transmission lines to access those energy sources."LiNeBrEaKThe commission approved the decision proposed by CPUC President Michael Peevey to build the transmission line on a 4-1 vote. This vote was the culmination of an unprecedented three-year process involving extensive environmental review and more than a dozen public hearings.LiNeBrEaKReport denotes waning confidenceLiNeBrEaKLOS ANGELES - The California Employee Confidence Index decreased 0. 7 points to 40. 8 in November, according to the latest Spherion Employment ReportLiNeBrEaKThe monthly survey of California workers, conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of Spherion Corp., indicates that although overall confidence decreased, more workers reported confidence in their ability to find a new job and revealed that they are more likely to do so.LiNeBrEaKResults from the California Employment Report include:LiNeBrEaKForty-one percent of workers reported that they are likely to look for a new job in the next 12 months compared to 31 percent in OctoberLiNeBrEaKSeventy-nine percent of workers believe there are fewer jobs available versus 74 percent in OctoberLiNeBrEaKMore than half (51 percent) of workers are confident in their ability to find a new job, representing a 10 percentage-point increase from the previous monthLiNeBrEaKEight in ten (80 percent) workers believe the economy is getting weaker compared to 73 percent in the previous month.LiNeBrEaK"Although this is the third consecutive month of decline, our Index suggests that workers appear to be more optimistic in certain areas," said Lauren Steel, territory vice president for Spherion.LiNeBrEaKAd agency to cut 3,000 positionsLiNeBrEaKNEW YORK - Omnicom Group Inc., the world's largest advertising, marketing and public relations conglomerate, on Thursday said it is cutting "less than 5 percent" of its work force as clients tighten their belts on ad spending.LiNeBrEaKThe cuts translate to around 3,000 jobs from a global work force that numbered 70,000 in 2007.

LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKGonzales is accused of misleading CongressLiNeBrEaKFormer White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales misled Congress when he claimed the CIA in 2002 approved information that ended up in the 2003 State of the Union speech about Iraq's alleged effort to buy uranium for its nuclear weapons program, a House committee said Thursday.LiNeBrEaKThe committee also expressed skepticism about claims by then-national security adviser Condoleezza Rice that she was unaware of the CIA's doubts about the claim before President George W. Bush's speech.LiNeBrEaKIraq's alleged attempt to buy uranium was one of the justifications for the Bush administration's decision to go to war. The claim has since been repudiated.LiNeBrEaKThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a memo that its investigation showed the CIA had warned at least four National Security Council officials not to allow Bush, in three speeches in 2002, to cite questionable intelligence that Iraq had attempted to obtain uranium.LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKSecret Service penalized in discrimination lawsuitLiNeBrEaKA judge ruled the Secret Service "made a mockery" of the law in order to thwart black agents accusing it of bias. She penalized the agency by barring it from introducing rebuttal evidence during the trial of their lawsuit.LiNeBrEaKThe severe and rarely invoked penalty - just short of awarding victory to the agents - is the latest twist in an eight-year-old case that alleges the Secret Service denied minority agents promotion because of their race.LiNeBrEaKIn a scalding 51-page opinion issued late Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson concluded the Secret Service refused to provide documents requested by the plaintiffs during the discovery phase of the trial, ignored judicial rules and defied court orders so extensively that it damaged the agents' ability to present their case.LiNeBrEaKSPRINGFIELD, MASS.LiNeBrEaKStepdad gets 12-15 years in beating of girlLiNeBrEaKA man was sentenced Thursday to 12 to 15 years in prison for allowing a brutal beating that left his stepdaughter with a severe brain injury and put her at the center of a right-to-die case in Massachusetts.LiNeBrEaKJurors convicted Jason Strickland in November of five of the six charges related to the 2005 beating of 11-year-old Haleigh Poutre. The jury didn't believe Strickland was present for the beating, but said he would have known that leaving the girl with his late wife, Holli, could pose a serious risk.LiNeBrEaKThe abuse left Haleigh in a coma. After months on life support, child welfare officials got permission to remove her feeding tube. But soon after, the girl began to show improvement. Now 14, Haleigh lives in a Boston rehabilitation facility.LiNeBrEaKUNITED NATIONSLiNeBrEaKU.S. balks at move to condemn anti-gay lawsLiNeBrEaKAlone among major Western nations, the U.S. has refused to sign a declaration presented Thursday at the United Nations calling for worldwide decriminalization of homosexuality.LiNeBrEaKMore than 70 U.N. members outlaw homosexuality, and in several of them, homosexual acts can be punished by death.LiNeBrEaKAccording to some of the declaration's backers, the United States refused to sign, expressing concern in private talks that some parts of the declaration might be problematic in committing the federal government on matters that fall under state jurisdiction.LiNeBrEaKBrieflyLiNeBrEaK- Death sentence: A New Hampshire jury has handed down the state's first death sentence in a half-century to a man who fatally shot a Manchester police officer two years ago.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	For prayers at inauguration, Obama will split his ticket  		NEWS; Pg. 015  	425 words  	The clergy members chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to pray at his inauguration fill separate symbolic roles: One is a nod to the civil rights activists who made Obama's election possible. The other is an overture to conservative Christians who rankles some Obama supporters. LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Rick Warren, who will give the invocation, is the most influential pastor in the United States, and a choice that has already caused problems for Obama.LiNeBrEaKWarren is a Southern Baptist who holds traditional religious beliefs and endorsed California's Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage. But he also wants to broaden the evangelical agenda to include fighting global warming, poverty and AIDS.LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Joseph Lowery, 87, is considered the dean of the civil rights movement. For the benediction at the Jan. 20 swearing-in, he says he will pray that the "spirit of fellowship and oneness" at the inauguration endures throughout Obama's presidency.LiNeBrEaK"He gets a lot with these choices," said David Domke, author of "The God Strategy: How Religion Became a Political Weapon in America."LiNeBrEaK"Here's a guy who wants to run a progressive administration getting a substantial lift in his wings from the nation's most popular evangelical," Domke said. "But he balances that with Joseph Lowery, who speaks to the more liberal, social-justice and African-American heritage."LiNeBrEaKBy picking Warren, Obama is sending another signal, about his willingness to upset liberals by tilting to the center. Gay rights groups are demanding that Obama rescind the invitation because of Warren's opposition to same-sex marriage.LiNeBrEaK"By inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration, you have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table," Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a letter to the incoming president.LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference yesterday, Obama said he is a "fierce advocate for equality for gay and lesbian Americans." But he said he will build relationships with people of opposing views, and wants his inaugural to reflect that goal.LiNeBrEaK"I'm overwhelmed. I'm very grateful. I'm humbled and honored," Lowery said in a phone interview. "When we worked on the Voting Rights Act in the '60s, we hoped and felt that one day there would be an African-American president. I honestly can say I didn't think I'd live long enough to see it."LiNeBrEaKAs a young pastor in 1950s Alabama, Lowery helped lead the Montgomery bus boycotts. With the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others, he created the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 		December 19, 2008 Friday 	Study: Carbon cap will cost jobs  	By Leslie Brooks Suzukamo lsuzukamo@pioneerpress.com  	BUSINESS  	593 words  	If Midwest states go ahead with a regional effort to cap production of greenhouse gases, Minnesotans could end up with higher electric bills and 21,000 fewer jobs, according to a study by a group representing Minnesota businesses.LiNeBrEaKPartners for Affordable Energy says it would be better if Minnesota waits for a national or global effort to limit the production of greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"A regional approach is not going to solve the problem with greenhouse gases," said Bill Blazar, senior vice president of public affairs at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which was part of the business group. LiNeBrEaKBut supporters of the effort to limit greenhouse gases as soon as possible questioned the study's conclusions and said waiting would further damage the environment.LiNeBrEaKThe study by Partners for Affordable Energy, released last week, focuses on the economic impact of Minnesota's goals to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with global warming by 15 percent by 2015 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe business group represents iron and coal mining, agriculture, rural utilities, grocers and printers, among others. They want to ensure Minnesota's efforts don't lead to energy costs that put them at a disadvantage to competitors in other states, said Christina Pierson, executive director for the group.LiNeBrEaKPartners for Affordable Energy commissioned an economic analysis in reaction to proposals for a regional exchange from Gov. Tim Pawlenty and the Midwest Governors Association. The study assumed Minnesota would be part of a Midwestern cap-and-trade system that limits the amount of greenhouse gases companies can produce, but also lets those companies trade emissions credits with one another. Companies that reduce their emissions below their limit could sell credits to companies that don't.LiNeBrEaKThe system is supposed to create a marketplace that rewards companies that reduce emissions the most.LiNeBrEaKBut the effort would be costly, the study said. Minnesota households would see a 17 percent increase in electricity prices by 2015, and the state's industries would pay 33 percent more for power then, forcing some companies to close or be bought out, the study said.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade system would cost Minnesota a net 21,000 jobs by 2015, factoring in new "green energy" jobs that could be created by conservation and renewable energy initiatives, the study said.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the greenhouse gases produced by the rest of the country would wipe out any reductions made in Minnesota, study author Anne Smith said.LiNeBrEaK"One needs to ask the question, does Minnesota need to take this on itself?" she said.LiNeBrEaKBut one environmentalist said waiting for a national or international mandate could result in greater damage.LiNeBrEaK"Now is not the time to wait," said Kevin Reuther, legal director of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.LiNeBrEaKAnd an executive of Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility, expressed skepticism about the report's conclusions.LiNeBrEaKThe projected business increase of 33 percent is "unrealistic," said David Sparby, president of Northern States Power-Minnesota, an Xcel company. And although he said he hadn't run the numbers, he estimated the 17 percent household increase by 2015 could be no more than the effect of inflation. Xcel is not part of the partnership group.LiNeBrEaKPawlenty believes states can play a role in crafting energy policy, and he is awaiting the results of an economic analysis from the Midwest Governors Association, his spokesman Brian McClung said.

The A-lister was in town last week to promote his latest, "Seven Pounds," but the big news wasn't his red-carpet appearance -- it was his surprise drop-in at the Aveda Institute in Minneapolis. It turns out that Smith's stylist, Austin Pierce, is a graduate of the institute and wanted to show his client where he learned how to do hair. Smith greeted students, toured the building and got his hair cut (of course!). I.W. can't help but wonder if he, too, uses the Rosemary Mint conditioner.LiNeBrEaKSara Glassman LiNeBrEaKRoasting on an open fireLiNeBrEaKHam is the focal point of many Minnesotans' Christmases, but no one knows how to ham it up like local country vet Sherwin Linton. Twenty-two years after he landed the novelty hit "Santa Got a DWI" (a million copies sold!), Linton has revisited the formula with another wacky but message-filled single suited to the season and era, "Global Warming Christmas." The reggae-based song addresses the issue of climate change through the eyes of a not-so-jolly ol' St. Nick. Sample lyrics: "Soon Dasher and Prancer and all the rest will have to pass an emissions test" and "Santa is talking retirement with all the stress on the environment/ How can he tell little Tommy and Ruth about `An Inconvenient Truth'?" You can hear it live at Linton's holiday show tonight at the Coon Rapids American Legion Post, 11640 Crooked Lake Blvd., or -- a sign that he's really up on the times -- it's also available for download at iTunes.LiNeBrEaKCHRIS RIEMENSCHNEIDERLiNeBrEaKPit Bull RedLiNeBrEaKSculptor Harriet Bart's annual holiday gift took an unexpectedly political turn this year. For the past 19 years the Minneapolis artist has produced a limited edition "multiple" -- gold leafed snail shells, gilded eggs, altered tape measures -- with enigmatic messages for 60 friends and fans. This year's was a red-tipped bronze bullet (blank) in a red tartan lipstick case tied with a "Seeing Red" tag. The bullet's resemblance to a lipstick was unmistakable, even without the gilded words "Pit Bull" under the little mirror to footnote the recent presidential campaign. "Making it was cathartic," Bart said. "But it almost got a friend jailed. She was en route to Washington, D.C., with the case in her purse. Airport security would not let her board the plane and told her she was lucky she wasn't taken in for questioning." The friend jettisoned the case; Bart sent a replacement.LiNeBrEaKMARY ABBELiNeBrEaKQuietdrive heads to IraqLiNeBrEaKWhile the biggest chore for most of us after Christmas is trying to return that sweater from Mom, the boys of Quietdrive will be getting ready for the biggest trip of their lives. The day after their fourth annual hometown holidays gig next Friday at Trocaderos (7 p.m., $10), the emo/pop rockers are leaving for a USO tour that will find them playing military bases and embassies in Iraq, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Greece over the next two months. Since they're already going to be halfway around the globe, they're also going to go ahead and squeeze in U.K. and Japanese tours. "It's a very small sliver of pride for us to go over and assist those who are laying their lives down for us -- despite the rationale of what's going on there, or whether or not we should be there," singer Kevin Truckenmiller said.LiNeBrEaKCHRIS RIEMENSCHNEIDERLiNeBrEaKPrincess of EgyptLiNeBrEaKUsually the fifth runner-up on "American Idol" fades from our memory faster than the latest Ruben Studdard album. But not so for Paris Bennett, the only finalist from Minnesota (she was on in 2006 when Taylor Whats-hisname won). She turned up in Time magazine's year-end "List Issue" in Top 10 Strange Baby Names. After citing such celebrity couples' kids as Bronx Mowgli (Ashlee Simpson/Pete Wentz), Nahla Ariela (Halle Berry/Gabriel Aubry) and Trig Paxson Van (Sarah and Todd Palin), the almost-famous Bennett stands alone at No. 10 for naming her newborn Egypt. Anything to keep her name out there.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   Metro Edition	Readers Write  		NEWS; Pg. 22A  	989 words  	LETTER OF THE DAY: Obama shows by his actions that he wants to be a unifierLiNeBrEaKWith President-elect Barack Obama's decision to ask the Rev. Rick Warren, the pastor of Saddleback Community Church in California and author of the best-selling book "The Purpose-Driven Life," to deliver the invocation at the 2009 presidential inauguration, Democrats may have finally indicated their willingness to reach out to moderate evangelicals. The announcement represents a surprising yet strategically important demonstration of unity and bipartisanship.LiNeBrEaKWarren, along with other moderate evangelical leaders like Bill Hybels, Tony Campolo and Jim Wallis, epitomizes a new American evangelical middle. Though most evangelicals subscribe to theological and political conservatism, they are by no means a monolithic group. LiNeBrEaKPolitically, many evangelicals tend to gravitate toward the more liberal Democratic Party while retaining their theological conservatism. These individuals are still conservative on many domestic issues, like gay marriage, stem-cell research and abortion, but exhibit a greater bent towards social justice.LiNeBrEaKJoining with gay activists, mainline Christian denominations, Pentecostals and liberal Democrats on these issues, Warren has drawn fire from the conservative wing of the evangelical community for his perceived abandonment of traditional conservative values. The lack of consensus on these issues illustrates the diversity found in the evangelical community.LiNeBrEaKThe Saddleback pastor also represents a broadening of evangelicals' foreign policy agenda. He describes a highly ecumenical method for combating some of the world's most serious problems, from global climate change and human rights abuses to poverty and AIDS. On these issues, Democrats and evangelicals can work together to bring about the kind of change Obama constantly spoke about during his campaign.LiNeBrEaKThough John McCain captured 73 percent of the white evangelical vote, Obama improved upon John Kerry's showing among this constituency by 4 percentage points. If Democrats prove able of wooing even a small percentage of these traditionally conservative voters, Republicans could have a very long road ahead of them.LiNeBrEaKNILAY SAIYA, South Bend, Ind.LiNeBrEaKTHE SENATE RECOUNTLiNeBrEaKIt shows the country that our elections workLiNeBrEaKRecent headlines by the Star Tribune regarding the Senate recount are attempts to stir up controversy. The recount is not "muddled" or "messy." It's simply very close, so every vote counts! Because of Minnesota's election laws -- which are the best in the nation -- and thanks to our public servants, such as Secretary of State Mark Ritchie and countless other election officials and volunteers, we are serving as an example to the nation. This is how elections can be conducted fairly and honestly. This is how to count all the votes.LiNeBrEaKDAVE THOMAS, MinneapolisLiNeBrEaKA Dec. 15 article on rejected absentee ballots carried a provocative headline ("A nasty bug in the system crawls out") and claimed that the rejected absentee ballots are the "biggest flaw in Minnesota's election system."LiNeBrEaKTo safeguard the system, when filing an absentee ballot, there are five clearly stated rules to follow. Fail to do so, and your ballot will be rejected. What exactly is the problem?LiNeBrEaKDON ENGEBRETSON, EXCELSIORLiNeBrEaKA runoff election will cost money we apparently don't have anymore, but the integrity of the electoral process is expensive. The money will simply need to be found, because we need elected officials whom we know "won" our support without the taint this whole mess has cast on them.LiNeBrEaKIt's time for a do over.LiNeBrEaKDAVID BEHLING, ALBERT LEA, MINN.LiNeBrEaK`IMMIGRATION SUNDAY'LiNeBrEaKCatholic Church is promoting illegal aliensLiNeBrEaKWith all due respect to the Catholic Church, their "Immigration Sunday" is not about immigrants, but illegal aliens. Its basis for "Immigration Sunday" is in response to the arrest of illegal immigrants at the Swift and Co. meatpacking plant.LiNeBrEaKThe church says our immigration policy needs to be changed. We can all agree on that. This country, with more than 300 million people, is currently overpopulated. We need to end all immigration completely. We don't need any more legal immigrants or illegal aliens to add to the burden we already have.LiNeBrEaKHAROLD OLSON, MINNEAPOLISLiNeBrEaKTHE DETROIT STRUGGLESLiNeBrEaKUnion nixed plan that would have benefited itLiNeBrEaKOne of the reasons that the Big Three automakers are in such a dire financial situation is the huge labor costs that they incur.LiNeBrEaKAs part of the proposed bailout, Republicans in the Senate asked that the union accept the wages that the nonunion autoworkers receive. The UAW said no.LiNeBrEaKThe union's stance flies in the face of reason. Option 1: Take the reduction in pay to help the company they work for to survive and continue to provide them with a job. Option 2: Refuse to accept a lower wage and most likely the company will go out of business. They will then have no job and no salary.LiNeBrEaKIt should be a no-brainer.LiNeBrEaKBRIAN MARSH, SPRING LAKE PARKLiNeBrEaKI never thought I'd have anything to thank the Bush administration for, but if it comes through with a plan to stabilize the auto industry, I will owe it some appreciation. Republican senators are apparently willing to tip a teetering economy into a full-scale depression in order to stick it to the unions, and, not incidentally, benefit the nonunion auto producers in their owns states. I don't know how they can look themselves in the face each morning.LiNeBrEaKREGINA DRISCOLL, ST.

St. Petersburg Times (Florida) 		December 19, 2008 Friday 	THE NAME OF THE BIG GAME: SAVING THE PLANET  	SUSAN THURSTON  	TBT; SUPER BOWL XLIII; Pg. 33  	553 words  	The Super Bowl, and all the hoopla that surrounds it, is going super green.LiNeBrEaKFrom powering the stadium on renewable energy to donating leftover food to the hungry, the NFL is sponsoring initiatives to offset the environmental impact of the big game. LiNeBrEaK"We have a sense of responsibility to leave the host community better than we found it,'' said Jack Groh, director of the NFL's Environmental Program.LiNeBrEaKThe program began 16 years ago with basic recycling and has expanded to include food donations, green energy and tree plantings. New this year: measuring tree growth to calculate the greenhouse gas impact of planting new trees. While the NFL admits the efforts don't completely negate the Super Bowl - and all the beer cans, plastic forks and car trips it generates - the initiatives do make a difference. Here are some of them.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy. For the first time in Tampa, biomass from plant waste and, to a lesser degree, solar energy will power the stadium on game day and during the NFL Experience, which runs for five days.LiNeBrEaKTampa Electric Co. will buy biomass energy from a South Florida provider, which will ship it through transmission lines into the TECO system. Solar energy will come from TECO and other providers. In all, the stadium and Experience will consume an estimated 187,000 kilowatt hours. By comparison, a typical house uses 15,000 kilowatt hours per year.LiNeBrEaKTECO officials estimate that powering the Super Bowl with renewable energy will prevent more than 313,500 pounds of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, or the equivalent of taking 19 cars off the road for a year. It will increase the stadium's cost by about $5,000, which the NFL and its sponsors will pay.LiNeBrEaKTree planting. The NFL, with help from the U.S. Forest Service and the Florida Division of Forestry, is planting 2,700 trees at a dozen sites in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties to help offset the game's carbon impact. Scientists will measure the trees annually to calculate their long-term environmental benefits using software developed by the Forest Service. The new program will track the amount of air pollution, carbon dioxide and stormwater the trees absorb and quantify the trees' effects of cooling, said Charlie Marcus, urban forestry coordinator for the state. Generally, it takes five to 10 years for a tree to start reducing greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKLeftover food donation. Prepared party food that doesn't make it to buffet tables will be donated to America's Second Harvest of Tampa Bay, which partners with 350 charities and churches to provide food to the needy. Food will come from various Super Bowl parties, including some private events not connected to the NFL or the Tampa Bay Super Bowl Host Committee. During the last Super Bowl, 90,000 pounds of food were donated.LiNeBrEaKMaterial donations. All building materials, decorations, office equipment and supplies used in the preparation of the Super Bowl will be given to nonprofit groups to use or sell for cash. Items range from rolls of carpeting to signs to plants. Estimated value: more than $300,000.LiNeBrEaKUsed book and sports equipment donations. About 90 local schools are collecting books and sports equipment to give to local children. The donation drive continues through Jan. 22.

LiNeBrEaKThe company said the closure of two units at its Crystal River Energy Complex in Citrus County represents the equivalent of removing 830,000 vehicles from Florida's roads. The decision follows months of talks with state officials, including Gov. Charlie Crist and Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Michael W. Sole, said Progress Energy Florida chief executive Jeff Lyash.LiNeBrEaKCrist has hoped to reduce state carbon dioxide emissions to the 1990 level by 2025.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	2 Coal Plants To Be Iced  	RUSSELL RAY, rray@tampatrib.com  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 4  	468 words  	Progress Energy will retire them when its nuclear site is on line.LiNeBrEaKBy RUSSELL RAYLiNeBrEaKrray@tampatrib.comLiNeBrEaKTAMPA - Under a deal with state regulators, Progress Energy Florida has agreed to retire two of its four coal-fired units at Crystal River, deemed by environmentalists to be among the dirtiest power plants in the nation. LiNeBrEaKThe two units, which were built in the 1960s, will be retired after the utility builds a nuclear plant in Levy County, 10 miles north of Crystal River. The plant is expected to go on line in 2016.LiNeBrEaKRetiring the two coal units would cut emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to global warming, by 5. 5 million tons a year, said Jeff Lyash, president and chief executive of Progress Energy Florida.LiNeBrEaK"They are our oldest, most carbon-intensive generating resources," Lyash said. "We needed to work our way out of dependence on those plants."LiNeBrEaKThe two units can generate up to 866 megawatts, enough power for 53,000 Florida homes.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the utility agreed to spend more than $1. 3 billion on improvements to its two other coal units at Crystal River. The improvements will reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, the chief causes of smog and acid rain, by 90 percent, Lyash said.LiNeBrEaKHe said the improvements and the retirement of the two units will move Progress Energy substantially closer to meeting Gov. Charlie Crist's mandate for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKUnder executive orders signed by Crist in 2007, carbon dioxide emissions from power plants must be reduced to 1990 levels by 2025.LiNeBrEaK"This moves us almost 60 percent of the way to the governor's target," Lyash said.LiNeBrEaKStephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, applauded the utility's plan to mothball the two coal units.LiNeBrEaK"The urgency of global warming requires that we look at retiring coal-fired power plants," he said.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Smith questioned the need to replace that capacity with nuclear power, especially when demand has flattened, the byproduct of a sour economy. A stronger energy-efficiency program might eliminate the utility's need to build a nuclear plant, he said.LiNeBrEaK"It is very clear to us that Progress Energy is not an aggressive utility in looking at energy efficiency," Smith said.LiNeBrEaKNuclear plants produce no harmful air emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe nuclear plant in Levy County would generate up to 2,200 megawatts of power, enough for 1. 3 million homes. The utility also plans to increase the capacity of its nuclear plant in Crystal River by 15 percent.LiNeBrEaK"These are all elements of a long-term plan that's designed to make sure our customers have the energy they need at a price that is affordable," Lyash said.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		December 19, 2008 Friday   Final Edition	Prayer picks fill inaugural roles  	RACHEL ZOLL Associated Press  	News; Pg. A13  	836 words  	The clergy chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to pray at his inauguration fill separate symbolic roles: One is a nod to the civil rights activists who made Obama's election possible. The other is an overture to conservative Christians who rankles some Obama supporters. The Rev. Rick Warren, who will give the invocation, is the most influential pastor in the United States, and a choice that has already caused problems for Obama.  LiNeBrEaKWarren is a Southern Baptist who holds traditional religious beliefs and endorsed California's Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage. But he also wants to broaden the evangelical agenda to include fighting global warming, poverty and AIDS. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, 87, is considered the dean of the civil rights movement. For the benediction at the Jan. 20 swearing-in, he says he will pray that the "spirit of fellowship and oneness" at the inauguration endures throughout Obama's presidency. "He gets a lot with these choices," said David Domke, author of "The God Strategy: How Religion Became a Political Weapon in America." "Here's a guy who wants to run a progressive administration getting a substantial lift in his wings from the nation's most popular evangelical," Domke said. "But he balances that with Joseph Lowery, who speaks to the more liberal, social justice and African-American heritage." By picking Warren, Obama is sending another signal, about his willingness to upset liberals by tilting to the center. Gay rights groups are demanding that Obama rescind the invitation because of Warren's opposition to same-sex marriage. "By inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration, you have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table," said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a letter to the incoming president. In a news conference Thursday, Obama said he is a "fierce advocate for equality for gay and lesbian Americans." But he said he will build relationships with people of opposing views, and wants his inaugural to reflect that goal. "That dialogue, I think, is part of what my campaign's been all about: That we're not going to agree on every single issue, but what we have to do is to be able to create an atmosphere when we where we can disagree without being disagreeable and then focus on those things that we hold in common as Americans," he said. In the past several decades, inaugural prayer has most often been the job of evangelist Billy Graham, who forged relationships with every president from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush. Dubbed "America's pastor," Graham is now 90 and off the public stage. His son, Franklin, stepped in for his father and gave the invocation at Bush's 2001 swearing-in. Bush's personal pastor, the Rev. Kirbyjon Caldwell, an African-American Methodist from Houston, was chosen to give the inaugural benediction twice. Caldwell supported Bush in both his presidential campaigns, then backed Obama in 2008. But Obama no longer has a personal minister. He resigned his membership at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago following an uproar over incendiary parts of sermons by his longtime pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Obama instead turned to two preachers who could set a tone for his administration. "I'm overwhelmed. I'm very grateful. I'm humbled and honored," Lowery said in a phone interview. "When we worked on the Voting Rights Act in the '60s, we hoped and felt that one day there would be an African-American president. I honestly can say I didn't think I'd live long enough to see it." Lowery's biography reads like a history of the civil rights movement. As a young pastor in 1950s Alabama, he helped lead the Montgomery bus boycotts. With the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others, Lowery created the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which anchored the national civil rights movement. In 1965, Lowery played a key role in the bloody, pivotal Selma-Montgomery March. He led a delegation of marchers presenting their demands to then-segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace. Lowery, a Methodist, expanded his agenda in later years to fight poverty, stop violence and end apartheid. Warren, 54, has become the most prominent clergyman of his generation. His Saddleback Community Church in Orange County, Calif., has grown to more than 22,000 worshippers each week. His book, "The Purpose Driven Life" is one of the best-selling books in the world, with more than 30 million copies sold. He is mobilizing churches around the globe to fight poverty and illiteracy through his P.E.A.C.E coalition. Last month, he joined forces with Reader's Digest Association Inc., to launch a multimedia juggernaut based on his "Purpose Driven" writing. He and his wife, Kay, have become leading advocates for people with HIV/AIDS. On Dec. 1, World AIDS Day, the Warrens gave Bush an award for creating a multimillion-dollar U.S. fund to combat the virus.

The Washington Post 		December 19, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	EPA Eases Emissions Regulations for New Power Plants  	David A. Fahrenthold and Steven Mufson; Washington Post Staff Writers  	FINANCIAL; Pg. D03  	414 words  	The Environmental Protection Agency ruled yesterday that new power plants are not required to install technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, rejecting an argument from environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKThe ruling, in a memorandum signed by EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, turns on a seemingly arcane regulatory question that could govern the future of new fossil fuel-burning buildings and power plants under the Clean Air Act. LiNeBrEaKDuring the Bush administration, the EPA has rejected the idea that greenhouse gases should be regulated like soot, smog precursors and other kinds of air pollution, despite an April 2007 Supreme Court ruling that said carbon dioxide fit the definition of a pollutant that could be regulated under the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKThe case at issue yesterday began in 2007 when the EPA issued a permit to a new coal-fired power plant in Bonanza, Utah. The Sierra Club, an environmental group, filed a legal challenge, saying that the permit should have required the plant to control its output of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKIn a case before the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board, the Sierra Club cited a rule that required plants to use the best available technology to control all "regulated" pollutants, as well as the April 2007 Supreme Court ruling.LiNeBrEaKThe case revolved around the question of whether carbon dioxide was required to be controlled or simply monitored.LiNeBrEaKThe appeals board, a kind of appeals court for EPA rules, found on Nov. 13 that the rule was unclear. Johnson's memo yesterday sought to make it plain. Major industrial corporations have been pressing the Bush administration to issue a ruling in the case.LiNeBrEaK"That is our established interpretation," Robert Meyers, the head of the EPA office of air and radiation, said in an interview. "We've been applying it that way for 30 years."LiNeBrEaKIt was unclear yesterday what the ruling's real-world impact will be. The EPA says that about 50 plants -- either new or significantly remodeled -- must obtain a permit under this provision every year. But Meyers said he does  not know if any are positioned to receive final approval before President-elect Barack Obama takes office on Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration is likely to review the case, and Democratic officials close to the president-elect's team say that the Supreme Court ruling and the EPA's power to regulate carbon dioxide can serve as powerful levers to bring corporations and other parties to a bargaining table about broad framework for controlling greenhouse gases.

The Washington Post 		December 19, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	Advocates for Action on Global Warming Chosen as Obama's Top Science Advisers  	Juliet Eilperin and Joel Achenbach; Washington Post Staff Writers  	A-SECTION; Pg. A06  	899 words  	President-elect Barack Obama has selected two of the nation's most prominent scientific advocates for a vigorous response to climate change to serve in his administration's top ranks, according to sources, sending the strongest signal yet that he will reverse Bush administration policies on energy and global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe appointments of Harvard University physicist John Holdren as presidential science adviser and Oregon State University marine biologist Jane Lubchenco as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which will be announced tomorrow, dismayed conservatives but heartened environmentalists and researchers. LiNeBrEaKLike Energy Secretary-designate Steven Chu, who directs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Holdren and Lubchenco have argued repeatedly for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions to avert catastrophic climate change. In 2007, as chairman of the board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Holdren oversaw approval of the board's first statement on global warming, which said: "It is time to muster the political will for concerted action."LiNeBrEaKIn October, Lubchenco told the Associated Press that she believed public attitudes on climate change were shifting, adding: "The Bush administration has not been respectful of the science. But I think that's not true of Republicans in general. I know it's not."LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's political appointees have edited government documents to delete scientific findings and to block scientists' recommendations on issues involving climate change, endangered species, contaminants in drinking water and air pollution.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration has been the most remarkably anti-science administration that I've seen in my adult lifetime," Nobel laureate David Baltimore, former president of the California Institute of Technology, said in an interview. "And I do think that there will be a sea change in the Obama administration with the respect shown for the findings of science as well as the process of science."LiNeBrEaKBut Bush's science adviser, John H. Marburger III, challenged that assessment. "There are stupid and foolish things that have been perpetrated by employees of the federal government in the executive branch, but it doesn't mean that the president is anti-science," he said. "The president is getting blamed for every little thing that happens that people don't like in the administration."LiNeBrEaKMarburger added that because of the president's opposition to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and mandatory curbs on greenhouse gas emissions: "It was easy [for opponents] to infer that he was negative toward science. . . . The president respects science; he likes science."LiNeBrEaKAlden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, predicted that Obama's latest nominees would work with a Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and a Commerce Secretary Bill Richardson to change how government addresses global warming.LiNeBrEaK"You can see the elements coming together," Meyer said. "It means you've got people in key places across the administration that get the urgency of the climate issue and get the need for aggressive policy to move climate solutions forward, both in the U.S. and internationally."LiNeBrEaKBut Holdren's reported selection inspired no joy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group that denounces global warming "alarmists" and opposes many environmental laws. Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at CEI, said, "I think he's a very bad choice. His views are extreme, they're not based in fact, and he's a ranter."LiNeBrEaKOf the overall Obama team, Ebell said, "They will pursue an anti-energy agenda that is designed to constrict energy supplies and raise energy prices."LiNeBrEaKLubchenco did not draw the same level of criticism from conservative groups as Holdren yesterday, but she represents just as radical a departure for NOAA, which oversees marine issues as well as much of the government's climate work. While NOAA has traditionally favored commercial fishing interests in policy disputes, Lubchenco has consistently called for conservation measures to safeguard ocean ecosystems in the face of industry opposition.LiNeBrEaKJoshua S. Reichert, managing director of the Pew Environment group, said NOAA officials have too often set aside scientific considerations when deciding how much fish to extract from the sea. "For too many years, politics has played a greater role in fisheries management than science," he said. "This appointment carries with it the hope that this may soon change."LiNeBrEaKHoldren and Lubchenco have pushed other scientists to play a more active policy role. Holdren has attended international climate talks and helped coordinate a statement on the subject from scientific academies around the world. Lubchenco founded the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program to teach mid-career scientists how to participate in public policy debates.LiNeBrEaKAndrew Rosenberg, who was deputy director of NOAA's Marine Fisheries Service under President Bill Clinton and is professor of natural resources and the environment at the University of New Hampshire, said that by selecting Lubchenco -- someone who is a respected researcher and an active player in national policy discussions -- "it's saying that science agencies have a role in policy."LiNeBrEaKStaff researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 		December 19, 2008 Friday  Correction Appended  	Obama to Announce Final Cabinet Picks  	Anne E. Kornblut; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	636 words  	Met 2 EditionLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama will announce the final selections for his Cabinet today, naming Rep. Hilda L. Solis (D-Calif.) as labor secretary and former Dallas mayor Ron Kirk as U.S. trade representative. The two will be in Chicago to be formally announced, along with Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), Obama's choice for transportation secretary.LiNeBrEaKWith his selection of Solis, a liberal member of Congress, the president-elect appears to be moving toward his goal of promoting "green-collar jobs" -- those that help promote more energy efficiency, through projects such as retrofitting, something Solis has prioritized during her tenure in Congress. She is better known for her effort on energy issues than for her work on matters relating to labor; she sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee -- but not the Education and Labor Committee. LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, labor leaders embraced the decision to name Solis, whose father was a Teamsters shop steward in Mexico, to the post. Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, issued a statement underscoring their long-standing alliance. "From the streets of Los Angeles where she marched with the janitors who were fighting for jobs with dignity that can support a family through SEIU's Justice for Janitors campaigns, to the halls of Congress where she has been an outspoken supporter of healthcare rights for all, a livable minimum wage, and workers' right to come together for a voice on the job, Hilda Solis has never backed down from the good fight to make the American Dream available to all," Stern said.LiNeBrEaKSolis, who was born in Los Angeles in 1957, is the third Hispanic chosen for the Cabinet (in addition to Bill Richardson and Ken Salazar), and the fifth woman (in addition to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Susan Rice, Janet Napolitano and Lisa Jackson). She is also yet another Cabinet or top staff pick for Obama who originally backed Clinton in the Democratic primaries. Solis was an avid supporter of the former first lady, but was then aggressively courted by Obama as the primaries ended as part of his effort to win over Hispanic voters.LiNeBrEaKIn all likelihood, the next labor secretary will spend much time contending with the looming battle over the Employee Free Choice Act, legislation Obama supported that would make it much easier for unions to organize workers but that business groups adamantly oppose. One group issued a statement denouncing her support of the legislation. "Solis' co-sponsorship of the misnamed Employee Free Choice Act, a much-desired bill by organized labor that eliminates workers' right to a secret ballot vote in organizing elections, signals that Obama's Department of Labor will tow-the-line for union bosses," said J. Justin Wilson, a senior research analyst at the Center for Union Facts.LiNeBrEaKAmong Solis's previous accomplishments: sponsoring a bill, signed into law in 2003, granting citizenship to immigrants after a year of service in the military, rather than three years, as had been the law.LiNeBrEaKObama will install Kirk as the steward of his trade policies. The first black mayor of Dallas, Kirk ran unsuccessfully for one of Texas's U.S. Senate seats in 2002. Since leaving office, he has been a partner at the Houston-based law firm of Vinson and Elkins. Among his priorities will be following up on Obama's campaign promises on trade, including stiffer enforcement of trade agreements, particularly the environmental and labor protections in the North American Free Trade Agreement. China, which has manipulated its currency in recent years to gain trade advantages, is expected to be another item high on the trade agenda.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Alec MacGillis contributed to this report.

The Wisconsin State Journal  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	The Wisconsin State Journal Doug Moe column: Moe: Weather brings out good, bad and ugly  	Doug Moe, The Wisconsin State Journal  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	723 words  	Dec. 19--Good Doug has lived in Madison his entire life and would never leave, even with all this snow. Good Doug is an optimist.LiNeBrEaK"What doesn't kill us makes us stronger," he said.LiNeBrEaKBad Doug has lived in Madison his entire life, and if he doesn't get out of here pretty soon, he's going to hurt somebody. Bad Doug is not exactly an optimist. LiNeBrEaK"It is always darkest just before it goes pitch black," he said.LiNeBrEaKAll the snow this month, on top of all the snow last year, has brought out the best in Good Doug, and, not surprisingly, it has brought out the worst in Bad Doug.LiNeBrEaKOne reason Good Doug would never leave is because he appreciates the four seasons. "I love the change," Good Doug said. "It's like the circle of life."LiNeBrEaKBad Doug figures Good Doug can't count. "There's only two seasons around here anymore, pal," Bad Doug said. "Winter and road construction."LiNeBrEaKGood Doug doesn't have a snowblower because he values the exercise of shoveling. He also doesn't like the noise they make and the gas they use.LiNeBrEaKBad Doug doesn't have a snowblower because he doesn't get along with machines. His lawnmower once blew up. Bad Doug figured one close call was enough, so he bought a push mower. Of course, the explosion might have had something to do with Bad Doug not changing the mower's oil since the Reagan administration.LiNeBrEaKBad Doug is also too cheap to buy a snowblower. Besides, his neighbor has one.LiNeBrEaK"Who am I to deprive him of the opportunity to act neighborly and snow blow my driveway?" Bad Doug said.LiNeBrEaKBad Doug almost always remembers to get out of his hot tub in time to thank his neighbor for clearing the driveway.LiNeBrEaKBad Doug was rooting for global warming and now feels like he's been conned.LiNeBrEaK"I played 18 holes at Tumbledown Trails on Jan. 3, 2007," Bad Doug said. "It was the happiest day of my life."LiNeBrEaKLast winter, Bad Doug's clubs stayed in the trunk of his car.LiNeBrEaK"What's the name of that Al Gore movie again?" Bad Doug said. "Oh, yeah. An Inconvenient 100 inches.'"LiNeBrEaKThis winter now looks like it might be even worse. "They should revoke Gore's Nobel Prize," Bad Doug said.LiNeBrEaK"It's not global warming," Good Doug said. "It's climate change."LiNeBrEaK"It has changed, all right," Bad Doug said. "It's another Ice Age."LiNeBrEaKThis time of year, Good Doug enjoys hearing from friends who are spending the winter in Florida or Arizona.LiNeBrEaK"They are always upbeat," Good Doug said.LiNeBrEaK"Of course they're upbeat," Bad Doug said. "It's 80 and sunny where they are. Did you ever notice how they always call or send you an e-mail right after a blizzard up here?"LiNeBrEaKWhen that happens, Bad Doug does what comes naturally -- he lies.LiNeBrEaK"Just getting ready to grill steaks in the back yard," Bad Doug will say, when the call comes from Florida.LiNeBrEaK"What?"LiNeBrEaK"We're grilling out."LiNeBrEaK"But I thought it was below zero."LiNeBrEaK"That's why we're doing steaks instead of a turkey."LiNeBrEaKInvariably, the mention of turkey reminds Bad Doug of his hero, Arthur "Turkey" Gehrke, a bar owner in Watertown who in the first half of the 20th century became nationally famous for hibernating through the winter.LiNeBrEaKGood Doug said the people to admire are those who embrace the winter, who go ice skating or cross-country skiing.LiNeBrEaK"You admire them," Bad Doug said. "I will admire Turkey Gehrke."LiNeBrEaKBad Doug's favorite newspaper article of all time is a profile of Gehrke that appeared in the Milwaukee Journal in 1967, on the 25th anniversary of Gehrke's death.LiNeBrEaKIt pointed out how Gehrke, who lived above the tavern he owned in Watertown, suffered stomach pains in cold weather. Beginning in 1913, when he was 30, he began spending November through March in his bed on the second floor. His wife, who ran the tavern, would send up turkey sandwiches and milk on a dumbwaiter.LiNeBrEaKWhen Gehrke died, Time magazine reprinted one of his best quotes: "If more folks went to bed all winter, there wouldn't be so much trouble and confusion in the world."LiNeBrEaK"Amen," Bad Doug said.LiNeBrEaKContact Doug Moe at 608-252-6446 or dmoe@madison.com	CLIMATE CHANGE (73%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (67%); CONSTRUCTION (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (66%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (52%); NOBEL PRIZES (50%); AWARDS and PRIZES (50%)  	Construction  	AL GORE (51%)  	WISCONSIN, USA (91%); FLORIDA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	December 20, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081219-WJ-The-Wisconsin-State-Journal-Doug-Moe-column-1219  	Newspaper  	WJ  	2008 The Wisconsin State Journal   															
The Wisconsin State Journal  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 19, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Set aside global warming politics  	The Wisconsin State Journal  	COMMENTARY  	499 words  	Dec. 19--Wanted: Policymakers who can produce a measured, sensible response to global warming.LiNeBrEaKPolitical extremists need not apply.LiNeBrEaKThat message was reinforced this week by a team of UW-Madison scientists who presented a study concluding that if not for global warming, the world would be entering an ice age. LiNeBrEaKTo extremists on the right, the study was another opportunity to ridicule the alarm over global warming. Why try to stop it when it's actually saving us from a deep freeze?LiNeBrEaKTo extremists on the left, the research was a chance to ring the alarm bell even louder and belittle any dissenters for sticking their heads in the sand -- or ice.LiNeBrEaKThe two extremes should stop trying to walk on opposite sides of the road in divergent directions.LiNeBrEaKThe country should meet in the middle and head toward the same goal -- a cleaner air policy that makes sense not only in response to global warming but also to benefit public health, the economy and national security.LiNeBrEaKThe UW-Madison study added to research on the impact humans have on the climate.LiNeBrEaKThe general conclusion is that human activity sends into the atmosphere gases that produce a greenhouse effect, raising the average global temperature.LiNeBrEaKWhile the UW-Madison study found that the greenhouse effect so far has kept the world out of an ice age, researcher Steve Vavrus issued a warning about the future:LiNeBrEaK"It's very important for people to realize that this research suggests climate is very sensitive to greenhouse gases," he said. "And the huge amounts we're emitting through modern activities are probably going to have an even bigger impact."LiNeBrEaKOther research suggests the impact will pose risks for food production, public health, quality of life and more.LiNeBrEaKThere is much we don't know about global warming and how effective we could be in combatting it.LiNeBrEaKBut no matter what the answers turn out to be, there is much we can do now that makes sense for reasons beyond global warming.LiNeBrEaKFor example, three prime ways to reduce greenhouse emissions should also be atop agendas for public health, economic development and national security:LiNeBrEaK--Shifting to cleaner coal technologies and coal alternatives for generating power would lower pollution that harms public health.LiNeBrEaK--Developing home-grown renewable sources for motor fuel would relieve dependence on foreign oil and boost the U.S. economy.LiNeBrEaK--Expanding mass transit where cost-effective would reduce traffic congestion and cut road costs.LiNeBrEaKThese and other initiatives could all be elements of a policy in the national interest.LiNeBrEaKAll of us ought to be able to agree on that.

Akron Beacon Journal (Ohio)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Study lists global-warming risks to Ohio: Climate change to affect environment, economy and health, group says  	Bob Downing, The Akron Beacon Journal, Ohio  	LIFESTYLE  	488 words  	Dec. 18--Global warming poses a big threat to Ohio's health, environment and economy.LiNeBrEaKThat assessment came in a report released Wednesday by the statewide eco-group Environment Ohio at news conferences in Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo and Cincinnati. LiNeBrEaK"It's not just about polar bears and Arctic ice caps anymore," said Amy Gomberg, program director of Environment Ohio. "Climate change poses threats to Ohio's environment that could have a negative impact on our economy as well."LiNeBrEaKOhio's economic stake in dealing with carbon dioxide, a key global-warming gas, is huge: nearly $127 billion and 1. 9 million jobs that will be affected, the 34-page report says.LiNeBrEaKThe report, What's at Stake: How Global Warming Threatens the Buckeye State, says changing climate profoundly will affect Lake Erie and Ohio's farming and timber industries.LiNeBrEaKLake Erie water levels could drop 3 to 61/2 feet in the next 70 years because of increased evaporation and reduced ice cover, and that adversely would affect Great Lakes shipping, the report says. Ohio probably will face increased drought and flooding from more severe storms in the future, the report says.LiNeBrEaKHeat stress and asthma from worsening air pollution are expected to become bigger health problems for Ohioans, the report says. It suggests that troublesome insects and diseases probably will expand into Ohio if temperatures continue to climb.LiNeBrEaKEnvironment Ohio called on President-elect Barack Obama and Congress to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent by 2020 and by 80 percent by 2050, perhaps via a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax.LiNeBrEaKCap-and-trade is a flexible environmental system that sets an overall limit on emissions but allows companies that can reduce emissions easily to sell credits to other companies for which reductions would be difficult. The cap ensures that emissions will not exceed a desired amount.LiNeBrEaKFederal and state efforts to stimulate the economy should include boosting clean-energy programs, Environment Ohio said.LiNeBrEaKThe eco-group also called on Ohio to get more involved in fighting global warming. It should do more to promote energy conservation and join other states to develop a regional plan to reduce global warming pollution in the Midwest, the report says.LiNeBrEaK"Our carbon pollution problems are not all gloom and doom," Gomberg said. "The tools to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions are at our fingertips."LiNeBrEaKThe report is available at http://www.environmentohio.org.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Online Edition	Jay Bookman;  Obama and the Rev. Rick Warren 	JAY BOOKMAN; Staff  		389 words  	Thursday, December 18, 2008, 04: 00 PMLiNeBrEaKSo Barack Obama asks the Rev. Rick Warren to give the inaugural invocation, and controversy ensues.LiNeBrEaKOn one hand, the outrage is understandable. The gay community has every right to feel offended and to have expected better from Obama, especially given that Warren has spouted some real nonsense about gay marriage and California's Proposition 8. If you don't think gay Americans should be able to marry, say so. But don't fabricate some fantasy about gay marriage being a violation of your free speech or the freedom of religion, as Warren did. LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, I get the sense that Obama really does intend to try something new. He said as much in his response to the controversy, explaining "that dialogue, I think, is part of what my campaign's been all about: That we're not going to agree on every single issue, but what we have to do is to be able to create an atmosphere when we --- where we can disagree without being disagreeable and then focus on those things that we hold in common as Americans."LiNeBrEaKWhile that sounds all touchy-feely and kumbaya-ish, it may disguise some hard-headed political calculation.LiNeBrEaKIn many ways, the Republican Party of the last 20 years has been a collection of unrelated interest groups joined in an unholy alliance of necessity. In effect, the gay bashers joined forces with the gun advocates and the low-taxers and the neocons and the free traders and the anti-enviros, and they all agreed to support each other's issues in lockstep. (That's true of all political parties, by the way --- we're just talking a difference of degree here).LiNeBrEaKA lot of the GOP success in the past 20 years --- and a lot of the Democrats' frustration --- can be explained by how tightly that alliance has held together. Obama may see a shot at breaking it apart. If he disagrees with Warren on gay rights but they share common ground on global warming or health care, he'll take Warren's help to accomplish what they can on those issues.LiNeBrEaKConversely, when the topic turns to gay rights, Obama can try to recruit allies in the corporate sector who opposed him on money issues. It's a very old maxim, divide and conquer. It's coalition-breaking in the guise of coalition-building.LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/bookman/entries/2008/12/18/obama_and_the_rev_rick_warren.html	GAYS and LESBIANS (91%); SAME SEX MARRIAGE and UNIONS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); FREEDOM OF SPEECH (77%); MARRIAGE (76%); US POLITICAL PARTIES (76%); POLITICS (70%); FREEDOM OF RELIGION (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (67%); GUN CONTROL (64%); RELIGION (55%) Blogs   		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	January 1, 2009  	ENGLISH  		Newspapers  		2008 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	847 words  	Dec. 18--Former Iowa Gov. Thomas Vilsack was named Wednesday as President-elect Barack Obama's secretary of agriculture.LiNeBrEaKAs head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Vilsack is expected to carry Obama's campaign pledge to cut commodity subsidies to wealthy farmers and non-farmers.LiNeBrEaK"I congratulate former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack on his nomination for secretary of agriculture," U.S. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson said Wednesday. LiNeBrEaK"Gov. Vilsack is a strong advocate who understands the changing landscape of our nation's rural economy," said Peterson, DFL-7th District, himself a candidate for the post but which he publicly said he didn't desire.LiNeBrEaK"I look forward to working with him and President-elect Obama in advancing food, conservation and energy policies that are in the best interest of American agriculture and the American people," Peterson said.LiNeBrEaKObama at the same time announced his selection to head the Interior Department as Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is under the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaK"It's time for a new kind of leadership in Washington that's committed to using our lands in a responsible way to benefit all our families," Obama said. "That is the kind of leadership embodied by Ken Salazar and Tom Vilsack."LiNeBrEaKVilsack spoke of his commitment to "promote American leadership in response to global climate change," and declared his intent to "place nutrition at the center of all food programs administered by the department."LiNeBrEaKVilsack will oversee implementation of a new $290 billion five-year federal farm bill -- a bill that is criticized most for aid it gives to farmers but of which more than two-thirds is used to fund nutrition programs such as food stamps.LiNeBrEaKThe former Iowa governor tested the Democratic presidential waters early, but didn't stay long. While governing an ag state, he didn't focus much on agricultural issues as governor, but did provide leadership in technology, ethanol and other rural issues.LiNeBrEaK"As the former governor from our neighboring state of Iowa, Gov. Vilsack understands the unique agricultural and livestock issues that face our working farmers and ranchers," said U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, DFL-Minn., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.LiNeBrEaK"His leadership on developing the next generation of renewable fuels can help create jobs while reducing our dependence on foreign oil," she said. "I am hopeful that his Midwestern values and background will be a strong voice to ensure that American agriculture continues to provide a safe, abundant food supply and sources of renewable energy."LiNeBrEaKFarm group reaction to Vilsack's designation also focused on his work on renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaK"During his tenure as Iowa's governor, one of the nation's top agriculture-producing states, Gov. Vilsack was an ardent supporter of furthering the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol, biodiesel and wind, as well as an advocate for biotechnology," said American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman.LiNeBrEaK"He has been a strong proponent of international trade and expanding our export markets. His understanding and experience with many of the pressing issues facing agriculture today will serve him well in his new position," Stallman said.LiNeBrEaKStallman called Interior Secretary-designee Salazar "also uniquely qualified and experienced to serve as secretary of the Interior. He serves on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and has been a strong proponent of expanding the development of renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaK"He is a recipient of the Friend of Farm Bureau award for his many pro-agriculture efforts and his life-long experience as a farmer will serve him well in addressing the concerns of agriculture,": Stallman added.LiNeBrEaKKlobuchar called Salazar a fifth-generation Coloradan whose family has ranched and farmed for more than a century.LiNeBrEaK"Ken understands the land and natural resource issues that are vital to protecting the environment and securing our energy future," she said. "His leadership and pragmatism, particularly on energy issues, will be missed in the Senate but I look forward to continuing working with him in the months and years to come."LiNeBrEaKVilsack will replace another Minnesota neighbor -- former North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer, who was a recent appointment by President George W. Bush as ag secretary.LiNeBrEaK"With his opportunity to build on the accomplishments of USDA during the Bush administration, Tom Vilsack would lead a department that has made great strides in strengthening our agricultural economy, expanding conservation, leading biofuels development, securing our food supply, improving nutrition, and increasing markets for American agriculture worldwide," Schafer said.

The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Climate battle starts in Ohio, report asserts: Activists: State must lead in solution  	Tom Henry, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	447 words  	Dec. 18--Toledo and other parts of Ohio are poised to benefit if President-elect Barack Obama stands by his campaign promise to jump-start U.S. efforts on climate change, a number of activists and researchers said at separate news conferences across the state yesterday. LiNeBrEaK"If we do nothing, we're putting major elements of our economy at risk," LuCinda Hohmann, Environment Ohio field organizer, said at a presentation with two other speakers in Government Center in downtown Toledo. "It's really important that Ohio transitions itself to being a leader of the solutions."LiNeBrEaKThe environmental group organized the news conferences to roll out its Ohio-centric report, one that synthesizes and updates modeling that a num-ber of scientists have made in recent years to help localize the global issue.LiNeBrEaKOhio stands to lose billions of dollars in crop damage, shipping, fishing, forestry, boating, and popular forms of Lake Erie ecotourism, such as birding.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to higher costs for consumer goods, health costs would rise if a warmer climate results in more West Nile virus and if the resulting higher air-pollutant levels trigger more cases of asthma and other respiratory ailments. And more algae is predicted for western Lake Erie, depleting oxygen from the water for fish while driving down property values.LiNeBrEaKPeople in farm-rich and industry-heavy northwest Ohio may not realize that a third of the state is still forested. A warmer year-round climate "threatens to reshape Ohio's forest-related economy in ways we cannot imagine," David Maywhoor, Buckeye Forest Council executive director, said.LiNeBrEaKOhio has a $15 billion timber industry that employs 119,000 people. State forests also are a huge component of the recreation industry, he said.LiNeBrEaK"This is a quality-of-life issue," Kevin Egan, a University of Toledo assistant professor of environmental economics, said.LiNeBrEaKToledo could become a leader by building upon its research and development in solar energy, he said.LiNeBrEaKCoal-fired power plants are the largest single source of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas attributed to rises in the Earth's warming climate.LiNeBrEaKOhio gets nearly 90 percent of its electricity from such facilities, making it the nation's fourth largest emitter.LiNeBrEaKContact Tom Henry at:LiNeBrEaKthenry@theblade.comLiNeBrEaKor 419-724-6079.

The Boston Globe 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	A novel, Nobel idea at Energy  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A18  	427 words  	WHEN Steven Chu won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997, he said, "It's remarkable what simple curiosity can lead to." His appointment by President-elect Barack Obama as energy secretary breaks an eight-year gag on scientific curiosity at a critical time for the country and the planet. LiNeBrEaKOne of the Bush administration's most egregious insults to America's collective intelligence was the repeated deletion of scientific findings on global warming from reports and testimonies from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The omissions were meant to dull public understanding of the impact of autos and industries on global warming and of how climate change will worsen disasters, diseases, and disparities. Nearly every year brought fresh news of deletions.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush's first EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, quit in 2003 amid the censorship. In 2006, top NASA climate scientist James Hansen said the administration tried to muzzle him on the need to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKChu, the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, shared the Nobel for his work cooling and trapping atoms with lasers for more detailed examination. He would be the first energy secretary who is a current scientist. All previous 11 energy secretaries going back to President Carter ran chemical or power companies or were military men or politicians. The second energy secretary under Carter, Charles Duncan, had been a Coca-Cola executive. Chu would be a secretary who knows how things go better with atoms.LiNeBrEaKThe appointment is being hailed by environmental groups who see Chu as a science nerd who can ably articulate how snowpacks and glaciers are disappearing, and how the poor will disproportionately be hit by droughts and storm surges spawned by climate change. He is unafraid to call coal an environmental "nightmare." He comes from those corners of curiosity that leave no rock, bacteria, yeast, ray of sun, or blade of switchgrass unturned, or unexamined for alternative energy. He has even cited the potential of decaying logs crawling with termites that convert cellulose into ethanol.LiNeBrEaKChu has forged industry partnerships without being accused of selling out, attracting $500 million from Big Oil's BP for biofuel research.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Chu told Reuters, "If I were emperor, I would put the pedal to the floor on energy efficiency and conservation."LiNeBrEaKHis appointment is the best sign yet that eight years of official hostility to science is about to end. We hope he guns the engine on energy independence.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Obama picks Salazar for interior, Vilsack for agriculture  	Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	658 words  	Dec. 18--WASHINGTON -- Every stream tells a story on the half-day drive from Denver to the Salazar family ranch, every culvert a tale of water and politics. Ken Salazar knows them all, a font of knowledge tapped by President-elect Barack Obama on Wednesday when he introduced the Democratic senator from Colorado, whose ancestors farmed and ranched the American southwest for more than 400 years, as his choice to lead the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists call Salazar too centrist and too friendly to drilling and mining interests to run the department. LiNeBrEaK"His overall record is decidedly mixed and is especially weak in the arenas most important to the next Secretary of the Interior -- protecting scientific integrity, combating global warming, reforming energy development and protecting endangered species," said the Center for Biological Diversity in Arizona.LiNeBrEaKA letter opposing Salazar's nomination was signed by about 50 wildlife biologists and members of environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKBut in Salazar and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack -- a longtime chief executive of a major farm state, chosen Wednesday for agriculture secretary -- Obama is adding two rural-tuned voices to the Cabinet of the most urban president in at least 100 years. Salazar brings a familiarity with farm and ranching interests to the contentious politics of Western water scarcity.LiNeBrEaKMost conservationists and rural interest groups that weighed in Wednesday praised the nominations, with many saying that by choosing Salazar and Vilsack, Obama has taken a step toward fulfilling his campaign promise of revitalizing rural economies.LiNeBrEaK"We're very encouraged" by the choices, said Mark Maslyn, executive director of the American Farm Bureau, which recently honored Salazar for his work on agricultural issues. "They're men of substance, and they have a record" of supporting the renewable energy efforts Maslyn called "critical" for rural economies and the nation.LiNeBrEaKSalazar barnstormed rural Colorado on Obama's behalf in the months before the November election, promising men in work boots and women in cowboy hats that the Illinois senator understood their plight better than a fellow Westerner, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). He drew nods when he criticized McCain for raising the prospect of renegotiating the Colorado River Compact, which apportions water among seven Western states.LiNeBrEaKIn a recent interview on the state's Eastern Plains, Salazar sipped from a plastic bottle with a "protect Colorado water" label. He acknowledged the challenge he had to overcome pitching a South Side Chicago candidate in agricultural areas, but he said voters responded when he stressed Obama's support for the most recent farm bill and for energy alternatives such as wind, solar and biofuels, which are booming in rural Colorado.LiNeBrEaK"When I explain that to people in rural Colorado," Salazar said, "people come our way."LiNeBrEaKSalazar has drawn praise as a consensus-builder on water issues. Obama praised Salazar's experience in a news conference Wednesday and, in a shot at the Bush administration, said it would help him lead an Interior Department that "cleans up its act."LiNeBrEaKBetween Salazar, Vilsack and other energy-related appointees announced last week, Obama said, "I am confident that we have the team that we need to make [the] rural agenda America's agenda, to create millions of new green jobs, to free our nation from its dependence on oil and to help preserve this planet for our children."LiNeBrEaKBettina Boxall of the Los Angeles Times contributed from Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.com	ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); FAMILY FARMS (90%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (89%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (89%); POLITICS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (89%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (88%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); ELECTIONS (77%); LEGISLATORS (76%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (75%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (75%); BIODIVERSITY (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (75%); BIOMASS (75%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (74%); SOLAR ENERGY (74%); SCIENCE NEWS (74%); BIOLOGY (74%); WIND ENERGY (74%); WILDLIFE (73%); INTERVIEWS (72%); AGRICULTURE (66%); GLOBAL WARMING (54%); BIOFUELS (50%); US PRESIDENTS (77%)  	Government  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); KEN SALAZAR (94%); JOHN MCCAIN (52%); TOM VILSACK (92%)  	DENVER, CO, USA (92%); CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%) COLORADO, USA (95%); ILLINOIS, USA (92%); SOUTHWEST, USA (92%); IOWA, USA (92%); SOUTHWEST USA (88%); ARIZONA, USA (79%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081218-TB-OBAMA-STAFF-20081218  	Newspaper  	TB  	2008 Chicago Tribune   				CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (56%)  											
Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Ban those bitter diatribes  	By Bill Mann Columnist  	MY TOWN; Alameda; Oakland-Berkeley; News; Local  	652 words  	WHEN ONE POLITICAL party is out of power, the voice of the (ostensibly) loyal opposition inevitably grows louder.LiNeBrEaKTake MSNBC's Keith Olbermann, for example. He has been the chief media voice railing against The Incumbent Texan for the past two years, bless his heart. But since Barack Obama's election, Olbermann sounds almost reserved on his "Countdown." This is as it should be, although Olbermann is peevish by nature, and there will always be plenty of southern senators to assail.LiNeBrEaKThe point here today: Expect the sweethearts at Fox News   which Olbermann calls "Fox Noise"   to become increasingly bitter and rancorous when Obama assumes office. LiNeBrEaKBipartisan, bischmartisan.LiNeBrEaKDon't forget: It was during Bill Clinton's presidency (in 1996) that Fox News was spawned, and it became an instant national megaphone   and a ratings success   to rail against Clinton and call for his impeachment. Even with Ann Coulter's jaw wired shut (this, alas, is temporary) Prince Rupert of Murdoch's troops have already begun their verbal assaults on the popular president-elect.LiNeBrEaKMy holiday request: Could the mainstream media please try to ignore Roger Ailes' ideological pit bulls on Fox News? Couldn't the rest of cable and broadcast news please restrain itself from responding to these bitter diatribes?LiNeBrEaKJust because an extremist hack like Sean Hannity raises an issue   no matter how bogus   doesn't mean it deserves a serious reply. Let's ignore this sideshow.LiNeBrEaKMost of the time, Fox's manufactured "issues" don't deserve the dignity of a reply anyway. (Remember the Obamas' "terrorist fist bump?")LiNeBrEaKIt's not because they're conservatives, because they're not. They're right-wingers. They're extremists, just like KSFO morning venomist Lee Rogers and national radio hatemonger Michael Savage. George Will, to cite one example, is a conservative. He's NOT a right-wing extremist.LiNeBrEaKLanguage is important, especially in establishing dialogue rather than shouting at each other. Essayist Camille Paglia has made the point that Fox News and its friends have conjoined the terms "liberals' and "leftists." Leftists nationalize banks and corporations, she correctly points out. Liberals believe in social justice and racial and gender equality, among other things. There's a big difference.LiNeBrEaKStill, for years, Fox, KSFO's Rogers and other extremists have been using the terms "liberals" and "leftists" interchangeably. Obama may in fact be a liberal on some issues, but he's not a leftist. The distinction is important.LiNeBrEaKSo let's lower our voices and restore a civil tone in civil matters.LiNeBrEaKLet's also get rid of self-serving terms created by the outgoing government. Like "climate change" instead of global warming. Or another PR term, "death tax" instead of what it has always been called, the inheritance tax. Let's also banish the ghoulish term "partial-birth abortion" and restore the far more accurate modifier "late-term." The current administration and its confederates (a good term when you think about it) have hijacked our language for purely political reasons.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of which, could we please get rid of the ridiculous "homeland security" monicker and call it something else? "Homeland" sounds like something Stalin would use.LiNeBrEaKAs for the dreaded (by Fox, anyway) epithet, "socialism," let's de-stigmatize that, too, please.LiNeBrEaKWhen we moved to Montreal, I was a young Republican from an FDR-hating GOP family. The Canadian experience changed me in many ways. I learned up there that a bit of socialism, properly applied, is a good thing for everyone.LiNeBrEaKIn the early 1970s, the province of Manitoba took over the car-insurance industry and went to a single-payer system. A bunch of lefty socialists, I scoffed at the time.LiNeBrEaKThen I found out what that meant in practice: Every Manitoban had his/her car-insurance premium reduced   to an amazing $49 annually. Suddenly, socialism looked pretty good.LiNeBrEaKReach Bill Mann at newsmann@mannpublications.org	TELEVISION PROGRAMMING (90%); NETWORK TELEVISION (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); SOCIAL JUSTICE (86%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); CABLE TELEVISION (73%); CABLE INDUSTRY (65%); TERRORISM (65%); NATIONALIZATION (64%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%); US PRESIDENTS (77%)  	NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING (95%); SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS (95%)  	BARACK OBAMA (92%); BILL CLINTON (70%); ROGER AILES (55%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (90%) CALIFORNIA, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  		FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC (95%)  													
Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Oakland takes aim at restoring local economy  	By Kamika Dunlap Oakland Tribune  	MY TOWN; Alameda; News; Local  	980 words  	OAKLAND   Eleven months ago, Pat King was a successful loan officer making about $10,000 a month. Today, the economic crisis has left the unemployed single mother living on pennies to raise her 17-year-old son in West Oakland.LiNeBrEaK"I saw it coming," said King, 45. "Loans were flying out the air, and people could put anything on paper. Then slowly loans that I was trying to get approved started to be more difficult, and the industry began to put in more restrictions." LiNeBrEaKKing is among scores of Oakland residents who are struggling, out of work or in serious financial trouble. She said she is "just hanging on day by day" and not living out the American dream.LiNeBrEaKThrough the CalWorks program, King receives temporary financial assistance and employment-focused services based on state guidelines for her income, property and family size.LiNeBrEaKSo far this year, nearly 2 million Americans have lost their jobs. Unemployment is at 7. 1 percent in Alameda County and 8 percent statewide.LiNeBrEaKIn the shadow of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, city officials and community leaders have banded together. They say it will take a strong local effort to support President-elect Barack Obama's plan for a major economic recovery and jobs-creation package.LiNeBrEaK"We need a game-changing strategy," Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums said Thursday at City Hall. He was joined by Councilmember Desley Brooks (Eastmont-Seminary), Councilmember-elect Rebecca Kaplan, the Urban Strategies Council and ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now.LiNeBrEaKThey gathered as a part of a national coalition to launch the "Jobs and Economic Recovery Now!" campaign. The economic recovery plan is the largest U.S. public works program since the interstate highway system and includes projects to repair bridges, roads, as well as create green-collar jobs to reduce energy and global warming emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The Green Jobs Core was pioneered in Oakland to fight poverty and pollution," Dellums said. "We can help lead the country in a new direction and open up a level of employment that's extraordinary."LiNeBrEaKThe group agreed that saving the economy and the environment are equally important and urged residents to create the "change they want to see locally."LiNeBrEaKDellums, who was appointed Thursday to serve on the United States Conference of Mayors' Working Group on the MainStreet Economic Recovery Plan, said the panel will be meeting with Obama's economic team to discuss how to rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, grass-roots groups, including the Alameda County Community Asset Network, are working in conjunction with "Bank on California," a new initiative by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and former President Bill Clinton to help low-income families build savings.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is to help the "unbanked," many of whom are poor or immigrants, gain access to banking services including prepaid debit cards, penalty-free fee accounts, credit repair services and financial coaching and counseling.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the Brookings Institution, 11 percent of California's 25 million residents do not have checking or savings accounts. About 21 percent of African-American households and 24 percent of Latino households do not have a bank account. The goal of the program is to create 100,000 accounts in two years among residents in San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and Fresno.LiNeBrEaKJohn Brauer is a founding member of the asset network and executive director of the Workforce Collaborative. The Oakland-based nonprofit provides job readiness and placement services to people with little work history or who face barriers to employment, including homelessness or records of incarceration.LiNeBrEaK"In this economy, the folks we serve are the last hired and the first fired," Brauer said. "I think people now more so than ever are looking for training as a necessity to compete better."LiNeBrEaKCommunity and city leaders say addressing the economic recession and neighborhoods impacted by the foreclosure crisis will take a multilayered strategy. ACORN has teamed with the Urban Strategies Council, a nonprofit community building and advocacy agency, to restore blighted neighborhoods and redevelop vacant residential properties.LiNeBrEaKThrough a community land trust, they plan to purchase and rehabilitate 200 bank-owned properties in Oakland and sell the houses   but not the land   at low-interest loans to residents. By maintaining ownership of the land, the land trust could keep the prices of the homes affordable and gain income as a trust from the appreciation of the land.LiNeBrEaKAndy Nelsen, director of Economic Opportunity Programs at the Urban Strategies Council, said the public-private partnership will help create so-called "green-collar" construction jobs and neighborhood stability and stimulate the local economy.LiNeBrEaK"Banks and lenders have left us with a real mess to be cleaned up in urban areas,'' he said. "But a stimulus package gives us a chance to turn this into a real opportunity.''LiNeBrEaKReach Kamika Dunlap at 510-208-6448 or kdunlap@bayareanewsgroup.com.Short on cashLiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKAbout one in four Bay Area households, or 24. 7 percent, has incomes too low to meet basic needs. One in four people older than age 15 in Alameda County don't have bank accounts or rely on check-cashing services. In Alameda County in 2006, 30 percent of tax filers at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites had no checking account and 59 percent had no savings account.

The Denver Post 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Guest Commentary Sound the alarm on climate change  	Waleed Abdalati  	Pg. B-13  	633 words  	Environmental scientists who have been watching Earth's climate change dramatically in recent decades recognize an immediate need for comprehensive, coordinated action to address the threats of climate change.LiNeBrEaKFrom ground and from space, we see an Arctic in the midst of rapid change: The blanket of sea ice that once covered much of the Arctic Ocean in summer is disappearing. Once-frozen soils are thawing, and buildings, pipelines and forests lean on sinking foundations. Glaciers are disintegrating and ice sheets are shedding massive amounts of ice, feeding already-rising seas.LiNeBrEaKAs predicted for decades, human- caused warming is sweeping across the Earth. This will have impact on water resources, public health, coastal infrastructure, ecosystems and agriculture. No place on the planet will be left untouched. LiNeBrEaKLeaders in both major parties have given voice to concerns about climate change. Now is the time to act, and swiftly. Climate change is critical to the U.S. economy, national security, international standing, and environmental and cultural heritage. Consider the findings of thousands of scientists around the globe:LiNeBrEaKDwindling sea ice. Since the advent of satellite monitoring in the 1970s, summer Arctic sea ice extent has declined by 39 percent, further amplifying warming and having significant biological, ecological and societal impacts.LiNeBrEaKThawing ground. Across the Arctic, permafrost has warmed up to 13 degrees in the last century - with about half of that increase occurring in the last 25 years. Degrading permafrost releases ancient stored carbon, creating a warming feedback not yet included in most climate models.LiNeBrEaKIce loss in Greenland. Warming has caused a 30 percent increase in melt area of the Greenland ice sheet since 1979, and ice now flows off the sheet much faster than a decade ago.LiNeBrEaKIce loss in Antarctica. Oceanic and atmospheric patterns have protected most of Antarctica from warming. However, the Antarctic Peninsula, which juts into the southern Atlantic, has warmed by about 4 1/2 degrees in the last 50 years. Ice shelves the size of small states have begun disintegrating.LiNeBrEaKRising seas. Oceans are rising because of melting glaciers and ice sheets and because water expands as it warms. Seas have risen twice as quickly in the last 15 years than in the previous 50, and at the current rate of warming, will rise another foot by 2100. However, if warming continues to accelerate and polar ice sheets begin to shrink more rapidly, a rise of 3 feet or much more is possible. That would affect 145 million people around the world, at a cost of nearly $1 trillion, according to the United Nations.LiNeBrEaKAreas of uncertainty remain, from the roles that air pollution and clouds will play in a warming world to the effect of warmer oceans on hurricanes. But we have enough data today to compel global mitigation, to reduce emissions and lessen the impact of climate change in the future.LiNeBrEaKClimate change is not an intractable issue. Other harmful global environmental trends have been successfully addressed, most notably the destruction of the ozone layer. We believe such nimble responses are again possible and necessary, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare communities for change. As before, with great leadership, these actions will create new opportunities for our country to prosper.LiNeBrEaKWe ask President-elect Barack Obama to lead us and the international community - now.LiNeBrEaKWaleed Abdalati is head of NASA's Cryospheric Sciences Branch at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Md.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Inventor's 'refrigeration system' for planet shows promise, but scientists are skeptical  	By Greg Gordon, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1791 words  	WASHINGTON _ Ron Ace says that his breakthrough moments have come at unexpected times _ while he lay in bed, eased his aging Cadillac across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge or steered a tractor around his rustic, five-acre property.LiNeBrEaKIn the seclusion of his Maryland home, Ace has spent three years glued to the Internet, studying the Earth's climate cycles and careening from one epiphany to another _ a 69-year-old loner with the moxie to try to solve one of the greatest threats to mankind.LiNeBrEaKNow, backed by a computer model, the little-known inventor is making public a U.S. patent petition for what he calls the most "practical, nontoxic, affordable, rapidly achievable" and beneficial way to curb global warming and a resulting catastrophic ocean rise.LiNeBrEaKSpray gigatons of seawater into the air, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, and let Mother Nature do the rest, he says. LiNeBrEaKThe evaporating water, Ace said, would cool the Earth in multiple ways: First, the sprayed droplets would transform to water vapor, a change that absorbs thermal energy near ground level; then the rising vapor would condense into sunlight-reflecting clouds and cooling rain, releasing much of the stored energy into space in the form of infrared radiation.LiNeBrEaKMcClatchy Newspapers has followed Ace's work for three years and obtained a copy of his 2007 patent petition for what he calls "a colossal refrigeration system with a 100,000-fold performance multiplier."LiNeBrEaK"The Earth has a giant air-conditioning problem," he said. "I'm proposing to put a thermostat on the planet."LiNeBrEaKAlthough it might sound preposterous, a computer model run by an internationally known global warming scientist suggests that Ace's giant humidifier might just work.LiNeBrEaKKenneth Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, roughly simulated Ace's idea in recent months on a model that's used extensively by top scientists to study global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe simulated evaporation of about one-half inch of additional water everywhere in the world produced immediate planetary cooling effects that were projected to reach nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit within 20 or 30 years, Caldeira said.LiNeBrEaK"In the computer simulation, evaporating water was almost as effective as directly transferring ... energy to space, which was surprising to me," he said.LiNeBrEaKAce said that the cooling effect would be several times greater if the model were refined to spray the same amount of seawater at strategic locations.LiNeBrEaKHe proposes to install 1,000 or more devices that spray water 20 to 200 feet into the air, depending on conditions, from barren stretches of the West African coast, bluffs on deserted Atlantic Ocean isles, deserts adjoining the African, South American and Mediterranean coasts and other arid or windy sites. To maximize cloud formation, he'd avoid the already humid tropics, where most water vapor quickly turns to rain.LiNeBrEaK"It does seem like evaporating water outside the tropics would be more effective," Caldeira said.LiNeBrEaKThe spraying would be targeted mainly at higher, northern latitudes, where Ace thinks that air currents known as Ferrel Cells could deliver heavy snow to the Arctic, offsetting the melting of the polar icecap.LiNeBrEaKIt stretches the imagination _ and perhaps credulity _ to suggest that a solitary inventor with no government support could solve global warming, especially a man who never earned a degree despite studying physics for much of a decade at the University of Maryland.LiNeBrEaKSeveral scientists who reviewed Ace's patent petition for McClatchy reacted with caution to outright derision over its possibilities, but some softened their views upon learning of the computer model.LiNeBrEaKAce's invention rests on some unconventional theories.LiNeBrEaKHe contends that the planet is 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit too hot to stop the meltdown from the last ice age 20,000 years ago, not a couple of degrees too warm, as government scientists say. He proposes to lower the temperature by 3. 5 degrees to 4 degrees, leaving a cushion to avoid tipping toward another ice age and always retaining the option of turning the sprayers down or off, if needed.LiNeBrEaKHe suspects that deforestation is a major cause of global warming, not just because trees absorb carbon dioxide, but also because a large-leaf tree can wick up and evaporate hundreds of gallons of water in a single day. Ace said that the absence of tens of billions of trees, destroyed by southward-creeping glaciers thousands of years ago and again by man's recent timber cutting, has left the planet "slightly dehumidified," reducing cloud cover.LiNeBrEaKAce points to recent research that found snow cover is shrinking even at below-freezing altitudes on Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro and other mountaintops, a change that's attributed to declining snowfall.LiNeBrEaKIt would be relatively easy to design spraying equipment to carry out his plan to fill that water vapor deficit, but it would take a major international effort to install 1,000 large spraying devices, or thousands of smaller ones. If fully deployed, the 15,800 cubic meters of sprayed water per second would be equivalent to the flow at the mouth of the Mississippi River and would require enough energy to power a medium-sized city.LiNeBrEaKHowever, spraying only a portion of that amount for a decade would be enough to cool the equivalent of current man-made global warming, estimated to range up to 0. 76 degrees Fahrenheit, Ace said. Such cooling, he said, could buy mankind decades of time for more research and precision.LiNeBrEaKDepending on its scale, the water evaporation scheme would cost anywhere from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions of dollars a year, but Ace said it still would have "a net positive financial effect." It would prevent global warming-related damage, he said, and the extra rainfall would provide the cheapest way to transport water to drought-stricken regions, counteract desert expansions, increase natural irrigation for crops and boost the output of hydroelectric power plants.LiNeBrEaKAdded rainfall also would reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, because cold raindrops carry more carbon dioxide back to the oceans than is released when water evaporates, he said.LiNeBrEaKCaldeira's computer results could surprise many scientists because water vapor is a greenhouse gas widely recognized to be more powerful than carbon dioxide. The simulation suggests, however, that water vapor's cooling effects overwhelm its heat-trapping properties.LiNeBrEaKAce has his doubters, partly because he took the patent route rather than submitting his idea for scientific peer review. A patent certifies that an invention is unique, not that it would work.LiNeBrEaKDouglas Davis, an atmospheric chemist at Georgia Tech University who's known Ace for years, lauded some of his inventions but called his global cooling idea "big-time speculation" because so little is known about the behavior of water in the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK"In the case of the computer models that are used for global warming, I know that the hydrological cycle is a critical component of those models, and the hydrological cycle is not well understood," Davis said, stressing that he's not a climate expert.LiNeBrEaKDavid Travis, a University of Wisconsin-Whitewater professor who's studied clouds extensively, praised Ace's innovation, but said he's "generally opposed to geo-engineering" solutions and can't imagine evaporating water on a large enough scale to have a near-term effect.LiNeBrEaKCaldeira, who plans to submit his computer findings in the spring for peer-reviewed publication, is among scientists so concerned about sluggish progress in curbing greenhouse gases that they met last year to consider geo-engineering options.LiNeBrEaK"Ideas such as Ron Ace's should be carefully and impartially evaluated," Caldeira told McClatchy. "Every brilliant innovation in the history of technology looked a little bit loony when first proposed."LiNeBrEaKAce's invention looks less loony when compared to some others. NASA scientists conceived the multitrillion-dollar idea of orbiting megaton mirrors in space to deflect sunlight. Other scientists have proposed reflecting solar energy by placing mirrors on thousands of high-altitude balloons, by foaming the oceans' surfaces or by filling the upper atmosphere with tiny sulfates or inert particles, or by adding water droplets to low-level ocean clouds from 1,500 unmanned boats.LiNeBrEaKAce said he thinks that mankind is "headed straight for a disaster."LiNeBrEaKBy focusing solely on solutions that deal with carbon in the atmosphere, Ace thinks that mankind won't prevent a "big glacier melt" that could lift ocean levels 20 feet and wipe out the world's seaports.LiNeBrEaKOne thing is certain: Ace is dead serious. He's tenaciously compiled more than a thousand pages of research, sometimes during all-night binges despite a fight with cancer. He said he's invested large sums in patenting his global-warming inventions.LiNeBrEaKAce said he's created more than 700 inventions, starting with a gravity-measuring machine he built in seventh grade to record passes of the sun and moon on cloudy days. He's won nearly 70 U.S. and foreign patents, but said he's lacked the time and money to submit petitions for all but about two dozen of his inventions. None has led to big commercial success.LiNeBrEaKAce said that his unusual blend of expertise in physics, optics and heat transfer has helped him understand the role of light-scattering clouds and water's influence on climate.LiNeBrEaKMaintaining a hermitlike existence during the past three years, he's churned out more than half a dozen inventions that could help curb global warming, including several that he said would cut energy use.LiNeBrEaKHe often speaks in professorial tones, but can quickly morph into a cynic or a feisty debater over the laws of physics, always mindful of the role of "the big heater" _ the sun.LiNeBrEaKAce said that he gradually steeped himself in the science of global warming because of "curiosity, nothing more."LiNeBrEaK"I never saw myself making a dime on it," said Ace, who said he'd donate his patent to the U.S. government if he gets one.

LiNeBrEaKA recent Texas AandM University study, based on satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, warned that if water vapor levels in the atmosphere continue to rise, it "could guarantee" an increase of several degrees Celsius in the Earth's temperatures over the next century.LiNeBrEaKThese scientists warned of potential "positive feedback," in which water vapor traps heat near the surface, the warmer temperatures cause increasing ocean surface water to evaporate, producing even more water vapor, further heightening the trapping effect and beginning the cycle anew.LiNeBrEaKKenneth Caldeira, a climate scientist for the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University whose computer simulation of Ace's invention suggests it would significantly cool the planet, said that scientists are still trying to sort out the complicated role of water vapor.LiNeBrEaKAmong its mixed effects:LiNeBrEaK_It absorbs latent heat near the earth's surface and transports it to higher altitudes, for a cooling effect.LiNeBrEaK_When it condenses at higher altitudes, it releases the latent heat, which then can radiate into space, producing more cooling.LiNeBrEaK_It's a greenhouse gas, trapping heat and causing warming.LiNeBrEaK_It can form low clouds that reflect solar energy, a cooling effect.LiNeBrEaK_It can form more high clouds, which block some sunlight but mostly prevent the release of infrared radiation from below, another warming effect.LiNeBrEaKRobert Park, a retired University of Maryland physics professor, said scientists are right to worry that water vapor and other greenhouse gases could lead to thermal runaway _ a cycle where two or more factors feed off another to propel temperatures higher _ but that no one has proved that it's occurring because the atmosphere is so complex.LiNeBrEaK"This is what makes climate such a horrendously difficult thing to calculate ... by far the most difficult calculation that man has ever attempted," Park said.LiNeBrEaKAce hopes that his global cooling invention will help settle the matter.LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKThe Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology: http://dge.stanford.edu/DGE/CIWDGE/CIWDGE.HTML	ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ASTRONOMY and SPACE (77%); CLIMATOLOGY (77%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (77%); PHYSICS (77%); RESEARCH (77%); MODELING and SIMULATION (73%); SPACE and AERONAUTICS AGENCIES (72%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); INTERNET and WWW (65%); SOLAR ENERGY (64%); COMPUTER SIMULATION (53%)  			EARTH (92%); MARYLAND, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 21, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081218-BC-ENV-WARMING-VAPOR-EXCLUSIVE-ADV21  	Newspaper  	WA  	2008 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (80%)  		TEXAS A and M UNIVERSITY (58%); NATIONAL AERONAUTICS and SPACE ADMINISTRATION (58%); STANFORD UNIVERSITY (56%)  				WASHINGTON   							
Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	LETTERS Perpetuating the green energy scam  		B; Pg. 6B  	814 words  	To the editor:LiNeBrEaKSunday's commentary by Keith Schwer, "Act now on renewable energy," calls for comment. I would classify Mr. Schwer's expertise in this field - he's the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at UNLV - as totally lacking.LiNeBrEaKWind and solar generation of electricity has a 40-year history of small, expensive and unreliable performance in spite of considerable subsidies and tax advantages. Wind turbines are veritable Cuisinarts for birds while solar panels kill all life in their shade. Geothermal generation is older still at about 60 years; it produces enormous amounts of dangerous waste, such as radioactive strontium and cesium and huge quantities of deadly arsenic. LiNeBrEaKAlso, those units are small, producing 20 to 30 megawatts of electricity each as compared with an 1,100-megawatt nuclear plant. Those three "alternative" sources of energy are also unreliable by being mostly unavailable during hours of maximum demand. Any effort to increase their miserable and tremendously expensive contribution to our energy needs would plunge this country into the ranks of Third World countries.LiNeBrEaKI would advise the parents of college-bound youngsters to avoid teachers such as Mr. Schwer. His mention of the global warming scam (after 10 years of serious cooling, this hoax has been transformed into "climate change") goes contrary to the 31,000 scientists - 9,000 of them with Ph.D.s - who have affirmed by their signatures their negative opinion of any human-caused global warming.LiNeBrEaKMarc JericLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKBudget busterLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKI find it very interesting that UNLV has an estimated $50 million budget shortfall and administrators just can't figure out where to cut anything.LiNeBrEaKI recall that the Legislature was warned that the dental school, which was created years ago under the guise of providing for the indigent and not costing the state a penny, now costs the taxpayers approximately $50 million a year.LiNeBrEaKLet the school go private or just let the school go.LiNeBrEaKRon WagnerLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKEducation firstLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKI am currently a student at the College of Southern Nevada and have two children in the Clark County School District. I have to ask myself and every other citizen of Las Vegas, "What are we doing?" If we don't stand up and let the Nevada Legislature know how much we value education, we can expect more cuts and a bigger mess than we already have.LiNeBrEaKWe might ask ourselves if we aren't sending the message to our young people that education doesn't matter, and if this doesn't have something to do with our high dropout rate.LiNeBrEaKNevada needs to wake up and fight for its education system before it's too late.LiNeBrEaKI know times are hard. We all feel it, but this is not a sacrifice we can afford to make. I hope that the people of Nevada will read this, and that enough of us will take a stand and let our legislators know we want education to be funded first.LiNeBrEaKTammy MyersLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKTipping pointLiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKMy first reaction after reading the letter from M. Dykes in Saturday's Review-Journal, which seemed to be soliciting tips for teachers, was "Puh-leeze! Give me a break!"LiNeBrEaKMaybe the writer thinks it would be a good idea for teachers to put a tip jar on their desks. What's next? Maybe other taxpayer-funded employees could lay a tip envelope on you whenever they perform their normal job responsibilities. Perhaps the policeman could give you one when he hands you your speeding ticket. Maybe firemen could leave a tip envelope after putting out the fire.LiNeBrEaKWhen can we expect to see a sign that says "Tips appreciated" on city buses? And don't forget the people in the county tax office; they do their job well, too, when they get your tax statement mailed out on time.LiNeBrEaKDon't overlook the county judges. I do believe District Judge Jackie Glass deserves a filled tip jar for a job well done on the O.J. Simpson trial.LiNeBrEaKI know that many Las Vegas workers depend on tips to supplement their wages, but do we need to also tip full-time county and city employees we already support with our taxes? I think not.LiNeBrEaKS.G. HayesLiNeBrEaKLas VegasLiNeBrEaKTourism bailout?LiNeBrEaKTo the editor:LiNeBrEaKSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants billions of dollars for Detroit and zero for Las Vegas.LiNeBrEaKHere is a guy destroying his own state. He wants to save $100-per-hour automaker jobs while thousands of hotel and casino workers are laid off.LiNeBrEaKR.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Same old, same old  		B; Pg. 6B  	300 words  	With each Cabinet appointment, President-elect Barack Obama's pledges of "change" become more hollow.LiNeBrEaKTo run the Department of Education, Mr. Obama selected Arne Duncan, an old buddy of his who has run the Chicago public schools for seven years. While Mr. Duncan embraces charter schools, his promotion was well received by the nation's two large teacher unions. LiNeBrEaK"Arne Duncan actually reaches out and tries to do things in a collaborative way," Randi Weingarten, head of the 1. 4 million-member American Federation of Teachers, told The Associated Press earlier this month.LiNeBrEaKThere's nothing wrong with collaboration, of course. But fixing all that's wrong with America's public schools will require occasionally upsetting established educational interests. Mr. Duncan has no such track record in that regard.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, don't hold your breath waiting for any major shakeup in national education policy.LiNeBrEaKDitto for our Byzantine, Depression-era agriculture policies, given that Mr. Obama has tabbed former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack to run the Department of Agriculture. Mr. Vilsack, an attorney by trade who learned to love farm handouts as a matter of political survival in his home state, has been an ardent backer of ethanol subsidies.LiNeBrEaKHe said his priorities, in order, will be "improving profitability for farmers," the need for "sustainable practices" and fighting "global climate change."LiNeBrEaKNoticeably absent from that list is any expressed concern about the plethora of subsidies that the department doles out courtesy of taxpayer to rich farmers - or even dead farmers. Nowhere did Mr. Vilsack express any concern about the higher commodity prices U.S. consumers must pay in order for the Department of Agriculture to prop up inefficient producers and block cheaper imports.LiNeBrEaKChange?

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Kempthorne expects smooth sailing  	Henry Brean  	B; Pg. 3B  	493 words  	LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKBarack Obama won the presidency with promises of change, but outgoing Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne expects no major shake-ups when it comes to federal water policy on the Colorado River. LiNeBrEaKAt a meeting of water managers Wednesday in Las Vegas, Kempthorne praised the president-elect's selection of U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar to head the Department of the Interior.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne said he has worked closely with Salazar over the past 2&frac12; years and the Democratic senator from Colorado clearly understands the complexities of Western water issues.LiNeBrEaKHe expects Salazar to help foster the spirit of cooperation that has emerged in recent years among the seven states that share the Colorado River.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne's remarks came during the final day of the Colorado River Water Users Association's annual conference at Caesars Palace.LiNeBrEaKAfter his speech, Kempthorne said responsible management of the river has little to do with which party controls the White House.LiNeBrEaK"I don't believe it's a partisan issue," he said.LiNeBrEaKSouthern Nevada Water Authority chief Pat Mulroy echoed Kempthorne's comments about Salazar. "He'll do a fabulous job," she said.LiNeBrEaKMulroy went on to praise Kempthorne for steering negotiations among the seven Colorado River states without dictating what had to be done. "He was never one to overexert his power," she said.LiNeBrEaKAs the nation's 50th interior secretary, Salazar will find "much work to be done" to guide the Colorado through drought, climate change and increased pressure from population growth, Kempthorne said.LiNeBrEaKIn the process, he said, his successor will have to keep the seven states from backsliding into "costly litigation" and "fruitless acrimony."LiNeBrEaKPerhaps the biggest challenge Salazar will face concerns relations with Mexico, which is guaranteed by treaty a share of water from the Colorado.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne said productive talks are under way with Mexico over a tangle of issues concerning water supply and the river's ecology but the discussions are still in their infancy.LiNeBrEaKThe Las Vegas Valley gets 90 percent of its drinking water from the Colorado River, which supplies 25 million people from Wyoming to California.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne received a standing ovation before and after Wednesday's speech.LiNeBrEaKAfterward, he passed out plaques to Mulroy and other representatives from the Colorado River states commemorating the shortage-sharing agreement signed last year during the Colorado River Water Users conference in Las Vegas.LiNeBrEaKThe sweeping agreement lays out new rules for jointly operating the twin reservoirs of Lake Mead and Lake Powell during extended dry spells such as the one that has gripped the region since 2001.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne called it the "most important agreement on the river since the original 1922 compact" that divided the Colorado among the seven states.LiNeBrEaKThe people present that day, Kempthorne among them, "made history with the stroke of a pen," he said.LiNeBrEaKContact reporter Henry Brean at hbrean @reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0350.

The Macon Telegraph (Georgia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Unseasonably warm weather won't stick around much longer  	Chuck Thompson, The Macon Telegraph, Ga.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	409 words  	Dec. 18--It's beginning to look a lot like, well, early fall maybe. It certainly doesn't feel like Christmas, no matter what the calendar says. LiNeBrEaKBut this unseasonably warm weather isn't expected to last much longer.LiNeBrEaKForecaster Shirley Lamback with the National Weather Service said Wednesday that highs in Macon are expected to remain in the mid-70s through Saturday.LiNeBrEaKAfter that, a new front pushing through will begin to push temperatures back toward the normal range of mid-30s for overnight lows and high 50s for daytime highs.LiNeBrEaK"The forecast is for 30 degrees Monday night, so that will be the first it will be below freezing again," she said.LiNeBrEaKLamback said a frontal boundary that drifted over the state before stalling in north Georgia the last few days brought the warm weather, and until the new front arrives over the weekend, the southerly and southwesterly flow of winds will keep temperatures above the normal range.LiNeBrEaKThe record high for Dec. 17 was 78, set in 1933. The predicted high Wednesday was 76, but cloud cover during the middle of the day kept the high at a balmy, mid-December 72 degrees. There is a chance to break high-temperature records later this week.LiNeBrEaKWillie Chance, the University of Georgia extension agent for Houston County, said the warm spell is too short and too early in the season to be of concern to gardeners and peach farmers.LiNeBrEaK"I really haven't seen anything trying to bloom that shouldn't be," he said.LiNeBrEaK"Most of our temperate zone plants need a certain amount of cold weather before they can be tricked by an early warm snap. If we had this warming in late January or February, then there could be some damage. But it would also need to last more than two or three days."LiNeBrEaKHe said last week's rain, not the warm weather, is responsible for any recent blooming.LiNeBrEaK"Maybe some azaleas that set buds in late July and then went dormant because it was dry might bloom now because they finally got a little water, but it isn't because of these few warm days," he said.LiNeBrEaKTo contact writer Chuck Thompson, call 923-6199, extension 235.

The Manila Times (Philippines)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Industry players upbeat onrenewable energy projects  	Euan Paulo C. Anonuevo, The Manila Times, Philippines  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	474 words  	Dec. 18--INDUSTRY players expect the country to be awash with investments in renewable energy projects following the signing of the Renewable Energy bill in Malacanang on Tuesday. LiNeBrEaK"This is a welcome development not only for the industry but also for the country as well. It is a step in the right direction especially with the government's thrust to become energy self-sufficient while at the same time accelerating the development of indigenous renewable energy resources," Ernie Pantangco, Philippine Independent Power Producers Association president, said.LiNeBrEaKWith the renewable energy legislation in place, more investments for "green" projects such as solar, wind and geothermal resources are expected to push through, he said.LiNeBrEaKAt present, the country is ahead in geothermal production--next only to the United States--through Lopez-controlled Energy Development Corp., which has over 1,200 megawatts of capacity.LiNeBrEaKOther renewable sources remain under developed because of the huge investment costs required to put up such projects.LiNeBrEaKMario Marasigan, Department of Energy utilization and management bureau director, earlier said that a large number of investors keen on renewable energy sources had been anticipating the passage of the said bill.LiNeBrEaKVincent Perez, a former Energy secretary, said the country would need to develop these resources to attain government's target of 60-percent energy self-sufficiency by 2010.LiNeBrEaKThe country's self-sufficiency has risen from 45 percent in 2000 to 57 percent in 2007. In terms of power generation, the self-sufficiency level has also risen to 57 percent from 45 percent in 2000.LiNeBrEaKPerez said the Renewable Energy Law provides a generous package of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives that would accelerate the industry's growth, and help the government meet its energy self-sufficiency target.LiNeBrEaK"The newly signed law also sets clear policy directions for [renewable energy] development to ensure its long-term sustainability," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe passage of the bill is a step in the right direction to mitigate the effects of climate change especially since the energy sector is largely to blame for greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.LiNeBrEaK"Energy demand places increasing burden on our natural resources and our environment. To sustain growth and manage the environmental impacts, it is imperative that we put in place enabling regulatory environment to promote the use of renewable energy," Perez said.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition	PAUL A. SMITH &lt;|&gt; Assembly addresses wildlife  	PAUL A. SMITH, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	C Sports; Pg. 6  	835 words  	In the wake of an election that shifted the balance of power in Washington, D.C., and Madison, "change" is no longer a campaign slogan - it's a reality.LiNeBrEaK What it means and how effective it is will only be known in the coming months and years.LiNeBrEaK But some changes are taking place even before the new legislative sessions begin in January. LiNeBrEaK Among those already evident: How the Wisconsin Assembly treats hunting and fishing. Refreshingly, the early response is positive from both sides of the aisle.LiNeBrEaK When Speaker-Elect Mike Sheridan (D-Janesville) last week issued his list of committees for 2009-'10, he added a new name to the roster: the Fish and Wildlife Committee.LiNeBrEaK "Hunting, fishing, and other conservation activities are a part of the fabric of Wisconsin, from their economic impact to their place in the time-honored traditions of many Wisconsin families," said Sheridan. "The creation of an Assembly Fish and Wildlife Committee reflects the importance of our outdoor heritage and of the value of our natural resources."LiNeBrEaK Sheridan named Representative Ann Hraychuck (D-Balsam Lake) as chair of the committee.LiNeBrEaK Though not unprecedented, most speakers have had fish and wildlife issues handled along with environmental topics by the long-standing Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaK For the next two years, the Assembly will have a Natural Resources Committee chaired by Spencer Black (D-Madison) to deal with environmental issues such as air quality, water pollution and global warming. And fish and wildlife will get its own stage in Hraychuck's committee.LiNeBrEaK "I am very much in favor of this arrangement," said Black, who handled the wide variety of environmental and fish and wildlife issues during a previous 8-year stint as chair of the Natural Resources Committee. "I think it will allow the type of attention that each set of issues deserves."LiNeBrEaK Hraychuck, 57, will bring a thorough understanding of hunting and angling to the position.LiNeBrEaK "One of my favorite places to be is in my tree stand," said Hraychuck, a bow hunter. "It's like therapy."LiNeBrEaK Hraychuck, who grew up in an outdoors family in Balsam Lake, retired as sheriff in 2005 after 32 years with the Polk County Sheriff's office. She started as secretary and worked her way through the ranks to detective and ultimately the top job.LiNeBrEaK She has also served as president of the Polk County Sportsman's Club, the first woman to hold the position.LiNeBrEaK She was named to the Assembly's Natural Resources Committee in 2007 during her first term as a state representative.LiNeBrEaK "I think Ann is a very good choice," said George Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. "It's always important to get someone who understands the issues."LiNeBrEaK Meyer said he has known Hraychuck since the 1980's. They met on a Polk County boat landing amidst the acrimony of tribal spearfishing.LiNeBrEaK "She knows what it's like to work through tough situations," said Meyer. "She's also strong on 2nd Amendment issues. We're getting a good person to chair the committee."LiNeBrEaK Mike Bruhn, chief of staff of outgoing Natural Resources Committee chair Scott Gunderson (R-Norway), also gave high marks to Hraychuck. "She has shown a willingness to work with the conservation groups," said Hraychuck. "I think the hunting and fishing groups should be grateful."LiNeBrEaK In her first term, Hraychuck supported restoring the Natural Resources Board's ability to name the DNR secretary. She also spoke out against using the budget process to change hunting and fishing regulations.LiNeBrEaK The legislature will be sworn in January 5. And then it's off to the races.LiNeBrEaK Among the issues likely to come up over the next two years: deer management, baiting and feeding and alternative or supplemental funding sources for the DNR.LiNeBrEaK "I'm very excited," said Hraychuck. "I intend to make decisions based on science, not politics."LiNeBrEaK Hraychuck said she plans to take input from the many conservation groups in the state. Among her fist stops: a Friday meeting in Stevens Point of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress' Big Game Study Committee.LiNeBrEaK "The speaker has decided to change the way the committees deal with fish and wildlife," said Hraychuck. "I think it will benefit the resources of the state."LiNeBrEaK Interior action: Thursday's naming of Colorado Senator Ken Salazar as Interior Secretary by President-elect Barack Obama was swiftly applauded by at least one conservation group.LiNeBrEaK "Senator Salazar's pro-hunting votes over the past four years in Washington, and his support for access to federal lands for hunting throughout his entire career in Colorado, will prove to be invaluable for sportsmen and women during this Administration," said a statement from the Safari Club International (SCI).LiNeBrEaK Salazar is a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus and has been a consistent pro-sportsman vote during his term in the U.S. Senate, according to SCI.

"The creation of an Assembly Fish and Wildlife Committee reflects the importance of our outdoor heritage and of the value of our natural resources."LiNeBrEaKSheridan named Representative Ann Hraychuck (D-Balsam Lake) as chair of the committee.LiNeBrEaKThough not unprecedented, most speakers have had fish and wildlife issues handled along with environmental topics by the long-standing Natural Resources Committee.LiNeBrEaKFor the next two years, the Assembly will have a Natural Resources Committee chaired by Spencer Black (D-Madison) to deal with environmental issues such as air quality, water pollution and global warming. And fish and wildlife will get its own stage in Hraychuck's committee.LiNeBrEaK"I am very much in favor of this arrangement," said Black, who handled the wide variety of environmental and fish and wildlife issues during a previous 8-year stint as chair of the Natural Resources Committee. "I think it will allow the type of attention that each set of issues deserves."LiNeBrEaKHraychuck, 57, will bring a thorough understanding of hunting and angling to the position.LiNeBrEaK"One of my favorite places to be is in my tree stand," said Hraychuck, a bow hunter. "It's like therapy."LiNeBrEaKHraychuck, who grew up in an outdoors family in Balsam Lake, retired as sheriff in 2005 after 32 years with the Polk County Sheriff's office. She started as secretary and worked her way through the ranks to detective and ultimately the top job.LiNeBrEaKShe has also served as president of the Polk County Sportsman's Club, the first woman to hold the position.LiNeBrEaKShe was named to the Assembly's Natural Resources Committee in 2007 during her first term as a state representative.LiNeBrEaK"I think Ann is a very good choice," said George Meyer, executive director of the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. "It's always important to get someone who understands the issues."LiNeBrEaKMeyer said he has known Hraychuck since the 1980's. They met on a Polk County boat landing amidst the acrimony of tribal spearfishing.LiNeBrEaK"She knows what it's like to work through tough situations," said Meyer. "She's also strong on 2nd Amendment issues. We're getting a good person to chair the committee."LiNeBrEaKMike Bruhn, chief of staff of outgoing Natural Resources Committee chair Scott Gunderson (R-Norway), also gave high marks to Hraychuck. "She has shown a willingness to work with the conservation groups," said Hraychuck. "I think the hunting and fishing groups should be grateful.LiNeBrEaKIn her first term, Hraychuck supported restoring the Natural Resources Board's ability to name the DNR secretary. She also spoke out against using the budget process to change hunting and fishing regulations.LiNeBrEaKThe legislature will be sworn in January 5. And then it's off to the races.LiNeBrEaKAmong the issues likely to come up over the next two years: deer management, baiting and feeding and alternative or supplemental funding sources for the DNR.LiNeBrEaK"I'm very excited," said Hraychuck. "I intend to make decisions based on science, not politics."LiNeBrEaKHraychuck said she plans to take input from the many conservation groups in the state. Among her fist stops: a Friday meeting in Stevens Point of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress' Big Game Study Committee.LiNeBrEaK"The speaker has decided to change the way the committees deal with fish and wildlife," said Hraychuck. "I think it will benefit the resources of the state."LiNeBrEaKInterior action: Thursday's naming of Colorado Senator Ken Salazar as Interior Secretary by President-elect Barack Obama was swiftly applauded by at least one conservation group.LiNeBrEaK"Senator Salazar's pro-hunting votes over the past four years in Washington, and his support for access to federal lands for hunting throughout his entire career in Colorado, will prove to be invaluable for sportsmen and women during this Administration," said a statement from the Safari Club International (SCI).LiNeBrEaKSalazar is a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus and has been a consistent pro-sportsman vote during his term in the U.S. Senate, according to SCI.

The New York Times 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Praise and Criticism for Proposed Interior Secretary  	By JOHN M. BRODER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 30  	968 words  	President-elect Barack Obama's choice to lead the Interior Department, Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado, said on Wednesday that his job would be to try to balance protection of public lands with the continued development of domestic sources of coal, oil and natural gas.LiNeBrEaK  His efforts in the past as a state and federal official to thread the difficult political needle between the environment and energy brought him decidedly mixed reviews from environmental groups on Wednesday, but cautious praise from energy and mining interests.  LiNeBrEaK  As he deals with climate change, land and water issues, protection of endangered species and relations with American Indian tribes, Mr. Salazar will also have to try to manage an agency demoralized by years of scandal, political interference and mismanagement.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama introduced Mr. Salazar and Tom Vilsack, the former Iowa governor chosen to be secretary of agriculture, at a news conference Wednesday in Chicago. He said their responsibility would be to exploit the United States' bounty in a way that benefits all citizens and not just moneyed interests.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's time for a new kind of leadership in Washington that's committed to using our lands in a responsible way to benefit all our families,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That means ensuring that even as we are promoting development where it makes sense, we are also fulfilling our obligation to protect our national treasures.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Salazar, wearing his customary ten-gallon hat and bolo tie, said his job would entail helping the nation address climate change through a technological ''moon shot'' on energy independence. That includes not just development of green energy sources like wind power, but also the continued domestic development of coal, oil and natural gas, fossil fuels that generate heat-trapping  gases when they are burned.LiNeBrEaK  Environmental advocates offered mixed reviews of Mr. Salazar, 53, a first-term Democratic senator who served as head of Colorado's natural resources department and the state's attorney general. He was not the first choice of environmentalists, who openly pushed the appointment of Representative Raul M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, who has a strong record as a conservationist.LiNeBrEaK  Oil and mining interests praised Mr. Salazar's record as a state official and as a senator, saying that he was not doctrinaire about the use of public lands for resource exploitation. ''Nothing in his record suggests he's an ideologue,'' said Luke Popovich, spokesman for the National Mining Association. ''Here's a man who understands the issues, is open-minded and can see at least two sides of an issue.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Popovich noted approvingly that Mr. Salazar had tried to engineer a deal in the Senate under which mining companies and others could reclaim abandoned mines without fear of lawsuits. (The legislation is pending.) He also backed a compromise under which oil companies could drill for natural gas in limited parts of the Roan Plateau in northwestern Colorado, a plan that most environmental advocates opposed.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Salazar is a fifth-generation Coloradan who grew up on a ranch near the New Mexico border. He has been a farmer, lawyer and small-business man, as well as a state and federal official.LiNeBrEaK  Pam Kiely, program director at Environment Colorado, said Mr. Salazar had been a champion of wilderness protection and strong water quality laws and a skeptic on oil shale development, a subject of controversy in the Mountain West. Ms. Kiely  said she was unsure of his views on drilling in millions of acres of national forests and roadless areas.LiNeBrEaK  ''We hope he continues to play a role in ensuring that as we develop our mineral rights in these incredibly sensitive areas we require industry to put in place safeguards that protect our health, environment, water and air quality,'' Ms. Kiely said.LiNeBrEaK  Marc Smith, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, said in a statement that Mr. Salazar understood that energy security could be achieved only by making use of all domestic energy sources, including those found on and under public lands.LiNeBrEaK  ''We are pleased that the president-elect has chosen someone who understands that there is a direct connection between federal lands and access to affordable, clean natural gas,'' Mr. Smith said. LiNeBrEaK  While industry officials praised his moderation, Mr. Salazar drew strong criticism from some environmentalists. LiNeBrEaK  ''He is a right-of-center Democrat who often favors industry and big agricultural interests in battles over global warming, fuel efficiency and endangered species,'' said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, which tracks endangered species and habitat issues.LiNeBrEaK  Daniel R. Patterson, a former official of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management and now southwest regional director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, described Mr. Salazar as the most controversial of Mr. Obama's cabinet appointees. LiNeBrEaK  ''Salazar has a disturbingly weak conservation record, particularly on energy development, global warming, endangered wildlife and protecting scientific integrity,'' said Mr. Patterson, who was elected last month to the Arizona House of Representatives from Tucson and supported Mr. Grijalva for the Interior Department job. ''It's no surprise oil and gas, mining, agribusiness and other polluting industries that have dominated Interior are supporting rancher Salazar -- he's their friend.''LiNeBrEaK  Even as Mr. Salazar navigates the department's tricky political crosscurrents, he must also deal with calls to reverse dozens of decisions made in the Bush administration on endangered species and oil and gas leasing. He must do so with a management team weakened by the departure of dozens of demoralized career employees.

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., Peter Callaghan column: No doubt state will get Cabinet snubbed again  	Peter Callaghan, The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	695 words  	Dec. 18--Is it our breath?LiNeBrEaKAre we not blue enough?LiNeBrEaKThere has got to be a reason why so few from Washington state get asked to serve in high office in the federal government. In 120 years of statehood, just three Washington politicians have been appointed to a presidential Cabinet (you have until the end of this column to name them).LiNeBrEaKEvery four years we play the game. We create short lists that include our best and brightest (or most obvious) for jobs like secretary of Interior, secretary of Transportation, secretary of Housing and Urban Development. LiNeBrEaKAnd every year, we are passed over like the lime green Jello mold at the end of the buffet table.LiNeBrEaKBarack Obama has just a few more appointments to make. And unless a Washington resident becomes the head of the departments of Labor or Transportation or the director of the CIA, we're skunked again.LiNeBrEaKThere is still a chance that U.S. Reps. Jay Inslee and Adam Smith could get appointed to something, but they won't be Cabinet level. And names like Gary Locke and Ron Sims are still being tossed about. But they'll likely be for jobs at an even lower level.LiNeBrEaKMaybe it isn't a big deal. But with the recession, knowing anyone with a high-paying job can't hurt.LiNeBrEaKThere is a certain etiquette for those who line up at the government trough. And first among the rules is not to call out someone else's pork when you are in the process of getting your share. The point is not to draw attention to the feeding frenzy.LiNeBrEaKSo it was shocking this week to see one group with their hand out for some of Barack Obama's stimulus money trying to slap the hand of another group.LiNeBrEaK"President-elect Obama and Congress are working to pass a green-jobs economic stimulus package -- but it is in danger of being hijacked by the road-building lobby, which wants billions of dollars for unnecessary new roads that would increase global warming pollution," wrote Friends of the Earth.LiNeBrEaK"Send Congress this simple message: New Roads = New Pollution. Keep the stimulus clean."LiNeBrEaKSo what will Democrats do when one constituency group -- environmentalists -- make the stimulus a political battle with another constituency group -- skilled trade unionists? See why it's considered impolite to pick fights at the trough?LiNeBrEaKA state task force charged with restructuring the public education finance system has rejected a request by its chairman and Gov. Chris Gregoire to suggest specific taxes to pay for better schools funding.LiNeBrEaKThe Basic Education Finance Task Force instead has decided to recommend phasing in the price increases over six to eight years in hopes that economic recovery will produce more money. They made no recommendation of specific taxes.LiNeBrEaKBut can natural growth in revenue cover the costs of the task force plan? Unlikely. A staff report estimated that the proposals would add $7. 8 billion over two years, mostly in increased teacher pay and better funding of costs like heat, books and support staff.LiNeBrEaKThat would be on top of the $13. 6 billion that the state already spends on public education every two years.LiNeBrEaKDan Grimm, the former state treasurer who chaired the committee, suggested adding the state sales tax to things not currently taxed like consumer, business and financial services. That followed the governor's request to "provide recommendations on how the state can fund their funding level recommendations."LiNeBrEaKInstead the task force decided to not decide. There could be one more meeting but there doesn't appear to be the interest or the votes to propose specific tax hikes.LiNeBrEaK(Washington Cabinet members: Brock Adams, Transportation, Carter administration; Lewis B.

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Helping grid go green is essential to energy future  	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	COMMENTARY  	503 words  	Dec. 18--Congressman Jay Inslee didn't get the nod for interior secretary this week, but that's OK. The Northwest sure could use him in Congress when it comes time to craft a federal infrastructure package. LiNeBrEaKThe lawmaker from Bainbridge Island is one of the chief champions of expanding the Northwest power transmission system. His advocacy of clean, renewable energy could help the Northwest nab stimulus dollars to fund the modern-day equivalent of the New Deal-era hydroelectric dams.LiNeBrEaKInslee and others want to use this region to demonstrate how to bring the nation's electrical distribution into the 21st century by connecting remote power generation to population centers.LiNeBrEaKThe existing power grid has served the region well for decades, but increased demand and development of wind power has the system stretched to its limits.LiNeBrEaKDevelopers of wind power have flocked to eastern Washington and Oregon not just for the gusty weather. Power-generating dams nearby ensure an abundance of high-voltage transmission lines; they also can ramp up quickly when the wind doesn't show.LiNeBrEaKBut the more wind power the region adds, the harder it is for transmission managers to balance the hydro-wind mix and the more bottlenecks crop up on the grid.LiNeBrEaKA study by the Northwest Power and Conservation Council and the Bonneville Power Administration last year found that the region's existing power system can most likely accommodate 6,000 megawatts of wind power -- provided there are additional investments in high-voltage transmission lines. The Bonneville Power Administration figures it needs to string 600 additional miles of transmission line at a cost of $1. 5 billion.LiNeBrEaKCounting the wind projects in operation and under construction, the Northwest is already halfway to its 6,000-megawatt buildout. And interest in wind power and other green energy will only grow as state mandates in Washington, Oregon, California and elsewhere require utilities to buy a bigger portion of their power supply from renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKWithout increased capacity, the Northwest's power grid could bog down under the strain of hosting sporadic loads of wind-power electrons -- power that is being produced so that utilities elsewhere can buy renewable energy credits.LiNeBrEaKBuilding the next-generation green grid is part and parcel of weaning the country from its dependence on foreign oil and combating global warming. In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration helped electrify the West by building the 20th-century form of renewable energy. The federal government can help make this region again a model for energy independence.

The Olympian (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Environmental lobby sets good priorities  	The Olympian, Olympia, Wash.  	COMMENTARY  	720 words  	Dec. 18--Environmentalists in this state have learned that they can have more influence if they pool their resources and unite behind a handful of top legislative priorities.LiNeBrEaKIt's a strategy they've used since 2003, and as a result they can point to multiple achievements that include the all-out effort to clean up Puget Sound, legislation to phase out toxic flame retardants in certain consumer products, the promotion of biofuel technology and increased use of clean fuels and vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Priorities Coalition is made up of 24 of the state's leading groups all rallying behind the effort to protect land, air and water resources. Membership includes Climate Solutions, Sierra Club, American Rivers, National Wildlife Federation, The Nature Conservancy and Washington Wildlife and Recreation Coalition. Leaders of the organizations sit down together and develop a list they call "Priorities for a Healthy Washington." They start with 30 or 35 priorities, and whittle them down to four legislative proposals they believe they can realistically achieve. LiNeBrEaKThis year's priorities tackle climate change, energy efficiency, how we develop our communities and clean water.LiNeBrEaK"This is not the year to be walking with your hands out," said Clifford Traisman, lobbyist for the Washington Environmental Council and Washington Conservation Voters. "We believe our priorities go hand in hand with generating a stronger economy."LiNeBrEaKLawmakers face a $5. 1 billion budget shortfall, so they will have little interest in lobbyists who approach them urging new programs that will cost more money and enlarge the deficit.LiNeBrEaKTraisman and the environmental community recognize that. He predicts a "long, dark and cold session," but notes that environmentalists have shaped their goals with the budget in mind.LiNeBrEaKThe 2009 priorities are:LiNeBrEaK--Global warming: The environmentalists want to auction off rather than give away pollution credits that allow industries to emit greenhouse gases. Under their proposal polluters would pay for permits and the additional revenue "would be invested to reduce fossil fuel dependence, create green jobs and spur new clean-tech innovation, while providing assistance to moderate- and low-income households struggling with high energy costs."LiNeBrEaKThe environmentalists say their plan will protect the environment, benefit the economy and position the state to be a leader in a clean-energy economy.LiNeBrEaK--Energy efficiency: The environmentalists believe the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to focus on energy efficiency. They will promote energy efficient homes, businesses and public institutions and believe the efficiency measures will "create thousands of good, family-wage jobs in Washington." Their proposal, for example, would require energy-use information to be posted on buildings offered for sale or lease.LiNeBrEaK--Planning for growth: Environmentalists propose to change the way communities plan for population growth. They want to change the "transportation and land-use planning framework to assist local jurisdictions to plan for growth in a sustainable and climate-friendly way." They propose incentives for cities and developers who create "affordable, walkable and transit-oriented communities."LiNeBrEaK--Clean water: Environmentalists are proposing that polluters pay fees for their discharges. The coalition will come up with a revenue package to pay for Puget Sound cleanup and restoration of Washington's rivers and lakes. Environmentalists say "by investing in stormwater infrastructure, toxics prevention and other programs, we create new jobs, relieve financial pressure on local government and promote new economic stimulus."LiNeBrEaKIt's an ambitious agenda focused on the right targets. Look for the environmental lobby to exert its collective clout in 2009 as it has in the past with a focus on creating a healthier, more livable state where natural resources are enhanced, not compromised.

The Oregonian  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Portland's outgoing planning director says sustainability focus makes sense  	James Mayer, The Oregonian, Portland, Ore.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	409 words  	Dec. 18--Gil Kelley lasted longer -- nine years -- than other Portland planning directors in recent history but says he can't argue with the idea to now focus the city's future toward the current zeitgeist: sustainability. LiNeBrEaKMayor-elect Sam Adams announced this week that Kelley was out and Sustainability Director Susan Anderson will oversee the merged planning and sustainability departments.LiNeBrEaKThe news was "fairly unexpected," Kelley said. "I could do it for another nine years, easily."LiNeBrEaKStill, he said: "Not that it's a bad idea" to combine the bureaus. "It doesn't reflect a different mission, but a different skill set, more short-term and experimental."LiNeBrEaKIn the most general sense, sustainability means using resources in a way that maintains rather than depletes them. It includes efforts to fight global warming and find alternative energy sources.LiNeBrEaKKelley said he was looking forward to working on the Portland Plan, a new blueprint to guide the city's future, including a rewrite of the comprehensive plan and the central city plan, but now won't get the chance. He doesn't know his immediate fate but said he'd stick around to keep the shop running during the transition if asked.LiNeBrEaKAdams "needs the opportunity to be the leader of the band on the Portland Plan," Kelley said. "He needs the latitude to do it his own way. He needs to own it. I'm disappointed that I can't deliver that for him."LiNeBrEaKBut he feels no bitterness toward Adams, he said. He downplayed their disagreements, such as his opposition to Adams' plan to turn Burnside and Couch streets into a one-way couplet. "I don't see any philosophical disagreement. We've had mild differences, not profound," he said.LiNeBrEaKKelley, a Portland native, was working as planning director for Berkeley, Calif., when he was hired by Mayor Vera Katz in 2000, primarily to elevate long-range planning.LiNeBrEaK"The job of planning director in a city as dynamic as Portland is a tough one to keep filled," said Bob Stacey, executive director of 1000 Friends of Oregon and the city's planning director in the 1980s.

The Orange County Register (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Are gas guzzlers graveyard-bound?  	Pat Brennan, The Orange County Register, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	714 words  	Dec. 18--The days of monster SUVs prowling the nation, drinking from a seemingly endless pool of cheap gasoline, won't be coming back -- even though gas prices have dropped to surprisingly low levels.LiNeBrEaKSo says Alan Brew, an Orange County expert who specializes in business branding: teaching companies, such as utilities, car makers and airlines, how to respond to a new era of energy use.LiNeBrEaKNow, he says, it's all about green. LiNeBrEaK"There's been a tipping point in terms of people's consciousness," said Brew, 59, senior vice president of RiechesBaird in Irvine. "Detroit's in trouble. They've finally gotten the message. They have not been producing the vehicles people want."LiNeBrEaKBrew began his 20 years of advising businesses in his native Great Britain, then was sent by one company to San Francisco. He moved to Orange County a decade ago because "it seemed to be a great place to raise children." Now he has two of them; he, his wife and the children live in Coto de Caza.LiNeBrEaKQUESTION: What does your company do?LiNeBrEaKANSWER: Branding and branding strategy. Helping companies differentiate and flourish. Now we have a focus on the energy sector. It's a question of how to help them capitalize on trends in the energy world, to grow. Part of this is developing a presence in the marketplace.LiNeBrEaKQ: Is the drive toward "green" becoming a bigger factor?LiNeBrEaKA: It's all being driven by that. A lot of people talk about how the price of oil dropped, so what happens to the environment and green energy now? The answer is, this time, nothing. Traditionally, when the price of that oil dropped, people went back to their SUVs and forgot about the price of energy. They went back to their old habits.LiNeBrEaKThis time it is different, for several reasons. One reason is the state mandates on carbon emissions. That is all energy producers -- utilities and producers. So a utility like Southern California Edison has to now find suppliers and ways of getting renewables to minimize carbon emissions by a certain date. So that is putting great pressure on them and there's also a greater focus on providers of alternative energy, like solar and wind.LiNeBrEaKQ: The incoming Obama administration has talked about more alternative energy, green jobs. Do you think that will happen?LiNeBrEaKA: "There is that drive, and that will be supported by the incoming Obama government. (I recently) read about the European Union (that) passed new carbon emissions controls, which they were proclaiming were leading the world in clean energy and climate change protection.LiNeBrEaKQ: What else is pushing the businesses you work with toward this trend?LiNeBrEaKA: The other issue you have in the United States is one of energy security. I think Obama has proclaimed a 10-year campaign to rid the U.S. of oil imports from the Middle East completely. The alternative is domestically produced energy. Now we have coal and natural gas, the fossil fuels. But he's already said the coal industry will have very, very tough carbon emission controls placed on them. So coal is going to decline as a fuel source. It's now a major source of electricity production, but it will decline, and natural gas for a period will take its place.LiNeBrEaKYou're probably familiar with the T. Boone Pickens plan. He sees a natural gas bridge between oil and the renewable future. It's the cleanest-burning fossil fuel and there are oceans of it in the United States and in North America. That will be a major part of the picture going forward.LiNeBrEaK"Within 10 years, one fully expects to see a whole portfolio of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear, taking up the slack and making us largely independent. So that's the other drive.LiNeBrEaK"So you've got two, really. You've got a political climate, with popular concepts about climate change, and you've got national security coming into play. All that really sets the scene for the rise of the renewable energy industry."

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Sunrise Edition	Outgoing planning director says new focus makes sense  	JAMES MAYER, The Oregonian  	Local News  	670 words  	SUMMARY: Portland   | Gil Kelley says he wasn't ready to leave but understands the mayor-elect's push for sustainabilityLiNeBrEaKPortland's outgoing planning director says sustainability focus makes sense Gil Kelley says he wasn't ready to leave the job but understands the mayor-elect's push for sustainability Outgoing planning directorLiNeBrEaKsays new focus makes sense Kelley feels LiNeBrEaKno bitternessLiNeBrEaKtoward AdamsLiNeBrEaKJAMES MAYERLiNeBrEaKGil Kelley lasted longer --nine years --than other Portland planning directors in recent history but says he can't argue with the idea to now focus the city's future toward the current zeitgeist: sustainability.LiNeBrEaKMayor-elect Sam Adams announced this week that Kelley was out and Sustainability Director Susan Anderson will oversee the merged planning and sustainability departments.LiNeBrEaKThe news was "fairly unexpected," Kelley said. "I could do it for another nine years, easily."LiNeBrEaKStill, he said: "Not that it's a bad idea" to combine the bureaus. "It doesn't reflect a different mission, but a different skill set, more short-term and experimental."LiNeBrEaKIn the most general sense, sustainability means using resources in a way that maintains rather than depletes them. It includes efforts to fight global warming and find alternative energy sources.LiNeBrEaKKelley said he was looking forward to working on the Portland Plan, a new blueprint to guide the city's future, including a rewrite of the comprehensive plan and the central city plan, but now won't get the chance. He doesn't know his immediate fate but said he'd stick around to keep the shop running during the transition if asked.LiNeBrEaKAdams "needs the opportunity to be the leader of the band on the Portland Plan," Kelley said. "He needs the latitude to do it his own way. He needs to own it. I'm disappointed that I can't deliver that for him."LiNeBrEaKBut he feels no bitterness toward Adams, he said. He downplayed their disagreements, such as his opposition to Adams' plan to turn Burnside and Couch streets into a one-way couplet. "I don't see any philosophical disagreement. We've had mild differences, not profound," he said.LiNeBrEaKKelley, a Portland native, was working as planning director for Berkeley, Calif., when he was hired by Mayor Vera Katz in 2000, primarily to elevate long-range planning.LiNeBrEaK"The job of planning director in a city as dynamic as Portland is a tough one to keep filled," said Bob Stacey, executive director of 1000 Friends of Oregon and the city's planning director in the 1980s.LiNeBrEaKStacey's predecessor, Norm Abbott, held the job for four years. Stacey held it for four years. Then David Knowles held it for six years, then Kelley.LiNeBrEaK"He had a darn good run," Stacey said. "And he has a lot of accomplishments to show for it."LiNeBrEaKDevelopers, planning professionals, politicians and neighborhood leaders praised Kelley and expressed interest in Adams' plan to stress sustainability.LiNeBrEaK"Personally, I found him very interesting, very sharp and very committed to making it a more sustainable and equitable region," Metro Councilor Robert Liberty said. "Not everyone has both those things on their priority list."LiNeBrEaKHe said Adams' reorganization makes sense, but "I wish Gil fit into that plan."LiNeBrEaKDeveloper and former planning Commissioner Rick Michaelson said Kelley was "an excellent planning director who improved the professionalism of the bureau. He had a long-range view of the city and how it should grow, and I think he really improved the morale of the staff."LiNeBrEaKBut Michaelson acknowledged that every mayor is "entitled to a planning director they are personally comfortable with."LiNeBrEaKStacey said Adams is on the right track with stressing sustainability.LiNeBrEaK"If there is anything that Oregon and city planning should be about at the ground level, it's sustainability," Stacey said. "That's what we do here. We have the urban growth boundary to make sure we conserve as much land for natural resources and farm and forest uses. We try to integrate systems, parks, housing, employment and transportation in a single planning process."LiNeBrEaKJames Mayer: 503-294-5988; jimmayer@news.oregonian.com	MAYORS (90%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); CITIES (89%); CITY LIFE (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			PORTLAND, OR, USA (94%); SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (79%) OREGON, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  															
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   SOONER EDITION	DEAR MR. PRESIDENT-ELECT  		LIFESTYLE; Pg. E-7  	795 words  	Between now and Jan. 20, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette will publish letters written by local students to President-elect Barack Obama, who will be inaugurated as the nation's 44th president. They will appear intermittently on the My Generation page.LiNeBrEaKDear President-elect Barack Obama,LiNeBrEaKCongratulations on being elected the 44th president of the United States of America. Our country is facing some big problems today, and I want to give you my opinion on what things we should focus on first.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming has a big effect on the world and the United States. One important action our country can take to slow down global warming would be to use more windmills throughout the country for electricity.LiNeBrEaKI have firsthand experience seeing windmills work. They use a lot of windmills in Costa Rica, and it is amazing how they can power the region around them. Windmills do not produce pollution, and wind is a renewable source of energy. Costa Rica is a poor country, but if it can do it, we can do it, too!LiNeBrEaKHealth care is so important, and even Costa Rica has it for everybody. This is another example of something people in a less developed country have but we do not have here in the United States. I think all people should have heath care coverage. It is especially important for kids like me. When I was in kindergarten, I broke my arm at the playground. It took my family a year to pay off the expenses because I didn't have any insurance. Now my sister and I have insurance through the CHIP program.LiNeBrEaKThis program is so important, and it should be expanded throughout the country. I hope that while you are president you will focus on making sure all kids have health insurance.LiNeBrEaKThank you for your time and I hope you will make the right choices in creating a better country and world.LiNeBrEaKSincerely,LiNeBrEaKDaniel Salter-Volz, 11LiNeBrEaKFifth grade, Pittsburgh LibertyLiNeBrEaKDear President-elect Barack Obama,LiNeBrEaKI am concerned about the health care in this country. My grandfather has cancer and my uncle believes it could have been the water he was drinking because another man on his street got cancer as well. Is the water we're drinking clean enough? Is the air we breathe too polluted? Are young children being poisoned because of lead paint? Please help to make our country an easier place to stay healthy.LiNeBrEaKAnother problem I hope you address in your term as president is the amount of gas America uses. Do we have enough fuel-efficient vehicles? Why do we depend on other countries for oil and don't drill in our own? Why are we fighting a war in a country that we rely on for oil? Why are we using our money to fund that war and not to develop more resourceful ways of using energy? Please try to fund companies that will help our country be more resourcefulLiNeBrEaKPresident-Elect Obama, the last issue that I think is important is do you think we have enough jobs in this country? Do you think it should be easier to start small businesses and there should be penalties for shipping jobs overseas? Do you think we should fund more companies that create lots of jobs in the United States? Please help our country create more jobs.LiNeBrEaKPresident-Elect Obama, please write back saying what you think of my concerns.LiNeBrEaKYours truly,LiNeBrEaKBen Eppinger, 11LiNeBrEaKFifth grade, Pittsburgh LibertyLiNeBrEaKDear President-elect Obama,LiNeBrEaKMy name is Jared Weber. I'm really glad you won the election. I have some ideas about what I think you should do while you're president. I know you might not want to take advice from an 11-year-old, but here it is.LiNeBrEaKFirst, I think you should try to get every child an education no matter what. Also, make advanced classes for kids in public schools that have to follow the "No Child Left Behind" curriculum but are smart enough to go ahead.LiNeBrEaKThe next thing I think you should do is lower health-care costs for everyone and give special benefits that are free for people who can't afford it at all. I agree with your tax plan of lowering taxes for people who make less than $250,000 a year a lot.LiNeBrEaKI think you should eliminate the death penalty completely. I hope you know the U.S. is the only civilized nation with the death penalty.LiNeBrEaKAfter that, I think you should try to make everything more energy-efficient, especially the place you're going to live, the White House. An example of that would be to make most of the light bulbs in the White House compact fluorescent. Another example of energy efficiency would be to make all of the cars you and your Secret Service agents drive hybrids. Doing that I think would make people think it is a good idea.LiNeBrEaKI agree with you that there should be a college football playoff.LiNeBrEaKThat's the advice I have. One question I ask, if you get re-elected are you going to get your daughters another puppy? I hope you write back.LiNeBrEaKSincerely yours,LiNeBrEaKJared Weber, 11LiNeBrEaKFifth grade, Pittsburgh Liberty	STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); WIND ENERGY (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (74%); LEAD (73%); HEALTH INSURANCE (72%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (72%); CHILDREN (70%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); POISONINGS (60%); LEAD PAINT (50%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	PITTSBURGH, PA, USA (79%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%); COSTA RICA (93%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 P.G.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition; All Editions	An excess of midnight rules  	The Plain Dealer  	OPINION; Pg. A13  	332 words  	President Bush is not the first president to try to ram through a crateful of controversial rule changes at the tail end of his administration - nor will he be the last. LiNeBrEaKBill Clinton had his own long list of unilateral rules from an attempt to block oil drilling in the Arctic to tightened privacy for electronic records. The practice of shoveling last-minute regulations out the White House back door before a new team comes in the front is almost as old as the republic.LiNeBrEaKThat said, the scope of the safety, environmental and health care alterations that President Bush has chosen to make unilaterally - and in such a way that will be difficult to undo - is breathtaking and unsettling.LiNeBrEaKIncluded among Bush's so-called midnight regulations is one that makes it easier for coal companies to dump mining detritus into mountain streams and another that lets freight railroads ship hazardous chemicals through major cities, pre-empting local controls. Such shifts should not occur without a full and open public debate.LiNeBrEaKBush has pushed through scores of these midnight rule changes. Many pertain to clean-air standards, climate change, endangered species and oil, shale and tar sands exploitation. The president also has elected to put in place some arguably useful rules that lawmakers might find politically risky to support on their own - such as one giving farmers more latitude to hire foreign workers.LiNeBrEaKSome of the more controversial rules likely will come up for alteration before a Democratic-controlled Congress next year. President-elect Barack Obama may choose not to enforce others.LiNeBrEaKYet many of these rules will be expensive to change.LiNeBrEaKAs time-honored as these last-minute regulations have become for outgoing presidents, there is something particularly unseemly and wrong about burdening the nation with a swath of rules that require time and money to sort out in the midst of an economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush would have done better by the country and his legacy if he had shown more restraint.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   All Editions	N.J. sits in on emissions auction;  Power plants now paying for polluting 	By JAMES M. O'NEILL, STAFF WRITER, North Jersey Media Group  	NEWS; Pg. A04  	673 words  	Power plants started paying Wednesday for the right to pollute in New Jersey as the state participated in its first auction designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey officials had been scolded back in September when the state was not ready for the initial auction by a 10-state coalition called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This time, New Jersey joined the auction, held online.LiNeBrEaKIn the market-based cap and trade program, companies have to pay for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit into the air. Companies from 10 states bid Wednesday for more than 31. 5 million carbon dioxide emissions allowances. LiNeBrEaK"Today, New Jersey makes a strong statement by holding power plants accountable for their pollution," said Matt Elliott of Environment New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKThrough the program, the 10 states aim to stabilize the amount of carbon emissions from their power plants at a capped level through 2014. The cap will then be reduced by 2. 5 percent in each of the following four years for a total reduction of 10 percent by 2018.LiNeBrEaKPower plants in New Jersey currently produce about 20 million metric tons of carbon emissions a year, the state Department of Environmental Protection said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists have said the process is a good first step, but that the reduction goals are not nearly ambitious enough. "What's most important about this is that it provides a model for a national cap and trade system," said Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKUnder the plan, power plant operators must purchase allowances from their host states to cover each ton of carbon dioxide emissions they are likely to produce. The companies can then buy, sell or trade their permits. Companies that reduce their emissions and don't need all their allowances might sell them to a company whose emissions exceed their allowances.LiNeBrEaK"These state initiatives are very important to long-term efforts to deal with climate change," said Rena Steinzor, a law professor at the University of Maryland who writes extensively on environmental regulation. She said such regional initiatives need to be protected with national legislation, because "a large industry coalition, beginning with domestic carmakers and utilities with coal-fired plants, is trying to exact extinction of state initiatives as part of any federal climate deal."LiNeBrEaKThe coalition's executive director, Jonathan Schrag, said details about yesterday's auction, including how much it raised, would be released Friday.LiNeBrEaKIn the first auction on Sept. 25, all of the 12. 5 million allowances were sold at a clearing price of $3. 07 each. The demand for allowances was four times the supply.LiNeBrEaKThe September auction raised $38. 5 million. Today's auction was expected to generate about $100 million. States are supposed to use that money to improve energy efficiency and develop more renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar power.LiNeBrEaKPSEG Power participated in Wednesday's auction, as well as the one in September, said spokesman Mike Jennings.LiNeBrEaKThe coalition intends to hold quarterly auctions through the end of 2011.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has called for a national cap and trade program, something New Jersey business officials would prefer.LiNeBrEaK"It's better to have a national program that provides a level playing," said Michael Egenton, vice president for environment issues at the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce. New Jersey power companies are at a competitive disadvantage because they must pay for pollution credits, while neighbor Pennsylvania is not participating, so its power companies don't have the extra cost, Egenton said.LiNeBrEaK"We're a big backer of cap and trade systems and we support a national program," PSEG's Jennings said "A national program provides regulatory assurance ? everyone is playing under the same rules. A problem like global warming needs a global solution."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to New Jersey, the other states in the coalition include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.LiNeBrEaKE-mail: oneillj@northjersey.com	EMISSIONS (94%); AUCTIONS (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (89%); SOLAR ENERGY (79%); WIND ENERGY (79%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (79%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (76%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (74%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (74%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (73%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (73%); LEGISLATION (66%); LAW SCHOOLS (66%); AUTOMAKERS (50%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%) NEW JERSEY; AIR; POLLUTION; LAW  			NEW JERSEY, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 North Jersey Media Group Inc., All Rights Reserved  				SIERRA CLUB (54%)  											
The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   All Editions	Analysts expect U.S. to kick its foreign oil habit;  Report credits increase in biofuels, more efficient cars 	By H. JOSEF HEBERT, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Wire Services  	BUSINESS; Pg. B06  	605 words  	WASHINGTON ? U.S. dependence on foreign oil will drop dramatically over the next two decades as Americans are expected to confront rebounding oil prices, use more biofuels like ethanol and drive more fuel-efficient cars, the Energy Department predicted Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKBut the long-range energy forecast also said that coal, oil and natural gas ? all of which produce gases linked to climate change ? will provide nearly 80 percent of the country?s energy in 2030, barring mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions that most likely would cause that percentage to decline. LiNeBrEaKThe analysis by the department?s Energy Information Administration projects virtually no growth in U.S. petroleum use through the year 2030 because of wider use of ethanol and biodiesel and a push toward greater automobile fuel efficiency including the growing popularity of gas-electric hybrid vehicles.LiNeBrEaKIt is the first time in more than 20 years that petroleum demand in the United States is projected to be essentially flat for years to come, said Howard Gruenspecht, the EIA?s acting director. It "breaks this trend" of steady annual petroleum demand increases dating back to the 1980s, he said. The reversal began this year with U.S. petroleum use expected to decline by a million barrels a day, or about 5 percent, compared with 2007.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, net U.S. petroleum imports are expected to decline sharply, the EIA report predicted, with liquid fuel imports ? primarily oil ? accounting for only 40 percent of U.S. consumption by 2025, compared with 58 percent last year. That?s still higher than what the United States imported in the early 1970s when foreign oil one year accounted for only 28 percent of domestic consumption.LiNeBrEaKBut such an expected easing of U.S. reliance on imports comes as greater energy independence has been at the center of political and economic debate.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama, in announcing his key energy and environment advisers on Monday, said America?s heavy dependence on foreign oil is "eclipsed only by the long-term threat of climate change." Disputes over drilling in environmentally sensitive areas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in an Alaska wildlife refuge have largely hinged on arguments over foreign oil addiction.LiNeBrEaKThe EIA report said America?s lessening of its oil appetite stems from an expected strong expansion of alternative fuels with a 3. 3 percent a year growth in the use of renewable fuels ? not only for electricity generation but also as a motor fuel.LiNeBrEaKEthanol and biodiesel will be used much more widely as motor fuels and a new generation of cars hit showrooms. Sixty percent of car sales by 2030 are likely to be vehicles that rely heavily or exclusively on fuels other than gasoline, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids that are powered by the electric grid and flex fuel vehicles that use 85 percent ethanol, said Gruenspecht.LiNeBrEaKThe report said gas-electric hybrid cars, which automakers and consumers already have embraced, will account for 38 percent of the market by 2030, compared with 2 percent last year, the report suggests.LiNeBrEaKBut oil prices also are expected to keep U.S. petroleum demand in check.LiNeBrEaKAlthough crude oil prices have fallen dramatically since their peak last July of $147 a barrel ? tumbling below $40 a barrel Wednesday for the first time since 2004 ? the EIA predicts global crude oil costs will rebound after current economic problems subside. By 2030, nominal oil prices are projected to be $189 a barrel, equal to $130 in 2007 dollars, said the report.LiNeBrEaKThe agency?s forecast assumes no changes in laws or regulations, including any mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.

The drops just roll off, taking dirt with them.LiNeBrEaKThe same thing happens with lotus leaves, which have millions of microscopic bumps covering their surfaces.LiNeBrEaKHuman manufacturers know how to create such materials synthetically, but it's costly, time-consuming and generally limited to things like computer chips. However, French scientists at the National Center for Scientific Research in Aubervilles have developed a cheaper technique that is the sincerest form of flattery.LiNeBrEaKThey pour a silicon-based polymer liquid over an actual wing or leaf, let it dry, then peel off the solid form, which can then be used as a mold for producing very thin sheets of a special gel-like film.LiNeBrEaKBy layering together many sheets of the film, the scientists believe, they can create a window or windshield that naturally repels water and stays clean at the same time.LiNeBrEaKTrue factsLiNeBrEaKAntarctica's Wilkins ice shelf, a vast sheet of ice roughly the size of Scotland, is in danger of floating out to sea. Climate change has caused a massive ice bridge anchoring the shelf to Charcot Island to shrink to a tenuous thread. Once the bridge goes, scientists say, the shelf is likely to collapse into the ocean.LiNeBrEaKThe image here shows the ice bridge in 1992.LiNeBrEaKWhat is it? answerLiNeBrEaKA species of polychaete called Phyllodoce lineata.

Even at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second), it will take at least eight years for the movie to reach Alpha Centauri and any commentary to get back to Earth.LiNeBrEaKPatently absurdLiNeBrEaKEyeglasses sometimes fall off. To avoid this, wearers may resort to attaching bands to the frames or arms or wrapping unsightly tape around the nose bridge. A 2003 patent provided another alternative: eyebrow studs.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the inventor, eyeglass wearers would have body-piercing studs installed in their eyebrows, upon which suitably equipped glasses would then hang. For those who balked at the idea of basically hanging picture hooks above their eyes, the inventor also proposed a nose-bridge stud into which you could screw frameless lenses.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	565 words  	Dec. 18--The unincorporated communities may be the last in the county to build green, but they won't be the least.LiNeBrEaKCounty officials expect to put in place regulations next year that will require new homes, remodels and additions, from the outskirts of Watsonville to the San Lorenzo Valley, to be constructed to the region's highest standards of energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"If we're going to go to the point of doing this, you want to have a real impact on what's being built," said county Planning Director Tom Burns, who got the go-ahead this week from county supervisors to begin drafting green building rules. LiNeBrEaKUnder the regulations, which could be approved by summer, residential projects will be required to include a certain number of environmentally-friendly features, from low-flow toilets to straw-bale insulation to solar heating systems. New rules for commercial projects will follow.LiNeBrEaK"There's concern about greenhouse gases and global warming, and the built-in environment is part of that," said Burns.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to promoting energy and water efficiency, the new rules will help protect air quality, encourage the use of products that have less impact on the environment and make homes safer to live in, planners say.LiNeBrEaKAlready, the Planning Department is pushing green building by including recommendations with all building applications. Nothing, however, is currently required of applicants.LiNeBrEaKAllLiNeBrEaKfour cities in the county have mandatory green building rules.LiNeBrEaKThe county's new regulations are expected to veer slightly from those in the cities, most notably by requiring more of building projects and increasing the scope -- to all remodels and additions. But the regulations will be similar enough to prevent confusion among local contractors, planners say.LiNeBrEaKThe county receives upwards of 3,000 building applications annually.LiNeBrEaKSharon Sarris, a consultant on green building and member of the county's Commission on the Environment, says if the rules are written correctly, this can translate into significant energy savings.LiNeBrEaK"I'm pleased that the county is proceeding with a green building program," she said.LiNeBrEaKAnd while advocates of the rules say conservation can also mean money-savings, critics say environmental features can be costlier to install and some worry about having to pay additional permit fees.LiNeBrEaKCounty planners have said the costs of assuring compliance with green rules would be passed on to those doing the building. At this point, however, they do not know how much that will be.LiNeBrEaKIn the city of Santa Cruz, homebuilders pay between $700 and $1,000 to offset the expense of maintaining the green building program, according to county reports.LiNeBrEaK"The fees in the county have gotten so high it's more than a year's salary to build your own house," said Travis Smith, who lives outside Watsonville.LiNeBrEaKWhile Smith likes the concept of green building, he objects to more expensive regulations.LiNeBrEaKContact Kurtis Alexander at 706-3267 or kalexander@santacruzsentinel.com	COUNTIES (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); GREEN BUILDING (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); CONSTRUCTION (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (78%); APPROVALS (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (77%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (77%); HOME SECURITY (77%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (76%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (76%); EMISSIONS (76%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); CLIMATE CHANGE (72%); AIR QUALITY (67%); WAGES and SALARIES (60%)  	General  		CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081218-QC-County-proceeds-with-mandatory-green-building-rules-1218  	Newspaper  	QC  	2008    															
San Gabriel Valley Tribune (West Covina, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	AeroVironment technology to be used at Port of Los Angeles  	Ryan Carter, San Gabriel Valley Tribune, West Covina, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	767 words  	Dec. 18--As the incoming presidential administration emphasizes renewable and cleaner energy, and defense remains a big priority, Monrovia-based AeroVironment Inc. is well-positioned to reap the benefits, analysts said.LiNeBrEaKAmong those benefits was the company's announcement Thursday that Balqon Corp., a developer of heavy-duty trucks and tractors, has purchased technology that will help it run more efficient and cleaner-running vehicles in the Port of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKBalqon purchased AV's new high-voltage PosiCharge fast-charge system as part of the port's program to replace internal combustion yard tractors with electric propulsion vehicles. LiNeBrEaKThe system can charge up to four heavy-duty electric dock yard tractors at a time, quickly pumping enough energy into them during short breaks. The powering system eliminates the need for battery swapping among vehicles, since the battery is always charged. It also makes the vehicles and the flow of port containers more efficient while helping to reduce emissions, they said.LiNeBrEaKEfficiency was vital for Balwinder Samra, CEO and president of Balqon, which this year won the right to build the port's electric-powered tractor fleet.LiNeBrEaK"In our applications it was important that we had a fast charger to reduce the charging time ... and that we were able to charge these vehicles during any type of downtime we had," he said.LiNeBrEaKSamra also pointed to the Monrovia firm's experience in the market.LiNeBrEaKAnd with cleanerLiNeBrEaKair a hot topic and goal of local leaders, ports, cities and the Obama administration, AeroVironment officials are capitalizing on that experience.LiNeBrEaK"We've got our fast-charge technology, which we think can be instrumental in helping electronic vehicles of all shapes and sizes be much more practical," said Steve Gitlin, director of marketing strategy for AeroVironment.LiNeBrEaKBalqon Corp. manufactures all of the electric yard tractors at the port, which is in the midst of its Clean Air Action Plan, with a goal to cut air emissions in half by 2011, port spokeswoman Theresa Adams Lopez said.LiNeBrEaK"All these new technologies create new jobs, and it's cleaner running technology," she said. "It jump-starts green-collar jobs. It all is good ... new jobs for cleaner air."LiNeBrEaKAmong those jobs are those created by a company like AeroVironment, which is booming, analysts said.LiNeBrEaK"This is a firm that is absolutely on fire," said Erik Olbeter, an analyst who tracks the company for Pacific Crest Securities.LiNeBrEaKAnd the spark over its energy efficiency business has heated up in the last few months, he said.LiNeBrEaK"They've exceed expectations, and certainly as the country, the government and industry becomes more concerned with global warming, AeroVironment's (energy efficiency systems) business is very well positioned with products that not only reduce greenhouse emissions but also save money for companies."LiNeBrEaKBut interest in AV's unmanned aircraft system is also a major part of its business, Olbeter said.LiNeBrEaKThe firm is the market leader in manufacturing small, tactical, unmanned aircraft systems, he said.LiNeBrEaKJust this week, the firm announced that the Italian government cleared its military to fly the firm's unmanned Raven aircraft in Italy's airspace, citing the technology's ability to protect Italian land forces and fly over large populations without limits.LiNeBrEaKIn both cases, the company -- founded in 1971 by Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a pioneering designer of human powered aircraft -- is looking beyond the immediate uses of its systems.LiNeBrEaKCompany officials are looking beyond the military for use of its aerial systems. And they are looking beyond port and airport vehicle fleets for use of its electrical vehicle technology.LiNeBrEaKAs it stands, the fast-charge system now operating at the port powers thousands of material handling vehicles in airports, factories and distribution centers in North America, Gitlin said.LiNeBrEaKBut there's potential outside of factories and industrial plants, he added.LiNeBrEaK"We're working hard to meet with a lot of players in the emerging electrical vehicle market," Gitlin said.LiNeBrEaKThe interest is showing in the company's stock, Olbeter said.LiNeBrEaKIt closed at $36 a share Thursday, up $1. 19.LiNeBrEaKryan.carter@sgvn.comLiNeBrEaK(626) 962-8811, Ext. 2720	RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); BUSINESS FORECASTS (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); AIR QUALITY (87%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (85%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); MOTOR VEHICLES (72%); MARKETING STRATEGY (64%); JOB CREATION (60%)  	Construction  	BARACK OBAMA (54%)  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (93%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081218-GB-AeroVironment-technology-to-be-used-at-Port-of-Los-Angeles-1218  	Newspaper  	GB  	2008 San Gabriel Valley Tribune   	AVAV (NASDAQ) (94%) NASDAQ-NMS:AVAV  	AEROVIRONMENT INC (94%); BALQON CORP (85%)  													
The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   FINAL Edition	Environmental challenges await 2 Obama Cabinet picks;  Interior: Salazar is Western rancher who backs clean energy, 'wise use' of resources 	Peter Fimrite, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	785 words  	 Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar, who was nominated Wednesday as interior secretary, is a conundrum for environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK He comes from a rural ranching background but opposes the exploitation of natural resources and supports renewable energy. He has fought drilling but is not against it in all instances.LiNeBrEaK President-elect Barack Obama's choice to oversee mineral resources and manage the nation's parks and wildlife refuges is considered a centrist. Most of all, though, he is his own man.  LiNeBrEaK In accepting the nomination, Salazar promised to confront global warming, protect national parks, farms and ranchlands, restore the country's rivers, assist Native American communities and foster a more efficient, modern system of harvesting energy and natural resources.LiNeBrEaK "I will do all I can to help reduce America's dangerous dependence on foreign oil," he said. "I look forward to helping build our clean-energy economy, modernize our interstate electrical grid and ensure that we are making wise use of our conventional natural resources, including coal, oil and natural gas."LiNeBrEaKIn California, he is expected to increase funding for national parks, protect the coastline from drilling and commit wholeheartedly to developing solar, wind and other alternative energy sources.LiNeBrEaK "He's a Westerner. He's a rancher so he understands the value of public land and wildlife," said Kristina Johnson, spokeswoman for the San Francisco office of the Sierra Club. "He's been an outspoken critic of the Bush administration and its efforts to sell off our public lands to oil interests."LiNeBrEaKStill, many environmentalists are suspicious of Salazar, who endorsed Bush appointee Gale Norton for secretary of the interior when he was attorney general of Colorado. Norton, who is from Colorado, is reviled by environmentalists. LiNeBrEaK Salazar has also been criticized for expressing opposition while he was Colorado attorney general in 1999 to the listing of the black-tailed prairie dog under the Endangered Species Act. His concerns were related to the impact such a listing would have on agribusiness.LiNeBrEaK "The Department of the Interior desperately needs a strong, forward-looking, reform-minded secretary," said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity. "Unfortunately, Ken Salazar is not that man."LiNeBrEaK Salazar, whose family has farmed and ranched in Colorado's San Luis Valley for five generations, was director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources from 1990 through 1994 and was the state's attorney general before he was elected in 2004 to the U.S. Senate.LiNeBrEaK He has sponsored bills and vigorously fought to preserve national monuments, wilderness areas and scenic rivers.LiNeBrEaK He opposed drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has waged a continuing battle against plans by the Bush administration to lease land in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah for oil shale development. He has also led efforts to protect Colorado's Roan Plateau from natural gas drilling. LiNeBrEaKHe supports efforts largely pioneered in California to improve access to national parks to students, minorities and urban youth. Such programs are an integral part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Yosemite National Park and several other California parks.LiNeBrEaK Salazar sponsored the National Park Service Centennial Initiative, which included funding for initiatives like education and diversity. He also introduced the National Park Ranger School Partnership Act, establishing a partnership between the National Park Service and the Department of Education. LiNeBrEaK"He has a very holistic approach to what the national parks mean to this country," said Neal Desai, the senior program manager for the Pacific region of the National Parks Conservation Association, which has advocated for national parks since 1915. "He understands that national parks are national treasures and that we need to make sure that our children and grandchildren have the opportunity to experience their beauty and see their wildlife."LiNeBrEaK The measured support for Salazar comes at a time when the Department of the Interior has been widely criticized under the Bush administration for allegedly squelching efforts to protect endangered species and natural resources. LiNeBrEaK "We recognize he comes from a more moderate centrist philosophy and that we are not going to see eye to eye on every issue," said Roger Singer, the Colorado regional representative of the Sierra Club. "But I would much rather be in the room discussing these issues rather than out of the room as we have been for the past eight years. I expect him to bring more balance to protection to our public lands and wildlife habitat along with a sensible energy program that promotes renewable energy."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   FINAL Edition	Environmental challenges await 2 Obama Cabinet picks;  Agriculture: Nominee Vilsack wins praise from 2 groups that seldom agree 	Kelly Zito, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	671 words  	President-elect Barack Obama's selection of Tom Vilsack, a former governor of a heartland state and a strong supporter of alternative energy sources, as agriculture secretary drew praise Wednesday from both environmentalists and farmers - groups that don't often see eye to eye.LiNeBrEaK"Gov. Vilsack recognizes that farmers, ranchers and forest landowners have an important role to play in combatting climate change," Robert Bonnie, vice president of land, water and wildlife for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. "He is a strong supporter of a cap and trade program for greenhouse gases, carbon offsets and other measures to help stop global warming." LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed, Vilsack, 58, would oversee a federal agency with jurisdiction over school lunch programs, food safety regulations, trade negotiations, department-owned forestlands and crop subsidies, among other things.LiNeBrEaKHistorically, the agriculture industry - with its heavy uses of land, water, genetically modified crops and pesticides - has been seen as being at cross-purposes with environmentalists, who characterize those farming practices as harmful to fragile ecosystems and species.LiNeBrEaKWith his push in Iowa for more research into biofuels and wind energy as well as economic development of far-flung communities, Vilsack is something of a centrist - seemingly a prerequisite in an administration that puts a high value on building broad coalitions.LiNeBrEaK"The next secretary of agriculture is going to have to focus on environmental issues - what are the impacts of agriculture on global warming, particularly on the part of large animal operations, but also what are the solutions," said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF and former agriculture secretary under President Bush. LiNeBrEaKAs the largest agricultural producer in the nation - $37 billion annually - and home to some of the trickiest environment-farming debates, California will loom large in any agricultural policy decisions.LiNeBrEaKOver the past several years, no issue has taken on more prominence for farmers than water. California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta has become ground zero for a battle between environmentalists hoping to save a tiny species of fish from extinction and for the farmers who supply much of the country's fresh fruits and vegetables. Environmentalists want water pumping through the delta to cease or drop substantially; farmers say their industry will fail without an adequate water supply.LiNeBrEaK"There has to be a balance between what is done environmentally and what is done economically," said Tom Nassif, president of Western Growers, a trade group of 3,000 farmers in California and Arizona. "It's only when we don't take into account the economic impact of an environmental provision that we run into trouble - as we have in California with the delta smelt."LiNeBrEaKJack King, spokesman for another trade association, the California Farm Bureau Federation, hopes the incoming agriculture secretary can bring the two sides together.LiNeBrEaK"Yes, Vilsack is conservation-minded," King said, "But with the right touch, that can be helpful. If you give farmers incentives for green initiatives, for habitat preservation, for protecting land from development, it all fits together. We won't always agree with all sides, but if we can agree we have common interests, that will help."LiNeBrEaKVilsack is the latest former Democratic rival Obama has asked to join his administration. In 2006, Vilsack announced his bid for the presidency, but he dropped out in early 2007 before the primaries due to problems raising funds. He threw his support behind New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton but endorsed Obama after Clinton lost the long, bruising campaign for the Democratic nomination.LiNeBrEaK"The next secretary of agriculture is going to have to focus on environmental issues - what are the impacts of agriculture on global warming, particularly on the part of large animal operations, but also what are the solutions."LiNeBrEaKAnn Veneman, executive director of UNICEF and former agriculture secretary under President Bush 	ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (92%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); AGRICULTURE and ENVIRONMENT (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); AGRICULTURE (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); BIOMASS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (77%); AGRICULTURE REGULATION and POLICY (77%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION (77%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (76%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (75%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (75%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); ENERGY RESEARCH (73%); GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS (73%); SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS (73%); AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY (72%); AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES (72%); PESTICIDES (72%); CARBON OFFSETS (72%); FOOD SAFETY REGULATION (69%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (69%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (66%); BIOFUELS (52%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (77%) METRO; PRESIDENT; CABINET; APPOINTMENTS; OFFICIALS; BIOGRAPHY; AGRICULTURE; ENVIRONMENT; FARMS  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (53%); TOM VILSACK (96%) Barack Obama; Tom Vilsack  	SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); IOWA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  				ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE (57%)  											
The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	For inauguration prayer, Obama splits the ticket  	By Rachel Zoll The Associated Press  	NEWS; National; World  	369 words  	The clergy chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to pray at his inauguration fill separate symbolic roles: One is a nod to the civil rights activists who made Obama's election possible. The other is an overture to conservative Christians who rankle some Obama supporters. LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Rick Warren, who will give the invocation, is the most influential pastor in the U.S., and a choice that has caused problems for Obama.LiNeBrEaKWarren is a Southern Baptist who holds traditional religious beliefs and endorsed California's Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage. But he also wants to broaden the evangelical agenda to include fighting global warming, poverty and AIDS.LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Joseph Lowery, 87, is considered the dean of the civil rights movement. For the benediction at the Jan. 20 swearing-in, he says he will pray that the "spirit of fellowship and oneness" at the inauguration endures throughout Obama's presidency.LiNeBrEaK"He gets a lot with these choices," said David Domke, author of The God Strategy: How Religion Became a Political Weapon in America.LiNeBrEaK"Here's a guy who wants to run a progressive administration getting a substantial lift in his wings from the nation's most popular evangelical," Domke said. "But he balances that with Joseph Lowery, who speaks to the more liberal, social justice and African-American heritage."LiNeBrEaKBy picking Warren, Obama is sending another signal, about his willingness to upset liberals by tilting to the center. Gay-rights groups are demanding that Obama rescind the invitation because of Warren's opposition to same-sex marriage.LiNeBrEaK"By inviting Rick Warren to your inauguration, you have tarnished the view that gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans have a place at your table," said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, in a letter to the incoming president.LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday, Obama said he is a "fierce advocate for equality for gay and lesbian Americans." But he said he will build relationships with people of opposing views.LiNeBrEaK"We're not going to agree on every single issue, but what we have to do is to be able to create an atmosphere ... where we can disagree without being disagreeable and then focus on those things that we hold in common as Americans," he said.LiNeBrEaK**FILE** In this March 6, 2008 file photo, Rev.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	EPA memo reverses climate change ruling  	By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune  	NEWS; State  	581 words  	Green groups say the nation's top environmental administrator has dropped "a lump of dirty coal" into Americans' Christmas stockings with a memo that says there is no reason to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions of coal plants.LiNeBrEaKBut an electric-industry spokesman called the memo by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Steven Johnson "brave." And he asserted that, without its findings, more than 20 different industrial sectors, along with offices, schools, apartments and hospitals, might have been subject to "costly and inflexible permitting requirements." LiNeBrEaK"If EPA had embraced any other interpretation and determined carbon to be subject to regulation," said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, "the result could have been catastrophic for the structure of the [Clean Air] Act, the resources of the agency, the U.S. economy and even the environment itself. "LiNeBrEaKUtah has become ground zero for the fight over whether the federal Clean Air Act should be taken into account when new coal-fired power plants are built.LiNeBrEaKJust before Labor Day weekend in 2007, the EPA issued a permit for a power plant on the Ute Indian Reservation in eastern Utah. And, in doing so, the agency opted against considering the climate-change impacts of the proposed plant's emissions.LiNeBrEaKIt was a signal to watchful environmentalists, state regulators and industry on how federal regulators would interpret a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from earlier in the year. In effect, the court cleared the way for regulating greenhouse gases under the clean-air law.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA's permit for the Bonanza plant would have allowed South Jordan-based Deseret Power Electric Cooperative to add a 110-megawatt waste-fuel plant to its generating station south of Vernal in Uintah County.LiNeBrEaKWhatever happens now will have national implications, since there are more than 100 coal plants in process or under appeal, including two other ones in Utah.LiNeBrEaKLast month, a decision by the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board basically told federal regulators, either come up with a better reason why you think global warming pollutants should not be regulated in new power plants or else set a policy on how you will begin regulating them nationwide.LiNeBrEaKDeseret Power officials were not available for comment after hours Thursday.LiNeBrEaKBut Kathy Van Dame of the Wasatch Clean Air Coalition called the latest development "really bad news."LiNeBrEaKAnd Joro Walker, a Salt Lake City environmental attorney, said the memo snubs a key appeals board's directive: that any EPA decision on how to handle greenhouse gases must be reviewed and commented on by the public.LiNeBrEaK"It's a last-minute effort to influence policy" before the Obama administration takes office, said Walker. "But it's not going to work because it was not done properly."LiNeBrEaKIn Utah, the outcome is likely to affect two other proposed power plants.LiNeBrEaKOne is the 270-megawatt Sevier Power coal-fired plant proposed for Sigurd.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Obama rounds out his Cabinet  	By Lorem Ipsum The Salt Lake Tribune  	NEWS; National; World  	252 words  	Washington &raquo; President-elect Barack Obama will announce the final selections for his Cabinet today, naming Rep. Hilda Solis, D-Calif., as labor secretary and former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk as U.S. trade representative. The two will be in Chicago to be formally announced, along with Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., Obama's choice for transportation secretary. LiNeBrEaKWith his selection of Solis, a liberal member of Congress, the president-elect appears to be moving toward his goal of promoting "green-collar jobs" -- those that help promote more energy efficiency, through projects such as retrofitting, something Solis has prioritized during her tenure in Congress.LiNeBrEaKSolis is better known for her effort on energy issues than for her work on matters relating to labor; she sits on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Natural Resources Committee, the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, and the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee -- but not the Education and Labor Committee.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, labor leaders embraced the decision to name Solis, whose father was a Teamsters shop steward in Mexico, to the post. Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, issued a statement underscoring their long-standing alliance.LiNeBrEaKSolis, who was born in Los Angeles in 1957, is the third Latino chosen for the Cabinet (in addition to Bill Richardson and Ken Salazar), and the fifth woman (in addition to Hillary Rodham Clinton, Susan Rice, Janet Napolitano and Lisa Jackson).LiNeBrEaKThe Washington Post	US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (79%); LABOR DEPARTMENTS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); LABOR UNIONS (78%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (75%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (75%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (53%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (54%); NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING (54%); NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS (54%); NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS (54%)  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); HILDA L SOLIS (94%); RAY LAHOOD (58%); BILL RICHARDSON (54%); SUSAN RICE (54%); JANET NAPOLITANO (54%); HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (54%); KEN SALAZAR (54%); RON KIRK (91%); LISA P JACKSON (54%)  	DALLAS, TX, USA (92%); LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); TEXAS, USA (92%); ILLINOIS, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 19, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  	WPO (NYSE) (54%)  	WASHINGTON POST CO (54%)  		SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION (55%)

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	AeroVironment technology to be used at Port of Los Angeles  	By Ryan Carter, Staff Writer  	BUSINESS  	691 words  	As the incoming presidential administration emphasizes renewable and cleaner energy, and defense remains a big priority, Monrovia-based AeroVironment Inc. is well-positioned to reap the benefits, analysts said.LiNeBrEaKAmong those benefits was the company's announcement Thursday that Balqon Corp., a developer of heavy-duty trucks and tractors, has purchased technology that will help it run more efficient and cleaner-running vehicles in the Port of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKBalqon purchased AV's new high-voltage PosiCharge fast-charge system as part of the port's program to replace internal combustion yard tractors with electric propulsion vehicles. LiNeBrEaKThe system can charge up to four heavy-duty electric dock yard tractors at a time, quickly pumping enough energy into them during short breaks. The powering system eliminates the need for battery swapping among vehicles, since the battery is always charged. It also makes the vehicles and the flow of port containers more efficient while helping to reduce emissions, they said.LiNeBrEaKEfficiency was vital for Balwinder Samra, CEO and president of Balqon, which this year won the right to build the port's electric-powered tractor fleet.LiNeBrEaK"In our applications it was important that we had a fast charger to reduce the charging time ... and that we were able to charge these vehicles during any type of downtime we had," he said.LiNeBrEaKSamra also pointed to the Monrovia firm's experience in the market.LiNeBrEaKAnd with cleaner air a hot topic and goal of local leaders, ports, cities and the Obama administration, AeroVironment officials are capitalizing on that experience.LiNeBrEaK"We've got our fast-charge technology, which we think can be instrumental in helping electronic vehicles of all shapes and sizes be much more practical," said Steve Gitlin, director of marketing strategy for AeroVironment.LiNeBrEaKBalqon Corp. manufactures all of the electric yard tractors at the port, which is in the midst of its Clean Air Action Plan, with a goal to cut air emissions in half by 2011, port spokeswoman Theresa Adams Lopez said.LiNeBrEaK"All these new technologies create new jobs, and it's cleaner running technology," she said. "It jump-starts green-collar jobs. It all is good ... new jobs for cleaner air."LiNeBrEaKAmong those jobs are those created by a company like AeroVironment, which is booming, analysts said.LiNeBrEaK"This is a firm that is absolutely on fire," said Erik Olbeter, an analyst who tracks the company for Pacific Crest Securities.LiNeBrEaKAnd the spark over its energy efficiency business has heated up in the last few months, he said.LiNeBrEaK"They've exceed expectations, and certainly as the country, the government and industry becomes more concerned with global warming, AeroVironment's (energy efficiency systems) business is very well positioned with products that not only reduce greenhouse emissions but also save money for companies."LiNeBrEaKBut interest in AV's unmanned aircraft system is also a major part of its business, Olbeter said.LiNeBrEaKThe firm is the market leader in manufacturing small, tactical, unmanned aircraft systems, he said.LiNeBrEaKJust this week, the firm announced that the Italian government cleared its military to fly the firm's unmanned Raven aircraft in Italy's airspace, citing the technology's ability to protect Italian land forces and fly over large populations without limits. LiNeBrEaKIn both cases, the company - founded in 1971 by Paul B. MacCready, Jr., a pioneering designer of human powered aircraft - is looking beyond the immediate uses of its systems.LiNeBrEaKCompany officials are looking beyond the military for use of its aerial systems. And they are looking beyond port and airport vehicle fleets for use of its electrical vehicle technology.LiNeBrEaKAs it stands, the fast-charge system now operating at the port powers thousands of material handling vehicles in airports, factories and distribution centers in North America, Gitlin said.LiNeBrEaKBut there's potential outside of factories and industrial plants, he added.LiNeBrEaK"We're working hard to meet with a lot of players in the emerging electrical vehicle market," Gitlin said.LiNeBrEaKThe interest is showing in the company's stock, Olbeter said.LiNeBrEaKIt closed at $36 a share Thursday, up $1. 19.LiNeBrEaKryan.carter@sgvn.comLiNeBrEaK(626) 962-8811, Ext. 2720	RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); BUSINESS FORECASTS (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); AIR QUALITY (88%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (85%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); MOTOR VEHICLES (72%); MARKETING STRATEGY (64%); JOB CREATION (61%)  		BARACK OBAMA (54%)  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

LiNeBrEaKJust before the snow came, I was sitting at my desk wearing a sweater with a fleece jacket over it, and reading that global warming is about to be on the national agenda again.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration has kept it on ice for much of the past eight years, but Monday Barack Obama named an energy and environment team that plans to get the nation focused on the issue.LiNeBrEaKI especially like that he appointed a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Steven Chu, as energy secretary because energy policy is central to addressing global warming.LiNeBrEaKObama said his policies would be based on science and facts. "We value science."LiNeBrEaKThat'll be a nice change. George Bush spent most of his tenure questioning the science that said people play a role in global warming and didn't mention the subject in a State of the Union address until last January.LiNeBrEaKThat was just before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a report that said human activity has likely been the driving force in the warming trend since 1950. For scientists, not being absolutists, the phrase "very likely" is as strong as it gets.LiNeBrEaKThe Earth has natural warming and cooling cycles, but we've tampered with the pattern. Scientists have been talking about global warning for a long time, but it's been difficult getting action.LiNeBrEaKI spoke with K.C. Golden, policy director for Climate Solutions. In his presentations, Golden uses an illustration from a 1956 New York Times article on how carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels traps heat and is accountable for rising temperatures.LiNeBrEaKHe said individual Americans and other nations have both been waiting for U.S. leadership for decades, yet we still don't have a national policy; in fact, he said, the federal government has been "the primary roadblock," to developing a global response.LiNeBrEaKThe Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997, but the U.S. would not ratify it. Eventually the rest of the world moved forward, but only because U.S. cities and states stepped in to show Americans are willing to make changes. (Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels has been a leader of that movement).LiNeBrEaKGolden said individual Americans also are ready to do their part, and more will, when the national leadership gets serious. He recalled a focus group in which a woman said, "I don't think it's that big of an issue because nobody is doing anything about it."LiNeBrEaKPeople need the same sense of common purpose Americans had during WWII, he said.LiNeBrEaKHe likes the team that Obama has put together.LiNeBrEaK"We wasted a lot of time that we really needed." he said. "It's going to be a harder, steeper hill to climb, but it's not too late."LiNeBrEaKThe sun is about to shine on a critical issue.LiNeBrEaKJerry Large's column appears Monday and Thursday.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Throng reflects McCaskill's clout and Missourians' frustrations  	JO MANNIES  	METRO; Pg. C3  	787 words  	Wednesday offered concrete proof that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill is now the state's most influential Democrat in Washington - and that she will be under increasing pressure to prove it.LiNeBrEaKHundreds of people, most of them average working folks, retirees and students, packed the theater at the Forest Park campus of St. Louis Community College for what was billed as a one-hour "kitchen table talk."LiNeBrEaKNo kitchen tables were in sight, but there was no shortage of talk. Dozens filled both aisles, snaking all the way to the back doors, to get access to a mike, and lay out their concerns. LiNeBrEaKIt was clear they had shown up because McCaskill is a close ally of new President-elect Barack Obama. Even if she and other Democrats failed to carry the state for him, many locals see McCaskill as their strongest link to the new administration soon to take over the White House.LiNeBrEaKSome pressed their favorite causes: global warming, ending the war in Iraq, expanding health care coverage.LiNeBrEaKSeveral were educators concerned about new federal regulations that could force them to pay into the Social Security system while also continuing to pay into the state retirement program for public school employees.LiNeBrEaK"I've got your back. I understand your problem," McCaskill told the educators, as she detailed congressional efforts to block the changes.LiNeBrEaKMcCaskill was stunned by Wednesday's turnout. "I am overwhelmed how many of you are here, and how many of you want to speak," she said.LiNeBrEaKAfter extending the session about 20 minutes, she and her staff took the names of all aisle-standers who didn't get to ask a question. She promised to call each later with a personal reply, and to hold another such session soon.LiNeBrEaKI've covered many congressional public forums before, but never have I seen one fill the balcony. In this case, even McCaskill tacitly recognized that the throng was less an indication of any personal popularity and more a sign of public angst about the nation's economic health.LiNeBrEaKIf she and others in Washington fail soon to ease the latter, you can forget about the former.LiNeBrEaKA mixed bagLiNeBrEaKMcCaskill is among a number of Missouri politicos, many of whom who weren't on the Nov. 4 ballot, who now find themselves both winners and losers.LiNeBrEaKOthers on that list include Missouri's senior senator, Republican Christopher "Kit" Bond; the new governor-elect, Democrat Jay Nixon; and the outgoing governor, Republican Matt Blunt.LiNeBrEaKBond's political operation gets some of the credit for helping the state Republican Party amass enough rural votes to eke out a presidential victory for GOP nominee John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin.LiNeBrEaKEven so, Bond's visible support did little for the Republican nominee for governor, outgoing U.S. Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Columbia, who got creamed by Nixon.LiNeBrEaKHulshof's poor showing could make it harder for Bond to promote him for another statewide office. Bond also could find that his own political muscle is seen as less daunting if he takes sides in future Missouri contests - or when he gears up in the coming months for an expected 2010 bid for re-election.LiNeBrEaKIf victory margins are any measure, Nixon's huge 19-percentage-point win should give him solid political capital when the Legislature begins a new session next month. So should Nixon's success in carrying Missouri Republicans' most hallowed turf: Greene County in southwest Missouri, which takes in Springfield.LiNeBrEaKBut Nixon's hefty victory is tempered by his party's failure to cut into Republican control of the Legislature. The state GOP increased its margin in the state Senate to 23 seats out of 32.LiNeBrEaKAnd now Nixon faces a troubling state economic picture, which could make it harder for him to fulfill many of his campaign promises, at least in the short term.LiNeBrEaKOutgoing Gov. Matt Blunt, a Republican, also has a mixed political legacy. There may be debate over his governmental record, but it's a fact that he no longer wields much clout within the state Republican Party.LiNeBrEaKHis allies running the operation, including party executive director Jared Craighead (who also gets praise for McCain's win), are expected to be replaced within weeks by a new team with ties to Bond or Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, the only Republicans left holding statewide posts.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, a lesser-known Republican achieved a victory last Sunday in his quest to ease the state's bipartisan tensions. State Senate Majority Leader Kevin Engler, R-Farmington, persuaded all the newly elected statewide officials - Democrats and Republicans - to attend a holiday open house at his home.LiNeBrEaKLike McCaskill, Engler was blown away by the public response. According to state House Majority Leader Steve Tilley, R-Perryville, at least 300 locals showed up.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Obama irks some environmentalists His choice to lead Interior Dept., Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., gets cautious praise from mining industry.  	By John M. Broder NEW YORK TIMES  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	658 words  	WASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama's choice to lead the Interior Department, Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado, said Wednesday that his job would be to try to balance protection of public lands with the continued development of domestic sources of coal, oil and natural gas.LiNeBrEaKHis efforts in the past as a state and federal official to thread the difficult political needle between the environment and energy brought him decidedly mixed reviews from environmental groups on Wednesday, but cautious praise from energy and mining interests. LiNeBrEaKAs he deals with climate change, land and water issues, protection of endangered species and relations with American Indian tribes, Salazar will have to manage an agency demoralized by years of scandal, political interference and mismanagement.LiNeBrEaKObama introduced Salazar and Tom Vilsack, the former Iowa governor chosen to be secretary of agriculture, at a news conference Wednesday in Chicago.LiNeBrEaK"It's time for a new kind of leadership in Washington that's committed to using our lands in a responsible way to benefit all our families," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKSalazar, wearing his customary ten-gallon hat and bolo tie, said his job would entail helping the nation address climate change through a technological "moon shot" on energy independence. That includes not just development of green energy sources such as wind power, but also the continued domestic development of coal, oil and natural gas, fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gases when they are burned.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental advocates offered mixed reviews of Salazar, 53, a first-term Democratic senator who served as head of Colorado's natural resources department and as the state's attorney general. Salazar was not the first choice of environmentalists, who openly pushed the appointment of Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, D-Ariz. Grijalva has a strong record as a conservationist.LiNeBrEaKOil and mining interests praised Salazar's record as a state official and as a senator, saying that he was not doctrinaire about the use of public lands for resource exploitation. "Nothing in his record suggests he's an ideologue," said Luke Popovich, spokesman for the National Mining Association.LiNeBrEaKPopovich noted approvingly that Salazar had tried to engineer a deal in the Senate under which mining companies and others could reclaim abandoned mines without fear of lawsuits. (The legislation is pending.) He also backed a compromise under which oil companies could drill for natural gas in limited parts of the Roan Plateau in northwestern Colorado, a plan that most environmental advocates opposed.LiNeBrEaKPam Kiely, program director at Environment Colorado, said Salazar had been a champion of wilderness protection and strong water quality laws and a skeptic on oil shale development, a subject of controversy in the Mountain West. She said that she was unsure of his views on drilling in millions of acres of national forests and roadless areas.LiNeBrEaKSalazar drew harsh criticism from some environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK"He is a right-of-center Democrat who often favors industry and big agricultural interests in battles over global warming, fuel efficiency and endangered species," said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, which tracks endangered species and habitat issues.LiNeBrEaKDaniel R. Patterson, a former official of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management and now southwest regional director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said that Salazar "has a disturbingly weak conservation record, particularly on energy development, global warming, endangered wildlife and protecting scientific integrity."LiNeBrEaKEven as Salazar navigates the department's tricky political crosscurrents, he must also deal with calls to reverse dozens of decisions made under President George W. Bush's administration on endangered species and oil and gas leasing. And he must do so with a management team weakened by the departure of dozens of demoralized career employees.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Ex-Iowa governor is agriculture pick Obama cites new Agriculture Department head's expertise in dealing with farm issues.  	By Michael Doyle McClatchy Newspapers  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	399 words  	WASHINGTON - Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack will inherit a lumbering bureaucracy and have much to learn about fruits and vegetables, as the nation's next agriculture secretary.LiNeBrEaKVilsack is well-rooted in Midwestern commodities but not in the bounty from states such as California and Florida. Specialty crop growers will lobby to buttress the new farm chief with their allies.  LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, President-elect Barack Obama played up Vilsack's agricultural expertise as he announced him as his choice to run the Agriculture Department.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously, if you don't know agriculture, you're not going to become governor of Iowa," Obama said at a news conference, adding that Vilsack has "also been forward-looking" in his policies.LiNeBrEaKBecause Congress already has set crop subsidies and other agricultural policies for the next five years, with a farm bill enacted in May over President George W. Bush's veto, Vilsack could be a low-visibility Cabinet secretary. Even so, he'll confront a difficult-to-manage agency that spends $89 billion a year.LiNeBrEaKThe Agriculture Department's systematic problems, identified by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, include:LiNeBrEaK- Subsidy abuse. The Agriculture Department paid crop subsidies totaling $1. 1 billion in the names of 172,800 deceased individuals from 1999 to 2005. Critics decry the continuing payment of subsidies to wealthy farmers.LiNeBrEaK- Food dangers. Food safety-inspection staffing has declined steadily over the past decade despite budget increases, while the quantity of contaminated meat and poultry recalled by industry has increased sharply.LiNeBrEaK- Civil rights woes. Even after paying nearly $1 billion to minority farmers as a result of a lawsuit, the department faces persistent discrimination complaints.LiNeBrEaK"I look forward to the challenge," Vilsack said Wednesday, adding that "farmers and ranchers deserve a secretary of agriculture that respects them."LiNeBrEaKVilsack stressed, in order, the importance of "improving profitability for farmers," the need for "sustainable practices" and fighting "global climate change," and the centrality of good nutrition in feeding programs.LiNeBrEaKAlso Wednesday, Republican and Democratic sources said Obama would nominate Peoria Republican congressman Ray LaHood as transportation secretary. LaHood is an ideological moderate who has a well-established reputation for bipartisanship and efforts to encourage civil discourse in Congress.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 18, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: An energy crisis fades  	Times Union, Albany, N.Y.  	COMMENTARY  	563 words  	Dec. 18--Think back -- way back -- to the summer of 2008, when gas prices had soared past $4 a gallon and we were primed to hit $5. Republicans in Congress were demanding that Democrats abandon their objection to offshore drilling, in the name of the economy, national security, and the poorer and poorer American motorist. Presidential hopeful John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, were chanting "drill, baby, drill." Mr. McCain was casting domestic oil exploration as one of the keys to the nation's energy independence.LiNeBrEaKAnd now, here we are, with gas prices down last week to $1. 66 a gallon nationwide, and a report Monday in The New York Times that oil and gas companies are shutting down dozens of projects and slashing spending on exploration. LiNeBrEaKNo worries here, folks. Gas is cheap, relatively speaking, once again, and might even get cheaper. Like that crazy talk about human activity being responsible for global warming, all that worry about a dwindling supply of oil was just liberal fear mongering. Why, the supply of oil is probably replenishing itself underground as we speak.LiNeBrEaKChill, baby, chill.LiNeBrEaKExcept that's absolutely the wrong thing to do. We may not expect Big Oil to look out for America's best interests, but Congress cannot put the security of this nation's energy future on the back burner just because gas is, relatively speaking, cheap again for a moment. Nor can President-elect Barack Obama, who made progress on alternative energy and weaning America off Middle Eastern oil within 10 years one of his major campaign planks. Along with the economy and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, energy is an issue on which Mr. Obama needs to hit the ground running.LiNeBrEaKIf there was a bright spot in $4-plus gasoline, it was that it focused our attention on the reality that oil is a finite resource. It is growing ever harder and ever costlier to pull out of the ground, and ever pricier as an ever-more populous and ever-more industrialized planet demands more and more of it.LiNeBrEaKThis lull, experts agree, will be temporary, brought on by a drop in demand caused by high prices and a global economic crisis. The oil industry's cutbacks will probably only hasten, and possibly deepen, the rebound of such prices, because not only will the demand return, but the prospects for expanding the supply of oil will be put off even longer.LiNeBrEaKIt is as if we have relived the 1970s oil crisis and its aftermath -- a huge spike in prices, a national call for conservation, and more than two decades of collective amnesia and rising consumption -- in the span of just a few months.LiNeBrEaKJust slap a Hummer ad on the national billboard, cue up a song about that super-charged V-8, tell Detroit to never mind about fuel economy, and the circle would be complete.LiNeBrEaKChill, baby, chill.LiNeBrEaKThe crisis will come 'round again soon enough.LiNeBrEaKThe Issue: Oil and gas companies shut down projects as the price of gas plummets.LiNeBrEaKThe Stakes: Our nation needs more foresight than the oil industry.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition	Obama names Salazar to head Interior  	DINA CAPPIELLO Associated Press  	News; Pg. A9  	344 words  	WASHINGTON As the nation's 50th Interior secretary, Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar would face a backlog of rare species awaiting protection, maintenance backlogs at national parks and an agency often too cozy with oil companies. President-elect Barack Obama said Wednesday he wants the Interior Department to clean up its act, naming Salazar as his choice to do it.  LiNeBrEaKBalancing the harnessing of the nation's energy, land and water resources while protecting its environment won't be easy. And Interior is inherently an agency in conflict, charged with both developing energy resources on and under government land while also protecting that land including tribal reservations, national parks and wildlife refuges from being exploited. "We've had an Interior Department that was deeply troubled," Obama said as he announced his plan to nominate Salazar as well as his choice of Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack for Secretary of Agriculture. In Salazar's four years in the Senate, he has sided more with protectionist than development aspects of the department's mission. He opposed Bush administration efforts to develop oil shale resources in the West and open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and natural gas exploration. But he also helped broker a deal to allow more offshore drilling, while arguing that oil companies should be made to renegotiate offshore Gulf of Mexico leases by the Clinton administration that enabled them to escape making billions of dollars in royalty payments to the government. Salazar has also been a vocal advocate of renewable energy, and the public lands he will oversee include some of the nation's largest sources of wind, solar and geothermal energy. Salazar, the first Hispanic elected to statewide office in Colorado, said he would work to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and take "the moon shot" on energy independence. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chair of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, said Salazar will remove "the 'For Sale' sign the Bush administration has placed on public lands."

The Washington Times 		December 18, 2008 Thursday 	Rise in U.S. demand for oil seen as near nil  	By Tom LoBianco, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A08  	553 words  	Federal energy analysts said Wednesday that U.S. demand for oil barely will grow over the coming decades because of efforts to reduce use and invest in renewable power sources, but fossil fuels will continue to make up 80 percent of the nation's energy supplies. LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Information Administration also revised its estimates of carbon pollution downward from a year ago, saying three factors are responsible: higher prices, more energy-efficient technology and business investors wary of spending money on "dirty" fuel development.LiNeBrEaK"There's no question that the issue of climate change, even in the absence of policy change, is affecting investment behavior," said Howard Gruenspecht, acting administrator at the EIA. "Concern about new greenhouse gas regulations has dampened interest in new coal plants."LiNeBrEaKConcurrently, analysts expect the nation's carbon dioxide output to remain relatively flat over the next few decades because of the new attitudes of investors and consumers.LiNeBrEaKThe predictions appear to foreshadow much of the wider change in energy policy and increased environmental regulations expected from the incoming Obama administration and the emboldened Democrat-led Congress.LiNeBrEaKThe EIA also expects that reliance on oil will drop significantly between now and 2030: The United States imported 58 percent of oil consumed in 2007 and is expected to import 41 percent in 2030.LiNeBrEaK"This is a substantial move toward reduced dependency on imports," Mr. Gruenspecht said.LiNeBrEaKFossil-fuel supporters used the findings to bolster their call for domestic oil and gas exploration.LiNeBrEaK"The oil price is a huge driver in this forecast," said Mary Hutzler, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Research, an oil industry-funded think tank in the District.LiNeBrEaKCongress' decision to end the ban on offshore drilling drove up the expected supply of domestic oil, she said, and opening the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge for exploration would further decrease the need for foreign oil.LiNeBrEaK"Conservation and renewables are going to be the primary areas to pursue," said Ms. Hutzler, who ran the EIA from 2001 to 2003. "The forecast shows that happening to a certain extent, and it may happen even more depending on what policies happen in the energy. I think an important issue is that fossil fuels still represent 79 percent of supply" in 2030.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups Thursday said the EIA is likely understating some of its predictions, given that Congress and the incoming Obama administration widely expect to cap carbon emissions and invest heavily in renewable energy sources - both of which bode poorly for the fossil fuel industry.LiNeBrEaK"It would certainly be a colossal error to invest in something like a coal plant at this point," said Josh Dorner, spokesman for the Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKAs market forces and the stick (the threat of increased federal regulations) appear to mitigate oil consumption, so, too, does the carrot (tax incentives) appear to increase alternative energy investments, analysts said.LiNeBrEaKA federal tax credit for solar panel projects previously had been capped at $2,000 per installation but was lifted earlier this year to allow a 30 percent write-off for the cost of a project - which can routinely cost up to $35,000, Mr. Gruenspecht said.LiNeBrEaKThe result, EIA estimates, will be a relatively large increase in solar energy use by 2030.

The Washington Times 		December 18, 2008 Thursday  	Germany's approach;  An empty shoe for Mrs. Merkel 	By Suzanne Fields, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES   	OPED ; A23   	828 words  	 Chancellor Angela Merkel is suffering a barrage of metaphors, some of them pointed and all of them mixed. So, too, President Nicholas Sarkozy in neighboring France. They're the odd couple of the European Union, usually depicted as friends, but every European understands that kisses on both cheeks do not a romance make. Their dance was once a graceful duet in a light-hearted French operetta, but she's now singing off key in a solo, rendering them a misbegotten couple in a Wagnerian opera. LiNeBrEaK Enough metaphors already? The German press has more. "These days both leaders are governing on the thin ice of the financial crisis, but Mr. Sarkozy is whistling as he turns confident pirouettes, while Mrs. Merkel is crawling across the slippery surface on all fours, slowly and cautiously,"  observes Der Spiegel, the weekly newsmagazine, invoking popular cliches to deride the strategy the two leaders are using to deal with the recession.  LiNeBrEaK Other leaders in the European Union want her to package a bigger stimulus, but the cautious Frau Merkel is indeed cautious. She offers only modest sums to trigger investment. Mixed messages join mixed metaphors at home. When the chancellor met this week with government ministers, business executives and labor leaders to find ways to slow the recession, the meeting concluded with mush calling for "collective accountability,"  which is no more appealing than "accountable collectivity."  Most Germans do not suffer from personal debt. They're stingy with the plastic. But if they guard their credit cards, they don't seem to mind costly government measures for saving the environment. LiNeBrEaK Once a staunch supporter of the Merkel environmental protections, German Greens now depict the chancellor in shades of yellow, charging her with cowardice as her enthusiasm for fighting global warming cools (even as the globe itself cools). The Greens are especially angry that she joined other EU nations in a compromise that delays setting goals for reducing carbon emissions in Eastern Europe, where there's a reliance on smokestack industries. She insists that ambitious targeted goals remain in place for the year 2020, but that means playing a waiting game, and there's a long, long time between 2008 and 2020. LiNeBrEaK Seeking to turn her negatives, Frau Merkel praised the EU economic stimulus package of 200 billion euros ($267 billion) and promised Germans that she would spend billions of euros on road building and repairs next year. She feels the sting in the French accusation that she's "Madam Non,"  and failed Mr. Sarkozy for failing to join his expensive "rescue"  proposals. She likes the sound of "Madam Oui"  better. LiNeBrEaK Her pas de deux with Mr. Sarkozy over, she's determined to avoid the look of the wallflower. She's eager now for Barack Obama to sign her dance card. The chancellor says she won't commit to more spending on the German economic crisis until after the inauguration "of the new president of the world's largest economy was in office."  She, like most Europeans, is counting on the messiah from Chicago. LiNeBrEaK Teutonic times are tough all over. The German car industry is fastening its seat belts for the bumpiest ride in its history. BMW and Mercedes-Benz, long synonyms for "quality"  and "luxury,"  are suffering acute car sickness. They haven't been hit as hard as the Detroit Three, but their cars aren't turning heads and emptying wallets as they did only yesterday. Driving a sedan with a big engine reflects both bad taste and bad judgment in a declining economy. BMW cut more than 8,000 jobs this year and Mercedes says it will sell 150,000 fewer cars next year than it expected to do. Opel, the cutting-edge German car owned by General Motors, is vulnerable, too. Used cars with name brands are less desirable, too, as prospective owners worry that spare parts - batteries, brakes, fan belts, even windshield wipers - will be hard to find. LiNeBrEaK Mistakes seen through a rear-view mirror only reveal the landscape left behind, and foresight requires manufacturers to change their attitude as well as their designs. Expensive models with fast engines are suddenly unappreciated by drivers addicted to racing across the autobahns. Porsche became the major shareholder in Volkswagen with the intent to make sports cars with more power, but now those expected 12- and 16-cylinder monster engines look only like out-of-reach indulgences for a future demanding fuel efficiency. LiNeBrEaK Despite the bad economy, Berliners are reveling as usual in their distinctive Christmas markets, scooping up trinkets, gorging on potato pancakes and sipping Gl&uuml;hwein, the distinctive warmed wine. On St. Nicholas Day, celebrated early in December, children found their polished shoes stuffed with candy and sweets as always. The saint lived up to his reputation as a "wonderworker."  Mrs. Merkel once imagined herself as someone like that, but not this year. That's one metaphor that's gone missing. LiNeBrEaK Suzanne Fields is a syndicated columnist.

The Washington Post 		December 18, 2008 Thursday   Regional Edition	Environmental Quality;  Barack Obama's energy and environment team should aim for U.S. leadership on climate change. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A24  	482 words  	NOW THAT President-elect Barack Obama's energy and environment team is complete, the message he's sending is loud and clear: The vacuum of U.S. leadership on climate change  will be filled. His nominees share his goal of reducing carbon emissions and developing the next generation of energy production that will reduce this nation's dependence on fossil fuels. More important, they generally reflect the pragmatic approach to governing that Mr. Obama appears to be crafting with his Cabinet picks overall. LiNeBrEaKWhat Mr. Obama wants to accomplish is well known and would be a radical change in approach from the Bush administration's. Carbon dioxide would be declared a dangerous pollutant to be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. California would get the EPA waiver it was denied last year to implement its stringent tailpipe emissions standards. And the United States would institute a cap-and-trade system that would put a price on carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a declining allotment of pollution allowances. Mr. Obama has said his goal is to reduce U.S. emissions to the level of 1990 by 2020 -- an ambitious target, though one that falls short of recent commitments by European countries.LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu, the Nobel physics laureate who has been nominated as energy secretary,  heads the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which focuses on projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Lisa Jackson was chosen to be the next administrator of the  EPA. She had been the chief of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection and is credited with helping pass the state's Global Warming Response Act (its goal is an 80 percent reduction in the 2006 level of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050). Nancy Sutley will bring her years of experience at the EPA and the California State Water Resources Control Board and as an energy adviser to then-Gov. Gray Davis (D) to bear as the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Carol M. Browner, EPA administrator under President Bill Clinton, will coordinate the administration's energy, environment and climate change policy from the White House. (Question: Isn't this what the Council on Environmental Quality is supposed to do?) Rounding out this team are Sen. Ken Salazar (Colo.) and former Iowa  governor Tom Vilsack, who were tapped yesterday as the next interior and agriculture secretaries, respectively.LiNeBrEaKWe understand some of the rumblings from industry still smarting over Ms. Browner's aggressive and successful efforts to push through clean-air rules while she was at the EPA. Getting buy-in from all sectors for the tough decisions that are to come to address global warming may require a softer touch. For Mr. Obama himself, the biggest challenge will be addressing climate change while not stifling the growth that will be needed to pull the  United States out of its economic pit.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Commuter Rides Begin: Rail Service To SF Starts Today  	Lloyd Jojola, Albuquerque Journal, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1340 words  	Dec. 17--When train No. 500 of the Rail Runner Express eases into the Santa Fe Depot at 5: 45 a.m. today -- its hour-and-22-minute trip from the Duke City behind it -- commuter rail service to and from Santa Fe begins.LiNeBrEaKIt arrives after a year-anda-half of construction on the second phase of the state's $400 million commuter rail project, and more than two years since service was launched in the Albuquerque metropolitan corridor, between Belen and Bernalillo.LiNeBrEaKLauded as a visionary mass transit effort by many, the endeavor still draws criticism from some because of the cost. LiNeBrEaK"This is a historic day for New Mexico," Gov. Bill Richardson said Monday, standing in the swaying passenger car during the train's inaugural Santa Fe run. "Because what we're doing today is changing transportation in the state. It's historic because with the Rail Runner, we're moving into a new sustainable economy for the state.LiNeBrEaK"This saves gas money. It reduces pollution -- makes us fight against global warming. It makes a pleasant commute. It reduces traffic and accidents."LiNeBrEaK'A boost for business'LiNeBrEaK"I've lived in Albuquerque all my life, and all my life I've been waiting for the train between Albuquerque and Santa Fe," said travel agent Nancy Weaver, a passenger on Monday's inaugural ride that took place through falling snow. "Because we're so close, yet we don't come up here, unless for a special occasion."LiNeBrEaKIndeed, it's the Santa Fe leg that's especially been anticipated, particularly by weekday commuters.LiNeBrEaKThe service will have two stops in the capital city initially: at the South Capitol Complex Station and at the Santa Fe Depot at the existing rail yards. At least two more stations are planned: Zia Road and St. Francis Drive, and N.M. 599 and I-25.LiNeBrEaKFrom Downtown Albuquerque to the Santa Fe Depot, weekday commute times will generally run about 80 minutes. There will be Saturday service, and a late evening train will run on Fridays and Saturdays.LiNeBrEaK"The train will be a boost for tourism," state Transportation Secretary Rhonda Faught said the day of the ceremonial trip. "It will also be a boost for business. ... It's going to be an economic development tool. And we also know with this downturn in the economy, everything we can do to help improve our economy will only be a benefit, and this is going to help it."LiNeBrEaKThe reasons to take it can be even more simple.LiNeBrEaK"I'm going down (to Albuquerque) because there's a Greek place on Central Avenue. I can't get a good decent Greek meal in Santa Fe," Philip Esposito of Santa Fe said while watching the first train leave the Railyard station Monday.LiNeBrEaK100 miles in 5 yearsLiNeBrEaK"In five years, we've built 100 miles of commuter rail service. That's unheard of in the country," said Lawrence Rael of the Mid-Region Council of Governments, which managed the project. "We're now being used as a model by many folks."LiNeBrEaKI n 2 0 0 3 , R ich a r d s on announced he would pursue the commuter train endeavor that became part of the Legislature-approved $1. 6 billion Governor Richardson's Investment Partnership, or GRIP, a transportation infrastructure improvement package, which paid for most of the project.LiNeBrEaKBut the idea, even early on, had critics. Some legislators said it was squeezing money from road funding. Others point out that the train's operating costs will be largely taxpayer subsidized.LiNeBrEaK"The Great Train Robbery," is what The Rio Grande Foundation -- a "free market think tank" -- and Citizens Against Government Waste called the project in its recently issued pork-barrel spending report.LiNeBrEaK"In 'The Great Train Robbery,' a band of outlaws robs trains," the report reads. "In New Mexico's version, taxpayers are being 'held up' to pay for trains.

A1  	1266 words  	When train No. 500 of the Rail Runner Express eases into the Santa Fe Depot at 5: 45 a.m. today - its hour-and-22-minute trip from the Duke City behind it - commuter rail service to and from Santa Fe begins.LiNeBrEaKIt arrives after a year-anda-half of construction on the second phase of the state's $400 million commuter rail project, and more than two years since service was launched in the Albuquerque metropolitan corridor, between Belen and Bernalillo.LiNeBrEaKLauded as a visionary mass transit effort by many, the endeavor still draws criticism from some because of the cost.LiNeBrEaK"This is a historic day for New Mexico," Gov. Bill Richardson said Monday, standing in the swaying passenger car during the train's inaugural Santa Fe run. "Because what we're doing today is changing transportation in the state. It's historic because with the Rail Runner, we're moving into a new sustainable economy for the state. LiNeBrEaK"This saves gas money. It reduces pollution - makes us fight against global warming. It makes a pleasant commute. It reduces traffic and accidents."LiNeBrEaK'A boost for business'LiNeBrEaK"I've lived in Albuquerque all my life, and all my life I've been waiting for the train between Albuquerque and Santa Fe," said travel agent Nancy Weaver, a passenger on Monday's inaugural ride that took place through falling snow. "Because we're so close, yet we don't come up here, unless for a special occasion."LiNeBrEaKIndeed, it's the Santa Fe leg that's especially been anticipated, particularly by weekday commuters.LiNeBrEaKThe service will have two stops in the capital city initially: at the South Capitol Complex Station and at the Santa Fe Depot at the existing rail yards. At least two more stations are planned: Zia Road and St. Francis Drive, and N.M. 599 and I-25.LiNeBrEaKFrom Downtown Albuquerque to the Santa Fe Depot, weekday commute times will generally run about 80 minutes. There will be Saturday service, and a late evening train will run on Fridays and Saturdays.LiNeBrEaK"The train will be a boost for tourism," state Transportation Secretary Rhonda Faught said the day of the ceremonial trip. "It will also be a boost for business. ... It's going to be an economic development tool. And we also know with this downturn in the economy, everything we can do to help improve our economy will only be a benefit, and this is going to help it."LiNeBrEaKThe reasons to take it can be even more simple.LiNeBrEaK"I'm going down (to Albuquerque) because there's a Greek place on Central Avenue. I can't get a good decent Greek meal in Santa Fe," Philip Esposito of Santa Fe said while watching the first train leave the Railyard station Monday.LiNeBrEaK100 miles in 5 yearsLiNeBrEaK"In five years, we've built 100 miles of commuter rail service. That's unheard of in the country," said Lawrence Rael of the Mid-Region Council of Governments, which managed the project. "We're now being used as a model by many folks."LiNeBrEaKIn 2003 , Richards on announced he would pursue the commuter train endeavor that became part of the Legislature-approved $1. 6 billion Governor Richardson's Investment Partnership, or GRIP, a transportation infrastructure improvement package, which paid for most of the project.LiNeBrEaKBut the idea, even early on, had critics. Some legislators said it was squeezing money from road funding. Others point out that the train's operating costs will be largely taxpayer subsidized.LiNeBrEaK"The Great Train Robbery," is what The Rio Grande Foundation - a "free market think tank" - and Citizens Against Government Waste called the project in its recently issued pork-barrel spending report.LiNeBrEaK"In 'The Great Train Robbery,' a band of outlaws robs trains," the report reads.

The Anniston Star (Alabama)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	EPA considering livestock fee  	Michael A. Bell and Mike Faulk, The Anniston Star, Ala.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	569 words  	Dec. 17--ALEXANDRIA -- Farmers said it could be harder making ends meet as long as their livestock cuts the cheese.LiNeBrEaKThat's because the Environmental Protection Agency is considering slapping fees on pork and cow gassiness.LiNeBrEaK"You know, the whole thing has an air about it," said Scott Butler, director of the Calhoun County Farm Services Agency. "What about chickens? What about humans? What about buffalo? To me it's ridiculous. Where does it stop?" LiNeBrEaKThe EPA's proposal would require farms with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog, The Associated Press reported.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that belching and gaseous animals amount to air pollution.LiNeBrEaK"It's borderline immoral at this time," said Leianne Wright of Wright Dairy Farms, adding that many of her customers are on limited income, some saving quarters to buy milk and ice cream.LiNeBrEaKRoughly 80 cows graze at her 290-acre farm off U.S. 431. The EPA fee would cost the farm about $14,000 more each year.LiNeBrEaK"It's a livestock tax -- that's all it comes down to," she said.LiNeBrEaKButler and Wright said the only way farmers can absorb the extra cost is by passing that cost onto the consumer.LiNeBrEaKPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals spokesman Bruce Freidrich said the beef industry gets billions in taxpayer handouts, and meat producers should pay their fair share back.LiNeBrEaK"If the meat industry claims it will go out of business if it has to pay a tiny fraction of what it's given by American taxpayers, then it should go out of business on that basis alone -- it's not economically viable," Freidrich said in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKPerry Mobley, commodities director for beef, equine and hay and forage crops with the Alabama Farmer's Federation, said the measure doesn't just single out the cattle and pork industry.LiNeBrEaK"If you think about it: everything emits greenhouse gases. Even you and I."LiNeBrEaKHe begins to laugh.LiNeBrEaK"It's the truth. You know it and I know it."LiNeBrEaKMobley said there's 1. 2 million cattle in Alabama, yet 3 million white tail deer.LiNeBrEaK"And white tail deer have the same gastrointestinal system that cows do," he said. "If it went into play -- and I pray and hope that it doesn't -- it would just shut down the entire livestock industry in this country."LiNeBrEaKPat Byington, a former member of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management's commission for environmental management, said farm animal flatulence is a contributor to climate change, but it's one of many.LiNeBrEaK"I think you have to prioritize problems and there are greater problems than that," said Pete Conroy, director of Jacksonville State University's Environmental Policy and Information Center.LiNeBrEaKLocals think the idea of the EPA fee stinks, too.LiNeBrEaK"Just the idea of trying to tax greenhouse gases from the cows ... it takes an idiot to think of that," said Jimmy O'Dell, Calhoun County Board of Registrar's board member.LiNeBrEaKO'Dell joked the measure passing could eventually mean taxes on beans.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: Much pain ? little gain: State air-quality regulators approve hugely expensive, intrusive anti-emissions plan  	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	539 words  	Dec. 17--The California Air Resources Board approval last week of top-down micromanagement of industries and commerce, ostensibly to rid California of global warming, is a broad intrusion into the private sector that not only will be costly, but ultimately a solution for a problem for which dimensions have been defined more by politics than science and probably doesn't even exist. LiNeBrEaKThe ARB's "scoping plan" details the regulations and costs to be imposed on nearly every facet of California economic life to implement 2006's presumptuously named "Global Warming Solutions Act." It's the last thing a struggling economy needs, and the last thing a nearly bankrupt state government should be undertaking.LiNeBrEaKNot only have the Earth's temperatures subsided and even reversed in recent years, but state officials disingenuously claim their mandates and regulations will boost California's economy. They base their rosy projections on their own self-serving studies, which have been widely and authoritatively criticized.LiNeBrEaK"I have come to the inescapable conclusion that the (state's) economic analysis is terribly deficient in critical ways and should not be used by the state government or the public for the purpose of assessing the likely costs of CARB's plans," commented Robert Stavins of Harvard, one of six highly regarded reviewers commissioned by the state to critique the economic projections. All six experts were harshly critical.LiNeBrEaKThe state's own independent Legislative Analyst's Office came to similar negative conclusions about the Air Resources Board's hyped economic outlook.LiNeBrEaKWhat is certain is the $23 billion in taxes and fees even the state concedes the plan will cost the private sector.LiNeBrEaKThe mountain of rules and regulations approved by the ARB now will go through more public hearings and workshops to fine tune the details of each mandate, all of which must be in place by 2012. Some measures, such as developing a requirement for "cool" vehicle paint to lessen interior heat and thus the need for auto air-conditioning, already are under way. Others, like creation of the complex "cap and trade" artificial market to allow greenhouse gas emitters to pay to continue emitting, and reward companies that cut back, will take longer to finalize.LiNeBrEaKUltimate implementation may depend on how much pain the Schwarzenegger administration is willing to inflict on the economy. Costly environmental mandates are more accepted by the private sector when times are good. Times are tough today, which means added expenses and new costs will be felt sooner and more acutely. We hope the governor shows restraint in implementing these far-reaching mandates, which he can delay up to one year at a time if he finds they would inflict economic harm. Otherwise, the consequences could be severe, and felt soon.

LiNeBrEaKThe grant provides for partnering with farmers in three counties (Whatcom, Skagit, and San Juan), as well as farm advocacy and educational organizations in the region, to develop a ranked set of farm resiliency indicators -- a set of measureable indices to test the ability of the region's family farms to withstand four likely events or rapid changes: global climate change, seasonal flooding, urban/rural encroachment in farming areas, and uncertain energy prices.LiNeBrEaK"This is the institute's first large grant, and we're excited that it's sufficiently multidisciplinary to involve other departments and programs on campus, as well as other Huxley faculty," said institute director and WWU professor of environmental studies Gigi Berardi.LiNeBrEaKFor more information on the grant or on the work of the institute, contact Berardi at gigi.berardi@wwu.edu	GRANTS and GIFTS (90%); AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (77%); FAMILY FARMS (77%); CLIMATOLOGY (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (73%)  	General  		WASHINGTON, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081217-BH-BRF-Western-s-Huxley-College-awarded-140,000-grant-for-local-farm-project-1217  	Newspaper  	BH  	2008 The Bellingham Herald   		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (67%)  		US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (84%)

LiNeBrEaKFrom staff reportsLiNeBrEaKUABLiNeBrEaKEnvironmental talks continueLiNeBrEaK  The University of Alabama at Birmingham is continuing its year-round discussion of the environment Thursday with a talk about the watercress darter and the use of biofuels. The discussion will be held at 11: 30 a.m. at the Blazer Residence Life Center. It's meant to continue the ecological theme set by this year's campuswide discussion book, Elizabeth Kolbert's ''Field Notes From a Catastrophe: Man, Nature and Climate Change.'' Before the discussion, there will be viewings of two five-minute documentary films created by UAB students. One is about a church working to save an endangered fish found on its property; the other is about local biofuel programs and the implications of turning food into fuel. LiNeBrEaKHannah WolfsonLiNeBrEaKCRIME BRIEFSLiNeBrEaK  These crimes were reported to Birmingham police:LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Kristen Farrenkopf, 23, of Birmingham, told police a man with a gun robbed her of her purse and its contents, and threatened to shoot a man she was with Sunday at 1: 45 a.m. in the 1200 block of 29th Street South.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Terrence Gosha, 21, of Birmingham, told police a man hit him in the face with a beer bottle at a nightclub in the 800 block of Second Avenue North on Sunday at 3: 30 a.m. A friend drove Gosha to UAB Hospital where he received about 50 stitches on the left side of his face and his ear.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Ramona Colvin, 45, of Birmingham, told police her brother was driving her to work Sunday at 5: 52 a.m. when he went inside a gas station in the 1800 block of Avenue V. A man jumped in the car and drove off with Colvin in the passenger seat. Colvin punched the man and gouged his eyes before he stopped the car on Pike Road and ran away. Police arrested the suspect soon after.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Thomas Cruz, 31, city of residence unknown, Marcos Sanchez and Ignacio Mendez, both of Birmingham and age not given for either, told police they were in the parking lot of an apartment in the 500 block of Valley Avenue on Sunday at 7 p.m. when two men with guns robbed them.

Birmingham News (Alabama) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	YOUR OPINIONS  		EDITORIAL; Pg. 8A Vol. 121 No. 279  	1021 words  	State must plan now for collapse of the world economic systemLiNeBrEaK  Alabama Gov. Bob Riley must call the Legislature into emergency session now to create plans and pass laws to enable Alabama to survive the imminent collapse of the world economic system.LiNeBrEaKA new depression may happen if the auto companies collapse, as this will cause a cascading failure of corporations, banks and small businesses nationwide. This will spark great unemployment, house mortgage foreclosures and the specter of millions of people facing hunger, without housing and no jobs. Violence and vigilantism will explode as millions flee cities and end up destitute in Alabama and surrounding states that have agriculture-based communities. LiNeBrEaKThe governor or a new Depression Action Committee must be given power to:LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Take over banks and stop home foreclosures.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Take over power companies and operate them under state control.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Take over and control food resources and supply networks.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Take over all hospitals and medical care facilities.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Set up homeless camps with all facilities for long-term family care.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Close state borders to end millions flooding into the state.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Issue state ration stamps and print alternative money scrip.LiNeBrEaK--&gt; Use all National Guard and local police for long-term state martial law.LiNeBrEaKAlabama can face reality and plan for the coming catastrophe or be crushed by it.LiNeBrEaKJohnny Edward MofieldLiNeBrEaKDothanLiNeBrEaKThe biggest con jobLiNeBrEaKThere is nothing wrong with trying to improve our environment, but we are being bombarded by the biggest con job ever attempted against man. Al Gore and a group of ecology nuts are claiming the production of carbon dioxide gas is causing global warming.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is caused by fluctuations in the heat from the sun. The recent occurrence of global warming peaked in 1998, and the 10 years since then have been cooler. This cooling period will probably last for another 10 to 15 years.LiNeBrEaKThe ecology nuts plan to push us into spending trillions of dollars, which will make all of them even richer than Gore has become in the past few years. During this cooling period, they plan to take credit for the change in climate. The release of carbon dioxide gas in the meantime will help plant growth, and more oxygen will be released.LiNeBrEaKIf the ecology nuts pull this off, the world is even dumber than anybody thought.LiNeBrEaKThad GomillionLiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKTax nondiet soft drinksLiNeBrEaKAlabama is faced with two major problems: obesity and finances. The next Legislature can kill two birds with one law: upping the tax on nondiet soft drinks. A penny or two tax per bottle or restaurant drink could improve the people's health as well as the state's.LiNeBrEaKMany harmful things have been taxed, among them cigarettes and liquor. We need to add certain drinks to that list. Since people apparently do not want a lottery (or so says the governor), some other source of income is necessary, and the best is a tax on unhealthy products.LiNeBrEaKRoy LechtreckLiNeBrEaKAlabasterLiNeBrEaKThanks to brave teachers, principalsLiNeBrEaKI would just like to say thanks to all of the teachers and principals who have been brave enough to teach our children how to think for themselves.LiNeBrEaKFor too long now, we have been held under the thumb of No Child Left Behind, teaching children how to do well on standardized tests. There are, though, some teachers and principals who have felt the need to teach our children to be thoughtful and creative problem-solvers, a skill that has been forgotten in the past eight years.LiNeBrEaKTesting is important, but not at the expense of real learning. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!LiNeBrEaKHopefully, others will realize what they have done to our education system in recent years, and we can get back to teaching science, history, art, music and problem-solving skills. These are the things that really matter in life.LiNeBrEaKTodd AlexanderLiNeBrEaKCaleraLiNeBrEaKPoliticians should feel guiltyLiNeBrEaKThe News' Kathy Kemp calls what we are in a Scrooge-rude recession. What is it with this obsession with altruism and achievement guilt?LiNeBrEaKThis country was built on the idea of achievement and prosperity by one's own hand. Yes, there are problems at the moment. But feeling guilty for achievement is an insult to the Founding Fathers and what they stood for.LiNeBrEaKThe ones who should feel guilty are the politicians spending our tax dollars like drunken sailors for bailouts of companies and unions not willing to make any concessions simply to keep a political agenda or what they think is a company too big to fail.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the attitude of writers such as Kemp, this country is suffering from an orgy of self-sacrifice. It will be to all of our worse interest.LiNeBrEaKRussell DunlapLiNeBrEaKBirminghamLiNeBrEaKNeed stable funding for transitLiNeBrEaKGina Tombrello's excellent My Turn essay calling for bus riders to be able to participate more easily in Alabama life was right on target. The lack of respect the invisible riders have to face daily that she so aptly describes can be ended by our state lawmakers with the creation of a permanent, stable funding source for transit.LiNeBrEaKBus riders have been forced to navigate their lives on a worsening system that's unable to take them where they need to go when they need to be there. This is just for necessities; forget any thoughts about entertainment. But if our state lawmakers will finally do the right thing with the creation of stable funding sources for public transit, it will merge the bus riders to equality with the auto drivers to enjoy full benefits of citizenship in Alabama.LiNeBrEaKButch FerrellLiNeBrEaKFairfieldLiNeBrEaKIraqi reporter was correctLiNeBrEaKThe incident of the Iraqi reporter who flung his shoes at President George W. Bush would actually be comical if it weren't so sad and true.LiNeBrEaKThree thousand innocent Americans were killed in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Their deaths were paid back by thousands of innocent Iraqis who had nothing to do with America's tragic deaths.LiNeBrEaKIt's sad, but the reporter was correct. Somebody should apologize to the widows and orphans for America's head honcho making an ''oops'' (mistake) by bombing, killing and occupying the wrong country for something it did not do.LiNeBrEaKBut the reporter's freedom of speech will be dealt with, harshly, I'm sure.LiNeBrEaKMarilyn SchneppLiNeBrEaKBirmingham	LEGISLATORS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (89%); BANK FAILURES (78%); HOSPITALS (78%); TAXES and TAXATION (77%); FORECLOSURE (76%); MORTGAGE BANKING and FINANCE (76%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (74%); FAMINE (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (72%); SMALL BUSINESS (72%); CLIMATE CHANGE (71%); HOMELESSNESS (70%); POLICE FORCES (69%); GLOBAL WARMING (68%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (68%); RESTAURANTS (67%); SOFT DRINKS (63%); GOVERNORS (59%); OBESITY (67%)  		BOB RILEY (91%); AL GORE (53%)  	BIRMINGHAM, AL, USA (58%) ALABAMA, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Birmingham News All Rights Reserved  															
Boston Herald  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Boston Herald Lauren Beckham Falcone column: What's the poinsettia of Christmas anyway?  	Lauren Beckham Falcone, Boston Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	597 words  	Dec. 17--Not to pile it on, but since this Christmas is pretty much a bust, what with all the layoffs, foreclosures, Dow nosedives and general financial agita, let's just wallow in the misery for a sec.LiNeBrEaKI know there's always a moment at Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or Festivus where you gaze at family or friends or your six cats and are grateful for all that you have. Your Grinch-y heart swells as you feel it was truly worth all those early morning runs to Kohl's, hip-checking shoppers for the last Wii and the midnight mixing of flour and butter into the perfect pie crust. LiNeBrEaKBut it's the getting there that makes you want to submerge yourself in a vat of eggnog and not come up until Jan. 2.LiNeBrEaKMaybe it's because you've been seeing garland and trees in the stores since summer, or that, despite a recession, all the remote-controlled WALLEs are sold out.LiNeBrEaKHoliday cheer is also in short supply.LiNeBrEaKFamily get-together chatter has to be censored. Don't ask how so-and-so is; his 401(k) tanked the day after he retired. Don't mention your cousin's house; she hasn't made a payment since November.LiNeBrEaKThe office holiday party is the Ghost of Christmas Past. Photocopying your booty after a few too many used to be a rite of passage. Now it's the stuff of '80s cubicle lore.LiNeBrEaKAnd it's not just the economy. The eco-movement has set its sites on Santa. Wrapping presents, which is supposed to fun in that let's-play-some-Carpenters-and-eat-candy-canes sort of way is now a study in guilt. I used to look lovingly at presents under the tree -- what's more quintessentially Christmas? Now all I see are overflowing landfills and tree stumps.LiNeBrEaKThe airlines are in on the agony, too. Not only does it cost $500 to fly a dog across the country in cargo, you pretty much can't bring anything onboard, including wrapped presents. And if you need to check an extra bag for all of Santa's loot, the airport Scrooges will charge you for it.LiNeBrEaKWhich forces you to that other eighth-ring of hell, the U.S. post office. You stand, sweating, in a line that snakes out the door while an unsmiling postal worker stares down some person who cannot decide between the Virgin Mary stamps or the Santa ones.LiNeBrEaKOf course, sending paper cards is contributing to global warming, so folks have taken to the Internet to send season's greetings. Score one for Al Gore. But when those e-cards get bossy? "Please print out in color and fold in fourths."LiNeBrEaKDelete.LiNeBrEaKAnd those "greetings" can irritate instead of celebrate. What is so awful about "Happy Holidays"? Isn't being inclusive in the spirit of the season? But if anything except "Merry Christmas" passes your lips, the holiday purists call for a beat-down.LiNeBrEaKEven Santa's carrying more baggage than a sack filled with toys. What in the name of the North Pole were we thinking? Not only is he a red-suit-wearing, big, fat lie (that eventually we'll have to 'fess up to) he's taking credit for all the toys you bought for your kids.LiNeBrEaKYet, despite society's unrelenting attempt to kill goodwill and glad tidings, it fails. In the end, we eat, drink, are merry and admit "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" is kind of catchy. And so is the spirit of the season.LiNeBrEaKlbfalcone@bostonherald.com	CHRISTMAS (90%); HOLIDAYS and OBSERVANCES (89%); AIRLINES (85%); KWANZAA (73%); RECESSION (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (72%); HANUKKAH (72%); 401K PLANS (71%); PENSION and RETIREMENT PLANS (71%); CATS (71%); CENSORSHIP (66%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); LANDFILLS (50%)  	Airlines/Travel  	AL GORE (50%)  	UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 18, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081217-YB-Boston-Herald-Lauren-Beckham-Falcone-column-1217  	Newspaper  	YB  	2008    	NYSE:KSS

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Urban Obama picks rural advocates  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	669 words  	WASHINGTON _ Every stream tells a story on the half-day drive from Denver to the Salazar family ranch, every culvert a tale of water and politics. Ken Salazar knows them all, a font of knowledge tapped by President-elect Barack Obama Wednesday when he introduced the Democratic senator from Colorado, whose ancestors farmed and ranched the American southwest for more than 400 years, as his choice to lead the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists call Salazar too centrist and too friendly to drilling and mining interests to run the department: "His overall record is decidedly mixed, and is especially weak in the arenas most important to the next Secretary of the Interior _ protecting scientific integrity, combating global warming, reforming energy development and protecting endangered species," said the Center for Biological Diversity in Arizona. A letter opposing his nomination was signed by about 50 wildlife biologists and members of environmental groups. LiNeBrEaKBut in Salazar and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack _ a longtime chief executive of a major farm state, chosen Wednesday for agriculture secretary _ Obama is adding two rural-tuned voices to the Cabinet of the most urban president in at least 100 years. Salazar brings a familiarity with, and perhaps a preference for, farm and ranching interests to the contentious politics of Western water scarcity.LiNeBrEaKMost conservationists and rural interest groups that weighed in Wednesday praised the nominations, with many saying that by choosing Salazar and Vilsack, Obama has taken a step toward fulfilling his campaign promise of revitalizing rural economies.LiNeBrEaK"We're very encouraged" by the choices, said Mark Maslyn, executive director of the American Farm Bureau, which recently honored Salazar for his work on agricultural issues. "They're men of substance, and they have a record" of supporting the renewable energy efforts Maslyn called "critical" for rural economies and the nation.LiNeBrEaKSalazar barnstormed rural Colorado on Obama's behalf in the months before the November election, promising men in work boots and women in cowboy hats that the Illinois senator understood their plight better than a fellow Westerner, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.. He drew nods when he criticized McCain for raising the prospect of renegotiating the Colorado River Compact, which apportions water among seven Western states.LiNeBrEaKIn a recent interview on the state's Eastern Plains, Salazar sipped from a plastic bottle with a "protect Colorado water" label. He acknowledged the challenge he had to overcome pitching a South Side Chicago candidate in agricultural areas, but he said voters responded when he stressed Obama's support for the most recent farm bill and for energy alternatives such as wind, solar and biofuels, which are booming in rural Colorado.LiNeBrEaK"When I explain that to people in rural Colorado," Salazar said, "people come our way."LiNeBrEaKSalazar has drawn praise as a consensus-builder on water issues. Obama praised Salazar's experience in a press conference on Wednesday and, in a shot at the Bush Administration, said it would help him lead an Interior Department that "cleans up its act." Between, Salazar, Vilsack and other energy-related appointees announced last week, Obama said, "I am confident that we have the team that we need to make (the) rural agenda America's agenda, to create millions of new green jobs, to free our nation from its dependence on oil and to help preserve this planet for our children."LiNeBrEaK(Bettina Boxall of the Los Angeles Times contributed to this report from Los Angeles.)

(" 'Cow tax' rumor just hot air, EPA insists," Dispatch article, Dec. 7). LiNeBrEaKOne farm group estimates the taxes would be $175 annually for dairy cows, $87. 50 for beef cattle and $20 for hogs. I wonder how long you have to stand behind these animals to determine the rate of gas so you know how high to set the rate at which each will be taxed. Will your dog, cat or hamster be next? LiNeBrEaKAlso, all the big cities will have to be taxed because I'm sure several hundred-thousand people in one place will have a lot of belching and flatulence, with Washington, D.C., paying double because there is a lot of hot air there.LiNeBrEaKMaybe the government should make everyone buy a pin or armband to show that they had paid their tax and are allowed to expel all the gas they want.

The Creston News Advertiser (Iowa)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	OPINION: Pay now, or pay later  	Stephani Finley, Creston News Advertiser, Iowa  	COMMENTARY  	680 words  	Dec. 17--We survived the floods of 1993 and 2008. Those were what is known as a 100-year flood or even a 500-year flood -- even though they were only 15 years apart.LiNeBrEaKThe floods of last spring and summer are a thing of the past -- or are they? LiNeBrEaKAccording to an Associated Press story this week, Eugene Takle, a professor of atmospheric science and agricultural meteorology at Iowa State University, said if he had to hazard a guess, the possibility of serious flooding is increasing.LiNeBrEaKWell-known prognosticator Elwynn Taylor, also with Iowa State University, said he agrees and blames global warming for the recent phenomenon.LiNeBrEaKTaylor said since 1950, Iowa's annual precipitation has increased by 10 percent, which, in turn, has doubled the amount of water carried by rivers in the state.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, Witold Krajewski, a water resources engineer at IIHR Hydroscience and Engineering at the University of Iowa, said the odds of another flood like the one in June are about 1 in 250 in a given year.LiNeBrEaKThat doesn't sound as bad. Those aren't very good chances.LiNeBrEaKBut, at the same time, as individuals and as a community, we must be ready just in case that one chance happens again in the coming year.LiNeBrEaKMost of the problems we faced in Creston and the other small, rural communities were caused by infrastructure failure.LiNeBrEaKIn Creston, those with soaked homes happened because of a failed storm sewer system or even, in some cases, the sewage system. Yuck!LiNeBrEaKThere's not a lot anyone can do when Mother Nature pelts our rooftops with hail, but when it comes to water backing up in sewer systems, that's a solvable problem -- it only takes money.LiNeBrEaKEngineers working with the city of Creston have estimated it would take approximately $50 million to repair the cities ailing sewer problems. That's a lot of money; more than the city has. It's also more than the taxpayers of Creston can afford to pay.LiNeBrEaKBut, where is the point of no return?LiNeBrEaKSome Iowa cities are requesting river gauges that monitor water levels. Information is then transmitted to a satellite. Agencies, such as the National Weather Service and Army Corps of Engineers, use the data for forecasts and flood preparation.LiNeBrEaKMost Iowa gauges are operated by the U.S. Geological Survey, which usually partners with a state agency or local city government. It used to pay for half of operating costs, but that has slipped to 40 percent and officials say it's hard to stretch the federal money available.LiNeBrEaKStartup cost for each electronic gauge is $15,000 to $20,000. Annual operating costs are $10,000 to $15,000.LiNeBrEaKWhen you think of all the damage done by this year's floods, if those gauges would help those communities close to a river how many times can this happen before those gauges will pay for themselves many times over?LiNeBrEaKHomeowners in Union County spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, dare I say a million, on flood damages this year.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, we could be flooded many years in a row before it would cost the $50 million it would take to bring the sewer system up to where it needs to be. So until then, we will depend on homeowners insurance, FEMA and our own resources to pay for any damages incurred as a result of future flooding.LiNeBrEaKThe city of Creston has a long-range plan to make the necessary repairs, but by the time the repairs are even halfway through it will be time to start over with the initial repairs and by then the costs will be much higher.LiNeBrEaKThis is not good news.LiNeBrEaKU.S. President-elect Barack Obama wants to stimulate the economy by creating jobs through infrastructure repair.LiNeBrEaKLet's get on that bandwagon!

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	YOUR LETTERS  		OPINIONS; Pg. A15  	637 words  	DeWine shouldn't offend party baseLiNeBrEaKRe "Kevin DeWine horrifies hard right; vice versa," Dec. 1: This editorial doesn't mention that conservatives usually travel in groups of 10 to 20 and wield torches and pitchforks.LiNeBrEaKRep. Kevin DeWine has, in fact, upset a large base of social conservatives. While the quotes mentioned are upsetting to some, including myself, the follow-up attacks by the current Ohio Republican Party deputy chairman on some social conservative leaders in the state were ridiculous. LiNeBrEaKThese social conservatives often pull a lot of the weight during party grass-roots efforts. If DeWine wants to lead the state party in a new direction, it doesn't help to insult his base right out of the gate.LiNeBrEaKMany social conservatives are registered Republicans, just as many pro-abortion, pro-union, anti-war activists are Democrats. Why are the activists on the right always viewed as the "offensive" ones?LiNeBrEaKIf President-elect Barack Obama were to upset his base by saying "we need to get away from the distraction of a woman's right to choose and the distraction of equal rights for homosexuals," would the Dayton Daily News be intellectually honest enough to come out and challenge the hate mail he would receive?LiNeBrEaKFor every liberal who is offended by a conservative, there is a conservative offended and fighting against the stances of liberals. We just don't get the press.LiNeBrEaKEmery P. Phipps Jr.LiNeBrEaKHuber HeightsLiNeBrEaKDyer's climate rant doesn't make senseLiNeBrEaKRe "4 harsh truths are clear about climate change," Dec. 4: Gwynne Dyer's commentary has merit because his extremely liberal, if not outright socialist viewpoint, normally does not generate any interest.LiNeBrEaKIn this case, the rant of disinformation stimulated a quick scan. Review of this 65-year-old man's background and education would tend to make one respectful of his education and accomplishments; however, in his case, his consistent anti-American, unsubstantiated garbage eliminates any chance for respect.LiNeBrEaKDyer states, "The real requirement, if we are to avoid runaway global warming, is probably 80 percent cuts by 2030, and almost no burning whatever of fossil fuels by 2050."LiNeBrEaKDoes this "we" include China, India and/or any so-called developing nations? And does the fact that the temperature statistics for the last 10 years show a cooling make any difference?LiNeBrEaKDyer states, "We might put a temporary chemical sunscreen in the stratosphere by seeding it with sulphur particles, for example, or we could artificially thicken low-lying maritime clouds to reflect more sunlight."LiNeBrEaKSuch statements are shocking. The so-called "green house effect" predominantly caused by water vapor and not CO2 was supposedly the cause of global warming, and now, by thickening these clouds, we would reduce global warming by reflecting more sunlight?LiNeBrEaKThe two positions are in opposition and more than a little stupid.LiNeBrEaKAlbert M. BlissLiNeBrEaKGreenvilleLiNeBrEaKTear down eyesore across from 'model'LiNeBrEaKRe "Ponitz Career Center can be a model," Dec. 7: John Patterson would be delighted that Dayton Public Schools and Sinclair Community College have come full circle to re-create a job training center. The building currently under construction at Edwin C. Moses Boulevard and Washington Street will be a positive landmark for the school system, as well as a fitting tribute to David Ponitz.LiNeBrEaKThe negative landmark across the street from the new school must go away. The former paper company at Edwin C. Moses and Gerstner Way is a disgrace to our city. The vacant building has been continually vandalized and has deteriorated to the point of no return.LiNeBrEaKThe city must find a way to remove this eyesore before the 800 students begin their classes. John Patterson would want it removed now.LiNeBrEaKI am sure that no one would build a state-of-the-art home across from a dump.

The Denver Post 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Knotty issues at Interior put Salazar on tightrope  	Mark Jaffe The Denver Post  	A SECTION; Pg. A-06  	838 words  	As head of the Department of the Interior, Ken Salazar will face a delicate balancing act in managing public lands for conservation, recreation and development, according to industry executives and environmental activists.LiNeBrEaK"It is a balance that kind of got out of whack in the last few years," said Jane Danowitz, public land director for the Pew Environment Group.LiNeBrEaKSalazar will also face issues his predecessors have not, including starting up offshore oil drilling, helping institute the Obama administration's renewable-energy policy and adding climate change to public-lands planning. LiNeBrEaK"This is a very full and complex plate," said Bill Meadows, president of the Wilderness Society, an environmental group based in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaK"Ken Salazar is a good choice for the job," Meadows said. "He has a conservation ethic, and while we haven't always agreed with him, he is someone who will listen with an open mind."LiNeBrEaKSalazar is seen as a centrist who will listen to all sides.LiNeBrEaK"We've worked with Sen. Salazar, and he understands the importance of natural gas development to American energy independence," said Marc Smith, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States.LiNeBrEaK"There are interest groups that may be loud and opinionated," Smith said. "It will be Ken Salazar's job to keep it all balanced."LiNeBrEaKAs a fifth-generation Coloradan with credentials as a state attorney general and director of the state Department of Natural Resources, Salazar is widely seen as having a command of Western and public-lands issues.LiNeBrEaKAmong the initiatives he draws praise for are starting Great Outdoors Colorado, a lottery-money trust fund for state open-space programs; helping create Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve; and his effort to pass a "good Samaritan" bill to help clean up abandoned mining sites.LiNeBrEaK"The good Samaritan legislation, which would have encouraged private cleanups, is a good example of Salazar," said Allan Front, senior vice president at the Trust for Public Lands.LiNeBrEaK"It wasn't flashy," Front said. "It was a workmanlike solution that tried to accommodate industry and conservation."LiNeBrEaKSalazar also has been lauded for his opposition to the Bush administration's efforts to push through oil-shale development rules and drilling on the Roan Plateau.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Salazar won more time for the state to comment on the Roan leasing plan by holding up James Caswell's nomination as director of the Bureau of Land Management until Interior Secretary Kirk Kempthorne relented.LiNeBrEaKOne area where Salazar is drawing fire is his positions on the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKIn 1999, as state attorney general, Salazar opposed the listing of the black-tailed prairie dog under the act, saying there was insufficient data. The Fish and Wildlife Service is evaluating whether the species should be protected.LiNeBrEaKCritics such as WildEarthGuardians and the Center for Biological Diversity contend that Salazar tilts in favor of agribusiness over threatened species.LiNeBrEaKSalazar also is chided by these groups for endorsing the Bush administration's appointment of Gale Norton, a Coloradan, as interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKStill, a large number of environmental groups have praised his selection.LiNeBrEaK"Ken Salazar knows the West. He knows the land. He knows the communities," said Sharon Bucchino, public-lands director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.LiNeBrEaKMark Jaffe: 303-954-1912 or mjaffe@denverpost.com ------------------ Key issues for the next interior secretaryLiNeBrEaKEnvironmental advocates and industry executives say the issues include:LiNeBrEaKDeveloping renewable energy resources on public land.LiNeBrEaKBalancing oil and gas development with conservation.LiNeBrEaKAmending and rewriting BLM plans issued in the past six months that fail to adequately protect land or do not provide for wilderness designations or potential climate-change impacts.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping a plan for oil and gas drilling off the Eastern Seaboard that protects marine environments.LiNeBrEaKRevising the endangered-species listing process to once again make it science-based. The Bush administration was criticized in two audits for political interference.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping a more comprehensive management policy for mining on public lands. ------------------- About the Department of the InteriorLiNeBrEaKCreated by Congress in 1849, the Department of the Interior is the country's primary conservation agency. With more than 70,000 employees and 280,000 volunteers, the department's mission is to provide stewardship of the nation's natural and cultural heritage. The department manages 500 million acres of land, about one-fifth of the land in the United States.LiNeBrEaKIts land-management divisions include the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. The department also manages various resources through its Minerals Management Service, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Geological Survey.LiNeBrEaKThe Bureau of Indian Affairs is part of the Interior Department. The BIA provides services for about 1. 7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.LiNeBrEaKSource: U.S. Department of the Interior	ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (78%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (78%); LEGISLATION (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); NATIONAL PARKS (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (77%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); OIL EXTRACTION (76%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (76%); ENERGY REGULATION (76%); ETHICS (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (75%); WILDERNESS (73%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (73%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (70%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (64%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (64%); TRUST ARRANGEMENTS (63%); RODENTS (60%); US PRESIDENTS (89%)  		KEN SALAZAR (99%); BARACK OBAMA (57%)  	COLORADO, USA (92%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  				THE WILDERNESS SOCIETY (57%)  											
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   ALL S EDITION	Tragedy launched Vilsack's career;  Shooting thrust him into mayor's job 		NATIONAL; Pg. A6  	453 words  	DES MOINES, Iowa -- Tom Vilsack, the man President-elect Barack Obama was to announce today as his nominee for agriculture secretary, has been a long-shot -- and occasionally reluctant -- candidate for most of his political life in a career that began as a small-town mayor forced into the job because of a sensational shooting spree. LiNeBrEaKBorn in Pittsburgh, he was orphaned at birth and was adopted by Bud and Dolly Vilsack. During a brief run for the Democratic nomination he talked often of his adoptive mother's struggles with alcoholism, telling stories of lying in bed and listening to the liquor bottles crashing to the floor. Vilsack, 58, said the experience created a deep longing for stability.LiNeBrEaKHe met Christie Bell at Hamilton College in New York. After he graduated from law school, they settled in Mount Pleasant, a town of 8,700 in Southeast Iowa, and Vilsack joined his father-in-law's law practice and later coached Little League.LiNeBrEaKIn 1987 a disgruntled citizen burst into a Mount Pleasant City Council meeting and shot Mayor Edd King to death. With the community traumatized, Vilsack was appointed mayor of the largely Republican city.LiNeBrEaKIn 1992, he won a close election to the state Senate, where he was known for pushing legislation requiring companies getting state assistance to improve pay and benefits. When GOP Gov. Terry Branstad decided to not to seek re-election after 16 years, Vilsack surprised many by winning a three-way Democratic primary. Even more surprising was his victory over a better-known Republican contender, former Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot.LiNeBrEaKVilsack was generally viewed as a policy wonk with little sense of humor, but he occasionally sought to dent that image by dressing in outlandish cartoon-character outfits to entertain children during gatherings at the governor's mansion.LiNeBrEaKEven before leaving office in 2007, Vilsack began flirting with the Democratic presidential nomination, hoping to get a boost from Iowa's leadoff precinct caucuses. He launched his campaign for the presidency in November 2006 in Mount Pleasant but had difficulty raising money and ended his bid in February 2007.LiNeBrEaKWhile running for president, he called for cutting subsidies for agricultural commodity crops and channel the money toward improving environmental practices. He has argued that agricultural policy should focus on production of renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKIn an essay published in October, he urged greater investment in cellulosic ethanol, bio-fuel production plants and wind farms, and advocated "carbon credits" for farmers whose production reduces greenhouse gases associated with global warming.LiNeBrEaKVilsack also endorsed a goal of producing 25 percent of the nation's energy from renewable sources by 2025.

Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Ontario, CA) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	City joins effort for greener California  	By Neil Nisperos, Staff Writer  	NEWS  	434 words  	The city of Chino has officially joined in a state-wide goal to address the problem of global warming.LiNeBrEaKCouncil on Tuesday approved a resolution that outlines the city's effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable development policies and programs - in line with legislation committing California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020. LiNeBrEaK"We join over 500 leaders in the region from other cities, water and utility agencies, school districts and the like, with the goal of creating a healthy economic and environmental future for our community," said Tina Sray, director of Chino Community Services.LiNeBrEaKThe move is part of a regional effort called the Green Valley Initiative (GVI), which the counties of San Bernardino and Riverside have developed to attract "green-tech" jobs, sustainable energy education and building and purchasing practices that encourage recycling and the use of sustainable energy like solar power.LiNeBrEaKAmong the measures the city has adopted include the promotion of conservation for water and energy resources, the use of artificial turf in public areas, retrofitting city vehicles from gasoline powered to alternative fuel-powered vehicles.LiNeBrEaKCommunity Services Director Tina Sray said the city recently received a grant of $350,000 to implement a multi-family neighborhood recycling program. Another program offers technical assistance and free product marketing for businesses to use recycled materials to manufacture products, she said.LiNeBrEaKOther initiatives include the city-wide adoption of using recycled paper for making copies, and pursuing green building policies. The city is seeking "Silver Leaf," or environmentally friendly, standards for the city's new fire stations and police station.LiNeBrEaKChino Valley Unified School District students also helped contribute green-related artwork to a community calendar with the city's Green Valley theme, "Educate, Conserve, Recycle, Go Green!" The Calendar was handed out at Council on Tuesday and contributing students were honored by the city.LiNeBrEaKChino mayor Dennis Yates, who is on the governing board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, helped pass the resolution.LiNeBrEaK"The city of Chino is doing what we can do, but what needs to happen is people need to follow suit," he said. "We need to reduce our carbon footprint and reduce greenhouse gases affecting our planet."LiNeBrEaKFor information about the city's green initiative, call (909) 464-0758, or visit www.cityofchino.org and click on the Environmental Services icon.

Jordan Times (Amman)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Muhaisin highlights government measures to protect agriculture sector  	Hani Hazaimeh, Jordan Times, Amman  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	428 words  	Dec. 17--AMMAN -- The Lower House has concluded discussions on the draft agricultural risk fund law and is expected to endorse the legislation in the next two weeks in a bid to aid the Kingdom's farmers, Agriculture Minister Muzahim Muhaisin said on Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKAccording to the minister, the law aims to support the livestock sector by facilitating farmers' access to low-interest loans, among other steps the government is taking to protect the sector.LiNeBrEaK"Agriculture is key to food production and development in low-income countries. Successful agricultural policies contribute to securing jobs and enhancing living conditions," Muhaisin said, underlining His Majesty King Abdullah's directive that 2009 be designated the year of agricultural development.LiNeBrEaKThe minister made the comments at the opening of a regional conference on bio-fuel, the effects of global warming on food security and agricultural marketing.LiNeBrEaKOrganised by the Agricultural Food Marketing Association for the Near East and North Africa (AFMANENA), the three-day event opened yesterday with the participation of energy experts and agriculture stakeholders from 14 Arab countries.LiNeBrEaK"Jordan is among countries that are affected by unprecedented hikes in fuel and commodity prices in addition to global warming and the risks of desertification," Muhaisin told attendees.LiNeBrEaKTo avoid the negative repercussions of these challenges, the government is taking several precautionary steps to minimise their impact on the local economy, the minister pointed out, such as exempting agricultural inputs and imports from taxes and customs duties to curb rising food prices.LiNeBrEaKAFMANENA Secretary General Mohammad Awamleh said the Greater Amman Municipality has allocated a plot of land for an agricultural marketing training centre with cooperation from AFMANENA and the Arab Authority for Agricultural Investment And Development, which is contributing $100,000 for the centre's construction.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Amman Deputy Mayor Haitham Jweinat briefed the conference on the municipality's plans to establish a power plant that is expected to produce around 7 megawatts through a gas recovery system at the Ghabawi landfill.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Agriculture pick Vilsack faces huge bureaucracy, learning curve  	By Michael Doyle, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	914 words  	WASHINGTON _ Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack will inherit a lumbering bureaucracy and have lots to learn about fruits and vegetables as the nation's next agriculture secretary.LiNeBrEaKA conventional choice who still caught Capitol Hill by surprise, Vilsack is well-rooted in Midwestern commodities but not in the bounty from states such as California and Florida. Specialty crop growers consequently will keep lobbying to buttress the new farm chief with their allies.LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, President-elect Barack Obama played up Vilsack's agricultural expertise as he announced him as his choice to run the Agriculture Department. LiNeBrEaK"Obviously, if you don't know agriculture, you're not going to become governor of Iowa," Obama said at a news conference, adding that Vilsack has "also been forward-looking" in his policies.LiNeBrEaKBecause Congress already has set crop subsidies and other agricultural policies for the next five years, with a farm bill enacted in May over President George W. Bush's veto, Vilsack could be a low-visibility Cabinet secretary. Even so, he'll confront a difficult-to-manage agency that spends $89 billion a year.LiNeBrEaKThe Agriculture Department's systematic problems, identified by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, include:LiNeBrEaK_Subsidy abuse. The Agriculture Department paid crop subsidies totaling $1. 1 billion in the names of 172,800 deceased individuals from 1999 to 2005. Critics decry the continuing payment of subsidies to wealthy farmers.LiNeBrEaK_Food dangers. Food safety-inspection staffing has declined steadily over the past decade despite budget increases, while the quantity of contaminated meat and poultry recalled by industry has increased sharply.LiNeBrEaK_Civil rights woes. Even after paying nearly $1 billion to minority farmers as a result of a class-action lawsuit, the department faces persistent discrimination complaints.LiNeBrEaK"I look forward to the challenge," Vilsack said Wednesday, adding that "farmers and ranchers deserve a secretary of agriculture that respects them."LiNeBrEaKVilsack stressed, in order, the importance of "improving profitability for farmers," the need for "sustainable practices" and fighting "global climate change," and the centrality of good nutrition in feeding programs.LiNeBrEaKWith its 17 agencies and 110,000 employees, the Agriculture Department poses administrative challenges. Frequently, deputy agriculture secretaries are selected to handle day-to-day management while the secretaries take on broader tasks. With the secretary's job spoken for, the lobbying for these crucial administrative positions probably will escalate.LiNeBrEaKKaren Ross, the head of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, was in Washington meeting with farm organizations earlier this week, and numerous California farm groups are championing her to be the next deputy. Three of the past five deputy agriculture secretaries have come from California, reflecting the state's relative farm clout.LiNeBrEaK"If the Obama administration wants to provide balance, they will also need to have a Westerner who understands California agriculture," said Rep. Dennis Cardoza, D-Calif., a member of the House Agriculture Committee.LiNeBrEaKCardoza praised Vilsack as a moderate and "a fine choice," as did major national farm organizations.LiNeBrEaK"Overall, we're pleased, despite his not being from a specialty crop state," said Robert Guenther, the senior vice president of the United Fresh Produce Association. "As governor, he's demonstrated a firm grasp of agricultural issues."LiNeBrEaKVilsack, who turned 58 last week, served two four-year terms as the governor of Iowa. He made a short-lived run for president starting in November 2006 and later endorsed New York Sen. Hillary Clinton for the job. He went to college and law school in New York state and then moved to Iowa to join a law firm.LiNeBrEaKHe's more lawyer and politician than farmer. The law firm of Dorsey and Whitney, where Vilsack is an attorney but not a partner, describes him as having "more than 25 years of trial experience handling complex litigation and class actions with statewide and national implications."LiNeBrEaKStill, his Midwestern background, political strengths and compelling personal history of being adopted at birth made him an early front-runner for the agriculture secretary's job. Seven of the last 10 agriculture secretaries were from the Midwest, one was from the South and two were from California.LiNeBrEaKVilsack's years in Iowa have made him a big fan of ethanol, the government-subsidized fuel that provides an additional market for corn. His adopted home state leads the nation in producing pork, corn, soybeans and eggs. However, fruit and vegetable production in just one modest-sized county in California's Central Valley _ San Joaquin _ was quadruple that of the entire state of Iowa.LiNeBrEaK"Now, the next step is to build a team around him," Guenther said.LiNeBrEaKVilsack had seemed to end the speculation when he declared Nov. 23 that the Obama team hadn't contacted him. On Capitol Hill and in the news media, the conventional wisdom grew that Vilsack had formally ruled himself out; what he said Nov. 23, though, was never that definite.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	NASA reports 2008 is ninth warmest year since 1880  	Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	480 words  	Dec. 17--WASHINGTON -- The year 2008 was the ninth warmest year since instrumental temperature measurements began in 1880, and all of the nine warmest years have occurred in the past 11 years, NASA reported on Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKThe new data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and other government agencies on Tuesday adds to the evidence scientists have been observing about a warming Earth as fossil fuel burning emits heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKNASA also reported that the January to November global temperature was 0. 76 degrees Fahrenheit above the average for the 20th Century.LiNeBrEaKNASA also noted that the past year was cooler than any since 2000. Scientists note that global warming is a steady trend, but within it there are natural variations.LiNeBrEaKThe NASA report noted that "Eurasia, the Arctic and the Antarctic Peninsula were exceptionally warm, while much of the Pacific Ocean was cooler than the long-term average." It said the relatively cooler temperature in the tropical Pacific was due to a La Nina, the cool phase of a natural temperature variation.LiNeBrEaKBritain's Met Office on Tuesday also said that La Nina was part of the reason 2008 was slightly cooler than earlier years this decade. By Britain's accounting, 2008 was the 10th warmest year on record dating back to 1850, and all 10 of the warmest years occurred since 1997.LiNeBrEaK"Human influence, particularly emission of greenhouse gases, has greatly increased the chance of having such warm years," said Peter Stott of the Met Office in a statement Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe Met Office also reported that global temperatures from 2000 to 2008 are nearly 0. 36 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average for 1990 to 1999.LiNeBrEaKThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday summarized these and other trends, including:LiNeBrEaK_ The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was the third costliest, after 2005 and 2004.LiNeBrEaK_ The U.S. had nearly 1,700 tornadoes from January through November, which ranks second behind 2004 for the most tornadoes in a year since records began in 1953.LiNeBrEaK_ Arctic sea ice in 2008 reached its second lowest level at the end of the melting season in September, following a record low in 2007. In 2008, the ice shrank to 1. 74 million square miles, which was 0. 86 million square miles below the average annual minimum from 1979 to 2000.LiNeBrEaKSea ice loss is important because ice reflects most of the sun's radiation, but open ocean water absorbs most of it, adding to the warming trend both in the ocean and on land.LiNeBrEaKTo see more stories from the McClatchy Washington Bureau, go to http://www.mcclatchydc.com/.

The Manila Times (Philippines)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Renewable energy law comes into force  	Euan Paulo C. Anonuevo, The Manila Times, Philippines  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	835 words  	Dec. 17--The President said the new legislation is the "first and most comprehensive renewable energy law in Southeast Asia" that would enable the Philippines to capture a part of the soaring investments in renewable energy development worldwide pegged at $71 billion last year.LiNeBrEaK"With our Renewable Energy Act, we can now move aggressively to develop these resources," she added, referring to solar, biomass, geothermal, hydropower, wind and ocean-energy technologies. LiNeBrEaK"The benefits of renewable-energy use are considerable," Energy Secretary Angelo Reyes said also Tuesday. "It will foster sustainable growth, energy independence and economic security for the country, and unite us with the global effort to stop climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe new law--Republic Act 9513--provides fiscal and non-fiscal incentives for renewable energy investors, including tax credits on domestic capital equipment and services, special realty tax rates on equipment and machinery, tax exemption of carbon credits, duty-free importation mechanisms, and income tax holidays, among others.LiNeBrEaKThe law also provides for the establishment of a Renewable Portfolio Standard system, which would require electricity suppliers to source a certain amount of their energy supply from renewable resources such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and biomass.LiNeBrEaKThe standard would also be complemented by a feed-in tariff system to encourage the speedy entry of renewable energy projects.LiNeBrEaKAt present, the country is heavily reliant coal power plants, which are said to be one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, for bulk of its electricity needs.LiNeBrEaK"This measure will ultimately ensure a market for renewable energy, and provide a system that will allow consumers to choose green sources of energy in the long term," Reyes said.LiNeBrEaKPieces in placeLiNeBrEaKIndustry officials said that with such incentives and perks now present, the development of the country's renewable energy sources, which have long been hampered by huge investment costs and intermittent power generation, would finally have the support that it needs.LiNeBrEaKThe passage of the bill is also seen to help accelerate the Energy department's target for renewable energy sources especially at a time when the country's demand for power is narrowing the gap with supply.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Department of Energy's medium-term Renewable Energy Policy Framework, the government aims to develop more than 4,000 megawatts of additional renewable energy capacity, some 1,200 megawatts of which are planned to come from geothermal sources.LiNeBrEaK"While renewable energy development has been slow in the past years, the passage of the bill is expected to attract more investors to the industry, and help cement plans of investors who had been waiting for the bill's approval," Reyes said.LiNeBrEaKNew eraLiNeBrEaKCatherine Maceda, Renewable Energy Coalition spokesman, said, "The Renewable Energy Law is expected to usher in an era of cleaner energy use in the country that will benefit generations to come."LiNeBrEaKThe coalition, a multisectoral group that had been campaigning for the passage of the bill, projected that the country could save up to $1. 23 billion with the development of some 4,000 megawatts of electricity from renewable energy resources.LiNeBrEaK"This amount can be directed to fund other development needs of the country," Maceda said.LiNeBrEaKWelcome developmentLiNeBrEaKGreenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director Von Hernandez welcomed the development, saying the Philippines is on track toward achieving an energy revolution that is key to addressing climate change.LiNeBrEaK"This signals that the Philippines is on track toward achieving an 'Energy Revolution' which can end our dependence on fossil fuels and move the country into a low carbon emissions economy which is a key solution to the problem of dangerous climate change," he addedLiNeBrEaKIn August, Greenpeace released the report entitled, Energy Revolution: A sustainable Philippine Energy Outlook, the first-ever comprehensive energy strategy drawn up for the Philippine setting which shows how renewable energy can become the country's energy backbone.LiNeBrEaKThe report said renewable energy could provide more than half of the country's energy needs by 2030. It added that the Philippines could save as much as 40 percent, or $9. 6 billion, in electricity cost in 2050 by using renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKThe report recommends phasing out all subsidies for fossil fuels, stopping plans to construct nuclear power plants, putting a moratorium on the construction of new coal-fired power plants, and abandoning the myth of "clean coal" and nuclear power as solutions to climate change.LiNeBrEaK-- With Ira Karen Apanay	RENEWABLE ENERGY (92%); BIOMASS (90%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); LEGISLATION (90%); TAX RELIEF (90%); TAX LAW (90%); TAX INCENTIVES (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); ENERGY REGULATION (89%); ENERGY DEMAND (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (87%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); POWER PLANTS (78%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (78%); TAX EXEMPTIONS (77%); IMPORT TRADE (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); CARBON OFFSETS (73%); ENERGY and UTILITY TRADE (73%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (73%); TARIFFS and DUTIES (72%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (72%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (71%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (67%)  	Construction  		PHILIPPINES (92%); ASIA (92%); SOUTH EAST ASIA (92%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081217-MF-Renewable-energy-law-comes-into-force-1217  	Newspaper  	MF  	2008 News Bites Pty Ltd.   															
The Miami Herald (Florida)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	State party leaders to keep jobs: With no change in leadership expected, Florida's Democratic and Republican activists will meet soon to determine their agendas.  	Beth Reinhard, The Miami Herald  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	670 words  	Dec. 17--The only potential for drama at the upcoming elections of Florida's political party leaders: Republican Chairman Jim Greer belting out one of his trademark Elvis impersonations.LiNeBrEaKDespite some grumbling about their leadership, both of Florida's party bosses appear headed toward easy reelections.LiNeBrEaKFlorida Democratic Chairwoman Karen Thurman is unopposed in Saturday's vote, now that her lone challenger has gotten behind her. Backed by the top Republican officials in the state, Greer faces only a little-known Martin County political activist. LiNeBrEaKThough the party leaders are not household names, they oversee recruiting candidates, allocating campaign donations and setting the political agenda.LiNeBrEaKTheir performance is judged by a tally of wins and losses, even if individual candidates are most responsible for the score.LiNeBrEaKUnder Thurman's watch since 2005, Democrats have racked up more victories than they have in two decades. Most recently, the party delivered Florida to Barack Obama and netted one state House seat and one congressional seat.LiNeBrEaKThurman's only opponent, former Miami-Dade Democratic Chairman Bret Berlin, argued that the party should have gained more ground on Obama's coattails. But Berlin dropped his bid last week when it was clear Thurman had the votes.LiNeBrEaK"I would suggest the biggest thing we ought to be doing is delivering 27 electoral votes to the next president -- and guess what, we did," Thurman said. "I think there will be a lot of opportunities in the future to keep Obama supporters engaged."LiNeBrEaKBROKE RULESLiNeBrEaKThurman also faced criticism for embracing the state's earliest presidential primary in history, which broke national party rules and led the major candidates to boycott the state before the Jan. 29 vote. The national party has formed a commission to reexamine the presidential primary process.LiNeBrEaKGreer, picked by Gov. Charlie Crist after he won election in 2006, boasts of the party fending off strong challenges to the three Republicans members of Congress representing South Florida. After two election cycles in which Hispanic voters favored the top of the Democratic ticket, Greer recently hired a new Hispanic outreach director.LiNeBrEaKVOTE EDGELiNeBrEaKGreer said he also wants to start chipping away at the Democratic Party's 650,000-vote edge in registration.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to start right out of the chute," he said.LiNeBrEaKGreer's only challenger in the party's Jan. 10 election is Eric Miller of Stuart, who worked on California U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's presidential primary campaign. He distributed a brochure on his political philosophies, which diverge from Florida's Republican Party establishment on two issues: global warming and immigration.LiNeBrEaKMiller contends science has not proven that humans have caused climate change, and he described global warming as a "get-rich-quick scheme." He also says the children of illegal immigrants should not be allowed in public schools.LiNeBrEaK"I do not believe that they are entitled to one red cent of any tax dollar, other than those used for deportation," Miller wrote.LiNeBrEaKAsked how that position squares with the party's efforts to recapture the Hispanic vote, he said, "The question becomes: Do we compromise our principles to obtain votes or hold fast to our beliefs and do what is right?"LiNeBrEaKMiller also criticized Greer's spending practices. The Herald/Times Tallahassee bureau reported that Greer charged personal expenses to the party during a fundraiser last summer at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach County.LiNeBrEaKGreer would not comment Tuesday except to point to a memo written by the party's treasurers that said "the allegations are completely inaccurate or entirely false."

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition	Warming may be ages old &lt;|&gt; Early human activity caused greenhouse gas  	LEE BERGQUIST, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	B News; Pg. 6  	407 words  	Global warming didn't start with the industrial revolution, but began 5,000 to 8,000 years ago with large-scale agriculture in Asia and extensive deforestation in Europe, according to new research by University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists. LiNeBrEaK Using powerful supercomputers and advanced climate models, the researchers concluded that methane and carbon dioxide - the building blocks of global warming - began rising with the introduction of rice cultivation and large-scale tree removal.LiNeBrEaK "I think that the take-home message is that this hypothesis shows that climates are extremely sensitive to small variations in greenhouse gases," said Steve Vavrus, a climatologist at UW's Center for Climatic Research.LiNeBrEaK Vavrus and his colleagues John Kutzbach and Gwen&auml;elle  Philippon were to discuss their research today at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.LiNeBrEaK The work of the UW team also shows that the build-up of greenhouse gases over thousands of years has prevented the start of a new glacial age.LiNeBrEaK Ice ages have occurred at regular 100,000-year intervals over the last 1 million years, they said, mirroring predictable changes in the orbit of the Earth, known as Milankovitch cycles.LiNeBrEaK Had the man-made gases not been emitted into the atmosphere, portions of the arctic and some mountainous regions would contain more permanent snow and ice than they do today, Vavrus said.LiNeBrEaK The researchers used data from other scientists who have been measuring oxygen and other gases trapped in ice core samples from Antarctica that are 850,000 years old.LiNeBrEaK The air samples from 5,000 to 8,000 years ago contained unmistakable levels of methane and carbon dioxide gases.LiNeBrEaK Methane levels rose from decomposing vegetation in terraced rice paddies, Vavrus said. The rising levels of carbon dioxide came from deforestation known to have taken place in Europe.LiNeBrEaK Three different climate models were used. The researchers removed the amount of greenhouse gases that humans sent into the atmosphere, based on the ice core samples. The models show more permanent snow and ice cover in Canada, Siberia, Greenland and the Rocky Mountains.LiNeBrEaK  Vavrus said the research supports theories first put forward by William F. Ruddiman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Virginia.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   02 EDITION	Protected habitat    proposed for sea otter  		A; Pg. 02  	248 words  	Protected habitatLiNeBrEaKproposed for sea otterLiNeBrEaKBy apLiNeBrEaKAssociated PressLiNeBrEaKANCHORAGE, Alaska - A federal agency proposed nearly 6,000 square miles of southwest Alaska shoreline be protected habitat for a threatened population of northern sea otters. LiNeBrEaKAbout 90 percent of northern sea otters live in coastal Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands population was declared threatened three years ago under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKAbout 40,000 northern sea otters exist today, less than half of the 1970s estimates. The reasons for the decline aren't known, but increasing predation by killer whales is suspected.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal issued Tuesday would designate nearshore waters in southwest Alaska as critical habitat. Nearshore is defined as within 100 meters, or 328 feet, of the mean tide line.LiNeBrEaKThe agency said nearshore waters provide sea otters with cover and shelter from marine predators, particularly killer whales.LiNeBrEaKThe Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the government eight years ago to protect sea otters. The conservation group maintains that proposals to open Bristol Bay in the Bering Sea to oil development, overfishing and global warming are threatening sea otters.LiNeBrEaKThe agency's designation is a good start, but the protected habitat should extend at least a mile from shore, said Brendan Cummings, the center's oceans program director.LiNeBrEaKA critical habitat designation requires all federal agencies to ensure that any activities in the area would not harm sea otters.

Palo Alto Daily News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	City deadlocks on compost plan  	Will Oremus, Palo Alto Daily News, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	412 words  	Dec. 17--Three votes and nearly four hours of discussion and debate weren't enough for the Palo Alto City Council to reach a decision early Tuesday morning about the fate of the city's compost heap. Faced with a choice between preserving park land and keeping green waste local, the council split into three groups, each offering a different solution. With no compromise in sight as 1 a.m. neared, the only thing all three could agree on was tabling the issue and coming back for another vote in January. LiNeBrEaKPassions ran strong on all sides as parks supporters traded jabs with climate change activists.LiNeBrEaKThe seven-acre compost pile in the Baylands is scheduled to close in the next two years and become part of Byxbee Park, along with the adjacent landfill. But that would mean trucking thousands of tons of yard trimmings to Gilroy at a time when the city is trying to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, keeping the compost heap would require a public vote to allow development on dedicated park land, typically a no-no on the Peninsula. Both the city's parks and recreation commission and its planning and transportation commission unanimously recommended against that idea, though both also said the city should explore other options for keeping its compost local.LiNeBrEaKMayor Larry Klein, Vice Mayor Peter Drekmeier and Council Member Jack Morton argued the city has no other realistic venue for the operation, so the pile should stay put.LiNeBrEaKCouncil members Sid Espinosa, Greg Schmid and Yoriko Kishimoto countered that the city should find ways to reduce its carbon footprint without taking away hard-won open space. Hoping for a third way were council members Pat Burt and Yiaway Yeh, who suggested delaying the closure a year to study alternatives. Council Member John Barton's absence made it harder for any of the proposals to garner a five-member majority. But even if he had been there, none would have had more than four votes. That means at least one official's mind will have to change in order to settle the issue in January.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: AP's public disservice  	The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	COMMENTARY  	304 words  	Dec. 17--The first casualty in the debate over "global warming" continues to be the truth. Just look at an Associated Press dispatch this week filed by Seth Borenstein, identified as an AP "science writer." LiNeBrEaK"Global warming" is "a ticking time bomb that President-elect Obama can't avoid," Mr. Borenstein writes.LiNeBrEaK"The 10 hottest years on record have occurred since (Bill) Clinton's second inauguration," he continues.LiNeBrEaK"Global warming is accelerating," he adds.LiNeBrEaK"Time is close to running out," he warns.LiNeBrEaKWe wonder if Borenstein has caught his breath yet.LiNeBrEaKFour hypotheses that many credible scientists dispute are presented as fact. There's nary a mention in the AP's story that the debate over "global warming" has heated up as more and more indicators suggest planetary cooling.LiNeBrEaKAnd with no real support, the story states as a fact that the cooling trend "actually illustrates how fast the world is warming."LiNeBrEaKBorenstein and The Associated Press are entitled to their opinion. But this is an opinion -- filled with Chicken Little hysteria at that -- presented as straight news. There's clear bias. And the only "balance" is derisive of clearly credible counterpoints.LiNeBrEaKIt's this kind of reportage that has no place in the global warming debate. But, sadly, it has become the rule instead of the exception. What a tragic disservice to the public, to science and, yes, even the planet.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   SOONER EDITION	U.S. MISSING PRESENCE AT SUMMIT;  AS THE HEMISPHERE'S LEADERS GATHER TO DISCUSS WAYS TO DEAL WITH THE WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL CRISIS 	Bradley Brooks, The Associated Press  	WORLD; Pg. A-6  	629 words  	COSTA DO SAUIPE, Brazil -- Forget the global economic crisis and climate change. What Latin American leaders are talking about is who was not at yesterday's summit: the United States or any other outside power.LiNeBrEaKThe largest hemispheric summit to exclude U.S. representation was hailed by Washington's most vocal critics as a sign that Latin America is demanding a new independence from the superpower to the north.LiNeBrEaKCuba's integration into the Rio Group -- after it was expelled from the Washington-based Organization of American States in 1962 -- only added to the buzz about a new era. LiNeBrEaK"The presence of Cuba is a very strong signal that America is no longer the boss in Latin America," Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez told reporters upon his arrival at the summit, which drew 33 heads of state or their representatives.LiNeBrEaKMr. Chavez and other leaders said the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president creates a key opportunity for South American countries to speak with their own voice and to demand respect in a new dialogue with the United States.LiNeBrEaK"The important thing is that we are here together, without the patronage of the empire," Mr. Chavez told Venezuelan state television, referring to the United States. "The way is beginning, a new way -- our way from the South."LiNeBrEaKBolivian President Evo Morales -- also long at odds with the Bush administration -- said he hoped that Mr. Obama could ease the economic and political friction between the United States and Latin American nations.LiNeBrEaK"The entire world is hoping there will be changes," said Mr. Morales, who in September expelled the U.S. ambassador, accusing him of siding with violent opposition protests. "I hope there might be changes, and we Bolivians want to improve diplomatic relations."LiNeBrEaKDespite some biting rhetoric, efforts by Latin American nations to do more to determine their destinies is a good thing, said Michael Shifter, director of the Andean program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. "This is a healthy development and should not be seen as a rejection of the U.S.," Mr. Shifter said. "On the contrary, Latin America wants to deal with the U.S. and other major world powers, but it wants to do so on more equal terms than in the past."LiNeBrEaKCalls to the U.S. embassy in Brasilia and the State Department in Washington were not immediately returned.LiNeBrEaKThe two-day summit, called to focus on regional responses to crises in finance, food and environment, so far has been long on verbiage and short on action. An opening meeting of South America's Mercosur leaders -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- only highlighted the issues that divide countries in the region. They were unable to agree on a reform to eliminate dual tariffs on imported goods.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Ecuador has been engaged in a fight with Brazil over debt payments for a problematic hydroelectric project. Paraguay is angry about recent Brazilian military exercises near the two nations' border, and Venezuela has challenged Brazil's idea for a regional defense council by inviting the Russian Navy to visit.LiNeBrEaKAt the opening of meetings in the northeast Brazilian state of Bahia, officials blamed developed nations for the economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKEcuador's President Rafael Correa -- who in recent days defaulted on $60 million in sovereign debt -- called for a stronger Bank of the South, a regional development agency. If it were more robust, he said, nations like his would have the funds to meet their debt obligations.LiNeBrEaKCuban President Raul Castro held bilateral meetings with Mexico's Felipe Calderon and was expected to do so today with a vice president of Colombia -- two nations with which Cuba has been at odds in recent years.LiNeBrEaK"The past trail has been long and difficult," Mr. Castro said on his first foreign trip as president.

Post and Courier (Charleston, South Carolina)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Power plant in Florence County, S.C., gets environmental permit  	Doug Pardue, The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	768 words  	Dec. 17--Santee Cooper's proposed coal-fired power plant in Florence County will be allowed to release more than 90 pounds of poisonous mercury a year and other air pollutants under an air quality permit granted Tuesday by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control.LiNeBrEaKDespite opponents' arguments that the plant, as proposed, uses outdated technology that will pour poisonous and greenhouse gases into the air, DHEC contends that it had no choice because the plant would meet all currently applicable state regulations and laws. LiNeBrEaKNancy Cave, an official with the Coastal Conservation League, which opposes the plant along with several other environmental organizations, replied "oh, Lord" when told of DHEC's decision. "I assume we will appeal it."LiNeBrEaKCave says the league does not believe that the state's Pollution Control Act ties the environmental agency's hands, forcing it to grant the permit.LiNeBrEaKDHEC emphasized in a formal press release that it had attached conditions to the permit that would require the plant to meet "the most stringent" future limits on mercury emissions, whether the state's or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's. Another condition requires Santee Cooper to leave room in the plant's design for additional mercury controls if required by future regulations. In addition, the permit gives DHEC the right to reopen the permit to incorporate any future state or federal carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas requirements.LiNeBrEaKMercury pollution, largely from coal-fired plants, became a major issue in the state after The Post and Courier published an investigation in October 2007 called "The Mercury Connection." The stories revealed that some people who eat fish from South Carolina's numerous mercury-contaminated rivers and lakes have elevated levels of mercury in their systems. Mercury is highly toxic, even in tiny amounts, and can cause brain damage in children and heart damage in adults.LiNeBrEaKIn reaction to that series and growing public concern about mercury pollution and the proposed power plant, DHEC agreed earlier this year to begin a study of mercury pollution in South Carolina, focusing, in part, on potential harm to people. Santee Cooper and other state utilities have agreed to participate in that study, DHEC said.LiNeBrEaKThe air quality permit does not clear the way for construction of the plant. The permit can be appealed and the plant is still subject to federal approval of an ongoing environmental impact study and statement, which isn't expected to be completed until early next year.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this month, the state Department of Natural Resources urged DHEC not to issue any permits for the plant, especially water quality and construction in navigable water permits, until after completion of the environmental impact statement.LiNeBrEaKDNR expressed "significant concern" about potential water quality and environmental impacts from the plant. In particular, DNR had concerns about proposed solid waste and ash pond facilities that might pollute the Great Pee Dee River and damage the river bluffs that contain rare plants. The power plant is to be built on the Florence side of the river near Pamplico. DNR also complained that Santee Cooper had not adequately addressed many of the concerns it had expressed nearly a year earlier.LiNeBrEaKLaura G. Varn, Santee Cooper's vice president of corporate communications and media relations, said the company now plans to build the ash ponds farther from the river. She said Santee Cooper is conducting studies related to other expressed concerns.LiNeBrEaKSantee Cooper, a state-owned utility, says it needs the $1. 25 billion plant, scheduled to be completed in 2013, to meet energy demands just as the company would be running short of power. The company hopes to have a new nuclear power plant online by 2016 to provide for longer-term needs.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists accuse the company of trading the well-being of residents for cheap power from the coal-fired plant.LiNeBrEaK"DHEC could have moved South Carolina forward to a healthier future, but instead it punted the ball 150 yards backwards," said Blan Holman, attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. "The permit is unlawful, and will be challenged vigorously."

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   All Editions	Second time, a charm;  A president turns to Jersey again for EPA head 		OPINION; Pg. A12  	476 words  	LISA JACKSON is off to Washington, D.C., as newly appointed administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. We hope her tenure goes better than that of former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who made the same trip back in 2000. LiNeBrEaKThe odds do seem in Jackson's favor. Whitman was a moderate Republican named to head an agency the conservative Bush administration viewed as more a business opportunity than protector of the environment. After watching the rollback of environmental laws, and clashing with Bush on global warming and clean air policies, she resigned.LiNeBrEaKJackson will enter office along with a president who has called for cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, creating "green jobs" and making a quarter of the nation's electricity come from renewable resources by 2025. She should have a far easier time at the EPA than Whitman. At least we hope so. When Barack Obama becomes president, he must stick to the environmental campaign promises he made as senator.LiNeBrEaKWe applaud Obama's instinct to look to New Jersey to fill the post ? one of the few actions he shares with Bush. Especially now, with an EPA much weaker than it was eight years ago, it needs a leader who understands the dire importance of regulations and the need for strict enforcement.LiNeBrEaKJackson headed the state's Department of Environmental Protection for 2 1/2 years until Dec. 1, when she became Corzine's chief of staff. She is a chemical engineer by training, and a 16-year employee of the EPA. Most environmental groups applaud Obama's pick. Corzine has not adequately dealt with a number of environmental issues, they say, but Jackson has managed to accomplish a fair amount in a short time even while hampered by a small budget.LiNeBrEaKAnd, as far as the environmentalists are concerned, her heart is in the right place. She backed the dredging of the polluted lower Passaic River, according to Ella Filappone of the Passaic River Coalition. She backed last year's law requiring plants using the most toxic or explosive chemicals to review their use and switch to safer procedures if possible. And Rick Engler, director of the New Jersey Work Environment Council, said Jackson was right there on the DEP's order to allow union representatives and plant workers to accompany DEP inspectors on their rounds to look for potential hazardous chemical accidents.LiNeBrEaKWhen the Sierra Club and the Chemistry Council of New Jersey agree on a nominee, there isn't much more to say.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey can only benefit by having someone at the EPA who is so familiar with our environmental challenges and problems. And the country will certainly benefit by having someone at the helm who has dealt with global warming, toxic releases, hazardous waste and flood hazard rules. Of course, that's not all we want to be known for, but if New Jersey's environmental woes can help the rest of the country, we'll take it.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition	On Climate, Obama Must Hurry  	L. PRESTON BRYANT, JR. and  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A-15  	804 words  	President-elect Barack Obama recently unveiled a massive infrastructure spending package that includes new federal investments in energy efficiency. This will help the United States begin to address climate change, but it is only a small part of a much larger climate-change strategy that needs to be implemented in Obama's first term.LiNeBrEaK With Obama in the White House, the U.S. has a historic opportunity to enact climate-change legislation that will reduce emissions of heat-trapping pollutants, create jobs, and spur renewable energy innovation. LiNeBrEaK Obama has promises to keep. In his election-night victory speech, he pointed to our "planet in peril" as one of the three central challenges of his presidency, together with the financial crisis and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.LiNeBrEaK As a candidate, Obama said unequivocally that he favors a federal, economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions trading system. He set a goal of reducing U.S. emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. He pledged to ensure that 25 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2025. And he committed to invest $15 billion per year over the coming decade in clean energy technologies and fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaK VOTERS responded enthusiastically. In the transformed post-election political landscape, we can finally see climate change progress on the horizon.LiNeBrEaK Last June, major legislation establishing a cap-and-trade system for emissions allowances failed to advance in the Senate by 12 votes. But now, Democratic gains in Congress make passage more likely. In fact, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has pegged a cap-and-trade bill's chance of success at 80 percent in the next two years and 100 percent in the next four years.LiNeBrEaK The climate has also changed dramatically at the White House. President-elect Obama firmly believes that climate change threatens our nation and our planet. In line with the overwhelming scientific consensus, Obama declared in August that "human activities are influencing the global climate and we must react quickly and effectively."LiNeBrEaK What steps should Obama and the new Congress take?LiNeBrEaK First, Obama must continue conveying that tackling climate change is consistent with his first priority: curing our nation's economic ills. A cap-and-trade system, which will put a price on carbon-based energy production, will simultaneously spur development of a new generation of clean-energy technologies. Such legislation could put Americans to work by building a new renewable energy infrastructure and by expanding venture capital investments in green technologies.LiNeBrEaK SECOND, OBAMA and Congress should use the fiscal stimulus package and tax legislation that will be introduced in 2009 to advance climate change goals. They should permanently extend the renewable-energy production tax credit (which has in the past been allowed to expire) to attract long-term investment in wind and solar energy; eliminate wasteful tax breaks and subsidies for the oil industry; include investments in energy efficiency in any new aid to states and municipalities; and fund infrastructure projects like public transit and smart-grid technologies to promote energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaK Third, cap-and-trade legislation should be the centerpiece of the U.S. climate strategy. This approach provides both certainty in overall emissions reductions and market-based flexibility for individual companies.LiNeBrEaK A cap-and-trade system for sulfur dioxide, enacted in the U.S. in 1990, helped alleviate the acid rain problem at one quarter the cost of initial government estimates. And the European Union is demonstrating that a cap-and-trade system can work, on a continental scale, to achieve year-by-year reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK THESE THREE steps should be taken early in the new administration. When more than 170 nations gather in Copenhagen in December 2009 to chart a new global treaty on climate change, the United States must be at the table, as a leader rather than a laggard.LiNeBrEaK Can bold initiatives on climate change really be enacted during a financial crisis? We think they can. Energy prices have come down. The political landscape has changed. President Obama can make a compelling case that action on climate change will not damage the economy and will instead create jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and protect the environment.LiNeBrEaK Great presidencies are forged in crisis, and 2009 is the year to address the climate crisis. If we don't act, we're committing ourselves to a long-term toxic mortgage - on the future of the planet.LiNeBrEaKL. Preston Bryant, Jr. is Virginia's Secretary of Natural Resources. Noah M.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: A new direction  	The Salt Lake Tribune  	COMMENTARY  	483 words  	Dec. 17--Scientists are predicting that the American West will be hit especially hard by the effects of global warming caused by carbon emissions. Evidence of the looming catastrophe is already abundant: more wildfires of increasing intensity, shorter winters with less snowpack, hotter summers and longer droughts, shrinking reservoirs and disappearing groundwater. LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration casually looked the other way or doctored the data for eight years as scientists warned that the climate crisis was real and would only get worse. So we applaud President-elect Barack Obama for assembling a top-notch team of experts to implement science-based policies for energy innovation and conservation. The goal: to move the country away from its climate-changing dependence on fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKNews that the president-elect intends to nominate Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., to head the Department of Interior is good for Westerners worried about the mindless rush to mine oil shale in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado and to open more public lands to drilling rigs and off-road vehicles.LiNeBrEaKObama's choice of Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics, for energy secretary signals an abrupt change from Bush's industry-friendly mantra that America can somehow drill its way to energy independence. Chu's science background is made to order for putting the country on a new course for producing effective anti-pollution technology and quickly getting it on the market.LiNeBrEaKSalazar, a formerLiNeBrEaKrancher, is a well-known name among Western conservationists. He has opposed the push for wholesale mining of shale rock for oil, an unproven and energy-inefficient process that can destroy the land and guzzle huge amounts of water. He understands the importance of preserving public lands, the complexities of water law and the growing scarcity of Western water resources.LiNeBrEaKObama has done well by the West in his other Cabinet nominations -- New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as commerce secretary and Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary. As governor of a border state, Napolitano has a proven grasp of immigration issues important to Utah and the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaKEnding America's long addiction to fossil fuels and our related dependence on foreign oil must be combined with reducing the carbon cloud that's strangling the Earth. We believe that Obama, in nominating Chu and Salazar, understands these interrelated missions and their importance to the strength and economic stability of the country.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Compost controversy deadlocks Palo Alto council  	By Will Oremus DAILY News STAFF WRITER  	COMMUNITIES; Peninsula; News; Local  	346 words  	Three votes and nearly four hours of discussion and debate weren't enough for the Palo Alto City Council to reach a decision early Tuesday morning about the fate of the city's compost heap. LiNeBrEaKFaced with a choice between preserving park land and keeping green waste local, the council split into three groups, each offering a different solution. With no compromise in sight as 1 a.m. neared, the only thing all three could agree on was tabling the issue and coming back for another vote in January.LiNeBrEaKPassions ran strong on all sides as parks supporters traded jabs with climate change activists.LiNeBrEaKThe seven-acre compost pile in the Baylands is scheduled to close in the next two years and become part of Byxbee Park, along with the adjacent landfill. But that would mean trucking thousands of tons of yard trimmings to Gilroy at a time when the city is trying to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKOn the other hand, keeping the compost heap would require a public vote to allow development on dedicated park land, typically a no-no on the Peninsula. Both the city's parks and recreation commission and its planning and transportation commission unanimously recommended against that idea, though both also said the city should explore other options for keeping its compost local.LiNeBrEaKMayor Larry Klein, Vice Mayor Peter Drekmeier and Council Member Jack Morton argued the city has no other realistic venue for the operation, so the pile should stay put.LiNeBrEaKCouncil members Sid Espinosa, Greg Schmid and Yoriko Kishimoto countered that the city should find ways to reduce its carbon footprint without taking away hard-won open space.LiNeBrEaKHoping for a third way were council members Pat Burt and Yiaway Yeh, who suggested delaying the closure a year to study alternatives.LiNeBrEaKCouncil Member John Barton's absence made it harder for any of the proposals to garner a five-member majority. But even if he had been there, none would have had more than four votes. That means at least one official's mind will have to change in order to settle the issue in January.LiNeBrEaKE-mail Will Oremus at woremus@dailynewsgroup.com	CITY GOVERNMENT (91%); PARKS and PLAYGROUNDS (91%); MAYORS (90%); CITIES (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (75%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (73%); EMISSIONS (67%); LANDFILLS (55%)  				December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved  															
THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	OBAMA APPOINTMENTS: VALUING SCIENCE  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A20  	285 words  	It's almost a new day for science, energy and rational federal decision-making. President-elect Barack Obama's selection of more top advisers represents a much-needed commitment to serious examination of major energy, climate and environmental issues. LiNeBrEaKIn naming several energy and environmental nominees, Obama showed very high standards. Among others, he picked former Environmental Protection Agency head Carol Browner as assistant to the president for energy and climate change and Steven Chu, a 1997 Nobel Prize-winning physicist, as head of the Energy Department. Chu currently directs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.LiNeBrEaKObama said of Chu: "His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science. We will make decisions based on facts, and we understand that the facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKSome Democrats, according to CNN, worried about Chu's lack of political experience. But Browner, who also worked for Al Gore before entering the Clinton administration, knows the ropes in D.C. And, while we certainly could have seen the appointment of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger as energy secretary, Chu's selection just as dramatically underlines the needs for the country to use science in considering its energy and environmental future.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush White House's arrogant, ideological disregard for science and facts provoked what could prove disastrous delays on dealing with global warming and fossil fuels. But the arbitrariness about reality and, in many cases, the law also extended to such areas as endangered species decisions and the utterly wasteful promotion of abstinence-only sex education. Science: no longer a dirty word in the White House after Jan. 20.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	A world of difference on energy policy  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	679 words  	The following editorial appeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Tuesday, Dec. 16:LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, President-elect Barack Obama named Steven Chu, winner of the Nobel Prize for physics, as his choice to lead the Department of Energy. It's hard to imagine a greater contrast between Chu and the man he probably will replace at the energy department, Samuel Bodman.LiNeBrEaKBodman was nominated by President Bush in 2004. He is a former Texas businessman whose company was one of the Lone Star State's top five polluters. It released 54,000 tons of toxic emissions into the Texas air during 1997 alone. LiNeBrEaKThat was the same year Chu received the Nobel Prize for the "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light." In an interview last year with The Washington Post, the son of Chinese immigrants said he turned his attention to energy and climate change after earning the Nobel honor. "Many of our best basic scientists (now) realize that this is getting down to a crisis situation," he told the newspaper.LiNeBrEaKAs head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Chu has been a champion of innovative approaches to solving climate and energy problems. He already has expressed support of a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, as well as for cleaner cars and greener buildings. Under Bodman and, before him, Spencer Abraham, the Bush administration's approach to energy issues has been summarized best by the chant at last summer's Republican National Convention: "Drill, baby, drill."LiNeBrEaKObama also named Carol Browner, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Bill Clinton, as senior White House adviser to coordinate environmental and energy policy. He chose Lisa Jackson to head the EPA and Nancy Sutley, who holds a top environmental post in Los Angeles, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKIn the Bush administration, the council has been stocked with former industry lobbyists. Rather than advancing environmental issues, the council frequently has been used to block efforts to address problems and suppress inconvenient scientific findings.LiNeBrEaKObama's nomination of Chu signals a serious new approach to addressing global climate change. More fundamentally, it signals the return of respect for science and the scientific method in American government.LiNeBrEaKFor the last eight years, the Bush administration has elevated its anti-regulation ideology over science, especially when scientific findings would hamper the pursuit of corporate profits. It also has downgraded scientific, medical and health concerns to curry favor with special interest groups in its political base. Thus, in the area of public health, information on the effectiveness of condoms in combating sexually transmitted diseases was removed from government Web sites. When it came to climate change, White House political appointees altered reports by scientists and silenced experts.LiNeBrEaKNow, as the president's term winds to a close, the administration has embarked on a fast-paced anti-regulatory spree. It has weakened the Endangered Species Act, opened public lands to drilling and mining exploitation, and approved rules to permit mining waste to be dumped into rivers and streams. No longer is there even any attempt to disguise its anti-environmental actions with such Orwellian labels as "Clear Skies" and "Healthy Forests."LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration's new focus on science doesn't mean that there suddenly will be simple or miraculous solutions to society's most pressing scientific and technological challenges. But it does indicate that the search for solutions will take place in the real world, not one ruled by ideology and wishful thinking instead of scientific principles.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Post-Dispatch on the World Wide Web at http://www.stltoday.com	AWARDS and PRIZES (93%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (91%); NOBEL PRIZES (90%); PHYSICS (90%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (88%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (86%); INTERVIEWS (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); LOBBYING (77%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (77%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (75%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (75%); SCIENTIFIC METHOD (74%); APPOINTMENTS (73%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (72%); COMPANY PROFITS (72%); FINANCIAL RESULTS (72%); US REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTIONS (71%); POLITICAL PARTY CONVENTIONS (71%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (64%); SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (62%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (56%)  	NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (56%); NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING (56%); NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS (56%); NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS (56%)  	BARACK OBAMA (94%); GEORGE W BUSH (84%); SAMUEL W BODMAN (72%); BILL CLINTON (53%); STEVEN CHU (94%); CAROL BROWNER (54%); LISA P JACKSON (53%)  	CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081217-BC-ENERGY-EDITORIAL  	Newspaper  	SL  	2008 St. Louis Post-Dispatch   	WPO (NYSE) (56%)  	WASHINGTON POST CO (56%)

Then it was the Southern slave-labor states versus the Northern free-labor states. Now it is the Southern non-union labor states versus the Northern union labor states.LiNeBrEaKThe key Republican senators -- McConnell from Kentucky, Corker from Tennessee, Shelby from Alabama, DeMint from South Carolina -- all hail from states with foreign car companies that set up in that region in large part because of its anti-union stance. As conservative columnist David Harsanyi announces, "We're still going to buy cars, Madame Governor (Granholm of Michigan), but perhaps we will buy them from companies that have the temerity to say 'no' to unions." LiNeBrEaKThe most patriotic of all regions believes it is better to be dependent on foreign corporations than on American corporations with union labor.LiNeBrEaKCertainly American car companies and their union deserve to be roundly criticized for their behavior. For almost three decades they bitterly fought against the public interest -- against seat belts, improved fuel efficiency regulations and global warming legislation. They built poor-quality cars and arrogantly assumed we would dutifully continue to buy them.LiNeBrEaKBut the two key criticisms by opponents of federal financial assistance are deeply flawed.LiNeBrEaKOne regards the disproportionate reliance of U.S. car companies on the sale of SUVs and trucks, a decision they came to regret as gasoline prices soared. I submit foreign car companies would have made the same decision if not for an accident of history. The Japanese entered the U.S. car market with inexpensive, small cars.LiNeBrEaKAs they gained a foothold they scaled up and, in the last 10 years, embraced increased horsepower and size almost as fervently as did their American counterparts. Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all entered the big truck and SUV market in the early 2000s. The 2006 Lexus 470 SUV boasted an increase of 40 horsepower compared to the 2005 model. In 2007, even while running ads touting its environmental consciousness, Toyota introduced the Tundra, a full-size truck named after a part of the world that could disappear because of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe other criticism is that U.S. car companies cannot compete on price because of the cost of unionized labor. Actually, because of dramatic concessions by the UAW, wages of union workers are only slightly higher than those of non-union workers.LiNeBrEaKAnother major component of labor costs is retiree benefits. Once again, Japanese car companies benefited by being late to the game. The Big Three built up a huge pool of retirees long before Honda and Toyota opened plants in this country. In any case, as David Leonhardt of the New York Times argues, "These retirees make up arguably Detroit's best case for a bailout. The Big Three and the UAW had the bad luck of helping to create the middle class in a country where individual companies -- as opposed to all of society -- must shoulder much of the burden of paying for retirement."LiNeBrEaKRarely mentioned in the current debate is that labor costs make up only about 10 percent of the price of a vehicle, and unionized car plants use less labor per vehicle assembled than their non-union counterparts. Nine of the 10 most efficient auto assembly plants in North America are union plants, according to a recent study.LiNeBrEaKIn any event, the Big Three often sell their cars for less than equivalent cars from Japanese companies.LiNeBrEaKThe legacy problem of U.S. car companies is not retiree benefits but the perception by Americans that their cars are lower in quality.LiNeBrEaKReality is increasingly at odds with perception. The 2008 J.D. Power Quality Award went to the Chevrolet Malibu. The Ford Fusion was No. 3, winning out over the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima. Ford's quality ratings now approach those of Toyota. According to the Consumer Reports' 2007 Annual Car Reliability Survey, 93 percent of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury models scored average or better, while the redesigned Camry and Tundra both scored below average.LiNeBrEaKThe bottom line to me is that GM and Ford are American companies. They are the top two companies in RD spending in America, totaling more than $12 billion annually. In third place is Microsoft. Combined, GM and Ford have nearly 100 major plants in the United States. Toyota, Honda and Nissan each have eight.LiNeBrEaKFord and GM each obtain at least 80 percent of their parts from American factories. Toyota, Honda and Nissan get only 45 percent to 55 percent of their parts from the U.S., according to car industry observer Roger Simmermaker.LiNeBrEaKWith all due respect to the Southern Republicans, I believe the key issue in the bailout debate is about country, not about unions.LiNeBrEaKDavid Morris is vice president of the Minneapolis-based Institute for Local Self-Reliance and is author of "Driving Our Way To Energy Independence."

The Telegraph (Nashua, New Hampshire)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	NH joins final test of greenhouse gas cap  	David Brooks, The Telegraph, Nashua, N.H.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	742 words  	Dec. 17--If it's true that the country tends to follow New Hampshire's lead -- which is the whole idea of our presidential primary, after all -- then next week's auction of the right to send 1. 2 million tons of carbon into the air has extra significance.LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, New Hampshire will be participating for the first time in the 10-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI, or "reggie"), the hemisphere's first cap-and-trade system designed to curtail the gas that most contributes to global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe recession has reduced both the need and likely return from the sale, but nonetheless, the process is so new that attention remains high.LiNeBrEaK"Given that the economy is slow, emissions are down," said Joanne Morin, climate and energy programs manager for the state Department of Environmental Services.LiNeBrEaKStill, she added, "A lot of people are watching."LiNeBrEaKThey're watching because RGGI is the first cap-and-trade system aimed at greenhouse gases in this hemisphere, which makes it a model of practices to emulate -- or avoid.LiNeBrEaKAmong the interested spectators are a half-dozen Western states, including California, that have announced plans to institute some greenhouse-gas controls, plus the new presidential administration.LiNeBrEaKBarack Obama has expressed interest in a sort of nationwide version of RGGI to cut greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKAlso watching are the many critics of cap and trade, of which there are many. The political right sometimes decries the system as a hidden, unnecessary tax, while the environmental left sometimes decries it as a bureaucratic mess that won't accomplish anything.LiNeBrEaKEurope has had a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions for two years, although with some significant differences than the RGGI model, and so far it hasn't done much to curtail pollution. On the other hand, the Northeast successfully used cap-and-trade to curtail acid rain.LiNeBrEaKRGGI conducted what might be considered an "alpha test" in September, when seven of the 10 states -- not including New Hampshire, nor New York or New Jersey -- participated in the first of what will be quarterly auctions.LiNeBrEaKIt did better than some had feared, with all 12 million allotments sold (each allotment allows one ton of carbon dioxide pollute to be emitted by a utility) at a price of $3. 07 each, in the middle of the predicted price range.LiNeBrEaKWednesday's quarterly auction could be called a "beta test," since all states will participate this time, but it's still a "pre-compliance" sale, because utility companies don't have to start owning allotments to offset their pollution until Jan. 1.LiNeBrEaKThe sale will involve 31. 5 million CO2 emission allowances. New Hampshire will sell 1. 2 million of them.LiNeBrEaKThe sale has a floor price of $1. 87, so New Hampshire will make at least $2. 24 million -- as long as all the allotments are sold, that is.LiNeBrEaKThe recession has reduced energy consumption by industries, cutting the amount of electricity produced by utilities and therefore the amount of pollution they have to produce, which in turn cuts their need to stockpile allotments to offset carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKCombined with the fact that RGGI has a "loose cap" -- it will sell 188 million tons of CO2 annually, whereas the New England utilities generated only 150 million tons a year -- and it isn't clear how much need utilities have to buy allotments.LiNeBrEaKIt's likely that the sale price will be less than the $3. 07 of September's sale. Figures probably won't be available until late in the week or early next week.LiNeBrEaKPartly as a result, activists are urging environmental groups to buy allotments to increase the cost of pollution.LiNeBrEaKThe money from the sale is distributed to the participating states, which use it as they see fit. New Hampshire will use its money to improve energy efficiency, hoping to reduce the need for future allotments.LiNeBrEaK"Already, $1. 2 million has been earmarked for the StayWarm initiative," said Morin, talking about the volunteer effort to help low-income residents weatherize their homes. "Money (from Wednesday's sale) will go directly into the weatherization initiative."

USA TODAY 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   FIRST EDITION	Falling prices extend to electricity;  Lower construction costs reduce rates 	Paul Davidson  	MONEY; Pg. 4B  	464 words  	After years of steep increases, costs to build power plants and transmission lines have started to fall, promising to temper electricity rate increases for consumers, according to a report out today. LiNeBrEaKThe development is notable because the nation is poised to build the biggest wave of plants in a generation to meet rising electricity demand, and capital costs make up 50% of utility rates, says Larry Makovich, a managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. CERA conducted the study.LiNeBrEaKConstruction costs have dipped 5% the past year and will likely drop an additional 7% to 10% next year, says Candida Scott, CERA's senior director of cost and technology. If the recession persists into 2010, further decreases are likely, she says.LiNeBrEaKBehind the trend are plunging costs for raw materials such as steel and copper amid the global economic slump. Steel prices have tumbled nearly 30% in recent months, offsetting a sharp run-up earlier this year, Scott says.LiNeBrEaKAnd as some utilities delay or cancel new plants, easing order backlogs, costs for equipment, labor, engineering and management are declining. While some utilities signed contracts for new generation at higher prices, others may wait for costs to fall.LiNeBrEaKNuclear plants have benefited most, with costs dropping 12% the past year, largely because they saw the sharpest increases. Since 2006, reactor construction expenses have soared to about $7 billion from about $3 billion. A big reason: Reactor vessels are supplied by just a few manufacturers. No nuclear reactor has been completed since the 1990s, but several dozen are being planned.LiNeBrEaKCosts to build coal, wind and natural gas generators have risen slightly this year but recently have stabilized and are poised to fall, Scott says.LiNeBrEaK"We're seeing some softening in the labor market that's bringing costs down" for some plant-upgrade projects, says Jason Cuevas, spokesman for Southern Co., one of the largest utilities.LiNeBrEaKConsumers may be hard-pressed to notice any savings because power plant construction costs still have more than doubled since 2000, CERA says. A $1 billion plant in 2000 now costs $2. 24 billion.LiNeBrEaKUtility bills will likely increase 10% to 15% the next few years just to finance the new construction, Makovich says. But if expenses did not moderate, rates likely would jump about 20%, he says.LiNeBrEaKAfter figuring in fuel cost increases, especially for coal, electricity bills likely will rise as much as 35% the next five years or so, Makovich says. Further increases are expected when Congress imposes fees on utilities' global-warming emissions. The recession should provide a brief reprieve. With natural gas prices falling and some utilities delaying projects, rates are dropping in some areas and should be fairly stable most of next year, Makovich says.

USA TODAY 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	'Santa Goes Green' grants Christmas wish with a cause;  Previewing the kids' book online helps spread the message 	Mike Snider  	LIFE; Pg. 4D  	689 words  	A children's book author hopes that her new Christmas story will help kids realize that they can have an impact on global warming.LiNeBrEaKSanta Goes Green (Mackinac Island Press, $15. 95) is the story of a boy, Finn, who writes Santa and asks him to help raise awareness about global warming. Finn is interested in the issue because he has adopted a polar bear, and polar bears are losing habitat to global warming.LiNeBrEaKFinn tells Santa he does not need any toys for Christmas, but instead he wants the jolly old elf's help. "Santa can do anything in (Finn's) mind," says author and publisher Anne Margaret Lewis. LiNeBrEaKThe book has sold about 13,000 copies since the small Traverse City, Mich., children's books publisher put a previewable version of the entire book online last month (at mackinacislandpress.com). Now in its second printing, it's a runaway hit.LiNeBrEaKSuccess has come without the embrace of mass-market booksellers, although Borders Books bought some for its Great Lakes-area stores. Librarians across the country are ordering Santa and other books, too, says associate publisher Brian Lewis. "It's really word-of-mouth people buying copies," he says. "It's this organic growth that we love."LiNeBrEaKOne convert, ExtraordinaryMommy.com blogger Danielle Smith, bought Santa and other titles after looking at them online. She began touting the books. "People get to see every single page and every single detail," she says.LiNeBrEaKSanta Goes Green's "artistry is so rich, and the story is so sweet and well-told," Smith says. "I think that it resonates this time of year. And green is something we try to do in little bits and pieces, and when you have it in front of you, it's tangible on a child's level."LiNeBrEaKThe project is a Lewis family affair. Anne, who has written 10 children's books, has been married to Brian for 22 years. And their son, Cameron, who is 6,  gave Anne the idea for the book.LiNeBrEaKThe Lewises married several years after they met in northern Michigan while windsurfing. She worked part time, then full time at Sleeping Bear Press, a small publishing firm that Brian started and sold six years ago. Before that, he also sold Lewis Publishers, an environmental publishing company started with his father in 1984. Then in 2004, Anne started Mackinac Island Press.LiNeBrEaKTheirs is not the only new, green Santa book. Another is When Santa Turned Green (Thomas Nelson Publishers; $15. 99), but what makes the Lewises' book different is that you can see the whole book online before committing to buy it. "This mechanism has opened the door," says Brian Lewis. "We don't have to rely entirely on someone in New York City" to decide the fate of their product.LiNeBrEaKEarly last summer, Anne and Cameron were reading a National Geographic article about how global warming has melted glaciers, which in turn reduced places for bears to live and hunt. "He asked how we could help the polar bears, so we started going around the house every time we left a room and shut the lights off. Then we would say, 'We just saved another polar bear,' " she says. "I was trying to convince him that you can make a difference, and it worked."LiNeBrEaKThat got Lewis to wondering whether she could write a book that would pass along the feeling. "I wanted it to be about polar bears because of how it came to be," she says. "And then I thought, who would a child think is the most powerful person who could help him do that? Santa. The story just started evolving."LiNeBrEaKSuch a story of self-sacrifice fit into her writing style. "I tend to hide messages in books because I want (children) to learn through characters and the actions of characters that they can have fun or be a loyal friend," Lewis says. "My message is that kids can make a difference."LiNeBrEaKGlad tidings continue to come in for Santa Goes Green. Possibly under Christmas trees next year: Gund plush toys of Finn and Leopold, the polar bear.LiNeBrEaKAnd a movie could be in the works. "When I saw the illustrations and saw the story, I just thought it could really be a good children's story," says Penny Milliken, one of two former Disney executives whose new edu-tainment  firm, SeaStars Partnership, secured the rights.  "The time is right for it."

USA TODAY 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Everyone, it seems, wants something from Obama;  President-elect faces a crush of demands 	Ken Dilanian  	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	1988 words  	WASHINGTON -- Al Gore wants quick action on climate change. Sen. Edward Kennedy says health care reform can't wait. Labor unions want a bill making it easier to organize.LiNeBrEaKThe American Civil Liberties Union is calling for the immediate closure of the military's prison for foreign terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The liberal advocacy group MoveOn .org urges a steady troop withdrawal from Iraq. The National Governors Association is pleading for billions in aid to states, pronto.LiNeBrEaKAnd, by the way, Mr. President-elect, the American Lung Association would like you to make all federal work sites smoke-free.LiNeBrEaKNew administrations always face a cacophony of competing demands, but few presidents have been confronted with the sort of urgent and varied pleas being made to Barack Obama, amid two wars and the worst economic crisis in generations, says Anthony Badger, a University of Cambridge historian of American politics. LiNeBrEaKAfter eight years of a Republican president whose central domestic policy was tax cuts, Americans who want a more activist government are aching to see their causes addressed. During the campaign, Obama told many of them just what they wanted to hear. The question now is which pledges Obama tackles first, which ones have to wait and which ones will survive contact with Congress and special interest groups in Washington.LiNeBrEaK"He's under extraordinary pressure to be all things to all people, and he's going to find that very difficult to manage during his first 100 days," says New York University political science professor Paul Light, who specializes in the workings of the federal government. "There are a lot of people coming to him with checklists of issues they care about, but Congress is not capable of handling a mass rush of legislation."LiNeBrEaKOthers, such as MoveOn.org executive director Eli Pariser, say that view underestimates the sense of urgency created by the economic crisis, the broken health care system and the consensus for protecting the climate.LiNeBrEaKThe rallying cry among left-leaning interest groups, including the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO, is that fixing the economy means tackling health care -- the costs of which are hurting everyone from unemployed workers to General Motors -- and addressing climate change by subsidizing clean energy to create "green" jobs.LiNeBrEaK"You have a very popular president elected with a mandate for change, and an unprecedented organized movement of people back home working to make that change happen," Pariser says. "I don't think we've ever seen that before."LiNeBrEaKThe government can do more than one big thing at a time, says Richard Kirsch, national campaign manager for Health Care for America Now, a coalition of unions and progressive groups. "There's no reason that Congress can only do health care, only do climate change."LiNeBrEaKObama has not discussed the timing of his agenda, and his aides aren't ready to, spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter says.LiNeBrEaKThe one thing Obama and congressional Democrats have been clear about is that they intend to pass a package of spending and tax cuts as early as January.LiNeBrEaKThat package, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday could be $600 billion, is designed to jump-start the economy, begin fulfilling Obama's pledge of a middle-class tax cut and set the groundwork for transforming the energy and health-care sectors.LiNeBrEaKThe details are still being worked out, but Obama, Pelosi and other Democrats have said the package will include tax cuts -- as much as $200 billion, Pelosi said -- plus spending on such things as an energy efficient electricity grid and computerizing health records.LiNeBrEaKEarly press is onLiNeBrEaKAlmost from the moment Obama was elected, interest groups and influential advocates were turning up the heat, and stressing the urgency of their causes.LiNeBrEaKThe Sunday after the Nov. 4 election, The New York Times carried an opinion piece by former vice president Gore, calling for a massive program to address climate change.LiNeBrEaKOn the same day in The Washington Post, an opinion article by Kennedy was entitled, "Health Care Can't Wait."LiNeBrEaKComparisons with Franklin Roosevelt's first months are unavoidable, but they only go so far, says Badger, whose latest book is FDR: The First Hundred Days.LiNeBrEaKNo president since Franklin Roosevelt has faced such a severe economic crisis, he says, but the situation today lacks the "sheer, gut-level desperation" afoot in 1933, when Roosevelt won passage of a flurry of legislation to combat the Depression. Also, Badger says, the United States is more politically polarized today, which means Obama won't have the kind of free hand Roosevelt had.LiNeBrEaKAnother constraint: dwindling government resources. With a budget deficit approaching a trillion dollars, Obama may be hamstrung on major expenditures on issues such as health care and energy -- particularly after undertaking what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar stimulus package.LiNeBrEaKPresident Clinton had to trim his domestic agenda when he took office in 1993, after advisers persuaded him to reduce the federal deficit and shelve the stimulus package and middle-class tax cut he had campaigned on.LiNeBrEaK"I hope you're all aware we're all Eisenhower Republicans here," Clinton told aides in 1993 with angry sarcasm, according to Bob Woodward's book, The Agenda. "We stand for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market. Isn't that great?"LiNeBrEaKAnd President Reagan, after cutting income taxes in 1981, was unable to "reverse the growth of government," as he had promised in his first inaugural address. He later agreed to tax increases to control rising deficits.LiNeBrEaKObama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton White House, has said his boss doesn't plan to postpone fulfilling his major campaign promises, such as curbing carbon emissions and expanding health coverage.LiNeBrEaK"The crisis we have today," Emanuel said Nov. 9, "is an opportunity to finally do what Washington for years has postponed and kicked down the road."LiNeBrEaKAfter meeting with Gore in Chicago on Dec. 9, Obama said "the time for delay is over" on addressing greenhouse gas emissions but made no specific policy announcements. A few days later, when he announced that former South Dakota senator Tom Daschle would be his Health and Human Services secretary, Obama again promised to dramatically expand health coverage, though he didn't say when.LiNeBrEaKObama's allies among interest groups don't seem prepared to wait. In late November, Health Care for America Now ran national television spots featuring Obama during an October campaign speech in Virginia, saying he can't fix the economy without fixing health care. "We agree," flashed the message on the screen. "We're ready."LiNeBrEaKDivided We Fail, another health care coalition, is urging members to sign a petition asking Obama "to follow through on your campaign promise and commit to making health care and financial security reform a priority in the first 100 days of your administration."LiNeBrEaKOther demands have poured in. More than 100 retired generals and admirals are calling for repeal of the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy so gay men and lesbians can serve openly -- an issue that paralyzed the early months of Clinton's presidency. The American Lung Association is circulating a petition urging Obama to ban smoking in federal workplaces. The World Food Program is asking Obama to "give hunger its rightful place on the foreign policy agenda."LiNeBrEaKAmnesty International urged Obama "to show true leadership by making human rights central to his new administration," and American Rivers, which advocates for river restoration, is asking Obama to make "water infrastructure a top economic stimulus priority."LiNeBrEaKThe Secular Coalition for America called on Obama to overhaul military policies to reduce what it sees as religious discrimination against non-believers in the armed forces.LiNeBrEaK"You are barraged by people who have the best idea -- not a better idea, but always the best idea -- about what you should do first and with what kind of intensity," says Nicholas Calio, a top lobbyist at Citigroup who headed the legislative affairs operation for President Bush and former president George H.W. Bush.LiNeBrEaKLast month, MoveOn.org held 1,200 meetings nationwide to organize a campaign to keep the heat on members of Congress to deliver on Obama's agenda, executive director Pariser says.LiNeBrEaKMoveOn.org may present an early harbinger of how the left reacts to a disconnect between campaign rhetoric and governing reality.LiNeBrEaKPariser said he believes Obama will fulfill a promise to withdraw all combat troops from Iraq within 16 months.LiNeBrEaKBut military analysts, including Andrew Krepinevich, president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, call that an uncertain proposition.LiNeBrEaKKrepinevich believes Obama's goal is to draw down troops at a pace dictated by the situation on the ground, and get to a point where about 30,000 U.S. troops are advising Iraqis and available as a deterrent to violence.LiNeBrEaK"That would be a goal that all but the very hard left could sign up to," he says.LiNeBrEaKAsked about Iraq at a Dec. 1 news conference, Obama said he still believed "that 16 months is the right time frame. But as I have said consistently, I will listen to the recommendations of my commanders."LiNeBrEaKHe also said he would leave an undetermined number of troops for training and logistics.LiNeBrEaKThe looming obstaclesLiNeBrEaKAnother factor is what sort of opposition Obama will face. In the first 100 days, Roosevelt was granted extraordinary deference because the public and most lawmakers felt that "this was a time when you have to stand by the president -- it was almost a wartime footing," Badger said.LiNeBrEaKBut conservatives and some interest groups are skeptical about Obama's plans.LiNeBrEaKPro-business groups, including Americans for Job Security and the Employee Freedom Action Committee, have spent millions since the election on national ads against legislation, supported by Obama and most Democrats, that would make it easier for employees to join labor unions.LiNeBrEaKStuart Butler, vice president of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, argued in an interview that Democratic health care and climate change proposals are likely to drive up spending on health and energy, which would be an economic drag, not a stimulus.LiNeBrEaK"Of course there's going to be resistance," said Ron Pollack, who directs Families USA, which advocates for universal health care. "But in the end, the cost of inaction is just too high, and everyone gets that."LiNeBrEaKSigns are emerging about how Obama will proceed.LiNeBrEaKAfter meeting in mid-November with transition officials, Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in an interview, "They seem to be saying, we need to move on all fronts early."LiNeBrEaKHe said he believes the Obama administration plans an economic stimulus bill in January that would include health care and environmental components.LiNeBrEaKThen, Pope said, the administration will "do the political heavy lifting between February and August" to push health care legislation, cap carbon dioxide emissions and subsidize alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKObama spokeswoman Cutter cautioned, "We've never said we'd get all that done" by August.LiNeBrEaKIn Congress, Kennedy is working on a health care plan, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who chairs the Finance Committee, recently released one of his own.LiNeBrEaKRep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, told reporters last month they would be hard pressed to find any daylight between him and the president elect on trade or tax policy. At one point he crooned, "Whatever Obama wants" to the tune of Whatever Lola Wants.LiNeBrEaKPope said the Obama transition is far better organized and disciplined than what he saw with former Democratic presidents Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Former California congressman Leon Panetta, a former chief of staff under Clinton, agreed.LiNeBrEaK"They seem to have a much more clear idea about the steps they need to take early on," he said of Obama's team.LiNeBrEaK"They clearly are ahead of the game."

USA TODAY 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Falling prices extend to electricity;  Lower construction costs reduce rates 	Paul Davidson  	MONEY; Pg. 4B  	464 words  	After years of steep increases, costs to build power plants and transmission lines have started to fall, promising to temper electricity rate increases for consumers, according to a report out today. LiNeBrEaKThe development is notable because the nation is poised to build the biggest wave of plants in a generation to meet rising electricity demand, and capital costs make up 50% of utility rates, says Larry Makovich, a managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. CERA conducted the study.LiNeBrEaKConstruction costs have dipped 5% the past year and will likely drop an additional 7% to 10% next year, says Candida Scott, CERA's senior director of cost and technology. If the recession persists into 2010, further decreases are likely, she says.LiNeBrEaKBehind the trend are plunging costs for raw materials such as steel and copper amid the global economic slump. Steel prices have tumbled nearly 30% in recent months, offsetting a sharp run-up earlier this year, Scott says.LiNeBrEaKAnd as some utilities delay or cancel new plants, easing order backlogs, costs for equipment, labor, engineering and management are declining. While some utilities signed contracts for new generation at higher prices, others may wait for costs to fall.LiNeBrEaKNuclear plants have benefited most, with costs dropping 12% the past year, largely because they saw the sharpest increases. Since 2006, reactor construction expenses have soared to about $7 billion from about $3 billion. A big reason: Reactor vessels are supplied by just a few manufacturers. No nuclear reactor has been completed since the 1990s, but several dozen are being planned.LiNeBrEaKCosts to build coal, wind and natural gas generators have risen slightly this year but recently have stabilized and are poised to fall, Scott says.LiNeBrEaK"We're seeing some softening in the labor market that's bringing costs down" for some plant-upgrade projects, says Jason Cuevas, spokesman for Southern Co., one of the largest utilities.LiNeBrEaKConsumers may be hard-pressed to notice any savings because power plant construction costs still have more than doubled since 2000, CERA says. A $1 billion plant in 2000 now costs $2. 24 billion.LiNeBrEaKUtility bills will likely increase 10% to 15% the next few years just to finance the new construction, Makovich says. But if expenses did not moderate, rates likely would jump about 20%, he says.LiNeBrEaKAfter figuring in fuel cost increases, especially for coal, electricity bills likely will rise as much as 35% the next five years or so, Makovich says. Further increases are expected when Congress imposes fees on utilities' global-warming emissions. The recession should provide a brief reprieve. With natural gas prices falling and some utilities delaying projects, rates are dropping in some areas and should be fairly stable most of next year, Makovich says.

The Washington Times 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Green lobby critical of new-roads agenda;  Infrastructure plan called bad for 'economy, security, climate' 	By S.A. Miller, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A07  	570 words  	Friends of the Earth on Monday attacked President-elect Barack Obama's call for new infrastructure projects in his economic-stimulus package, saying it's a road to pollution.LiNeBrEaKThe 39-year-old environmental group launched a new Web site (www.roadtonowhere .org) and announced plans for ads, grass-roots mobilization and lobbying of Congress to keep new construction of roads out of a stimulus bill.LiNeBrEaK"More roads mean more pollution and more dependence on oil, hurting our economy, security and climate," Friends of the Earth's Colin Peppard said. LiNeBrEaKThe group, which includes more than 100,000 members and activists in the U.S., said transportation is responsible for 30 percent of the country's global-warming pollution and nearly 70 percent of its oil use, and that 10 miles of new four-lane highway result in emissions equivalent to the lifetime emissions of more than 45,000 Hummers.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress have made building roads, bridges and schools - and repairing or repaving existing infrastructure - a cornerstone of a stimulus that could cost between $600 billion and $1 trillion early next year.LiNeBrEaKFriends of the Earth does not oppose repairing existing roadways, though it stressed the need for more public transit, passenger rail, and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.LiNeBrEaK"Investments in clean transportation alternatives, as well as road and bridge maintenance and repair, create more jobs than new-road construction and help families save money on gas," Mr. Peppard said. "Focusing an economic-stimulus package on such clean investments should be a no-brainer."LiNeBrEaKThe assault on stimulus roadwork came as other environmentalists are raising alarms that national climate-change policy could get sidelined in Congress by economic concerns. The green lobby, as reflected by Friends of the Earth, is increasingly uneasy with Mr. Obama's assurances that Democrats can meld economic, energy and environmental priorities.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama transition team did not immediately comment on the Friends of the Earth's "road-to-nowhere" campaign.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama, who met with his economic advisers Tuesday to work on a stimulus plan, stressed the need to "rebuild."LiNeBrEaK"My economic team ... is helping to shape what is going to be a bold agenda to create 25 million new jobs, to start helping states and local governments with shovel-ready projects - rebuilding our roads, our bridges, making sure that schools ... are energy-efficient, putting people back to work, getting businesses to start seeing some increase in demand," he saidLiNeBrEaK"I'm confident that we can accomplish that if we've got Democrats and Republicans, federal, state, and local governments all working together," Mr. Obama said. "But, look, we are going through the toughest time, economically, since the Great Depression. And it's going to be - it's going to be tough."LiNeBrEaKA spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a chief proponent of stimulus infrastructure spending, said the California Democrat is sensitive to environmental concerns and noted the speaker's pledge that the stimulus would be "forward-looking."LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus also likely will include increased Medicaid payments to states, expanded eligibility for food stamps and other nutrition programs, extended unemployment benefits and middle-class tax cuts. But infrastructure projects are expected to dominate the spending.LiNeBrEaKCapitol Hill Republicans say such projects take too long and will not spur the economy.

The Washington Times 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 		By James Morrison, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	WORLD; EMBASSY ROW; A12  	606 words  	BRIDGE TO SOMEWHERELiNeBrEaKThe German ambassador Tuesday called for an "energy revolution" as he opened a joint German-U.S. project his government calls a "trans-Atlantic climate bridge" to encourage government and private cooperation to produce cleaner power.LiNeBrEaK"We are facing enormous economic challenges," Ambassador Klaus Scharioth told energy experts at his residence. "During these difficult times; it is critical that we take the long view on energy and climate change." LiNeBrEaKHe noted the challenges of trying to meet air quality goals set out in the Kyoto climate treaty during the global financial crisis.LiNeBrEaK"First, we need an energy revolution that involves both the public and private sector and decision-makers at all levels," Mr. Scharioth said. "Second, we need more cooperation."LiNeBrEaKThat is the reason for the "climate bridge."LiNeBrEaK"I believe that by working together, Germans and Americans can be a powerful engine for trans-Atlantic and also global climate cooperation," he said.LiNeBrEaKMr. Scharioth noted that many of his guests already show the success of U.S.-German cooperation on energy projects.LiNeBrEaK"First Solar, the largest manufacturer of thin-film solar cells in the world, is an excellent example of a U.S. company thriving in Germany, thanks to the country's favorable framework for renewable energies," he said, introducing the firm's chief executive officer, Michael Ahearn.LiNeBrEaKGuests included: L. Preston Bryant Jr., Virginia's secretary for natural resources; Kathleen McGinty, former secretary of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection and the acting secretary, John Hanger; Claudia Wormann of the Federation of German Industries; and Eicke Weber, director of Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bryant recently led a delegation to Hamburg to study Germany's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Pennsylvania and Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia region have established partnerships in the energy sector.LiNeBrEaKMr. Scharioth added that Germany has already met its goal under the Kyoto treaty of reducing its carbon emissions to 22 percent below the levels emitted in 1990. Critics, however, say Germany achieved much of its target by closing old, coal-fired energy plants in East Germany.LiNeBrEaK"A green economy can generate growth, create jobs, ensure energy security and prevent our climate from deteriorating further," the ambassador said.LiNeBrEaKCZECH-EU SPATLiNeBrEaKA former Czech ambassador to the United States on Tuesday stood up for the European Union amid criticism over the Czech Republic's dedication to the EU.LiNeBrEaKAlexandr Vondra, now the deputy prime minister, noted that the Czech government is committed to the 27-nation union the Czech Republic joined four years ago, despite the feelings of Czech President Vaclav Klaus, who refuses to fly the EU flag over the presidential Prague Castle.LiNeBrEaKUnder its parliamentary system, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek is head of government, while Mr. Klaus holds the more ceremonial position as head of state. The prime minister will represent the nation when the Czech Republic assumes the rotating EU presidency in January.LiNeBrEaK"European policy is the domain of the government," Mr. Vondra said in response to criticism from French President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose country currently holds the EU presidency. "There was, there is and there will be the European flag" flying over parliament and the government offices, he added. Mr. Vondra was ambassador in Washington from March 1997 to July 2001.LiNeBrEaKMr. Sarkozy on Tuesday said he is "sometimes a little astonished" by Mr. Klaus' criticism of the EU.LiNeBrEaK* Call Embassy Row at 202/636-3297, fax 202/832-7278 or e-mail jmorrison @washingtontimes.com.

The Washington Times 		December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Bountiful untapped energy  	THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	EDITORIALS; A18  	480 words  	Americans have become open to anything that would lower the cost of soaring energy and oil prices. Energy independence and the impact of foreign energy supplies on American security have become a major policy concern. Now, President-elect Barack Obama has nominated Steven Chu as energy secretary, Lisa P. Jackson as head of the EPA and Carol Browner in a new position as his energy "czar." His focus is on conservation, global warming and alternative energy sources like wind power rather than on traditional sources of energy like natural gas and oil. LiNeBrEaKWe believe the new appointees should be focused on making use of domestic oil supplies and other natural resources already present to keep America energy independent.LiNeBrEaKA new study from ICF International commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association representing all aspects of the oil and gas industry, provides important information on the issue of energy independence. API's survey says "America's vast domestic oil and natural gas resources that had been kept off-limits by Congress for decades could generate more than $1. 7 trillion in government revenue, create thousands of new jobs and enhance the nation's security by significantly boosting domestic production."LiNeBrEaKThe study focused on untapped crude oil and gas supplies in the Outer Continental Shelf, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the Rockies. Specifically, if drilling were allowed in ANWR by the new Congress and new president, and a portion of federal lands in the Rockies, domestic crude oil production would climb by 2 million barrels per day in 2030 or 36 percent by 2030, API said. That would offset a fifth of the nation's imports. Natural domestic gas production would rise by 10 percent, which would allow America to be much less dependent on foreign oil and energy sources.LiNeBrEaKThis month, in fact, per-barrel oil prices rose slightly by $1. 45 or 3. 4 percent, according to MarketWatch. The increase was due to speculation, not action, that Saudi Arabia may cut production of oil. "This study also underscores how the oil and natural gas industry can enhance America's energy security and help solve economic problems by increasing production of our nation's vast oil and natural gas resources," said API President and CEO Jack N. Gerard.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama has stated that he is open at least to offshore drilling as part of a larger energy package. One blockade for Mr. Obama is that leftist "greenies" will protest violently against offshore drilling or use of any federal lands for energy sources like natural gas and oil. But Mr. Obama's new energy team should cede to the results of the API study, as it indicates how America could achieve much greater energy independence and security by using untapped federal lands for drilling. Mr. Obama should consider not just drilling on the outer shelf, but also in ANWR and the Rockies.

The Willits News (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 17, 2008 Wednesday 	Local First Week proclaimed  	Linda Williams, The Willits News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	285 words  	Dec. 17--Past Willits Mayor Holly Madrigal, in one of her last official duties, proclaimed December 14 to 20 as Local First Week in Willits. LiNeBrEaKThe proclamation was signed to help promote local business during the holiday season and encouraged by the Willits Chamber of Commerce, North Coast Opportunities and Willits Action Group.LiNeBrEaK"A local living economy is about creating positive alternatives for growing local value and a health sustainable local economy," says Willits Community Director Alan Falleri. "It is about the triple bottom line of 'People, Planet, Profit' where prosperity means more than just the traditional bottom line of financial outcomes but also is a measure of environmental and social performance."LiNeBrEaKA number of principles were cited to support the proclamation including shopping locally reduces the environmental impacts of air pollution and global warming caused by driving out of town to stop. Money spent in local businesses stays and circulates in the community.LiNeBrEaKThe proclamation begins with "Whereas, the independent, locally owned businesses of Willits keep wealth circulating in our community, adding to our economic vitality and resilience." It ends with, "I, Holly Madrigal encourage every citizen of Willits to choose the future we want to see with every purchase we make."

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: Beware new EPA power: Obama's climate-change crew may barge ahead where Congress, for good reason, had feared to tread  	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	531 words  	Dec. 16--President-elect Barack Obama's new environmental team may bode ill -- trillions of dollars of ill -- if they are true to their green colors and implement administratively what even the Democratic-controlled Congress has refused to do legislatively, all in the name of saving America from global warming. LiNeBrEaKCongress, which is restrained at the ballot box, has been loath to implement Draconian proposals to curb manmade greenhouse gases, supposedly the cause of global warming. But it's not because the temperature gains of the past 30 years were entirely erased by recent declines that Congress was dissuaded. Nor was it that temperatures have fallen while greenhouse gas emissions have risen, the opposite effect of global warming theory.LiNeBrEaKNo. Congress has been restrained from implementing economic horrors such as last year's proposed American Climate Security Act because of the widespread and deep economic damage it would cause. The Heritage Foundation estimated the bill would have increased gasoline prices 29 percent, thrown hundreds of thousands of people out of work and reduced gross domestic product as much as $4 trillion by 2030. Congress shelved the obviously destructive proposal, global warming or no global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut the new Obama environmental team may be less-restrained. These left-leaning bureaucrats will be empowered by a 2007 Supreme Court decision that determined, for the first time, that naturally occurring, ubiquitous carbon dioxide is now to be considered a pollutant. That opens the door to using the Clean Air Act, intended to fight pollution, to administratively enforce what Congress has been unwilling to do legislatively.LiNeBrEaKAs we saw in California, with adoption last week of costly administrative regulations to combat global warming, bureaucrats can be much less restrained than politicians. If you liked the $23 billion in taxes and fees California's Air Resources Board just imposed, you'll love the trillions of dollars of damage ahead at the hands of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA already has begun steps to bypass the legislative process and regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Its proposal is "nothing less than the most costly, complicated and unworkable regulatory scheme ever proposed," comments Ben Lieberman, senior energy and environmental analyst at the Heritage Foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of EPA actions, Lieberman estimates, "would likely exceed that of the legislation rejected by Congress, reaching well into the trillions of dollars while destroying millions of jobs in the manufacturing sector." Under EPA plans, "nearly every product, business and building that uses fossil fuels could face requirements that border on the impossible," Lieberman writes.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Main Edition	READERS WRITE  	CARL MANSON, W. BRUCE PHILLIPS, EARL JOHNSON, JACOB MASON, WILLIAM D. WILSON JR.; For the Journal-Constitution  	@ISSUE; Pg. 11A  	572 words  	Tech, Georgia State should be mergedLiNeBrEaKLet's get serious about merging colleges. Does it make economic sense to have two major universities within city blocks of each other? Georgia State University offers a full science curriculum which mirrors Georgia Tech's offering and Georgia Tech offers a full business curriculum which mirrors Georgia State's. Let's merge them into the Georgia State Institute of Technology. Here is your answer, Sen. Seth Harp. We just saved $200 million.LiNeBrEaKCARL MANSON LiNeBrEaKLithoniaLiNeBrEaKDon't hold your breath on debateLiNeBrEaKHow ironic that on the day of Olivia Judson's opinion column ("Restore [and respect] use of science in government," @issue, Dec. 10), we learn of a pending report from the Senate featuring 650 international scientists who dissent from global warming orthodoxy. Don't hold your breath waiting for truth-focused debate.LiNeBrEaKJudson believes that the recent election will reduce political meddling in science. I suggest she just wants her own team doing the meddling. We need, in fact, two debates: a real, scientific one and a vigorous public policy one. What we don't need is to be told that "science knows best" when the question is public policy.LiNeBrEaKW. BRUCE PHILLIPSLiNeBrEaKRoswellLiNeBrEaKKemp's actions not truly heroicLiNeBrEaKThe AJC's laudatory comments about Jan Kemp ("Not enough people joined Kemp's effort, @issue, Dec. 12) were idealistic and not placed in a realistic perspective, in this University of Georgia alum's opinion. Even back in the 1960s, every student knew that football players received assistance in their classroom pursuits (handpicked instructors, tutors, old exam files). Even today, the UGA president signs waivers to get potential football recruits enrolled. Otherwise, they could never meet academic requirements.LiNeBrEaKIn the end, it is all about money. The UGA football program must generate revenue to pay for all the federally mandated women's sports programs. You can buy a season ticket to UGA women's basketball for $25. Do I make my point?LiNeBrEaKRealistically, how are academically challenged football players damaged for just sharing in the "college experience"? Kemp and her lawsuit were "a tempest in a teapot," full of sound and fury and signifying nothing. Nothing except the court awarded $1. 1 million to her, paid out of state funds. If she had refused the money, then her actions would truly have been heroic.LiNeBrEaKEARL JOHNSONLiNeBrEaKMariettaLiNeBrEaKFolks in dense cities --- not Atlanta --- buy bikesLiNeBrEaKIn his opinion column "As others fall, bicycles ride high" (@issue, Nov. 26), Ron Goodden mentions that he has not seen much increase in bicycle riding. The lack of bicycle riding in Atlanta is largely due to incredibly unfriendly roads and large distances between where people live and work. Even if the number of bicyclists doubled, it would be hard to tell, since their numbers are so low.LiNeBrEaKDenser cities are seeing tremendous gains in bicycle riding. New York City just reported a 35 percent increase in bicycle commuters over one year. People in dense cities are the ones buying bikes, not folks in Atlanta suburbs.LiNeBrEaKJACOB MASONLiNeBrEaKMason, who was raised in Atlanta, is a New York transportation engineer.LiNeBrEaKAren't there some brains in Washington?LiNeBrEaKNo one in the federal government seems capable of just saying "no." I knew in 1973 when I bought my first car, a Toyota, that Detroit automakers should be allowed to die a quiet death.LiNeBrEaKI'm not that smart.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	247 words  	Dec. 16--Western Washington University's Institute for Global and Community Resilience, a program within the Huxley College of the Environment, has been awarded a $140,000 grant by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. LiNeBrEaKThe grant provides for partnering with farmers in three counties (Whatcom, Skagit, and San Juan), as well as farm advocacy and educational organizations in the region, to develop a ranked set of farm resiliency indicators -- a set of measureable indices to test the ability of the region's family farms to withstand four likely events or rapid changes: global climate change, seasonal flooding, urban/rural encroachment in farming areas, and uncertain energy prices.LiNeBrEaK"This is the institute's first large grant, and we're excited that it's sufficiently multidisciplinary to involve other departments and programs on campus, as well as other Huxley faculty," said institute director and WWU professor of environmental studies Gigi Berardi.LiNeBrEaKFor more information on the grant or on the work of the institute, contact Berardi at gigi.berardi@wwu.edu	AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS (90%); GRANTS and GIFTS (90%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); FAMILY FARMS (77%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (77%); CLIMATOLOGY (75%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (73%)  	General  		WASHINGTON, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-BH-BRF-Western-s-Huxley-College-awarded-140,000-grant-for-local-farm-project-1216  	Newspaper  	BH  	2008 The Bellingham Herald   		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (67%)  		US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (84%)  											
The Boston Globe 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Solving the transportation crisis  	Salvatore F. DiMasi  	OP-ED; Pg. A19  	710 words  	THE CHINESE SYMBOL for crisis is a combination of the characters for danger and opportunity. As we begin to address the looming transportation crisis, there is both danger and opportunity for the Commonwealth.LiNeBrEaKCrumbling roads and bridges and the massive Big Dig debt are huge challenges that will not be solved easily, and will require shared sacrifice. Fixing these problems will require creativity and a willingness to think in new ways. The danger lies in solutions that reflect old thinking or offer only a short-term fix.LiNeBrEaKSeveral times during my tenure as speaker, challenges to the Commonwealth have been so vast and complex they could be solved only by breaking the traditional political mold. LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, we rewrote the national storyline on healthcare, passing landmark legislation to provide health insurance to nearly every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. It happened only when bipartisan leaders, hospitals, insurers, unions, CEOs, and ministers were willing to stop reaching for sound bites and worked together for a bold solution. Since then, more than 430,000 people have been newly insured and we now have the lowest rate of uninsured in the nation.LiNeBrEaKLast year, we replicated that model with nation-leading energy reform. Governor Deval Patrick, Senate President Therese Murray, and I, together with our colleagues in the Legislature and stakeholders, worked for 11 months with disparate groups that for decades have fought over environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKOur actions led the Massachusetts League of Environmental Voters to say that we "led the nation on clean energy, global warming, and land protection this year." Both achievements are now considered the model for President-elect Barack Obama's policies on healthcare and energy.LiNeBrEaKNow we must take that same approach to problem solving and apply it to the transportation crisis.LiNeBrEaKFirst, the proposed toll increases are not the place to start. Drivers from the North Shore and west of Boston - the only toll-payers in the state - should not have to pay up to $1,800 each year to drive to work.LiNeBrEaKThe Transportation Committee holds a hearing on two gas tax bills tomorrow. Neither is perfect, but they are a start. In combination with other measures, they can form the basis of an alternative to the short-term thinking that got us in a mess so dire the independent commission we asked to analyze our transportation woes said in its report: "We need to grasp the enormity of the problem that we face, recognize that `business as usual' will not suffice, and work together to develop sustainable solutions for our transportation system."LiNeBrEaKSo what should our ultimate solution contain?LiNeBrEaKBefore we raise any taxes or tolls, we must act on deep and meaningful reform. We cannot ask more from people without showing them we are serious about meaningful change. We should merge transportation agencies to root out inefficiency. That means one transportation agency managing our systems, not four.LiNeBrEaKWe also need to reform an out of control pension system within agencies like the MBTA - which itself is facing the looming repayment of some $8 billion in debt, far greater than the current Big Dig debt crisis. Next, we need to level with people and explain that the $20 billion cost of maintenance without any enhancements can't be achieved with reforms alone. Additional revenue will be needed and everything should be on the table. A gas tax is a better option than a huge toll increase. It is a much fairer and more equitable way to address revenue needs.LiNeBrEaKAnd with respect to tolls, we need to have an honest conversation about how we situate them. Does it make sense to have them just on bridges and tunnels? Should we consider adding them in other places, such as at the borders? Should we embrace open road tolling to allow drivers to continue at highway speeds?LiNeBrEaKAs with healthcare and energy reform, the challenge to find meaningful solutions for our transportation system will be challenging. But with the cooperation of the governor, Senate, and House, we can craft a creative and effective solution.LiNeBrEaKThis is our challenge. If we work together, it represents a tremendous opportunity.LiNeBrEaKSalvatore F. DiMasi, a Democratic state representative from Boston, is speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

The Boston Globe 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	Kerry named head of foreign relations panel  	Bryan Bender Globe Staff  	NATIONAL; Pg. A16  	673 words  	WASHINGTON - Senator John F. Kerry was named chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, pledging to use his stewardship of the influential panel to strengthen American interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan, help end the war in Iraq, and craft solutions to the climate change crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe Massachusetts Democrat is already on an extended tour of trouble spots that will probably consume the foreign policy attention of President-elect Barack Obama. Kerry met yesterday with leaders in Pakistan and India, trying to ease tensions between the two nuclear powers over the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai. LiNeBrEaKHe next goes to Afghanistan, where Obama wants to deploy thousands of additional troops to fight the war on terrorism. The first stop on Kerry's itinerary, which began over the weekend, was the Republic of Georgia, the front line in Russia's more aggressive stance against the West. On Sunday, he and Obama talked about a global warming conference in Poland that Kerry attended.LiNeBrEaK"We have a big agenda ahead of us, just as our country faces big challenges across the globe," Kerry said in a statement from Islamabad, Pakistan.LiNeBrEaKKerry, who has sat on the committee for 24 years and first came to public notice when he testified before the panel in opposition to the Vietnam War, was elevated to the chairmanship by Senate majority leader Harry Reid after he lost out to Hillary Clinton to be Obama's secretary of state.LiNeBrEaKKerry is set to take over for the outgoing chairman, Vice President-elect Joe Biden, at a crucial time. Aides said the stops on his foreign trip highlight some of the core issues he will have to deal.LiNeBrEaKOver the weekend Kerry met in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi with Prime Minister Grigol Mgaloblishvili and President Mikheil Saakashvili, who are still reeling from the Russian invasion of their territory in August and are seeking membership in the NATO alliance.LiNeBrEaKYesterday, Kerry met with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi before traveling to Islamabad to meet with Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and other leaders.LiNeBrEaKKerry had tough words for his Pakistani hosts, saying that the government must shut down terrorist training camps like those believed to be have been used by the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks last month.LiNeBrEaK"It's imperative to comply and terrorist camps should be shut down," Kerry told reporters after holding talks with the Indian external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, according to local media reports.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking of the spate of attacks that killed nearly 200 people in India's financial center, Kerry added: "We know it was all planned in Pakistan and we are very, very confident that evidence will be presented at the right time."LiNeBrEaKToday, Kerry is to meet with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and visit US troops from Massachusetts who are serving there, according to his Senate office.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate Foreign Relations chairmanship remains among the most prized in the Senate. It is responsible for vetting international treaties, conducting the confirmation hearings for presidential nominees for the State Department, and overseeing the State Department budget. The panel also helps set policy for foreign aid and arms control programs and authorizes military training for allied nations.LiNeBrEaKKerry, in his statement yesterday, cited two legendary chairmen of the committee, one from each political party, in promising to seek bipartisan policies.LiNeBrEaK"Whether it was under the Republican chairman [Arthur] Vandenberg or the great Democratic chairman William Fulbright, this committee has always stood for the best of American foreign policy," Kerry said.LiNeBrEaKKerry has been preparing to take leadership of the committee for several weeks. Last week, he met with Clinton to iron out any issues that might arise during her confirmation hearing. Kerry also appointed a new spokesman for the committee: Frederick L. Jones II, a former career foreign service officer and spokesman for the National Security Council under President Bush.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Second City hits comedy bull's-eye: New show has politics, economy, Chicago Olympics and sex in its cross hairs  	Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	676 words  	Dec. 16--The frightening, funny new revue on the Second City mainstage is called "America: All Better!" but that doesn't stop the cast from delivering a show about the existential terrors of these yin-and-yang times here in Sweet Home Chicago, where one day we're flying high and mighty with the federal eagles and the next we're all rolling in the gubernatorial muck with the federal investigators.LiNeBrEaKA wife begs her laid-off husband's boss to give him his job back, lest life remain an endless series of trips to Menards and Pep Boys. Denizens of Lake Forest ponder the horror of downsized life in Des Plaines, involving ignominious Metra trains and beer in paper bags. Lauren Ash sings a dreamy ode to Barack Obama, but the Dow falls another hundred during her ditty. A blustery but unpredictable mayor tries to sell global dignitaries on a Chicago Olympics, only to insult Javier Bardem and fail to recognize Pele, bringing everything crashing down. LiNeBrEaK"Other than murder," the cast declares, "the crime rate is down in Chicago."LiNeBrEaKSums up our moment quite nicely, doesn't it?LiNeBrEaKAnd who does Matt Hovde's cast think is going to save us from this house of horrors? Who you gonna call when Rod and Patti Soprano offer Springfield to the highest bidder? Desperate times call for extreme measures: Rahm Emanuel, who will rip your throat out.LiNeBrEaK"Oh, Rahm," coo the show's sensual women, as the deliciously creepy Brad Morris takes on the congressman and nascent presidential chief of staff. "Teeny. Tiny. Terrifying."LiNeBrEaKEmanuel the enforcer keeps coming back. God knows there's enough corruption in Illinois to take up his time.LiNeBrEaK"He's like a really scary Precious Moments figurine," the women say, taking the true measure of their man.LiNeBrEaKThe best Second City revues have strong overarching worldviews -- preferably involving our deepest insecurities. This stellar new show is right up there with the classics. It benefits from a cast of unusually diverse styles and talents.LiNeBrEaKThe nasal, sharp-edged Joe Canale, whose characters include a polar bear terrified of global warming, gives the show its bite. Michael Patrick O'Brien (a dead ringer for the Second City alum Jack McBrayer) is the ever-essential goof, a character type that had hitherto been losing traction on Wells Street. The unusually malleable Morris adds the crucial intangible of emotional complexity. And Anthony LeBlanc is willing to step to the edge. Not only does LeBlanc do a killer Cornell West, but -- in a side-splitting song about inter-racial love -- he debuts a pickup line of the future: "Let's make our own Obama."LiNeBrEaKThe feisty redhead Emily Wilson delivers the outre sexual content (be warned if your offspring are headed to this show). Shelly Gossman -- perhaps the biggest talent on the stage -- has that Tiny Fey-like blend of nerd and farceur. And once she's warmed up, Ash's ability to nail everyday folks gives the show its social conscience.LiNeBrEaKThe only bust of the night is a long rehab scene at the top of Act 2. . But the rest of the show lands in the bull's-eye.LiNeBrEaKThe funniest sketch of a boffo night involves the incredibly gutsy Gossman as a Russian gymnast, doing an actual balance routine around the cocktails on the rail in the middle of the audience. At one point, a patron pours a drink into her upside-down mouth.LiNeBrEaK"So many of these Russian gymnasts," says a dry-as-sandpaper voice-over, "began their careers as strippers."LiNeBrEaKThe joint erupted with laughter Sunday night, not least because half of us are worried we might end our careers that way, if only somebody was interested.LiNeBrEaKcjones5@tribune.comLiNeBrEaKWhen: Open runLiNeBrEaKWhere: 1616 N.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Momentum builds for energy independence: Converging conditions could stoke sustained federal push for alternative fuels, greener cars  	Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	926 words  	Dec. 16--WASHINGTON -- Breaking America's foreign-oil addiction was all the rage on Capitol Hill when gas cost $4 a gallon. Now that it's under $2 and falling, history suggests the enthusiasm for alternative fuels and more-efficient cars will subside. It did that in the mid-1970s and again in the '80s and '90s.LiNeBrEaKBut this time could be different. A confluence of factors that didn't exist or played lesser roles in previous "energy independence" efforts has congressional leaders and environmental groups thinking that major action to reduce oil imports and replace fossil fuels may still be possible. The new elements in the equation include increasing public anxiety over global warming, broad enthusiasm for making sure the coming stimulus package has a "green" tinge and repeated vows for action from President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaKAlso this time, many consumers and oil company executives appear convinced it won't be long before high gas prices come back to stay.LiNeBrEaK"In the past, when the price of oil and gas have dropped, it has caused us to lose our focus" on energy independence, said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "I don't think that'll happen this time."LiNeBrEaKRecent opinion polls and exit surveys from the November election back him up, but perhaps nothing illustrates the change in attitudes better than a survey of 52 high-level oil and gas executives released last week by the auditing and consulting firm Deloitte.LiNeBrEaKIt found that less than a quarter of those executives expect oil and gas to be Americans' cheapest energy source in 25 years, and three-quarters say it's a good idea for the country to turn away from fossil fuels for transportation.LiNeBrEaKThat's a "sea shift" for the industry, said Joseph Stanislaw, a Deloitte senior adviser and longtime oil and gas analyst. "People are saying, prices go up and prices go down," he said, "but something's broken here, and we've got to fix it."LiNeBrEaKAmericans have worried about their dependence on foreign oil since the early 1970s, when Arab oil producers stunned the developed world by halting oil shipments during the presidency of Richard Nixon. The result was soaring energy prices, long lines at gas stations and an "energy shock" to the economy it took years to recover from.LiNeBrEaKToday the United States imports nearly two-thirds its oil, a 50 percent increase from the Nixon years, even though every president in that time has pledged to wean the nation from foreign energy.LiNeBrEaKObama, in announcing his energy policy team Monday, noted how presidents for decades had failed to curb the nation's oil addiction.LiNeBrEaK"This time has to be different," Obama said. "This time we cannot fail. Nor can we be lulled into complacency just because, for now, the price of gas has fallen below $4 a gallon."LiNeBrEaKOil prices hit record heights over the summer, fueled in part by explosive demand in developing nations such as China and India. Both Obama and his GOP opponent, John McCain, promised ambitious plans to reduce oil use, and Americans cut back on driving.LiNeBrEaKThen the global economy slipped rapidly into recession, energy demand ebbed and prices sank again.LiNeBrEaKInstead of backing off his alternative energy push, though, Obama doubled down. Since the November election he has promised to make so-called green projects a cornerstone of the economic stimulus plan that will anchor his early agenda. And he repeatedly pledged swift action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, an issue heavily wrapped in the politics of oil.LiNeBrEaKObama's concern over global warming is increasingly shared by voters. That's a big difference from the 1970s, said Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat who has urged Obama to focus heavily on energy alternatives. "We weren't paying attention to climate policy the way we are now," Ritter said.LiNeBrEaKClimate change has become "part and parcel" of federal energy policy, said Andy Karsner, a former assistant energy secretary in the Bush administration who is now at the non-profit Council on Competitiveness. "You will see climate, as an issue, embedded in the ongoing energy debate," he said.LiNeBrEaKMany Republicans warn that the economic downturn could make any climate change legislation -- which analysts project would raise household costs -- a tough sell.LiNeBrEaKRep. John Shadegg (R-Ariz.), who sits on two key energy committees, cautioned Obama to focus on plans to increase efficiency and boost alternative fuels, which would combat warming and oil dependence. "We ought to be looking for strategies that give us a dual benefit," he said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say the opposite: that lower gas prices weaken the argument against a cap-and-trade plan for greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers and analysts agree that even with cheaper gasoline, cash-strapped Americans aren't likely to immediately splurge on SUVs or resume the driving habits they learned to curb over the summer. They also agree that prices aren't likely to stay low for long. Once the world economy speeds up, oil demand almost certainly will surge again.

"We will make decisions based on facts, and we understand that the facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, headlines a quartet of appointments that also includes former Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner as a coordinator of energy and climate policy; former New Jersey environmental protection commissioner Lisa Jackson as EPA administrator; and Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Nancy Sutley to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality. LiNeBrEaKWith this team, some environmentalists and former federal research scientists expect Obama's White House to break from what they view as the Bush administration's record of overlooking science in favor of politics.LiNeBrEaK"It's such an incredible contrast, compared to the years of darkness under the current administration, to see a scientist in such a position of authority and influence in the Cabinet," said Alan Nogee, who directs the Clean Energy Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has accused the administration of silencing and overruling scientists in policymaking. "It's night and day."LiNeBrEaKCritics -- including Nogee's organization and former EPA Administrator Christie Whitman -- have complained about the influence of industry lobbyists and ideologues on administration decision-making.LiNeBrEaKRep. Henry Waxman of California is among the Democrats who have repeatedly charged top Bush officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and political adviser Karl Rove, with pressing federal agencies to take positions that put them at odds with their own scientists on energy, global warming and stem cell research.LiNeBrEaKThe critics say many high-ranking scientists have fled federal jobs or have been forced from advisory panels in an effort to tilt agency decision-making to be more favorable to corporate interests.LiNeBrEaKIn 2001, Waxman issued a 40-page report accusing the administration of having "manipulated the scientific process and distorted or suppressed scientific findings." In 2004, 60 prominent scientists accused the administration of "misrepresenting and suppressing scientific knowledge for political purposes."LiNeBrEaKIn 2006 the top climate scientist at NASA, James Hansen, said the administration tried to gag him from speaking publicly after he gave an academic lecture calling for prompt reductions in greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, the Interior Department's inspector general issued a report detailing how one administrator intervened in at least 13 decisions under the Endangered Species Act. The official's "zeal to advance her agenda has caused considerable harm to the integrity" of the Endangered Species Act program, the inspector general wrote, "as well as potential harm to individual species. Her heavy-handedness has cast doubt on nearly every ESA decision issued during her tenure."LiNeBrEaKJeremy Symons, former climate policy adviser at the EPA, was so shaken after his service as EPA representative to Cheney's energy task force in 2001 that he left government service to become a vice president at the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaK"There was no interest in considering the scientific evidence of the impact our energy policy would have on the environment," Symons said in an interview Monday. "When science was brought up for discussion, it was dismissed as not important to developing the energy plan."LiNeBrEaKObama stressed the importance of energy and climate policy to the nation's economy and security on Monday -- though he declined, when asked by a reporter, to say when he plans to grant a waiver for California to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKChu, who won his Nobel Prize for developing methods to trap atoms with lasers, has oriented the Berkeley lab to focus on renewable energy and climate change. On Monday he stressed the Energy Department's role in supporting scientists, public and private, and innovations that he said "can transform the entire landscape of energy demand and supply."LiNeBrEaKHis appointment won wide praise across industries and party lines. Current Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said in a statement that Chu "understands the significance of our energy and environmental challenges, and more importantly, understands the technical solutions necessary to address them. ... I hold him in the highest regard."LiNeBrEaKBush administration officials have insisted they respect science and that the criticisms are largely from the left and constitute an unbalanced view that discounts the views and contributions of industry.LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.comLiNeBrEaKthamburger@tribune.com	ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (91%); NOBEL PRIZES (91%); AWARDS and PRIZES (91%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); RESEARCH (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); BIOLOGY (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (89%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); POLITICS (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); LOBBYING (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (75%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (73%); BIOTECHNOLOGY and GENETIC SCIENCE (69%); STEM CELL RESEARCH (68%); ENDANGERED SPECIES (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	Lifestyle  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); HENRY WAXMAN (54%); KARL ROVE (53%); DICK CHENEY (53%); STEVEN CHU (92%); CAROL BROWNER (57%); LISA P JACKSON (56%)  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (92%); LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) ILLINOIS, USA (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-TB-Obama-s-environment-choices-send-a-message-1216  	Newspaper  	TB  	2008 Chicago Tribune   				US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%); COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (56%); UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS (55%)  											
Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Science must evolve to tackle the challenges of warming, researchers say  	By Harvey Leifert for the Daily Climate  	BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; Environment; News; Local; Business  	344 words  	SAN FRANCISCO - As the science of climate change matures and the need to prepare for its consequences presses, scientists must change their focus to advise local and regional leaders on how best to adapt to a warmer future, senior climate researchers said Monday. LiNeBrEaK"We need to change the way we do our climate science," said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Environmental Studies Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson.LiNeBrEaK"Rather than being curiosity driven, we need to be end-user driven."LiNeBrEaKModeling is one example, added Jack Fellows, vice president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a consortium of more than 70 universities.LiNeBrEaKGlobal models used by scientists to forecast climate shifts lack the detail necessary for mayors and governors to prepare for local challenges, particularly the changing intensity, frequency, and location of storms, floods, and other natural events.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to need both global-scale models as well as regional-scale models to look at very specific processes that are happening in those regions," Fellows said.LiNeBrEaKThe two men spoke at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco, an annual gathering of around 17,000 scientists from around the globe.LiNeBrEaKThe need is urgent, Overpeck said, particularly given climate-induced changes already underway. The United States is drying out, with fewer days of rainfall in most regions as compared with decades past. And the Pacific Ocean could lap the streets of Sacramento, California's inland capital, if the sea rises two meters - a possible scenario for the coming century, he said.LiNeBrEaKBut changing the culture of science and politics will not be easy, Overpeck acknowledged.LiNeBrEaKScientists must accept that economic and cultural considerations will be part of the mix as policy-makers develop strategies to cope with climate change. Policy-makers must trust and have access to relevant scientific research results in a form they can use.LiNeBrEaKBoth sides, he added, must cooperate to "co-generate knowledge."LiNeBrEaKThis story originally appeared in www.dailyclimate.org .

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Obama taps Bay Area physicist Steven Chu to lead energy department  	By Lisa M. Krieger Mercury News  	EDUCATION; Science; News  	1023 words  	He won the Nobel Prize in physics, rose to leadership posts at Stanford and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was tapped Monday as President-elect Obama's Energy Secretary, but Steven Chu long considered himself the "academic black sheep'' of his family.LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants recalls spending his lunch money to build homemade rockets and fashioning a pole vault out of bamboo from the carpet store. But growing up on Long Island he thought he could never match his siblings' Ivy League academic achievements. LiNeBrEaKYet, there he was Monday, being lauded as a visionary leader who will push America's energy policy into a new era, promoting groundbreaking research into new clean technologies.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science,'' President-elect Barack Obama said at a news conference. "We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Sentate, Chu, 60, would be the first Nobel winner named to the post and the only DOE chief in recent memory to have run a major laboratory. He is expected to take the nation's energy policy into a sharply different direction, strengthening research into advanced biofuels, artificial photosynthesis and other solar energy research.LiNeBrEaKObama also on Monday announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, as chair of the White House Council on Environment Quality; and former Clinton EPA chief Carol Browner as head of a White House council on energy and climate. LiNeBrEaKThe nomination of Chu   who is married to former San Jose State physics professor Jean Chu   was applauded by his scientific colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Throughout his life, and at all points in his career, he goes after near-impossible goals, but with an appropriate sense of what is, and is not, attainable,'' said Stanford physics professor Steve Harris, who would talk physics with Chu while they mountain biked up to Skyline Drive.LiNeBrEaK"Obama has filled up the cabinet so far with folks who know how to navigate 'inside the Beltway' to get things done,'' said Stanford professor Stephen Schneider, who wrote the influential book on climate change, "Laboratory Earth.'' "That's fine. But they are not visionary thinkers. Steve Chu is. There will be real dialogue in cabinet meetings.''LiNeBrEaKChu's conviction that technology can solve energy problems appeals to some of those in the energy industry as well, although they urged him to be sensitive to the economic impact of his policies.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully he'll take the view that our industry has taken, that we need to use every drop of energy that we can bring to the supply side to ensure that we will continue to have affordable, abundant and reliable energy in a way that does not harm the economy or consumers,'' said Joe Sparano, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, the main oil industry trade group in California.LiNeBrEaK"He is not just sitting in an ivory tower anymore,'' cautioned Frank Maisano, a lobbyist and spokesman for coal-fired power plants. "He'll need to focus on the art of the possible ... and be realistic about the role that coal plays in providing power and jobs.''LiNeBrEaKChu's father, Ju Chin Chu, came to the United States in 1943 to continue his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering. Two years later, his mother, Ching Chen Li, joined him to study economics. When they married in 1945, China was in turmoil so they stayed in the United States.LiNeBrEaKChu grew up in Garden City, N.Y., where his father was a professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. There were only two other Chinese families in town. "But to our parents, the determining factor was the quality of the public school system,'' Chu wrote in an autobiography for the Nobel Foundation. "Education in my family was not merely emphasized, it was our raison d'&ecirc;tre.''LiNeBrEaKAs a young child, he loved building things. He started with plastic model airplanes and warships, then moved to devices "where the main design criteria was to maximize the number of moving parts and overall size,'' littering the living room with hundreds of nuts, bolts and metal girders.LiNeBrEaKThere were no tennis players in the family, so Chu taught himself to play by reading a book.LiNeBrEaKBut in a family of accomplished scholars, "my performance was decidedly mediocre. I approached the bulk of my schoolwork as a chore rather than an intellectual adventure.''LiNeBrEaKGeometry came to the rescue. "Instead of memorizing facts, we were asked to think in clear, logical steps. Beginning from a few intuitive postulates, far-reaching consequences could be derived, and I took immediately to the sport of proving theorems.'' He embraced advanced placement physics and calculus with the same passion. LiNeBrEaKWith an A-minus average, he was rejected by the Ivy League so enrolled at the University of Rochester. "At least nobody had heard of my brothers and cousins,'' who had earned a total of two MDs, four Ph.D.s and a law degree. "As I prepared to go to college, I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family.''LiNeBrEaKHis love affair with physics started with the textbook "The Feynman Lectures on Physics.'' He came to California for graduate school, working with UC-Berkeley's Eugene Commins, who shared Chu's thrill of fundamental physics. Chu's youthful construction skills came in handy. He recalled that one experiment needed a state-of-the-art laser. "I brashly told him not to worry; I would build it and we would be up and running in no time.''LiNeBrEaKFrom Berkeley, he joined Bell Labs, where his work in the field of laser cooling and trapping led to a deeper understanding of the interaction between light and matter   and the Nobel Prize in 1997.LiNeBrEaKHe ascended through the ranks, eventually becoming chairman of the physics department at Stanford and head of the electronics research laboratory at Bell Labs. Since 2004, he has been director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.LiNeBrEaKContact Lisa M. Krieger at lkrieger@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5565.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Home Final Edition	Family might get burned by solar panels  	Joe Blundo, The Columbus Dispatch  	FEATURES - LIFE and ARTS; SO TO SPEAK; Pg. 01D  	506 words  	Saving energy shouldn't take this much energy.LiNeBrEaKSean McGovern and his wife, Danielle Polemeni, have attracted lots of curiosity, a few complaints and a code-violation notice for putting solar panels in their front yard. LiNeBrEaK"We didn't want to pick a fight with anyone," said Polemeni, an English teacher at St. Francis DeSales High School.LiNeBrEaKThey got one anyway.LiNeBrEaKMcGovern works for a sustainable-agriculture organization and has a longtime interest in alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, their son, then 6, heard about global warming and asked why adults weren't doing something about it. LiNeBrEaKThe boy's question prompted the family to write down ways to solve the problem. The list still hangs on the refrigerator door.LiNeBrEaKAmong the suggestions: "Use solar power."LiNeBrEaKWith the help of a federal tax credit and a state grant, the family put that plan into action during the summer with a $16,000 array of solar panels that generate electricity from the sun.LiNeBrEaKAt times, the panels make enough power to spin their electric meter backward.LiNeBrEaKThe best spot for the panels is a sunny area of the front yard on Norris Drive on the North Side. LiNeBrEaKPutting panels on the roof, McGovern said, would have meant cutting down trees that shade the house, which doesn't have air conditioning.LiNeBrEaKBefore the installation, McGovern and Polemeni asked the opinion of a city zoning official, who said the panels didn't constitute a structure and therefore required no special permission.LiNeBrEaKBased on that advice, they went ahead. Within days, someone in the neighborhood had complained, and the homeowners had a violation notice from the city.LiNeBrEaKWhat happened? The city basically disagreed with itself. LiNeBrEaKThe zoning official who told the homeowners they didn't need a permit had one opinion.LiNeBrEaKThe code-enforcement officer who investigated the complaint had another. He thought the panels, 22 feet long by 38 inches high, constituted a structure.LiNeBrEaKMembers of the Board of Zoning Adjustment, which heard the homeowners' appeal in November, agreed. They said this was the first time they had seen such a solar array. (Usually, panels are on a roof.)LiNeBrEaK"This is certainly not the typical 8-foot-fence case," said Jim Maniace, board chairman.LiNeBrEaKNo one disputed that the city sent contradictory messages. Nevertheless, the appeal was denied, albeit sensitively.LiNeBrEaKBoard members said the homeowners would need a variance to keep their panels but held out hope that it would be granted.LiNeBrEaK"I don't have any problem voting for a variance for you, because of your unique circumstances," board member Jim Bubutiev said.LiNeBrEaKA variance would be nice. If the homeowners are forced to remove the panels (an added cost), they will have to forfeit the grant and the tax credit.LiNeBrEaK"This leaves our family with the prospect of spending the next five years paying off a $17,000 debt for a hole in the ground," McGovern said.LiNeBrEaKWorse yet, it provides the wrong answer to his son's question: Why aren't adults doing anything about global warming?LiNeBrEaKBecause it causes too much trouble when they try.LiNeBrEaKJoe Blundo is a Dispatch columnist.LiNeBrEaKjblundo@dispatch.com	SOLAR ENERGY (91%); ZONING (89%); HOMEOWNERS (88%); CITY GOVERNMENT (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (78%); TAXES and TAXATION (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); PRIMARY and SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (71%); BUILDING and HOUSING INSPECTIONS (70%); GRANTS and GIFTS (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (55%)  			COLUMBUS, OH, USA (59%) OHIO, USA (59%) UNITED STATES (59%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  			Photo, DORAL CHENOWETH III / DISPATCH , Danielle Polemeni and husband Sean McGovern in front of their $17,000 solar array, for which they are seeking a zoning variance  				COLUMN  								
Daily News (New York) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	BARACK PLEDGES 'SMART DECISIONS' TO FIX ECONOMY  	BY KENNETH R. BAZINET in Chicago and MICHAEL McAULIFF in Washington DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS With James Gordon Meek and Meredith Kolodner  	NEWS; Pg. 8  	329 words  	BARACK OBAMA says he can't predict when the economy will take a turn for the better, but he's promising he will make all the right moves. LiNeBrEaK"I don't have a crystal ball," the President-elect said yesterday as he unveiled the latest additions to his administration, headlined by the energy secretary.LiNeBrEaK"What I have control of is making the good, smart decisions that lead to long-term sustainable economic development and growth."LiNeBrEaKObama has pledged to add or save at least 2. 5 million jobs quickly by beefing up infrastructure projects and boosting expenditures in the green jobs sector.LiNeBrEaK"The yardstick should be, am I creating these jobs, and are we strengthening our economy?" Obama said after rolling out Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu to head the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaKMany saw the choice as proof Obama will make good on his promise to push hard for alternative energy and environmental jobs.LiNeBrEaKTo back that up, Obama tapped former Environmental Protection Agency head Carol Browner to a new White House job managing energy and climate-change policy.LiNeBrEaKFor his new EPA boss, he grabbed New Jersey's environment chief, Lisa Jackson.LiNeBrEaKAnd sources told the Daily News Obama is bypassing City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein for education secretary in favor of Chicago's Arne Duncan, a fellow Harvard grad and regular in Obama's basketball games. Klein issued a statement praising the choice. He said Duncan "has been one of the country's great school reformers."LiNeBrEaKObama will also name Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar as interior secretary, leaving just two cabinet jobs unfilled, as well as the marquee posts of national intelligence director and CIA boss.LiNeBrEaKThe President-elect has been moving at a brisk pace in hopes of signaling the economy and country will soon be in good hands.LiNeBrEaKHis inaugural committee announced he and Vice President-elect Joe Biden will head to their inauguration by train from Philadelphia in an echo of Abraham Lincoln's 1861 journey to Washington.LiNeBrEaKkbazinet@nydailynews.com	ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); JOB CREATION (76%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (76%); NOBEL PRIZES (76%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (76%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (76%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (75%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (73%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (72%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (72%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (71%); AWARDS and PRIZES (68%); CLIMATE CHANGE (67%); EDUCATION (65%); BASKETBALL (64%); INFRASTRUCTURE (56%); OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS (78%) ECONOMY; USA; DECISION; BARACK OBAMA  		BARACK OBAMA (96%); KEN SALAZAR (54%); JOE BIDEN (53%); ARNE DUNCAN (67%); STEVEN CHU (56%); CAROL BROWNER (55%); LISA P JACKSON (55%)  	NEW JERSEY, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 Daily News, L.P.

The Dallas Morning News (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Exxon Mobil plans $1 billion upgrade for Texas refinery, 2 others  	Elizabeth Souder, The Dallas Morning News  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	745 words  	Dec. 16--Exxon Mobil Corp. will announce $1 billion in upgrades to three refineries today, including the Baytown, Texas, facility, that will boost the company's total diesel capacity by 10 percent.LiNeBrEaKThe Irving-based oil giant will add equipment to its refineries in Baytown; Baton Rouge, La.; and Antwerp, Belgium, to meet federal requirements to cut sulfur content in diesel by 2010. Thanks to several years of record profit, Exxon can also invest to boost production, even during a recession.LiNeBrEaKThe investment positions Exxon to enjoy the wider diesel profit margins as demand rises. LiNeBrEaKSome observers think carbon dioxide regulations could push U.S. drivers to diesel because the fuel is more efficient than gasoline and therefore emits less greenhouse gas.LiNeBrEaK"This project is kind of robust under all scenarios, and frankly we don't know what those regulations will be, and therefore it's difficult to predict what impact that will have on our product demand," said Exxon vice president Sherman Glass, who is in charge of refining.LiNeBrEaKExxon's own diesel forecasts are conservative: Demand in the U.S. will rise 3 percent annually. The company won't cut its capacity to make gasoline at the three refineries, but it will reduce heating oil capacity,LiNeBrEaKMr. Glass said Exxon will still be able to adjust diesel vs. gasoline output, depending on which is more profitable.LiNeBrEaKRight now, U.S. refiners aren't making any money at all on gasoline.LiNeBrEaKLast week, crude oil cost $45. 60 a barrel on the spot market, according to data from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. Divide that by 42 gallons in a barrel, and oil cost $1. 09 a gallon.LiNeBrEaKCompare $1. 09 with wholesale gasoline prices: 95 cents a gallon along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Refiners lost money by making gasoline, while they made money on diesel, at $1. 45 a gallon wholesale on the Gulf Coast.LiNeBrEaKDemand for diesel has been up almost every month this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, while gasoline demand has dropped.LiNeBrEaKMr. Glass doesn't see U.S. drivers trading in their gasoline cars for diesel, unlike drivers in Europe, where half of the cars on the road use diesel. Trucks and trains are driving diesel demand here, he said.LiNeBrEaKOther refining executives are more optimistic about the payoff for diesel investments, particularly as the U.S. moves to a grade of diesel that's as clean as gasoline.LiNeBrEaKJeff Morris, chief executive of Dallas refining company Alon USA, is shifting several of his refineries to make more diesel than gasoline.LiNeBrEaKWhen the U.S. regulates carbon dioxide emissions, which many observers expect to see in the next few years, both gasoline and diesel are likely to become more expensive. Mr. Morris expects drivers to choose diesel, which is a more efficient fuel.LiNeBrEaK"Even though now the issue of greenhouse gases has gone to Page 2 or 3, not Page 1, ultimately it will come back," Mr. Morris said.LiNeBrEaK"I think they're right on track. I've always been impressed by Exxon's management, their strategies, their discipline, their thoughtfulness," he said.LiNeBrEaKTo upgrade the Baytown facility, the largest refinery in the country, 1,000 temporary construction workers will be needed, Mr. Glass said. This comes at a time when many companies are laying off tens of thousands of people.LiNeBrEaKExxon's strategy is to invest constantly, through the good times and the bad. And Exxon has had some very, very good times lately, as record high crude prices produced record high profit.LiNeBrEaKThe investment in Texas is welcome news for Colin Rowan, a marketer in Austin who's been pushing state lawmakers to embrace greenhouse gas regulations as an opportunity to create a new industry here.LiNeBrEaKDiesel is "one of the less exciting options we have," he said. Investments to boost vehicle mileage or to make electric cars might do more to cut greenhouse gas emissions, he said.LiNeBrEaKStill, he said, Exxon's plan "does demonstrate they're recognizing the inevitability of a new energy future."LiNeBrEaKExxon executives have long predicted that people will continue to rely mostly on hydrocarbons for transportation for decades.

The Denver Post 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	CLIMATE CHANGE Ski resorts face chilling vision: less snow, time  	Mark Jaffe The Denver Post  	A SECTION; Pg. A-01  	527 words  	As the global climate warms in the next two decades, the snowpack on Aspen Mountain will retreat about 650 feet up the slope and ski season will be trimmed by almost a week, a new study says. LiNeBrEaKOne way to fight that will be with snow guns, according to the study on the impact of and adaptation to climate change at two iconic ski resorts - Aspen and Park City, Utah.LiNeBrEaKAspen, the study calculates, may have to triple its snowmaking in the coming decades.LiNeBrEaK"This is just a way for ski resorts to stave off or delay the inevitable, hoping the world gets its act together," said Mark Williams, a study co-author and a geography professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder.LiNeBrEaKWilliams is scheduled to present the study findings today at an American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKThere have been broad studies on how a warming climate, because of rising carbon dioxide levels that trap heat in the atmosphere, will affect the ski industry and mountains.LiNeBrEaKThe increase in carbon dioxide is attributed to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and razing forests.LiNeBrEaKThe study by Williams and Brian Lazar, chief scientist at Boulder-LiNeBrEaKbased Stratus Consulting Inc., used climate data for the two resort mountains and six different computer climate models to look at the fate of the two mountains.LiNeBrEaK"In some ways the conversation about whether ski communities survive is a metaphor for the climate-change problem," said Auden Schendler, sustainability director for the Aspen Skiing Co.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is big. What happens on the mountain you can see," Schendler said.LiNeBrEaKAs the planet warms, Aspen Mountain's additional 1,200 feet helps it fare better than Park City's 10,000-foot peak, the study found.LiNeBrEaKIn 2030, if carbon dioxide continues to build at current rates, Aspen could lose four to five days at the end of its season and Park City as many as 10 days.LiNeBrEaK"Many ski resorts are operating in negative cash flow until March," Schendler said. "Shaving off days at the end of the season could cripple the ski industry."LiNeBrEaKIf the trend continues, by 2100 Aspen could lose up to 4 1/2 weeks and Park City could have no snow at all.LiNeBrEaKPossible actions to takeLiNeBrEaKTo combat the dwindling snow the study recommends several strategies including:LiNeBrEaKDeveloping, where possible, higher altitude and north face runs that will hold snow.LiNeBrEaKInvesting in gondolas and chairlifts that can quickly get skiers and snowboarders to the areas where there is snow.LiNeBrEaKObtaining additional water rights for snowmaking and more efficient water use resortwide.LiNeBrEaKSnowmaking is already a major tool in Europe where man-made snow accounts for 30 percent of the snow in French Alps and covers 70 percent of Italian ski terrain, according to the French Institute for Mountain Studies.LiNeBrEaKLast season 12 percent of the acreage at Rocky Mountain region resorts was covered by snowmaking, according to National Ski Areas Association.LiNeBrEaKFor lower elevations, however, snowmaking isn't the answer, said Krista Parry, a spokeswoman for Park City Resort.LiNeBrEaK"When you talk about a snow line at 9,800 feet and your highest elevation in 10,000 feet that isn't going to work," Parry said.LiNeBrEaKMark Jaffe: 303-954-1912 or mjaffe@denverpost.com	SKIING (92%); RESORTS (92%); SKIING FACILITIES (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); MOUNTAINS (90%); TRENDS (78%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (77%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (77%); SCIENCE NEWS (77%); PROPERTY LAW (74%); SNOWBOARDING (73%); MODELING and SIMULATION (73%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (72%); WATER RIGHTS (60%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (54%)  			UTAH, USA (92%); COLORADO, USA (79%); ALPS (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%); FRANCE (69%); EUROPE (50%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Denver Post All Rights Reserved  		ASPEN SKIING CO (66%)  		AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION (56%); UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (56%)  											
The Evening Sun (Hanover, Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Read Green: Discussion group focuses on environment  	Jess Krout, The Evening Sun, Hanover, Pa.  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	899 words  	Dec. 16--Going green seems to be all the rage, with totes and shirts sending out messages of "Plastic Schmastic" and "It's Easy Being Green."LiNeBrEaKBut Gettysburg College poses the question: How can one individual truly make a difference?LiNeBrEaKIt's aimed not only at its students, but also at area residents as the college plans to explore a series of books and documentary films on the topic. LiNeBrEaKThe series, called Read Green, is free and open to the public. It starts Feb. 3, giving students the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the books over winter break.LiNeBrEaKKerri Odess-Harnish, the college's reference and instruction librarian who is leading the series, said this is the first year for a reading program focusing on the environment.LiNeBrEaK"It seems timely," she said. "There is a lot of buzz around going green, but what does that mean globally, plus what can individuals do locally?"LiNeBrEaKHer goal with the series is to generate some discussion at a local level, of how area residents and college students can make a difference.LiNeBrEaKFaculty members plan to facilitate the book discussions, which starts with "Animal, Vegetable, Mineral," by Barbara Kingsolver. Kingsolver's book takes a look at sustainable foods and how one family vows to buy only food raised in their neighborhood or grown themselves.LiNeBrEaKOn March 3, the topic becomes global warming with "Field Notes from a Catastrophe," by Elizabeth Kolbert. In "Field Notes," Kolbert journals her discoveries from traveling to the Arctic, Alaska, Greenland and other locations to interview scientists and learn firsthand the effects of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Deep Economy," by Bill McKibben, will conclude the book discussions on April 6, focusing on the environmental impact of sustainable foods.LiNeBrEaKThen on April 16, McKibben will visit Gettysburg to discuss his book and lecture on a new approach to the things we buy, the foods we eat, the energy we use and the money that pays for it all.LiNeBrEaKIn between the discussions, documentary films "King Corn" and "The End of Suburbia" will be shown Feb. 19 and March 25, respectively.LiNeBrEaK"All of them sort of discuss different pieces of the idea of sustainability," Oddess-Harnish said. "I enjoyed reading them all and watching them all. They're all really interesting, very accessible."LiNeBrEaKThe books are available in the Adams County library system and at Gettysburg College's Musselman Library.LiNeBrEaKOdess-Harnish said several professors are using the books in their classes next semester, in departments including English, political science, education and environmental studies.LiNeBrEaKThe books were chosen from a list of recommendations from interested librarians, faculty, staff and community members.LiNeBrEaKThen, Odess-Harnish said she did a lot of reading, whittling the list to the final three books and two documentary films.LiNeBrEaKWhile Read Green is the first reading and discussion program to focus on environmental and sustainability issues, it is not the first community reading project.LiNeBrEaKOdess-Harnish said Gettysburg College has partnered with the Adams County library system in the past during "Adams County Reads One Book."LiNeBrEaKThe college has also sponsored a Jewish literature reading program.LiNeBrEaKFor more information on Read Green or to register for the book discussions, call (717) 337-6600 or visit the Musselman Library Web site at http://www.Gettysburg.edu/library.LiNeBrEaKIF YOU GO:LiNeBrEaK"Read Green," a reading and discussion program focused on environmental and sustainability issues, will start Feb. 3, at Gettysburg College. The book discussions will be facilitated by faculty and held at 7 p.m. in the college's Pennsylvania Hall, third floor lyceum. The documentary films will be shown in the college's Joseph Theater, Breidenbaugh Hall, at 7 p.m.LiNeBrEaKTuesday, Feb. 3: "Animal, Vegetable, Miracle," by Barbara Kingsolver. The discussion centers on sustainable foods and will be held in the college's Pennsylvania Hall, third floor lyceum, at 7 p.m.LiNeBrEaKThursday, Feb. 19: "King Corn," a documentary film about two college friends who decide to grown one acre of America's most-productive, most-subsidized grain. What they discover raises troubling questions about how Americans eat and farm.

Herald and Review (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Say it ain't snow: Some things about winter are inevitable, but forecasters do their best to predict  	Arlene Mannlein, Herald and Review, Decatur, Ill.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	582 words  	Dec. 16--DECATUR -- While it may not yet officially be winter, daily temperatures and the frozen precipitation that fell early Monday indicate it's pretty much here.LiNeBrEaKSo what do the official forecasters suggest about the coming months?LiNeBrEaKFirst of all, it's winter. So, yes, it's going to be cold. LiNeBrEaKSecond, snowfall will happen, probably a normal amount, which, according to the National Weather Service, usually is 25 to 30 inches annually.LiNeBrEaKThird, ice, maybe. That's more of an unknown. That kind of prediction isn't an easy one to make, said Dan Smith, Weather Service meteorologist in Lincoln.LiNeBrEaK"Ice is very critical to what the temperatures are going to be doing," he said, especially those just two or three days in advance of an ice event.LiNeBrEaKHowever, comparing two well-known weather prognosticators shows their overall winter predictions aren't far apart.LiNeBrEaKThe Old Farmer's Almanac's long-range weather forecast suggests a very cold period that started around Thanksgiving, with temperature seesawing through March.LiNeBrEaKThe Weather Service outlook indicates a December that began colder than normal, with the second half warming, Smith said.LiNeBrEaK"The coldest periods will occur in December, early and mid-January and in early and mid-February," predicts The Old Farmer's Almanac.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the Weather Service, there's between a 40 percent and 50 percent chance that temperatures will be above normal, said Llyle Barker, also a meteorologist based in Lincoln.LiNeBrEaK"Overall, the trend as far as the outlook is concerned is pretty close to where it should be," continued Smith. "There are equal chances for above- to below-normal temperatures."LiNeBrEaKJanice Stillman, editor of the almanac since 2000, said one thing to remember about almanac predictions is they are made 18 months in advance.LiNeBrEaK"(The prediction) doesn't reach the public until it's on the newsstands," she said, though almanac forecasts can be similar to Weather Service predictions. "The formula that we use to make the forecast is proprietary," Stillman said.LiNeBrEaKBut she revealed the basis upon which forecasting is made: solar science, the study of activity on the sun; climatology, the study of prevailing conditions for decades and centuries; and meteorology, the study of the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKAnd the almanac forecasting includes a prediction about global warming.LiNeBrEaK"In short, that global warming is over," Stillman said. "This is one way to distinguish us from the National Weather Service and others, as well."LiNeBrEaKShe explained the prediction is based on the sun not being a constant star, and one of the measures of that is the number of sunspots that occur.LiNeBrEaK"(The year) 2008 has been a period of few sunspots. We've been in a quiet period," she said.LiNeBrEaK"Historically, that indicates a cool period to follow, not necessarily this winter, but perhaps in the ensuing period."LiNeBrEaKThere is, however, one qualification in this prediction: greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"What we cannot predict is greenhouse gases, because they are not on record," Stillman said.LiNeBrEaKAnd, she added, the unknown is how greenhouse gases may offset solar activity.LiNeBrEaKamannlein@herald-review.com|421-6976	WEATHER (90%); METEOROLOGY (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (89%)  	Environment/Recycling/Waste  		ILLINOIS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-HV-Say-it-ain-t-snow-Some-things-about-winter-are-inevitable-but-forecasters-do-their-best-to-predict-1216  	Newspaper  	HV  	2008 Herald and Review   															
The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	French diplomat says U.S. at turning point on climate: Obama sent Europe 'strong signals' on carbon dioxide, negotiator says  	Eric Berger, Houston Chronicle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	566 words  	Dec. 16--During a visit to Houston on Monday, France's chief climate change negotiator said Europe has been energized by Barack Obama's election, and by the broad outlines of his policies to curb global warming.LiNeBrEaKBrice Lalonde, the French ambassador for climate change, said Obama has already sent a "strong signal" to European counties that he will match their pledge of an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050. LiNeBrEaK"This is very important for us all, and probably a turning point for the United States on climate," Lalonde said. "We are so happy now that we're going to work together. We need your leadership, ingenuity and entrepreneurship."LiNeBrEaKAlthough Lalonde didn't directly criticize President Bush, Europeans have criticized him for dragging his feet on climate negotiations.LiNeBrEaKHe was in Houston to attend a Rice University conference titled, "Emerging U.S. Climate Policy: Transatlantic Approaches and Market Harmonization." During an interview afterward, Lalonde said Europe is anxiously awaiting American action on climate because it will determine the nature of the next international treaty.LiNeBrEaKThat much was clear, he said, during an international climate meeting earlier this month in Poznan, Poland, where negotiators laid the foundation for another meeting late next year, in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they're expected to draft a successor climate treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKLalonde, France's chief negotiator at the meeting, said many participants in the Poznan meeting were eager to see America draft its own climate policy before that meeting, with Congressional approval, so that America supports the new international pact.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto agreement in 2001.LiNeBrEaK"It is important for us to engage, and discuss, so that we can try and find a way to have the international agreement in phase with your own efforts," Lalonde said.LiNeBrEaKUnderstanding AmericaLiNeBrEaKThe French ambassador also said residents of his country have a difficult time understanding the attitude in America, where a significant portion of the country rejects the notion that human activities are warming the planet.LiNeBrEaK"It seems incredible to us," he said. "But it's important for me to understand the problems and differences with this country. The United States is a big country. There are long distances. A lot of your major cities were designed when energy was cheap, while our cities were designed for pedestrians."LiNeBrEaKEven so, he said, there's still time for America to be part of the solution to global warming, including the oil and gas industry based in Houston.LiNeBrEaK"It's time for the oil industry to understand that it has to leave a legacy to the world, which is to invest in other sources of energy. Each generation has to do something for the next," he said.LiNeBrEaK"The oil industry is one of the most powerful industries in the world, and it can invest, show by way, by inventing new technologies and become an energy provider, not an oil provider."LiNeBrEaKeric.berger@chron.com	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); TALKS and MEETINGS (89%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (89%); EMBASSIES and CONSULATES (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (87%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); EMISSIONS (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (75%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (73%); INTERVIEWS (73%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (69%); APPROVALS (65%)  	General  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); GEORGE W BUSH (70%)  	HOUSTON, TX, USA (94%); COPENHAGEN, DENMARK (79%) TEXAS, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (98%); EUROPE (94%); FRANCE (94%); POLAND (79%); DENMARK (79%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-HO-French-diplomat-says-U-S-at-turning-point-on-climate-1216  	Newspaper  	HO  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   				RICE UNIVERSITY (56%)  											
The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Obama picks tough environmentalists: Some in Houston fear they will seek changes that will cost area industry  	Matthew Tresaugue, Houston Chronicle  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	620 words  	Dec. 16--To Houston's smog fighters, President-elect Barack Obama's new environmental team is like a breath of fresh air.LiNeBrEaKBut industry groups and others fear that the new appointees would seek unnecessarily expensive changes for coal-fired utilities, petrochemical plants and refineries during a worldwide financial meltdown.LiNeBrEaKWith Monday's selection of Lisa Jackson to the top Environmental Protection Agency post and Carol Browner to lead a White House council on energy and climate, Obama put two experienced regulators in charge of cleaning the nation's air, land and water. LiNeBrEaKJackson previously led the environmental agency in heavily industrialized New Jersey, while Browner pushed through tough rules for air pollution over intense opposition as President Bill Clinton's EPA chief.LiNeBrEaKJim Marston, director of the Environmental Defense Fund's Texas office, said he expects the new team to look closely at ozone, the key ingredient in smog, and other toxic chemicals in the air. He also said they may question whether the state's pollution-cutting strategies are strong enough to protect the public.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration was kind of hands-off," Marston said. "I anticipate that this administration will take a different stance."LiNeBrEaKMatthew Tejada, executive director of the Galveston-Houston Association for Smog Prevention, agreed, saying the appointees would place greater emphasis on science in policymaking than their immediate predecessors.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the EPA in March reduced the amounts of allowable ground-level ozone after many scientists had concluded that the current standard, set in 1997, was no longer considered to be safe. The new limit, however, is not as stringent as the agency's science advisers recommended.LiNeBrEaKThe new limit is 75 parts per billion, or 75 molecules of ozone out of every billion molecules of air, compared with the previous 84 ppb. But scientists said the threshold should be as low as 60 ppb and no more than 70 ppb to protect millions of people, particularly the elderly and young children.LiNeBrEaKThe decision means Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, among other communities nationwide, will need to do more to cut emissions that cause ozone.LiNeBrEaK"If we followed the science from the beginning, we would have had a stronger ozone standard," Tejada said.LiNeBrEaKThe new team, which also includes Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary, is expected to deal with emissions of heat-trapping gasses that contribute to climate change. Gov. Rick Perry, for one, has raised concerns that federal regulation of carbon-dioxide emissions would be disastrous for Texas.LiNeBrEaKElena Marks, director of health and environmental policy for Mayor Bill White, said Obama's picks reflect "an understanding that pollution control isn't inconsistent with profitability. You don't have jobs or health."LiNeBrEaKMarks said she expects the new administration to listen to the city's concerns about air toxics, and the carcinogen benzene in particular. In July, the city challenged the EPA's methods for calculating emissions from large refineries and chemical plants, saying the amounts are underreported. The agency has yet to respond to the city.LiNeBrEaK"We're hoping for a good response," she said, noting that New Jersey has tougher regulations for air toxics, including benzene, than Texas.LiNeBrEaKmatthew.tresaugue@chron.com	SMOG (92%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (91%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); AIR POLLUTION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (86%); SCIENCE NEWS (86%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); AIR QUALITY (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (77%); PETROCHEMICALS (77%); CITY GOVERNMENT (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (76%); CLIMATOLOGY (75%); SCIENCE POLICY (72%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (72%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (72%); CHILDREN (71%); NOBEL PRIZES (64%); AWARDS and PRIZES (60%); PETROCHEMICAL MFG (57%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (54%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (90%)  	Lifestyle  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); BILL CLINTON (56%); RICK PERRY (51%); LISA P JACKSON (72%); CAROL BROWNER (72%); STEVEN CHU (51%)  	HOUSTON, TX, USA (91%); DALLAS, TX, USA (71%) TEXAS, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-HO-Obama-picks-tough-environmentalists-1216  	Newspaper  	HO  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   				US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE (56%)  											
The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	BRIEF: BP's U.S. chief says Salazar is a "good pick" for Interior  	David Ivanovich, Houston Chronicle  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	258 words  	Dec. 16--WASHINGTON -- BP America President Robert Malone today welcomed news that President-elect Barack Obama intends to nominate Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., to serve as the nation's next Interior secretary. LiNeBrEaKMalone said he has always found Salazar open-minded and "very direct."LiNeBrEaK"Right now, I'd say, 'Good pick,' " Malone said.LiNeBrEaKAs head of the Interior Department, Salazar would oversee the U.S. Minerals Management Service and the Bureau of Land Management, which supervise oil and gas production in federal lands and waters. Obama is expected to announce the selection later in the week, a senior Democrat told the Chronicle Monday.LiNeBrEaKA rancher who has drawn praise from environmentalists, Salazar pushed through a short-lived moratorium that barred commercial leasing of federal lands for oil shale production in the Rocky Mountain West.LiNeBrEaKBP is eager for the new administration to provide clarity on issues including the mechanism that will be used to combat climate change, how the nation will promote development of renewable energy sources and what access oil and gas producers will be granted on federal lands.LiNeBrEaKdavid.ivanovich@chron.com	OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); CRUDE OIL and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (78%); LAND USE PLANNING (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (76%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (70%); OIL EXTRACTION (70%); CLIMATE CHANGE (70%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (69%); US PRESIDENTS (90%)  	NAICS447110 GASOLINE STATIONS WITH CONVENIENCE STORES (92%); NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES (92%); NAICS211111 CRUDE PETROLEUM and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (92%) General  	KEN SALAZAR (95%); BARACK OBAMA (92%)  	COLORADO, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-HO-BRF-BP-s-U-S-chief-says-Salazar-is-a-good-pick-for-Interior-1216  	Newspaper  	HO  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   	BPLC (PAR) (92%); BP (NYSE) (92%); BP (LSE) (92%)  	BP PLC (92%); BP AMERICA INC (90%); MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (67%)  		MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (57%); BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (57%)  											
The Houston Chronicle 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	ANOTHER VOICE;  St. Louis Post Dispatch;  The case for a higher federal gas tax	St. Louis Post Dispatch  	B; Pg. 8  	539 words  	Consumers are enjoying the lowest retail gasoline prices in years, a welcome ray of light in an ever-darkening economic picture.LiNeBrEaKThat's good news for financially strapped American families and for the auto industry, which has struggled to produce the high-mileage vehicles consumers wanted when gas prices spiked at more than $4 a gallon over the summer. LiNeBrEaKBut in the long run low gasoline prices hurt America more than they help. They encourage continued reliance on gas-powered vehicles and harm the efforts to lower carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. They discourage research into new, nonpolluting transportation energy sources - the single greatest technological challenge of the 21st century.LiNeBrEaKConsider what happened during the early 1980s, when gas prices soared to the then-unheard-of price of $1. 38 a gallon. It triggered a surge of research into alternative energy sources such as solar power and electric vehicles. But as soon as prices began to drop, as they did in 1982, so did the rush of investment and research into alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKAdjusted for inflation, that previous average high gas price of $1. 38 was the equivalent of $3. 14 a gallon. We didn't see average retail prices that high again until this year.LiNeBrEaKBut when gas prices and investment in alternative energy fell in this country in the 1980s, they didn't drop everywhere. In Europe and in Japan, high gasoline taxes kept fuel prices relatively high. That encouraged conservation and provided investors with greater confidence that the money they pumped into developing new technologies would earn an acceptable return.LiNeBrEaKThe result was that Japanese car companies were the first to market new hybrid cars, and European companies led the way in producing new, cleaner diesel vehicles. American car companies, meanwhile, kept churning out large SUVs.LiNeBrEaKAfter years of failed attempts to increase mileage requirements for new cars - efforts steadfastly opposed by American auto manufacturers and their unions, Congress finally succeeded last year. As a result, U.S. cars must average 35 miles per gallon by 2020. European cars, in contrast, averaged 38 miles per gallon in 2006.LiNeBrEaKIf increasing mileage standards has been difficult, hiking gas taxes has been unthinkable. Although the idea is floated occasionally (most incongruously by then-Rep. Dick Cheney in the 1980s, who supported a plan to tax imported oil), it never has received a serious airing. It should.LiNeBrEaKThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in 2004 that increasing the federal gasoline tax - which has been 18. 4 cents a gallon since 1993 - would reduce consumption faster and at less cost than increasing mileage standards. That would help undercut the financial strength of such countries as Iran and Russia that, armed with a surplus of petrodollars, have been unfriendly to American interests. And combined with other tax incentives, it would encourage U.S. investment in energy alternatives.LiNeBrEaKThe nation that succeeds in developing and deploying new, green technologies will have a major economic advantage in the decades to come. It's crucial that the United States be that nation. Congress should raise the federal gas tax and push America toward innovation and energy independence.

The Houston Chronicle 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	French diplomat says U.S. at turning point on climate;  Obama sent Europe `strong signals' on carbon dioxide, negotiator says 	ERIC BERGER, Staff  	B; Pg. 2  	491 words  	During a visit to Houston on Monday, France's chief climate change negotiator said Europe has been energized by Barack Obama's election, and by the broad outlines of his policies to curb global warming. LiNeBrEaKBrice Lalonde, the French ambassador for climate change, said Obama has already sent a "strong signal" to European counties that he will match their pledge of an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050.LiNeBrEaK"This is very important for us all, and probably a turning point for the United States on climate," Lalonde said. "We are so happy now that we're going to work together. We need your leadership, ingenuity and entrepreneurship."LiNeBrEaKAlthough Lalonde didn't directly criticize President Bush, Europeans have criticized him for dragging his feet on climate negotiations.LiNeBrEaKHe was in Houston to attend a Rice University conference titled, "Emerging U.S. Climate Policy: Transatlantic Approaches and Market Harmonization." During an interview afterward, Lalonde said Europe is anxiously awaiting American action on climate because it will determine the nature of the next international treaty.LiNeBrEaKThat much was clear, he said, during an international climate meeting earlier this month in Poznan, Poland, where negotiators laid the foundation for another meeting late next year, in Copenhagen, Denmark, where they're expected to draft a successor climate treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKLalonde, France's chief negotiator at the meeting, said many participants in the Poznan meeting were eager to see America draft its own climate policy before that meeting, with Congressional approval, so that America supports the new international pact.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto agreement in 2001.LiNeBrEaK"It is important for us to engage, and discuss, so that we can try and find a way to have the international agreement in phase with your own efforts," Lalonde said.LiNeBrEaKUnderstanding AmericaLiNeBrEaKThe French ambassador also said residents of his country have a difficult time understanding the attitude in America, where a significant portion of the country rejects the notion that human activities are warming the planet.LiNeBrEaK"It seems incredible to us," he said. "But it's important for me to understand the problems and differences with this country. The United States is a big country. There are long distances. A lot of your major cities were designed when energy was cheap, while our cities were designed for pedestrians."LiNeBrEaKEven so, he said, there's still time for America to be part of the solution to global warming, including the oil and gas industry based in Houston.LiNeBrEaK"It's time for the oil industry to understand that it has to leave a legacy to the world, which is to invest in other sources of energy. Each generation has to do something for the next," he said.LiNeBrEaK"The oil industry is one of the most powerful industries in the world, and it can invest, show by way, by inventing new technologies and become an energy provider, not an oil provider."

The Houston Chronicle 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Obama picks tough environmentalists;  Some in Houston fear they will seek changes that will cost area industry 	MATTHEW TRESAUGUE, Staff  	A; Pg. 5  	570 words  	To Houston's smog fighters, President-elect Barack Obama's new environmental team is like a breath of fresh air.LiNeBrEaKBut industry groups and others fear that the new appointees would seek unnecessarily expensive changes for coal-fired utilities, petrochemical plants and refineries during a worldwide financial meltdown. LiNeBrEaKWith Monday's selection of Lisa Jackson to the top Environmental Protection Agency post and Carol Browner to lead a White House council on energy and climate, Obama put two experienced regulators in charge of cleaning the nation's air, land and water.LiNeBrEaKJackson previously led the environmental agency in heavily industrialized New Jersey, while Browner pushed through tough rules for air pollution over intense opposition as President Bill Clinton's EPA chief.LiNeBrEaKJim Marston, director of the Environmental Defense Fund's Texas office, said he expects the new team to look closely at ozone, the key ingredient in smog, and other toxic chemicals in the air. He also said they may question whether the state's pollution-cutting strategies are strong enough to protect the public.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration was kind of hands-off," Marston said. "I anticipate that this administration will take a different stance."LiNeBrEaKMatthew Tejada, executive director of the Galveston-Houston Association for Smog Prevention, agreed, saying the appointees would place greater emphasis on science in policymaking than their immediate predecessors.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the EPA in March reduced the amounts of allowable ground-level ozone after many scientists had concluded that the current standard, set in 1997, was no longer considered to be safe. The new limit, however, is not as stringent as the agency's science advisers recommended.LiNeBrEaKThe new limit is 75 parts per billion, or 75 molecules of ozone out of every billion molecules of air, compared with the previous 84 ppb. But scientists said the threshold should be as low as 60 ppb and no more than 70 ppb to protect millions of people, particularly the elderly and young children.LiNeBrEaKThe decision means Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, among other communities nationwide, will need to do more to cut emissions that cause ozone.LiNeBrEaK"If we followed the science from the beginning, we would have had a stronger ozone standard," Tejada said.LiNeBrEaKThe new team, which also includes Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary, is expected to deal with emissions of heat-trapping gasses that contribute to climate change. Gov. Rick Perry, for one, has raised concerns that federal regulation of carbon-dioxide emissions would be disastrous for Texas.LiNeBrEaKElena Marks, director of health and environmental policy for Mayor Bill White, said Obama's picks reflect "an understanding that pollution control isn't inconsistent with profitability. You don't have jobs or health."LiNeBrEaKMarks said she expects the new administration to listen to the city's concerns about air toxics, and the carcinogen benzene in particular. In July, the city challenged the EPA's methods for calculating emissions from large refineries and chemical plants, saying the amounts are underreported. The agency has yet to respond to the city.LiNeBrEaK"We're hoping for a good response," she said, noting that New Jersey has tougher regulations for air toxics, including benzene, than Texas.LiNeBrEaKFrance's chief climate-change negotiator says Europe is encouraged by the broad outlines of Obama's policies to curb global warming.

The Houston Chronicle 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	THE OBAMA TRANSITION;  Nobelist a novel pick for energy;  Chu brings colorful science background and work on climate change to post	DAVID IVANOVICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU, STAFF  	A; Pg. 1  	867 words  	WASHINGTON - Back in high school, Steven Chu constructed a pendulum to measure gravity. He later developed a method to trap atoms with laser light, which earned him a share of the Nobel Prize in physics. And as head of one of the U.S. national laboratories, he encouraged work on climate change and renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, President-elect Barack Obama formally announced he would nominate this 60-year-old scientist to become the nation's next energy secretary. LiNeBrEaKChu's appointment, Obama said in a Chicago news conference, will send "a signal to all that my administration will value science."LiNeBrEaKObama went public with his plans for Chu as he rolled out his energy and environment team, which also includes former New Jersey environmental regulator Lisa Jackson to lead the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Los Angeles' energy and environmental head Nancy Sutley to run the Council for Environmental Quality and former EPA Administrator Carol Browner to serve as an overall energy ``czar."LiNeBrEaKLater this week, Obama is expected to name the last key member of that team - Democratic Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado for Interior Secretary, a senior Democrat said.LiNeBrEaKChu, as director of the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, has been on "the cutting edge of our nation's efforts to develop new and cleaner forms of energy," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKEnergy a priorityLiNeBrEaKChu acknowledged that many believe the new administration's first priority must be to help the troubled economy, but noted energy is a priority as well. "We must repair the economy and put us on a path forward toward sustainable energy," he said.LiNeBrEaKChu has said "the greatest challenge facing science" is climate change and finding renewable energy sources that won't exacerbate global warming.LiNeBrEaKAnd in the highly partisan world of energy politics, Chu, as a scientist, might have credibility that a political figure wouldn't, said former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.LiNeBrEaK"People have lost confidence in what political figures are saying about energy," Abraham said. "They may pay more attention to the views of a scholar and Nobel winner when he gets up says `We need to do A, B and C.' "LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants, Chu was born in St. Louis and grew up in Garden City, N.Y., near Brooklyn Polytechnic, where his father taught.LiNeBrEaK"There were only two other Chinese families in this town of 25,000," Chu wrote in an autobiography posted on the Nobel Prize Web site. But his parents liked the school system.LiNeBrEaKAs a child, he built homemade rockets, taught himself how to play tennis by reading a book and learned to pole vault using bamboo poles obtained from a local carpet store.LiNeBrEaKHis high school pendulum project paid dividends 25 years later. "I was to develop a refined version of this measurement using laser cooled atoms in an atomic fountain interferometer," Chu wrote.LiNeBrEaKRejected by the Ivy League schools for what he called his "lackluster A-" average in high school, Chu attended the University of Rochester. There he was exposed to Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman's writings, which Chu found "mesmerizing and inspirational."LiNeBrEaKChu earned degrees in physics and mathematics. He then earned a doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley.LiNeBrEaKIn 1978, Chu joined Bell Laboratories, where in his first annual review he was told "not to be content with anything less than `starting a new field.' "LiNeBrEaKIn 1983, he became head of the Quantum Electronics Research Department in Holmdel, N.J. Chu then began work on a method to trap atoms with laser light. "I began to realize the way to hold on to atoms with light was to first get them very cold," Chu said.LiNeBrEaKIn 1997, he shared the Nobel Prize in recognition of that work. It led to more accurate atomic clocks, among other applications.LiNeBrEaKChu left Bell Laboratories to teach at Stanford University. And four years ago, he was pegged to run the Berkeley Lab.LiNeBrEaKWorld leaderLiNeBrEaKChu's goal there has been to make the lab a world leader in alternative and renewable energy research, particularly with the development of carbon-neutral energy sources. Chu brought in fellow scientist William Collins to head the lab's climate sciences department.LiNeBrEaKCollins' team has been focused on creating climate models that would give scientists insights on the ramifications of an abrupt change in climate - a breakup of Antarctic ice, say, or changes in vegetation at higher altitudes.LiNeBrEaKAs the nation develops new renewable energy sources, Collins said, scientists at the lab want to understand what the climate ramifications of those new fuels might be.LiNeBrEaK"We really believe that climate and energy are inextricably linked, and we think that advances in our methods of energy production will lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and help improve our climate," Collins said.LiNeBrEaKChu would oversee a department with a budget of more than $23 billion and more than 100,000 employees and contractors. His nomination requires Senate confirmation.LiNeBrEaKGlenn English, president of the Arlington, Va.-based National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, said the Chu nomination indicates Obama is serious about dealing with climate change.LiNeBrEaKGREEN TEAMLiNeBrEaKChoices may be a blow to Houston industry.

Khaleej Times (Dubai, United Arab Emirates)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Future Energy Needs Justify UAE Nuclear Deal with US  	Khaleej Times, Dubai, United Arab Emirates  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	638 words  	Dec. 16--ABU DHABI -The proposed agreement between the UAE and the US on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is expected to go a long way in fulfilling the future energy requirements of the emirates.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Hamad Ali Al Ka'abi, who is the permanent representative of the UAE at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), recent studies have indicated that the increasing demand for electricity in the emirates is fast outstripping the growth in supply. LiNeBrEaKTotal electricity demand in the UAE is expected to rise from approximately 15,000 mw now to 42,000 mw by 2020.LiNeBrEaKSeveral experts have also warned about an impending crisis in power supply elsewhere also in the light of growing global demand for fossil-fuel energy, particularly in supplying power for seawater desalination. They have argued that the possibility of fuel depletion and increasing rate of development in the GCC countries have made exploration of alternative sources of energy an urgent priority.LiNeBrEaKNuclear energy is being pushed by many experts as one of the important alternative sources of energy in this context.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Al Ka'abbi, the UAE has concluded that peaceful nuclear power generation represents an environmentally promising and commercially competitive option which could make a significant contribution to the country's economy and future energy security.LiNeBrEaKBroad Contours of the PolicyLiNeBrEaKAt a recent seminar on the 'Nuclear energy in the Gulf', he had said that the UAE government has prepared the broad contours of the policy on the establishment of a peaceful civilian nuclear power programme in the country.LiNeBrEaKThe core principles of the policy include complete operational transparency and highest standards of non-proliferation, safety and security. The policy also envisaged direct working with the IAEA and conforming with its standards in evaluating and potentially developing a peaceful nuclear energy programme. The UAE will approach any domestic nuclear power programme in a manner that ensures long-term sustainability.LiNeBrEaKAs per the policy, the UAE hopes to develop any nuclear power capability in partnership with governments and firms of responsible nations, and appropriate non-governmental organisations.LiNeBrEaKAnd it is this aspect of the nuclear policy that seems to have provided the context for the UAE to strive to work out a nuclear deal with the US.LiNeBrEaKThe nuclear industry had been in a dormant state in several parts of the globe after the Chernobyl accident and other similar setbacks in countries. But of late, there were reports of a 'nuclear renaissance' from countries like the US and UK, apparently after the development of new designs of reactors.LiNeBrEaKNew DesignsLiNeBrEaKThese new designs are supposed to be safer than the earlier ones. The fears of carbon dioxide emission and the global warming are other factors that gave increased acceptance to the nuclear energy initiatives, which do not pose any carbon emission threats.LiNeBrEaKHowever, there are also many sceptical experts who point out that the new designs are yet to be tested properly.LiNeBrEaKCost is another factor they hold against the nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaKThey also suggest the nuclear renaissance may not take place after all in the US and UK in the wake of the financial crisis.LiNeBrEaKAccording to them, it would be wise for the UAE to wait for sometime before making any firm commitment on the purchase of nuclear power plants.&acirc;[#x20ac]&uml;-ramavarman@khaleejtimes.com	ENERGY DEMAND (91%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (91%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (90%); ARMS CONTROL and DISARMAMENT (90%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (90%); EMISSIONS (89%); NUCLEAR SCIENCE (78%); INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS (78%); CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER (78%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (76%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); ALLIANCES and PARTNERSHIPS (66%)  	Disasters  		ABU DHABI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (90%) DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (92%) UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (97%); UNITED STATES (94%); GULF STATES (79%); UKRAINE (69%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-KJ-Future-Energy-Needs-Justify-UAE-Nuclear-Deal-with-US-1216  	Newspaper  	KJ  	2008    				INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (57%)  											
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	NASA reports 2008 is ninth warmest year since 1880  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	466 words  	WASHINGTON _ The year 2008 was the ninth warmest year since instrumental temperature measurements began in 1880, and all of the nine warmest years have occurred in the past 11 years, NASA reported on Tuesday. LiNeBrEaKThe new data from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies and other government agencies adds to the evidence that scientists have been observing about a warming Earth as burning fossil fuels emits heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKNASA also reported that the January to November global temperature was 0. 76 degrees Fahrenheit above the average for the 20th Century, and that the past year was cooler than any since 2000. Scientists note that global warming is a steady trend, but within it there are natural variations.LiNeBrEaKThe NASA report noted that "Eurasia, the Arctic and the Antarctic Peninsula were exceptionally warm, while much of the Pacific Ocean was cooler than the long-term average." It said the relatively cooler temperature in the tropical Pacific was due to a La Nina, the cool phase of a natural temperature variation.LiNeBrEaKBritain's Met Office on Tuesday also said that La Nina was part of the reason 2008 was slightly cooler than earlier years this decade. By Britain's accounting, 2008 was the 10th warmest year on record dating back to 1850, and all 10 of the warmest years occurred since 1997.LiNeBrEaK"Human influence, particularly emission of greenhouse gases, has greatly increased the chance of having such warm years," said Peter Stott of the Met Office in a statement Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe Met Office also reported that global temperatures from 2000 to 2008 are nearly 0. 36 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average for 1990 to 1999.LiNeBrEaKThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday summarized these and other trends, including:LiNeBrEaK_The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was the third costliest, after 2005 and 2004.LiNeBrEaK_The U.S. had nearly 1,700 tornadoes from January through November, which ranks second behind 2004 for the most tornadoes in a year since records began in 1953.LiNeBrEaK_Arctic sea ice in 2008 reached its second lowest level at the end of the melting season in September, following a record low in 2007. In 2008, the ice shrank to 1. 74 million square miles, which was 0. 86 million square miles below the average annual minimum from 1979 to 2000.LiNeBrEaKSea ice loss is important because ice reflects most of the sun's radiation, but open ocean water absorbs most of it, adding to the warming trend both in the ocean and on land.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Nobel winner gets Energy nod  	Steve Tetreault  	A; Pg. 5A  	895 words  	STEPHENS WASHINGTON BUREAULiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate and one of the nation's leading science advocates for combating global warming and promoting renewable energy, was announced Monday as President-elect Barack Obama's choice to lead the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKChu, 60, is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where since 2004 he has focused the California institution on research into biofuels, energy efficiency and conservation, solar energy and other strategies to address climate change. LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect formally announced the appointment at a news conference in Chicago where he also introduced his picks to fill other key energy and environmental posts in his administration.LiNeBrEaKObama said his choice of Chu "should send a signal to all that my administration will value science. We will make decisions based on facts, and we understand the facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKBut some lawmakers privately question Chu's lack of political experience to convert forward-thinking into legislation that can pass Congress and politics that can win support among bureaucrats.LiNeBrEaKChu shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for developing methods to cool and trap atoms using lasers.LiNeBrEaKChu is also a professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and former head of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKHe appeared in Las Vegas in August, where he spoke at the National Clean Energy Summit. He told the audience at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas that government research funds could help reduce the cost of solar cells and help create synthetic yeast to make diesel and jet fuel replacements from biomass.LiNeBrEaKIn other speeches he has declared that coal "is my worst nightmare," and he was not optimistic that light pollution "clean coal" can be perfected.LiNeBrEaKLess is known about Chu's views on the Yucca Mountain Project, one of the major programs managed by DOE and one that Obama criticized during the presidential campaign.LiNeBrEaKLynn Yarris, acting head of communications at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said he did not know whether Chu has ever taken a public position on the nuclear waste repository that DOE is trying to build at Yucca Mountain, 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.LiNeBrEaKAlong with several other major government science installations, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has participated in Yucca Mountain studies.LiNeBrEaKProject spokesman Allen Benson said the lab has been associated with Yucca about 20 years, performing investigations on how water travels through the ridge where nuclear waste would be stored.LiNeBrEaKBenson said "about three" lab employees still work on the project, not necessarily full time, with a current budget of about $1 million a year.LiNeBrEaKIn a 2005 interview posted on a University of California, Berkeley Web site, Chu said nuclear power "absolutely" should be made a bigger part of the nation's energy mix, where it now supplies 20 percent of electricity.LiNeBrEaKChu also has said he supports recycling spent nuclear fuel to reduce its volumes and the toxic lifetimes of its elements.LiNeBrEaKHe pointed out that nuclear fuel stored within canisters is supposed to remain contained within Yucca Mountain for 10,000 years. "But the current best estimates - and these are really estimates, the lab's in fact - is that the metal casings will probably fail on a scale of 5,000 years, plus or minus 2," he said.LiNeBrEaK"That's still a long time," Chu said. Dense rock is supposed to further retard the escape of radionuclides, "so that by the time it finally leaks down to the water table and gets out, the radioactivity will have mostly decayed," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn one possible clue to Chu's stance on Yucca Mountain, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he supported the nominee, and looked forward to confirming Dr. Chu as quickly as possible.LiNeBrEaKReid aides said the senator spoke with Chu last week about "Yucca, climate change and the need to create jobs by developing renewable energy."LiNeBrEaK"I am confident that Dr. Chu will transform the Department of Energy into a smart and progressive weapon against our addiction to oil, making our economy vastly more energy efficient and bringing about a safer future," Reid said. "Dr. Chu also knows, like most Nevadans, that Yucca Mountain is not a viable solution for dumping and dealing with nuclear waste."LiNeBrEaKSen. John Ensign, R-Nev., said he had a favorable impression of Chu, including the nominee's support for nuclear fuel recycling.LiNeBrEaK"That's what I've been talking about for a long time," Ensign said in an interview Thursday. On other issues, "He's obviously very into renewables ... so I like that part of him," Ensign said.LiNeBrEaKRep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., said Obama "has made a stellar selection" in Chu. LiNeBrEaKRep. Dean Heller, R-Nev., said "it remains to be seen" how the Obama administration will deal with Yucca Mountain, "and whether they will be willing to end the project once and for all."LiNeBrEaK"Our nation needs a comprehensive energy policy that includes conservation, renewable energy, and developing our own natural resources," Heller said in a statement. "It is my hope that the new secretary of Energy will work in a bipartisan manner to help solve our nation's energy problems."

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Final Edition	Experts predict push for biofuels &lt;|&gt; Obama advisers will focus on 'green' policies, they say  	THOMAS CONTENT, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	D Business; Pg. 1  	1340 words  	A surge of interest - and funding - is likely in 2009 for efforts to cut energy use, develop next-generation biofuels and expand renewable energy sources such as wind power, energy experts say.LiNeBrEaK But don't look for a rapid acceleration of plans to build new nuclear reactors, the experts said in assessing President-elect Barack Obama's choices to lead his administration's energy policy.LiNeBrEaK Experts say energy policy is going to take a greener hue, and they say an economic stimulus package may have its own green tint now that Obama has named his key energy and environment policy advisers.LiNeBrEaK Obama ran on a campaign to infuse $150 billion over 10 years into energy efficiency and renewable energy. On Monday, he named Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, an expert in alternative energy, to run the Energy Department. He has also named Carol Browner, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to be a White House policy czar overseeing energy and climate policy. LiNeBrEaK "You have the perfect storm for renewable energy, you have a need for jobs and the need for alternative energy for our energy independence," said Curt Pawlisch, a Madison energy lawyer. "You put those two together and there's going to be a lot of momentum, both at the federal and state level."LiNeBrEaK  Paul Wilson, who chairs the energy analysis and policy program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, agreed that the focus of the administration will be on any kind of energy that helps reduce emissions linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKNuclear power status quoLiNeBrEaK But nuclear power won't see the boost that alternative energy sources like wind and solar will see, Wilson said.LiNeBrEaK "This next administration is not going to put the brakes on nuclear energy, but they're not going to push the gas pedal either," he said.LiNeBrEaK Unlike Republican candidate John McCain, who was advocating a big nuclear expansion, "they're going to let things go the way they've already been set in motion."LiNeBrEaK Seventeen  applications have been filed with federal regulators to build 25 new nuclear plants. Wisconsin has three nuclear reactors along Lake Michigan, including two at Point Beach and one at Kewaunee. Both sites were originally designed to hold bigger power plants, but state law bars utilities from even considering a new reactor. Legislation to relax that moratorium could be introduced next year.LiNeBrEaK But don't expect any of those to proceed quickly, as a deep recession will mean power plants aren't needed quickly - and costly new reactors will be hard to finance.LiNeBrEaK "The financial meltdown is going to have a bigger impact than the new administration," Wilson said.LiNeBrEaK Chu, who won the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics, and runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has been a big proponent of next-generation biofuels through his lab's partnership with the oil company BP.LiNeBrEaK That could mean more investment for the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, experts said.LiNeBrEaK "(Chu) understands the promise of advanced biofuels and their reach and scalability beyond existing fuels," said Mike McAdams, head of the Advanced Biofuels Coalition, a consortium of companies including Virent Energy of Madison that are developing renewable biofuels.LiNeBrEaKCoordinated approachLiNeBrEaK Browner, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, will coordinate the efforts of at least 13 federal agencies and commissions.LiNeBrEaK Browner is likely to focus on big-picture energy issues across federal agencies, while Chu will be responsible for making sure the Energy Department develops the technologies to allow solar, wind and biomass to compete with oil and coal, said Dan Arvizu, director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo.LiNeBrEaK "If the chemistry is right between Carol Browner and Steve Chu, then you can take what otherwise might be some creative tension and turn it into a positive," he said. "If they are not in alignment philosophically in terms of what they think ought to be done, then you've got an issue."LiNeBrEaK  The selection of Browner to hold a White House position is a sign that Obama will try a White House-directed and coordinated climate change and energy plan, said Michael Kraft of the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, author of several books on U.S. environmental policy.LiNeBrEaK "Mostly, climate change policy is about energy use and cutting back on fossil fuels," Kraft said. "This is clearly a signal that Obama tends to follow through" on plans to develop more biofuels, solar and wind power "and to probably move away from coal and nuclear."LiNeBrEaK That could mean more business for companies such as TowerTech in Manitowoc, which builds towers for wind energy projects, and the port of Milwaukee, which has seen business from imports of wind energy components.LiNeBrEaKObama's choices laudedLiNeBrEaK  Supporters of plans to create more "green" jobs through renewable energy and energy efficiency say they welcomed the appointments.LiNeBrEaK "It'll be great to have a secretary of energy who doesn't want to see the agency abolished," said Jeanne Merrill, energy policy outreach specialist at the Center on Wisconsin Strategy and the Apollo Alliance, a national environmental group and labor coalition seeking to boost renewable energy spending.LiNeBrEaK In constant dollars, the federal budget for energy research and development spending today stands at $4 billion, which is half the amount that was spent in 1979, she said.LiNeBrEaK The Apollo Alliance is preparing to unveil clean-energy policy recommendations for Wisconsin, many of which echo those made this year by the global warming task force appointed by Gov. Jim Doyle.LiNeBrEaK Doyle has said he wants to see those recommendations implemented, and a bill that includes expanding Wisconsin's use of renewable power and relaxing its ban on building nuclear plants is expected to be introduced early next year.LiNeBrEaK The state's utilities want to see the ban on nuclear plants lifted but recognize that Wisconsin will follow other states in construction of new power plants. But those plans are a long way off - given the slowing economy and the credit crunch, said Roy Thilly, chief executive of WPPI Energy of Sun Prairie.LiNeBrEaK Perhaps the biggest emphasis of the new administration will be on energy efficiency and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK That would provide a boost for energy-efficiency programs run by the state Focus on Energy program, or for companies in the energy-efficiency field, such as Johnson Controls Inc. of Glendale or Orion Energy Systems Inc. of Plymouth.LiNeBrEaKBloomberg News contributed to this report.LiNeBrEaKSTEVEN CHULiNeBrEaK Age: 60LiNeBrEaK Experience: Professor of physics and molecular and cell biology, University of California, Berkeley; director, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 2004-present; chair, physics department, Stanford University, 1990-'93 and 1999-2001; head, quantum electronics research department, ATandT Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, N.J., 1983-'87; technical staff, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, N.J., 1978-1983.LiNeBrEaKCAROL BROWNERLiNeBrEaK Age: 53LiNeBrEaK Experience: Principal, Albright Group and Albright Capital Management, 2000-present; administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1993-2001; head, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, 1991-'93; legislative director, office of Sen.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   01 EDITION	The cow gas tax is    just so much hot air  		A; Pg. 06  	511 words  	The cow gas tax isLiNeBrEaKjust so much hot airLiNeBrEaKBy nicholesLiNeBrEaKIT'S EITHER the dumbest idea in EPA history or semi-urban legend: making farmers pay air pollution fees on their dairy cows, beef cattle and hogs. LiNeBrEaKThe cow tax, as it's called, would be based on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that the gas passed by livestock is a greenhouse gas emission that constitutes air pollution.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, farmers and ranchers could be penalized because the critters that provide Americans with meat and dairy products happen to be flatulent. Producers with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs could be charged $175 annually per dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 per hog.LiNeBrEaKIf this is a serious Environmental Protection Agency proposal - and that's questionable - then it needs to dissipate in the winds of opposition.LiNeBrEaKOur part of the planet survived buffalo, wild horses, even dinosaurs for that matter, without detectable damage from the gas they passed. (Admittedly, we're assuming that dinosaurs were flatulent, but no one was around to worry about it, and no one has attempted to blame them for global warming.)LiNeBrEaKFarmers and ranchers don't deserve to be taxed for something that comes naturally. Nor do beleaguered consumers need to be paying higher prices for American milk and meat because of the added penalty.LiNeBrEaKAs for the legitimacy of this idea, the news got out when the American Farm Bureau made a stink. That's also where the fee estimates apparently came from.LiNeBrEaKIn an Alabama Associated Press story published in the Press-Register on Dec. 7, an EPA spokesman was quoted as saying the fees were proposed for livestock operations that emit more than 100 tons of carbon a year and fall under the federal Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKOne imagines a federal inspector with a flatulence meter chasing cows in the pasture, but maybe there's some sort of universal government standard for gas per cow.LiNeBrEaKAt any rate, in the backdraft of numerous news stories, the EPA has said it merely issued a notice of "proposed rulemaking" to get comments on options for regulating greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"EPA is not proposing a cow tax," the federal agency said in a statement on the issue.LiNeBrEaKAlabama Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks remains suspicious and does not believe he is overreacting. "If you start talking agriculture in the same sentence as greenhouse emissions, we need to speak up," he told the Dothan Eagle.LiNeBrEaKCommissioner Sparks fears the fees would drive the beef cattle industry out of Alabama and lead to the United States importing more beef.LiNeBrEaKAlso on alert is Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who calls the idea absurd. "It is effectively a tax on cows when they belch," he says.LiNeBrEaKWith farmers, ranchers, agriculture officials and at least one member of Congress up in arms, the EPA is going to have a hard time trying to regulate livestock flatulence, if that's its intention.LiNeBrEaKBesides, methane gas produced from cow manure is considered an alternative energy source these days. In that light, shouldn't environmentalists be supporting cow flatulence instead of trying to eliminate it?

Mobile Register (Alabama) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   01 EDITION	Obama announces energy, environment team  		A; Pg. 05  	215 words  	Obama announces energy, environment teamLiNeBrEaKBy apLiNeBrEaKAssociated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama on Monday named an environmental and energy team that he said signaled his determination to tackle global warming quickly and develop alternative forms of energy. Obama selected Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol Browner, a confidante of former Vice President Al Gore, to lead a White House council on energy and climate. Browner headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration. LiNeBrEaKChu is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading advocate of reducing greenhouse gases by developing new energy sources.LiNeBrEaKObama also announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaK"We can spark the dynamism of our economy through a long-term investment in renewable energy that will give life to new businesses and industries with good jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced," he said. "We'll make public buildings more efficient, modernize our electricity grid, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while protecting and preserving our natural resources. We must also recognize that the solution to global climate change must be global."

The New York Times 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Hard Task for New Team On Energy and Climate  	By JOHN M. BRODER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 24  	1178 words  	The team President-elect Barack Obama introduced on Monday to carry out his energy and environmental policies faces a host of political, economic, diplomatic and scientific challenges that could impede his plans to address global warming and America's growing dependence on dirty and uncertain sources of energy.LiNeBrEaK  Acknowledging that a succession of presidents and Congresses had failed to make much progress on the issues, Mr. Obama vowed to press ahead despite the faltering economy and suggested that he would invest his political capital in trying to break logjams.LiNeBrEaK  ''This time must be different,'' Mr. Obama said at a news conference in Chicago. ''This will be a leading priority of my presidency and a defining test of our time. We cannot accept complacency, nor accept any more broken promises.'' LiNeBrEaK  Shortly after Mr. Obama spoke, transition officials confirmed that he would select Senator Ken Salazar, a first-term Democrat from Colorado, as interior secretary. Mr. Salazar's appointment will complete the team of environmental and energy officials in the new administration.LiNeBrEaK  The most pressing environmental issue for the incoming team will almost certainly be settling on an effective and politically tenable approach to the intertwined issues of energy security and global warming. LiNeBrEaK  The point person for these issues will be Carol M. Browner, who was named on Monday to the new position of White House coordinator for energy and climate. Ms. Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, will oversee two former aides, Lisa P. Jackson, who was selected as the new agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, who will be the chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Joining the group will be Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics whom Mr. Obama designated to lead the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Salazar, a former director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and state attorney general, is a farmer and rancher whose family has lived in Colorado for five generations. He is known as a staunch conservationist and an opponent of developing oil shale on public lands. LiNeBrEaK  His appointment will leave a Democratic vacancy in the Senate. Colorado, which voted for Mr. Obama 53 percent to 45 percent, has a Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, who will name a replacement to complete the final two years of Mr. Salazar's term. Mr. Salazar's brother John, a congressman, is among potential appointees to fill the Senate seat. LiNeBrEaK  The intense ideological and regional rivalries that have stalled climate change legislation in Congress for years have not suddenly melted away. And even though Mr. Obama promises to give energy legislation a high priority, he first must stabilize an economy that is shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands each month.LiNeBrEaK  The new team faces political urgency to deliver on promises made by Mr. Obama on the campaign trail. One was his pledge to use a cap-and-trade bill for curbing heat-trapping  gases as both the means of shifting investments  away from energy sources that cause emissions of such gases and also as the source of the $15 billion a year he promised to invest in advanced energy technology. That figure may be dwarfed by spending on stimulus programs, including so-called green projects like building wind farms and making buildings more energy efficient.LiNeBrEaK  Previous efforts to move a comprehensive climate bill through Congress stalled even without the deepening recession the nation confronts today, said Rafe Pomerance, a negotiator in the Clinton administration on international climate agreements and the president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a Washington nonprofit group.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Pomerance said the challenge would be to devise a scientifically rigorous bill that would satisfy lawmakers who fear the costs.LiNeBrEaK  Left unclear on Monday was how the new president's advisers intend to use the levers of government to get to the ''new energy economy'' Mr. Obama described. Also uncertain was what relationship they would forge with his powerful economic advisers.LiNeBrEaK  ''In policy terms, I think there are big questions about what priority will be given to direct public infrastructure spending versus tax-based incentives versus environmental markets versus direct regulation,'' said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group. ''There is still a very profound debate on all of that.'' LiNeBrEaK  The diplomatic tension is driven by the steps required to work toward a new global climate treaty, which the United States and nearly all other nations have committed to completing by December 2009. The last round of talks ended last weekend in Poland with few signs of progress on the main goal, limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases without hampering economic development.LiNeBrEaK  It is widely felt that if the United States does not demonstrate concrete domestic steps to curb its emissions from burning fossil fuels, fast-growing developing countries will continue to balk at taking on obligations to cut their emissions. And while Mr. Obama will enjoy a larger Democratic majority than Mr. Clinton did in his two terms, the Senate has long made such steps a prerequisite for its required consent to any climate treaty.LiNeBrEaK  The scientific urgency comes from the unanticipated recent growth in emissions of carbon dioxide in China, India and other countries with fast-expanding economies. This heat-trapping gas is the biggest concern because its long life, once the gas is released, causes it to build in the atmosphere, something like unpaid credit-card debt, as long as reductions are not made.LiNeBrEaK  Additional pressure comes from growing recognition that market forces alone are unlikely to drive the spread of nonpolluting energy technologies fast enough to matter where all the growth in energy use is at its peak, in the rapidly growing countries of Asia and Latin America.LiNeBrEaK  Nathan Lewis, who leads a team at Caltech pursuing ways to greatly improve solar energy technologies, said the appointment of Dr. Chu as energy secretary sent a strong signal that Mr. Obama understood that any program on climate-friendly energy had to have three prongs: increasing efficiency, moving existing nonpolluting energy technologies more quickly into the market, and advancing on the frontiers of energy science in search of radical breakthroughs.LiNeBrEaK  ''Energy efficiency cannot be seen as Job 1 and the other stuff Job 2,'' Dr. Lewis said. ''You've got to do them all as Job 1 because they all have to work.''LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu has spoken of using coal to generate electricity as an environmental ''nightmare,'' but he acknowledges that the nation lacks the technology to replace it or clean it up in the near term. Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for utilities, said that any solution to the climate problem must address these costs and provide consumers and electricity producers time to adjust.LiNeBrEaK  ''There will be major costs,'' Mr. Kuhn said. ''It's a question of trying to mitigate the costs as much as possible.''

The New York Times 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Ways to Get Detroit Out of the Ditch  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg. 36  	1162 words  	To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''White House Ready to Offer Aid to Auto Industry'' (front page, Dec. 13):LiNeBrEaK  When World War II broke out, American industry rapidly converted to wartime products. Shirt manufacturers changed production to mosquito netting, model train factories became bomb fuse factories, metal weather stripping production turned into mortar shell production, kitchen sinks became cartridge cases, and the auto manufacturers made tanks.LiNeBrEaK  Let the automakers use the bailout funds to convert to green technologies. Toyota and the rest can pick up the slack in automobiles. General Motors, under new leadership, can develop new and more efficient alternative energy products for ourselves and the rest of the world. LiNeBrEaK  As the economist James K. Galbraith has written, ''By helping to save the physical world, we may be able to save our currency, our credit and our economy as well.''  Finley Schaef LiNeBrEaK  Saugerties, N.Y., Dec. 13, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Providing car loans to the automakers may help them in the long run, but ultimately they need to sell cars and they need to do so now. What good will it do to provide them with money if the consumer doesn't have the financial resources to buy their product?LiNeBrEaK  I submit that a much better use of the money might be to offer government-guaranteed car loans to consumers, provided of course that they be able to meet certain financial requirements and with the condition that the consumer buys from the Big Three.LiNeBrEaK  This way General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get to move their current inventories, receive the money for future investment, and the government doesn't actually make the investment, unless the consumer defaults.LiNeBrEaK  Paul HauserLiNeBrEaK  Wellington, Fla., Dec. 14, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Instead of simply transferring billions of dollars into a Detroit abyss, why not have our government deal with the actual problem, a lack of automobile purchases and foresight by the industry?LiNeBrEaK  The government places a huge order for electric cars. It requires all Detroit employees to reduce their pay package by 10 percent. The government places a 20 percent down payment. When the vehicles are ready for delivery, the government sells them to dealerships.LiNeBrEaK  In this way, we drastically reduce our losses from importing petroleum, help reduce the adverse health consequences of pollution, reduce global warming and spawn a whole new industry that requires more electricity production, battery storage and electricity transfer. LiNeBrEaK  We Americans can actually produce something real for taxpayer money.LiNeBrEaK  Leonard GehlLiNeBrEaK  Pittsburgh, Dec. 14, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  As a political progressive, I rarely find myself lauding the backbone of the Republican Party, but I must say that in this instance it is the Democrats who are buckling to misplaced labor worries about auto jobs and the Republicans who realize that the American auto industry's engine has finally died. LiNeBrEaK  No amount of bailout will keep these notoriously inefficient companies afloat. Is this a rerun of an old 1979 Chrysler show? LiNeBrEaK  We've been here before, and it's time to consolidate our losses and support new green companies that can hire these workers for profitable and sustainable enterprise. Yogi HendlinLiNeBrEaK  Santa Monica, Calif., Dec. 14, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Imagine an act of leadership by the Senate: it says to the autoworkers, We are acting to reduce our salaries by 15 percent; we ask you to accept a 10 percent reduction. We do this in the interest of the well-being of the country.LiNeBrEaK  Is it hard to imagine our elected representatives acting selflessly and in the country's interest?LiNeBrEaK  Charles E. WellesLiNeBrEaK  South Bristol, Me., Dec. 13, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''A Finger in the Dike'' (column, Dec. 14):LiNeBrEaK  Nicholas D. Kristof argues that the auto bailout ultimately must go through because more than a million jobs are at stake. Those making this argument are completely disregarding economic truths.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Kristof parallels the automobile industry to the financial sector by examining the aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy. With Lehman, there was a clear market failure that justified government intervention. Credit markets were frozen; loans were not being made. There is no similar failure in the automobile market. If the Big Three should fail, there will still be plenty of great cars on the market made by companies other than General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.LiNeBrEaK  Second, when the Big Three fail, the associated job losses will be temporary. American demand for automobiles will still very much exist. Consequently, there will be a huge supply gap left for foreign car companies to expand their American production or for new domestic companies to enter the market. Either way, new job opportunities will replace the old. Kenan YountLiNeBrEaK  Charlottesville, Va., Dec. 14, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  How is it that so many still do not get it? How is that so many still do not understand how desperate things are with our economy and the importance of the American auto industry in that economy? LiNeBrEaK  And yes, enough of all that free-market purist nonsense about having to let things play themselves out in a capitalistic way, particularly when our financial institutions have failed even more miserably than the auto industry and are surviving thanks only to the government's huge bailout.LiNeBrEaK  As Nicholas D. Kristof says, one thing is more than clear: the American dike is about to crumble, and for our own good, we had better plug it through whichever way possible before we do even more irreparable damage to the economy.LiNeBrEaK  Carl MattioliLiNeBrEaK  Newtonville, Mass., Dec. 14, 2008LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  ''When the Cars Go Away,'' by Bill McGraw (Op-Ed, Dec. 13):LiNeBrEaK  There is much angst about whether  to bail out the Big Three automakers. Proponents rightly point out the devastating ripple effect of their closing. Those against government financial rescue justly question using huge amounts of taxpayer money to help those who have been incompetent, greedy, terminally shortsighted and self-serving in the extreme. LiNeBrEaK  Why not allow existing auto manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and so on to buy out General Motors, Ford and Chrysler? That, of course, assumes that they would have any interest. LiNeBrEaK  These makers are proven innovators and consummate administrators. A requirement of such a sale would be that the new owners keep the current workers in place. It would dissolve existing union contracts. It would, however, require the work forces of the Big Three to be compensated at rates commensurate with those of the new owners' other American plant work forces. LiNeBrEaK  Even if an ''auction'' of the companies were held resulting in a fire-sale, liquidation purchase price, it would generate some cash and would not cost the taxpayers a nickel. Basically, the only ones hurt would be the executives and the shareholders. LiNeBrEaK  And that, I'm afraid, is a big, Oh, well. We as nonparticipating taxpayers should not be required to cover their poor business decisions.LiNeBrEaK  MacKenzie AllenLiNeBrEaK  Tacoma, Wash., Dec. 14, 2008	AUTOMAKERS (93%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (92%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); AUTOMOBILE FINANCING (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); CONSUMER LENDING (90%); BAILOUTS (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); POLITICAL PARTIES (89%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); IMPORT TRADE (78%); MOTOR VEHICLES (78%); WORLD WAR II (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (74%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (71%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (91%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (91%)  		FLORIDA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The New York Times Company   	GMP (PAR) (91%); GMB (BRU) (91%); GM (NYSE) (91%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (91%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (91%)  	DRAWING (DRAWING BY ERIC HANSON)                                                              				Letter  		http://www.nytimes.com  						
The New York Times 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   The New York Times on the Web	Australia Unveils Targets to Cut Pollution  	By MERAIAH FOLEY  	Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg.   	565 words  	Australia  announced plans Monday to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 5  to 15 percent by 2020, angering environmental groups that had lobbied for much deeper cuts. LiNeBrEaK  In a policy statement, the government said the final target would depend on whether developed and developing nations,   including major emitters like China and India,  could agree to binding reductions under a new United Nations climate treaty next year. LiNeBrEaK  If the world acts together to forge deep cuts, Australia will reduce its emissions by 15 percent of its 2000 levels over 10 years  starting in 2010. If there is no agreement, Australia will cut emissions by  5 percent over the same period.  LiNeBrEaK  No matter what the short-term target is, the government said it was committed to reducing emissions by 60 percent from 2000 levels by 2050. LiNeBrEaK  ''There are many obstacles to achieving a strong international agreement by the end of the next negotiating round,'' the report said. ''However, the least responsible path that Australia could take would be to do nothing while we wait to see how the rest of the world acts.'' LiNeBrEaK  The announcement drew sharp criticism from nearly all of Australia's major environmental groups, which had been pushing for a short-term cut of at least 25 percent. LiNeBrEaK  ''This is a complete failure of a system,'' Christine Milne, a senator with the small  Greens Party, told the national broadcaster. ''Five percent is a global embarrassment; 15 percent is way below even the minimum the rest of the world wants to see,'' she said, pointing to the European Union's recent announcement that it would reduce emissions by at least 20 percent of 1990 levels by 2020. LiNeBrEaK  Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who made signing the Kyoto Protocol on climate change his first act   after sweeping to power last year on a platform of reducing Australia's emissions, said the targets were both responsible and appropriate to the times. LiNeBrEaK  ''They deliver necessary reform to tackle the long-term challenge of climate change, while supporting our economy and securing jobs during this global recession,'' Mr. Rudd told the National Press Club in the capital, Canberra, after his speech was interrupted by a pro-environment heckler who was led from the room by security staff members. LiNeBrEaK  Without the targets announced Monday, Mr. Rudd said Australia's emissions would grow by about 20 percent over the two decades to 2020. Despite the criticism, the government has said the 5-to-15-percent target places Australia among the world's leaders  on climate change. LiNeBrEaK  Because of Australia's fast-growing population -- mostly from immigration -- the policy paper projected that even a  5 percent cut in emissions would represent a 27 percent reduction in Australia's per capita emissions from 2000 to 2020. By contrast, the European Union's minimum target would result in a reduction of 24 percent per person, the government said. LiNeBrEaK  The targets announced Monday are part of a broader emissions trading program the government hopes to have in place by July 1, 2010. But  Mr.  Rudd must present his plans to Parliament, where his center-left Labor Party controls the House but not the Senate. LiNeBrEaK  Spurred by business groups who say it would slow economic growth in already precarious times, the opposition Liberal Party and two independent senators have said they will push to delay carrying out the plan unless significant changes are made.

The New York Times 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final			Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; POSTINGS RECENT ENTRIES FROM OUR BLOGS; Pg. 8  	520 words  	WellLiNeBrEaK  From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well. LiNeBrEaK  Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows it's hard to stay motivated. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania wondered if cold, hard cash might do the trick. LiNeBrEaK  The investigators recruited 57 prospective dieters who were obese but otherwise healthy and divided them into three groups. One group was given $3 a day plus matching funds for meeting weight-loss goals, meaning they could earn up to $168 during a four-week period. A second group was eligible to compete in a cash lottery for $10 to $100 a day during the study period if they achieved weight-loss goals. A third, the control group, simply attended monthly weigh-in sessions.LiNeBrEaK  At the end of 16 weeks, the dieters in the lottery group had lost an average of 13. 1 pounds each, while those in the matching-funds group had lost an average of 14 pounds each, compared with just 3. 9 pounds in the control group, according to a report in The Journal of the American Medical Association.LiNeBrEaK  Dot EarthLiNeBrEaK  From Andrew C. Revkin's blog, nytimes.com/dotearth.LiNeBrEaK  The climate talks that concluded Saturday in Poznan, Poland, underscored a deep and persistent global ''climate divide.'' On one side are the industrialized nations, which largely built their wealth through a century of fossil-fuel combustion; on the other, poorer countries whose path out of poverty depends for now on the same energy sources. LiNeBrEaK  And there are other divides that may make it difficult to achieve a global climate treaty in Copenhagen a year from now. In the United States, where the Senate must approve any treaty by a two-thirds vote, Congress remains divided not just by party but by geography.LiNeBrEaK  President-elect Barack Obama's climate team includes seasoned environmental regulators who see global warming mainly as a traditional pollution problem; and a nominee for energy secretary, Steven Chu, who recognizes the need for big leaps in science and engineering. Sustaining a focus on both aspects of the climate/energy challenge will not be easy.LiNeBrEaK  The New Old AgeLiNeBrEaK  From Jane Gross's blog, nytimes.com/newoldage.LiNeBrEaK  Few subjects have generated more interest here than long-term-care insurance. And I've found myself both alarmed and amazed at how many of you think that such a policy is the all-purpose solution to exorbitantly expensive nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other forms of ''custodial care'' for the incapacitated elderly.LiNeBrEaK  My mother had such a policy, a new product in the 1970s and very different from the policies of today. Leaving aside the eye-glazing technical details, nothing she needed was covered. Still, I have my own policy now. My annual premium is $1,700, and the benefits include many things my mother's didn't, including home modification, a small portion of the costs of assisted living (although not the apartment itself),  inflation protection and other bells and whistles I can't recall.LiNeBrEaK  But, often I think about canceling it, because my gut tells me that once the huge baby boom cohort starts filing claims, not even the biggest players in the field will be able to cover the costs.

The absurdity of this position is indicative of the same sort of myopic and corrupt thinking that has led the centrists to be so wrong in the past.LiNeBrEaK  Continual compromise leads to confusion. It is more than a little ironic that Mr. Obama would run on being correct from the start and then confound all expectations by choosing a staff and cabinet that have been so wrong from the start. And these people are supposed to be the brilliant and competent ones.

The New York Times 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Person, Patient, Statistic  	By DANA JENNINGS. 	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; CASES; Pg. 1  	914 words  	Dana Jennings is an editor at The New York Times and the author, most recently, of ''Sing Me Back Home: Love, Death and Country Music.''LiNeBrEaKI have prostate cancer, but it sometimes seems as if I've been in a terrible car crash: I've smashed through the windshield, I'm bleeding in the road, and a cop steps over my body and says, ''Hey, did you know that there were 41,000 traffic deaths last year?'' A passer-by notes that ''modern medicine is doing wonderful things with organ transplants'' while another mutters, ''Well, at least no one was killed.''LiNeBrEaK  This is the way prostate cancer often feels, as if my world had turned into a Philip K. Dick dystopia in which the cold intent of many people -- especially my insurer and the other bureaucrats who populate the health-care-industrial-complex -- was to translate me into an abstraction, to deny my damaged and tiresome flesh-and-bloodness. LiNeBrEaK  My insurer did not want to hear that my radical open prostatectomy last July would demand a higher level of care because previous abdominal surgery had created a tortuous internal topography of scar tissue and adhesions. My insurer, despite the insight and strong protests of my doctors, kept insisting that any knife would do. Was Sweeney Todd available?LiNeBrEaK  And some doctors I spoke with before my surgery -- not my current team at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey -- seemed to regard me as a rare pelt, a fascinating wrinkle in their volume business in prostates. Others, looking at me without really looking at me, defaulted to the reassuring role of professional pilot, treating the potential realities of impotence and incontinence as businesslike asides: ''We'll be cruising at 30,000 feet today ... you might wear man-pads for years ... please note Niagara Falls as we fly over ... and you might not ever have sex again.''LiNeBrEaK  Nearly 200,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and nearly 30,000 men die. This is serious, life-changing stuff: There's blood in your urine, a catheter snaked up your penis, scars stitch your gut, and you might be impotent and incontinent for a few months, a couple of years, or the rest of your life.LiNeBrEaK  Prostate cancer -- any cancer -- is a crucible in which we patients are somehow, we hope, reborn. It's a rite of passage as resonant as any other -- a graduation, a baptism, a wedding -- and should be treated that way. Some days, maybe because I'm still undergoing treatment, I don't want to hear about another stat, another study, another harebrained cure. How about a smile, a kind word and a hug?LiNeBrEaK  Prostate cancer is an abstraction in the same way that global warming was an abstraction, until the world saw the photograph of that forlorn polar bear trapped on an ice floe. It should be the goal of each one of my brothers-in-disease to become that bear.LiNeBrEaK  But it's difficult. The bewilderment, shame and fear often stun men into a passive and depressed silence. Nurses and doctors say that many men barely speak during treatment and office visits, letting their wives, partners or children do the talking. It's as if the dark biological knowledge they are bearing is too overwhelming for words.LiNeBrEaK  They are quiet waiting-room wraiths, perfecting their thousand-yard stares. And if they speak, it's in murmurs, as if cancer required whispers. They don't understand that to keep from being reduced to a cipher, a mere ''case,'' you need to be conscious and verbal.LiNeBrEaK  As a patient, when you don't speak, when you try to take on the cool and detached manner of a doctor, all you become is ''meat,'' quiet meat. And no one scratches you behind the ears and says, ''Good boy'' for being mute.LiNeBrEaK  It's hard to avoid that sense of meat-ness. Each office visit reduces you right away to your weight/temp/B.P. And because I had surgery at a teaching hospital, I woke up each morning to the rustle and jostle of a gang of residents. Young crows with bright and clever eyes, they flapped into my room -- almost like Keystone Kops in white coats -- to take a poke at the old crow. LiNeBrEaK  I don't want to be too tough on them, because they're only kids, and they have so much to learn in such a short time. But to most of them, I suspect, I was just a case, one of each morning's many medical exhibits.LiNeBrEaK  I preferred the humane, morphine-woozy middle-of-the-night conversations with the aides who took care of me. The guy who talked about superhero movies after checking out the Iron Man figurine my sons had given me. And the guy who, as he gently drained my ileostomy pouch -- not related to my cancer -- told me how he'd had to wear a temporary pouch after he'd been shot when he was young and stupid.LiNeBrEaK  It made me smile that the aides and nurses called my two round, plastic drains ''grenades.'' And it was one of my grenades that made one resident understand that I was more than just another ''prostate cancer post-op.''LiNeBrEaK  I can't recall her name -- most residents rushed through their names the same way they rushed through the halls -- and she seemed new. She'd been told to remove my drain, my last grenade. The moment she touched it I knew that both of us were in deep trouble.LiNeBrEaK  She needed to grab it firmly, then tug. Instead, she held it tentatively, as if it were a surly garter snake. Instead of pulling, she waggled it inside my body. It hurt, I believe, like being tortured: I got dizzy, nearly threw up and, yes, James Brown, I broke out in a cold sweat. LiNeBrEaK  When I told her I was going to pass out, she sheepishly went and got help. But I know she won't forget me. I became a real person in those cold-sweat moments, stopped being an abstraction. I became her polar bear on the ice floe.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Lobbyist spouses could complicate Obama nominations  	Tom Brune, Newsday, Melville, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	803 words  	Dec. 16--WASHINGTON -- When word leaked that Barack Obama intended to tap former EPA director Carol Browner as energy and global warming "czar," her Washington lobbyist husband, Tom Downey, a one-time Long Island congressman, began severing ties with energy and environmental clients, his firm said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Downey ended his contract with the last one -- Securing America's Future Energy, a nonprofit advocacy group promoting conservation and oil exploration to boost U.S. energy independence -- his firm and the nonprofit said. LiNeBrEaK"We don't represent them anymore," Kathleen Tynan McLaughlin, chief operating officer of Downey McGrath Group, said yesterday. "We no longer will be accepting energy or environment clients."LiNeBrEaKDowney, who married Browner last year, took a "prudent" step in the "gray area" of government ethics by cutting ties with the SAFE, said Mary Boyle of Common Cause, a nonprofit ethics advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKThe emergence of Washington power couples who include a political appointee and a lobbyist with a long list of clients is "fraught with danger," said ethics lawyer Jan Witold Baran.LiNeBrEaK"Spouses [of appointees] have to be very careful how they work and who they accept money from," he said. They must ask, are they "valid jobs for services actually rendered or whether they were vehicles to pad the financial well-being of some official couple."LiNeBrEaKLobbyist spouses have become a sore point for Obama as he assembles his team because he ran a campaign based on bringing change to the lobbyist-driven culture in Washington.LiNeBrEaKBrowner, named "czar" by Obama yesterday, is not the only one to have a lobbyist spouse: the wife of Tom Daschle, the pick to head Health and Human Services, is also a lobbyist, for example.LiNeBrEaKSince losing his seat in Congress in 1992, Downey has become a major fundraiser for Democrats, including Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), as well as a top lobbyist, reporting to the Senate $19. 5 million in lobbying fees since 1999.LiNeBrEaKThis year alone, his firm reported $2. 6 million in lobbying fees, and lists 32 clients other than SAFE on its Web site. But none is a business or advocate on energy or environmental issues, according to McLaughlin.LiNeBrEaKYet he has represented clients in the past who could raise concerns now. Fannie Mae, at the heart of the subprime mortgage crash, paid Downey $750,000 over the past decade before the contract ended in October. Mobil Oil paid his firm $14,000 in 1999, and Chevron USA $160,000 from 2000 to 2002 to lobby for it during its merger talks with Mobil, records show.LiNeBrEaKQuestions could arise about other clients, which increasingly includes those involved in health issues, as Obama seeks health care reform. Downey and Browner have shown they are aware of the potential appearance of conflict.LiNeBrEaKIn early 2006, Schumer raised alarms about a foreign-based firm, Dubai Ports World, getting a contract to operate six U.S. ports. DPW was represented in China by the Albright Group, which employed Browner and had hired Downey in 2004 as a lobbyist. Browner and Downey tried, unsuccessfully, to calm the storm.LiNeBrEaKThe Albright Group then recommended that DPW hire Downey as a lobbyist. It did, paying him, records show, $480,000 over two years. Two weeks after Downey and Browner wed in June 2007, Downey ended his contract with the Albright Group. McLaughlin said, "It was just a coincidence."LiNeBrEaKTHOMAS J.

The Olympian (Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	The Olympian, Olympia, Wash., Soundings column  	John Dodge, The Olympian, Olympia, Wash.  	LIFESTYLE  	868 words  	Dec. 16--Change is coming next week to The Olympian's Environment page, which has appeared each Monday in the newspaper since March 2004.LiNeBrEaKFirst, it's moving to a new home as the Living section cover in each Tuesday's newspaper. We're tweaking the content, too.LiNeBrEaKFor the next year, we'll concentrate on the most pressing environmental issues of the day: climate change. LiNeBrEaKI'm not inclined to use ink and newsprint on a debate about whether global warming and a changing climate stem from natural causes or human activities.LiNeBrEaKDominique Bachelet, an Olympia resident, climate change scientist, associate professor at Oregon State University and technical adviser to the 2007 Nobel Prize-winning U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says it best:LiNeBrEaK"Constructive criticism by the climate-change deniers is important," she said. "The computer models aren't perfect and modelers don't have a crystal ball. But we do know the climate is changing at a pace we haven't seen since the arrival on Earth of the human race."LiNeBrEaKTo continue arguing over how much humans are to blame for global warming misses the point. Anything we do to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions, conserve natural resources and make the transition to cleaner energy sources pays dividends on multiple fronts.LiNeBrEaKConservation and pollution reduction improve the quality of the air we breathe and the health of ecosystems that support a diversity of species. They address that fossil fuels are a finite resource that will not support continued population growth for centuries to come. They reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil and improve national security.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama and his supporters are right: Building a new, green-energy economy is the best way out of the economic doldrums that blanket the global economy.LiNeBrEaKThe plan at The Olympian is to turn the environment page into a reliable, relevant home for stories about what South Sound individuals, families, businesses, citizen groups, local governments and state elected officials are doing and want to do to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKFeature stories on this vital topic will be complemented with guest columns by scientists, teachers, community activists and others who have opinions on how to tackle the problems associated with global warming.LiNeBrEaKWe'll offer Web site addresses with useful information on climate change and tips to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, save water and conserve energy in the home and workplace.LiNeBrEaKA word of caution: The environment page won't be turned over exclusively to the topic of climate change for the entire year, just as we won't ignore it once a year has passed.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the Living section's popular "Where do I take my ...?" recycling feature will move to the environment page.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, The Olympian will continue to cover other environmental topics on the page. But think of climate change as a central theme that will be visited frequently.LiNeBrEaKThe new format and focus kick off with a feature story Tuesday on two Olympia families who have agreed to participate in The Olympian's "Green Steps" project. They have calculated their family carbon footprint, which is an estimate of the amount of carbon dioxide, a leading greenhouse gas, their family activities generated in the past year.LiNeBrEaKWe'll keep track of the families through the year and report back on changes they make and obstacles they face in their daily lives as they try to reduce their carbon footprints.LiNeBrEaKThe hope is that their experiences will guide others on a path to a more sustainable future, showing how all of us can be part of the solution to the most complex, challenging environmental problem of our time.LiNeBrEaKIf you want to come along on this journey, calculate your family's carbon footprint at www.nature.org/initiatives/climatechange/calculator.LiNeBrEaKMARINE LIFE FEATURE: This week also marks the end of a fixture on the environment page that first appeared in October 2005, the weekly text and color photographs depicting marine life of Puget Sound.LiNeBrEaKKudos to David W.

B03  	576 words  	SUMMARY: Study   | Climbing temperatures will spell trouble for wildlife and people, scientists sayLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming would bring drastic changes to Rogue River Valley by 2080 Rising temperatures will spell trouble for forests, wildlife and people, a study says Warming would bring drastic LiNeBrEaKchanges to Rogue River ValleyLiNeBrEaKSCOTT LEARNLiNeBrEaKIf global warming continues unabated, summer temperatures in the Rogue River Valley could rise as much as 15 degrees by 2080, making the weather in the southern Oregon valley similar to Sacramento's, Oregon researchers said in a report released today.LiNeBrEaKThe changes would likely boost wildfires, the researchers said, and spell trouble for fish, forests, pears, pinot noir and people, who would see snowpacks and water supplies dwindle.LiNeBrEaKThe report, drafted by the University of Oregon's Climate Leadership Initiative and the Ashland-based National Center for Conservation Science and Policy, is the first of four that will try to boil down climate change predictions to a regional scale in southern Oregon.LiNeBrEaKThe study's authors used the global Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's "business as usual" scenario to make the projections. That scenario assumes that most countries fail to act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKBob Doppelt, director of the leadership initiative, noted that atmospheric carbon levels are already above the IPCC's estimates from last year for the business-as-usual scenario. And temperature increases are likely even under best-case scenarios, he said.LiNeBrEaK"We wanted to paint the picture of the likely consequences of climate change if there is no change" in society's response, Doppelt said. "Even if the effect in the valley is half of that or a third of that, it's pretty significant. It's already hot down there in the summer."LiNeBrEaKThe Rogue River Valley, beginning near Crater Lake and running to Gold Beach, has 302,000 residents. It's considered a powerhouse system for wild salmon, and its white-water runs draw tourists from around the globe.LiNeBrEaKThe researchers, with help from a U.S. Forest Service bioclimatologist, applied three global climate change models to the valley. In such models, global forecasts are more certain than regional ones, particularly regarding precipitation, but Doppelt said the general trends should hold. Among their findings:LiNeBrEaK* Average annual temperatures will increase by as little as 1 degree or as much as 3 degrees by 2040 and by 4 to 8 degrees by 2080. Summer temperatures could increase dramatically, rising by 7 to 15 degrees by 2080.LiNeBrEaK* Snow accumulation could decline within a range of 25 to 75 percent by 2040, and as much as 94 percent by 2080, reducing summer stream flows, water quality and water supply. Big winter storms and rainfall could increase, boosting flooding.LiNeBrEaK* A longer summer with higher temperatures will likely increase wildfires and could create lethal stream conditions for native fish such as salmon and steelhead, similar to conditions on the lower Klamath River during the 2002 fish kill.LiNeBrEaKThe report says local governments, businesses and homeowners need to start taking the effects of global warming into account now. That includes politically tough and potentially expensive measures such as restricting development in wildfire-prone areas and floodplains, restructuring timber harvests, setting aside more habitat and restoring more streams.LiNeBrEaKTo see the report, go to http://tinyurl.com/67cxsq.LiNeBrEaKScott Learn: 503-294-7657; scottlearn@news.oregonian.com	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); RESEARCH (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (89%); TRENDS (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (78%); RIVERS (78%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); SCIENCE POLICY (73%); LAKES (73%); EMISSIONS (73%)  			OREGON, USA (95%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  				INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (55%); UNIVERSITY OF OREGON (56%)

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   SOONER EDITION	OBAMA SELECTS CHICAGO SCHOOLS CHIEF;  A COMPROMISE IN THE RIFT OVER THE NATION'S EDUCATION NEEDS 	Sam Dillon, The New York Times  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-1  	778 words  	Arne Duncan, the Chicago schools superintendent known for taking tough steps to improve schools while maintaining respectful relations with teachers and their unions, is President-elect Barack Obama's choice as secretary of education, Democratic officials said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKMr. Duncan, a 44-year-old Harvard graduate, has raised achievement in the nation's third-largest school district and often faced the ticklish challenge of shuttering failing schools and replacing ineffective teachers, usually with improved results. LiNeBrEaKHe represents a compromise choice in the debate that has divided Democrats in recent months over the proper course for public school policy after the Bush years.LiNeBrEaKIn June, rival nationwide groups of educators circulated competing educational manifestos, with one group espousing a get-tough policy based on pushing teachers and administrators harder to raise achievement, and another faction arguing that schools alone could not close the racial achievement gap and urging new investments in school-based health clinics and other social programs to help poor students learn.LiNeBrEaKMr. Duncan was the only big-city superintendent to sign both manifestos.LiNeBrEaKHe argued that the nation's schools needed to be held accountable for student progress, but also needed major new investments, new talent and new teacher-training efforts.LiNeBrEaKIn straddling the two camps, Mr. Duncan seemed to reflecMr. Obama's own impatience with what he has called "tired educational debates."LiNeBrEaKIn his last major educational speech of the campaign, Mr. Obama said: "It's been Democrat versus Republican, vouchers versus the status quo, more money versus more reform. There's partisanship and there's bickering, but no understanding that both sides have good ideas."LiNeBrEaKThe rival educational camps swamped the Obama transition in recent weeks with recommendations for the post. The National Education Association, the largest teachers' union, pressed for several current and former governors who had made schools a priority in their states.LiNeBrEaKMany former members of Teach for America, the program that sends elite college graduates to teach in low-income schools, weighed in on behalf of Joel I. Klein, the New York City schools chancellor, and Michelle Rhee, the Washington schools chancellor, both of whom have clashed with the teachers' unions.LiNeBrEaK"Obama found the sweet spot with Arne Duncan," said Susan Traiman, director of educational policy at the Business Roundtable. "Both camps will be OK with the pick!"LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama also moved yesterday to round out anenvironmental and energy team charged with tackling global warming and developing alternative forms of energy.LiNeBrEaKToward that end, Mr. Obama plans to name Democratic Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado to run the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaKThe choice of Mr. Salazar to be secretary of a department that oversees oil and gas drilling on public lands and manages the nation's parks and wildlife refuges will be announced later this week, an Obama transition official said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKNobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu will be energy secretary, and Lisa Jackson, the former head of New Jersey's environmental department, will head the Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Obama announced yesterday.LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner, a confidante of former Vice President Al Gore, will lead a White House council on energy and climate. Ms. Browner headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration. Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, will be chair of the White House Council on Environment Quality.LiNeBrEaKThe President-elect vowed to "move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy."LiNeBrEaKMr. Salazar is expected to balance the protection of natural resources while tapping the nation's energy potential - an approach that Obama has said he wants .LiNeBrEaKHe co-sponsored a bill in Congress to create a new land conservation system under the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management for permanently protecting 26 million acres of national monuments, wilderness areas and wild and scenic rivers. The legislation died during the lame duck session of Congress after the November election.LiNeBrEaKMr. Salazar, 53, opposed drilling in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge and objected to the Bush administration's efforts to lease Western lands for oil shale development. It will be up to the Obama administration whether or not to go ahead with leasing.LiNeBrEaKDr. Chu, 60, is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading advocate of reducing greenhouse gases by developing new energy sources.LiNeBrEaKThe selection of Dr. Chu, a Chinese American who shared a Nobel Prize for physics in 1997, received widespread praise on Capitol Hill.LiNeBrEaKPHOTO: Carol Browner, nominee for head of the National Energy CouncilLiNeBrEaKPHOTO: Nancy Sutley, nominee for head of the White House Council on Environmental QualityLiNeBrEaKPHOTO: Lisa Jackson, nominee for EPA administratorLiNeBrEaKPHOTO: Arne Duncan, nominee for education secretary	EDUCATION SYSTEMS and INSTITUTIONS (91%); EDUCATION (90%); PRIMARY and SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (90%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); TEACHER UNIONS (89%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (78%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (78%); TEACHER EDUCATION (78%); LABOR UNIONS (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (73%); GOVERNORS (73%); CLINICS and OUTPATIENT SERVICES (53%); NOBEL PRIZES (50%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (50%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%); WILDLIFE (50%); AWARDS and PRIZES (50%); LOW INCOME PERSONS (67%)  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); KEN SALAZAR (50%); ARNE DUNCAN (94%)  	NEW YORK, NY, USA (79%) NEW YORK, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 P.G.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   All Editions	Advocates cheer Jackson choice;  Former Jersey DEP head named to lead EPA 	By JAMES M. O'NEILL, STAFF WRITER, North Jersey Media Group  	NEWS; Pg. A08  	974 words  	President-elect Barack Obama on Monday officially named former New Jersey environmental chief Lisa Jackson to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKJackson is part of a team of environmental and energy officials that Obama introduced at a Chicago press conference:LiNeBrEaK* Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize winner and University of California at Berkeley professor, to head the Energy Department. LiNeBrEaK* Carol Browner, who headed the EPA during the Clinton administration, to serve as the top Obama administration official on climate and energy policy.LiNeBrEaK* Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, to head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKObama said Jackson "helped make her state a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions" and shares his goals for the nation.LiNeBrEaKAt the press conference, Jackson promised to tackle air pollution, toxic chemicals and development issues.LiNeBrEaK"There is simply no higher calling for me than to lead this vital agency at this vital time," she said. She also thanked her husband, Kenny, and her two sons, who were in the audience, for their support.LiNeBrEaKJackson, a chemical engineer and 16-year veteran of the EPA, spent the past two and a half years as head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, where she generated generally positive reviews from both environmentalists and industry advocates. She became Governor Corzine's chief of staff on Dec. 1. Jackson has been a member of Obama's energy and natural resources transition team.LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Senate, Jackson, 46, would become the first African-American to head the EPA, and the second from New Jersey to head the agency in the past decade. Former Gov. Christie Whitman was President Bush's first EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday afternoon, Corzine said: "Even though I lament her loss on behalf of the state of New Jersey, I am galvanized by the prospect of having one of our own showcased on a national stage with the opportunity to preserve our birthright for future generations. Lisa is up to the challenge."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists said one of Jackson's key achievements in New Jersey was guiding a plan through the state legislature that mandates cuts in global warming emissions. Under Jackson, New Jersey has also joined a 10-state regional cap-and-trade program designed to use market forces to get companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"She has been one of the strongest DEP commissioners we've had in a long time," said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey, an environmental advocacy group. "There's no question global warming is the biggest challenge of our time, and she's got a ton of experience on the issue."LiNeBrEaKThose who have dealt with her say she is a practical consensus-builder.LiNeBrEaK"She's smart, thoughtful and works extremely well with stakeholders," said S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. "Being an engineer, she knows how things operate and what works on the ground, and that will give her a leg up over some previous EPA administrators."LiNeBrEaKIndustry representatives also spoke well of Jackson's tenure in New Jersey. "She's a very good pick. We haven't always agreed, but she had always given our members the opportunity to give their point of view from a scientific-based perspective," said Hal Bozarth, executive director of the Chemistry Council of New Jersey, which represents the state's chemical industry.LiNeBrEaK"She understands from an economic view there needs to be a way for manufacturing, which provides jobs and builds wealth, to continue to exist," he said. "She knows there ought to be a place for them to sit at the table."LiNeBrEaKThose opinions, however, were not unanimous.LiNeBrEaKIn an open letter to Obama, Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, harshly criticized Jackson's tenure at the DEP. Her actions as commissioner, Rauch wrote, "have been nothing short of appalling," and "raise troubling questions about her fitness to run an agency of much greater size, complexity and significance."Ruch noted that the EPA took over several Superfund cleanups last summer that the DEP had been overseeing after the EPA's inspector general sharply criticized both the DEP and EPA for failing to clean up several of the worst toxic sites in New Jersey, including two in the Meadowlands.LiNeBrEaKBut other environmentalists dismiss such criticisms, saying many of the problems that Ruch cites Jackson merely inherited. They also argue that she has stood up to her boss, Governor. Corzine, at times to push for environmental policies.LiNeBrEaK"On numerous occasions Jackson openly disagreed with Governor Corzine and fought to stop environmental weakening by the state legislature," said Jeff Tittel, of the New Jersey Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKJackson will have a well-placed New Jersey ally as her nomination goes through the Senate confirmation process. New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg chairs a subcommittee on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where Jackson's confirmation process would begin.LiNeBrEaKEdward McBride, Corzine's chief counsel, has been named his new chief of staff. McBride will be replaced by attorney William Castner Jr. in the chief counsel's office. Castner recently served as the executive director of the state Assembly Democrats.LiNeBrEaKColorado senator tapped to head InteriorLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama will name Colorado Sen.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Final Edition	Obama vows progress on energy, warming;  He says his nominees will help the nation shed its addiction to oil 		GENERAL; Pg. A-4  	460 words  	 President-elect Barack Obama yesterday introduced an environmental and energy team that he said signaled his determination to tackle global warming quickly and develop alternative forms of energy. He vowed to "move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy." LiNeBrEaK Obama selected Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol Browner, a confidante of former Vice President Al Gore, to lead a White House council on energy and climate. Browner headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration.LiNeBrEaK Chu, 60, is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading advocate of reducing greenhouse gases by developing new energy sources.LiNeBrEaK The selection of Chu, a Chinese-American who shared a Nobel Prize for physics in 1997, received widespread praise on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said he looked forward to "confirming Dr. Chu as quickly as possible."LiNeBrEaK Obama also announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as EPA administrator; and Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, as chairwoman of the White House Council on Environment Quality.LiNeBrEaK Obama made clear he plans take energy policy in a sharply different direction from President George W. Bush, promising aggressive moves to address global warming and pump money and support into research into alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and biofuels.LiNeBrEaK With this team, some environmentalists and former federal research scientists expect Obama's White House to break from what they view as the Bush administration's record of overlooking science in favor of politics.LiNeBrEaK Critics - including former EPA Administrator Christie Todd Whitman - have objected to the influence of industry lobbyists and ideologues on administration decision-making.LiNeBrEaK "It's night and day," said Alan Nogee, who directs the Clean Energy Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has accused the administration of silencing and overruling scientists in policymaking.LiNeBrEaK Meanwhile, members of the Obama transition team said Obama has settled on two other Cabinet choices, though he did not announce them formally yesterday.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Metro Edition	YOU MIGHT BE A LIBERAL  	John Sappington  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B9  	734 words  	The Associated Press reported "top leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., promise not to lurch to the left and give in to pent-up demands from party liberals." The wording suggests that Pelosi, prom queen of the left, knows some liberals but doesn't count herself among them. Here is a major oddity of politicians; most admit liberals exist but few confess to being one.LiNeBrEaKIt's not that hard to identify liberals. They're far enough left to be in the gravitational pull of Karl Marx; they can't say "capitalism" without sneering, and they think Sarah Palin's wardrobe was second only to the economy as a campaign issue. Liberals divide the world into oppressors and victims. Police are oppressors, lawbreakers their victims. Corporations are oppressors, laborers their victims. Men are oppressors and . . . we get it. The caboose on this train of thought is that victims can break the shackles of tyranny by voting Democrat. LiNeBrEaKJeff Foxworthy observes that rednecks can't always recognize themselves either, so he provides clues. You might be a redneck if a tree is growing through the windshield of your Edsel, etc. Foxworthy's format could also help liberals with self identity. Read these propositions for believability:LiNeBrEaKAmerica is wrong and evil. Bush is just like Hitler. Republicans are the rich and Democrats are the poor. Republicans are stupid and Democrats are smart. Therefore the rich are stupid and the poor are smart.LiNeBrEaKWars in Afghanistan and Iraq were created to funnel money from hard-working people to Halliburton Corp. Four thousand combat deaths is an abomination but millions of fetal deaths are the right of every mother. We won't need a military after we stop bullying other nations. Islamic zealots will renounce jihad when the party of Rosie O'Donnell, Sean Penn, Michael Moore and Joy Behar apologizes to them. United Nations' resolutions defeat armed conflict and genocides.LiNeBrEaKCapitalism is evil unless you're Hillary Clinton playing the commodities market. It's obscene that corporate CEOs receive fortunes. Fortunes are for attorneys who sue corporations. Bill Clinton deserves $250,000 per speech. The rich hide billions in their basements like Scrooge McDuck so poor people can't have any. Personal responsibility for education, effort and budgeting are irrelevant to success. Poverty is about prejudice and bad luck. The lucky should be forced to divide their wealth with the unlucky. Everyone will have more money when taxes increase.LiNeBrEaKSocialism in other nations solves poverty, strengthens the work ethic and promotes self sufficiency. Communist governments invite free speech.LiNeBrEaKAmerican pollution causes global warming, not pollution generated by Russia, India and China. Nuclear energy would reduce greenhouse gases, but it's nasty. Offshore windmills would help too unless they spoil the view from the Kennedy compound. Dependence on foreign oil hurts Americans; therefore, we shouldn't retrieve domestic oil while developing new energy options.LiNeBrEaKSpending billions fighting terror is driving the nation into bankruptcy. Spending billions on medical care and adjudication of illegal aliens stimulates the economy. When jobs are lost it's helpful to have 12 million illegal aliens competing for the remainder.LiNeBrEaKMurderers didn't do anything to deserve cruel and unusual pain when anesthesia fails during lethal injection. If you're male and serving prison time, you deserve it. If you're a minority serving prison time, it's because of prejudice. Judges should create law, not the legislators that we voters elected.LiNeBrEaKDiversity, the celebration of difference, makes us strong except for differences favoring males, Caucasians or Americans. American men are sexist pigs who want women as household slaves. Arab men who drape women from head to foot are practicing their right to cultural relativity. No one should be subjected to hate speech except NRA members, religious people and NASCAR fans.LiNeBrEaKJimmy Carter's role in ousting the shah helped Iran become the nation of peace, equality and tolerance it is today. The myth of Bill Clinton's philandering was created by a vast right-wing conspiracy. Timothy McVeigh was a terrorist; William Ayres is an educational reformer.LiNeBrEaKIf any three of these seems plausible, you might just be a liberal. If so, cool it. Even Nancy Pelosi is afraid of you.LiNeBrEaKJohn SappingtonLiNeBrEaKSappington is a retired professor of psychology who lives in Rockbridge County.

San Antonio Express-News 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   STATEandMETRO Edition	YOUR TURN  		EDITORIAL; Pg. 6B  	484 words  	If you can't take the heatLiNeBrEaKI've been following the evolution versus creation debate with great interest. According to what I have read, evolution is the accepted and settled science and the only possible explanation for the development of life on our planet. LiNeBrEaKIf so, that should also mean we have nothing to fear from global warming. If the average temperature is rising by only one to two degrees every few decades, man and all other life forms will simply evolve and adjust.LiNeBrEaKWhew! What a relief.LiNeBrEaK-- William BoydLiNeBrEaKBelt tightening for allLiNeBrEaKI knew it all along. The Democrats demanded that the auto industry have a plan before receiving a bailout. Now there is a bailout in the works, but no plan. I'm not surprised.LiNeBrEaKThe unions all provide substantial financial support and must now be paid back. We can talk about the evil owners, and they may be culprits also. But the unions don't want to budge on these huge empires that they have built for their workers: large retirement plans, substantial payouts for those who don't even work and excessively high hourly rates.LiNeBrEaKNothing will ever change until the workers are required to take a reduction of pay and benefits. A number of years ago, airline employees volunteered to take big reductions just to survive. All must do so.LiNeBrEaKThe auto industry is not the only industry that is struggling through hard times. Time to tighten the belt, just like everyone else.LiNeBrEaK-- Bud MartinezLiNeBrEaKNo gun show loopholeLiNeBrEaKContrary to your editorial claim ("Border gun traffic feeds cartel violence," Our Turn, Dec. 6), licensed firearms retailers are already required by law to run background checks with the FBI or state police before they can make any sale to a customer. This is true whether the sale takes place at the retailer's main place of business or at a gun show. There is no "gun show loophole." Retailers who illegally and knowingly furnish guns to smugglers should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.LiNeBrEaKThe firearms and ammunition industry has long been committed to helping educate firearms retailers to better detect and prevent illegal purchases through its Don't Lie for the Other Guy program, which will soon repeat in the South Texas region.LiNeBrEaK-- Stephen L. Sanetti, president National Shooting Sports Foundation, Newton, Conn.LiNeBrEaKA matter of prioritiesLiNeBrEaKSeems every time we turn around, we see City Council standing right next to us with their hands out wanting more of our money, from Main Plaza - which required more of our money than we were told - to pay raises for City Council members and a city manager who already makes many times the average person.LiNeBrEaKIn case no one has told the mayor and others, our nation is going through a rough financial period and people are struggling to survive. If Sheryl Sculley really loves this city, why would it take so much money to keep her? I guess her priorities lie in her bank account, not the people of San Antonio.LiNeBrEaK-- Chris Mitchell	BAILOUTS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); RETAILERS (86%); FIREARMS (86%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (86%); CITY GOVERNMENT (83%); CITIES (83%); EVOLUTION THEORY (78%); CREATIONISM (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); WAGES and SALARIES (73%); SMUGGLING (69%); ILLEGAL WEAPONS (69%); GUN CONTROL (69%); PENSION and RETIREMENT PLANS (69%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (69%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (68%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (68%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (68%); POLICE FORCES (65%); CARTELS (64%); AIRLINES (51%)  			SAN ANTONIO, TX, USA (92%) TEXAS, USA (92%); EARTH (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 San Antonio Express-News All Rights Reserved  		NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS (51%)  	A reader enters the evolution debate, saying, with tongue in cheek, that man will evolve in order to deal with global warming.

The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Utahns hopeful for U.S. policy change  	Judy Fahys, The Salt Lake Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	341 words  	Dec. 16--Utah activists are breathing easier with the signal of a dramatic change in national environmental policy under a President Obama.LiNeBrEaK"If we have an [Environmental Protection Agency] that actually understands and appreciates science, then we will have a lot less work to do," said Brian Moench, co-founder of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment. LiNeBrEaKHe said much of his group's work has been to counter a pro-industry, anti-science slant of Bush administration regulations.LiNeBrEaK"This gives us hope public health will be given the priority it deserves."LiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City attorney Joro Walker said the Bush administration had loosened many environmental laws, including one that will allow further degradation of air quality in national parks. The attorney, who represents a wide range of environmental groups for Western Resource Advocates, also welcomed a more science-based orientation for national environmental programs as reflected in the Obama environment and energy team.LiNeBrEaK"It shows a new respect for science and the idea we need to pay attention to experts in the field and the things they are saying," she said.LiNeBrEaKGreg Spencer, president of Holladay-based Blue Source said the appointments reflect "a change of course, a course correction" in climate-change policy. Blue Source, a company that manages carbon offsets, has a business plan that assumed carbon-trading would be mandated someday, and it has been helping companies get into the game forLiNeBrEaKmore than seven years.LiNeBrEaK"It's a central development for carbon trading," he said of the change at the White House, "and the development of alternative energy and renewable fuel technologies."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL Edition	A scientist at last  		Op-Ed; EDITORIALS; Pg. B4  	295 words  	What a concept: a scientist given a leading role on climate change and alternative energy. In place of eight years of denial and avoidance, President-elect Barack Obama is going in a new direction.  LiNeBrEaK"My administration will value science," Obama said Monday. LiNeBrEaKHis choice for energy secretary certainly sends a strong message in that direction. Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate, was picked to run a Cabinet position that will be ground zero for climate change plans, long-range science and alternatives to the gas pump.LiNeBrEaKThe nominee, co-winner of the Nobel for physics in 1997, runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, an idea factory on alternative energy options. Chu, with ties to both Stanford and UC Berkeley, has a zeal for a range of scientific projects and the everyday skills in running a facility with 4,000 employees. LiNeBrEaKHis arrival should revive a federal bureaucracy that has come nowhere near its potential as the nation's chief resource of deep-science experimentation and practical rule-maker on energy options. He's often lamented the steady cost-cutting by both corporations and Washington in supporting research and development work.LiNeBrEaKAs an Asian American picked for a Cabinet spot, he also helps fulfill an Obama pledge for diversity.LiNeBrEaKIf there's a risk, it's that Chu's straightforward style may not necessariy play well in the political arena. In a recent speech, he noted that American households could spend more to to conserve energy in their homes, but they'd rather spend the money "on granite countertops." LiNeBrEaKChu's naming makes it evident the next president wants a credentialed scientist to unleash technology and innovation to solve the challenges of energy independence and global warming. Now it's up to the White House and Congress to provide the money.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	A new direction  	Tribune Editorial  	OPINION; Editorials  	414 words  	Scientists are predicting that the American West will be hit especially hard by the effects of global warming caused by carbon emissions. Evidence of the looming catastrophe is already abundant: more wildfires of increasing intensity, shorter winters with less snowpack, hotter summers and longer droughts, shrinking reservoirs and disappearing groundwater. LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration casually looked the other way or doctored the data for eight years as scientists warned that the climate crisis was real and would only get worse. So we applaud President-elect Barack Obama for assembling a top-notch team of experts to implement science-based policies for energy innovation and conservation. The goal: to move the country away from its climate-changing dependence on fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKNews that the president-elect intends to nominate Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., to head the Department of Interior is good for Westerners worried about the mindless rush to mine oil shale in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado and to open more public lands to drilling rigs and off-road vehicles.LiNeBrEaKObama's choice of Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics, for energy secretary signals an abrupt change from Bush's industry-friendly mantra that America can somehow drill its way to energy independence. Chu's science background is made to order for putting the country on a new course for producing effective anti-pollution technology and quickly getting it on the market.LiNeBrEaKSalazar, a former rancher, is a well-known name among Western conservationists. He has opposed the push for wholesale mining of shale rock for oil, an unproven and energy-inefficient process that can destroy the land and guzzle huge amounts of water. He understands the importance of preserving public lands, the complexities of water law and the growing scarcity of Western water resources.LiNeBrEaKObama has done well by the West in his other Cabinet nominations --- New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as commerce secretary and Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as Homeland Security secretary. As governor of a border state, Napolitano has a proven grasp of immigration issues important to Utah and the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaKEnding America's long addiction to fossil fuels and our related dependence on foreign oil must be combined with reducing the carbon cloud that's strangling the Earth. We believe that Obama, in nominating Chu and Salazar, understands these interrelated missions and their importance to the strength and economic stability of the country.

The Salt Lake Tribune 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Obama announces energy, environment team  	The Associated Press  	BREAKING; News; National; World; Local  	370 words  	Washington &raquo; President-elect Barack Obama on Monday named an environmental and energy team that he said signaled his determination to tackle global warming quickly and develop alternative forms of energy. He vowed to "move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy." LiNeBrEaKObama selected Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol Browner, a confidante of former Vice President Al Gore, to lead a White House council on energy and climate. Browner headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration.LiNeBrEaKChu is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading advocate of reducing greenhouse gases by developing new energy sources.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science. We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKObama also announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaK"We can spark the dynamism of our economy through a long-term investment in renewable energy that will give life to new businesses and industries with good jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced," he said. "We'll make public buildings more efficient, modernize our electricity grid, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while protecting and preserving our natural resources. We must also recognize that the solution to global climate change must be global."LiNeBrEaKObama also has chosen Chicago schools chief Arne Duncan to serve as education secretary, according to sources with knowledge of the decision.LiNeBrEaKDuncan has run the country's third-biggest school district for the past seven years. He's focused on improving struggling schools, closing those that fail, and getting better teachers.LiNeBrEaKObama has not signaled how he will try to fix the country's ailing schools. He has avoided taking sides in a debate between reform advocates and teachers' unions. The choice of Duncan may please the competing factions.LiNeBrEaKTeachers' unions wanted an advocate for their members. Reform advocates wanted someone like New York schools chancellor Joel Klein, who wants teachers and schools held accountable.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Physicist Chu expected to bring new vision to Energy Department  	By Lisa M. Krieger Bay Area News Group  	POLITICS; Science; News; National; Local; Science and Tech  	966 words  	He won the Nobel Prize in physics, rose to leadership posts at Stanford and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was tapped Monday as President-elect Obama's energy secretary, but Steven Chu long considered himself the "academic black sheep" of his family.LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants recalls spending his lunch money to build homemade rockets and fashioning a pole vault out of bamboo from the carpet store. But growing up on Long Island he thought he could never match his siblings' Ivy League academic achievements. LiNeBrEaKYet, there he was Monday, being lauded as a visionary leader who will push America's energy policy into a new era, promoting groundbreaking research into new clean technologies.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science," President-elect Barack Obama said at a news conference. "We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Senate, Chu, 60, would be the first Nobel winner named to the post and the only DOE chief in recent memory to have run a major laboratory. He is expected to take the nation's energy policy in a sharply different direction, strengthening research into advanced biofuels, artificial photosynthesis and other solar energy research.LiNeBrEaKObama also on Monday announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, as chair of the White House Council on Environment Quality; and former Clinton EPA chief Carol Browner as head of a White House council on energy and climate. LiNeBrEaKThe nomination of Chu   who is married to former San Jose State physics professor Jean Chu   was applauded by his scientific colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Throughout his life, and at all points in his career, he goes after near-impossible goals, but with an appropriate sense of what is, and is not, attainable," said Stanford physics professor Steve Harris, who would talk physics with Chu while they mountain biked up to Skyline Drive.LiNeBrEaK"Obama has filled up the cabinet so far with folks who know how to navigate 'inside the Beltway' to get things done,'' said Stanford professor Stephen Schneider, who wrote the influential book on climate change, "Laboratory Earth." "That's fine. But they are not visionary thinkers. Steve Chu is. There will be real dialogue in cabinet meetings."LiNeBrEaKChu's conviction that technology can solve energy problems appeals to some of those in the energy industry as well, although they urged him to be sensitive to the economic impact of his policies.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully he'll take the view that our industry has taken, that we need to use every drop of energy that we can bring to the supply side to ensure that we will continue to have affordable, abundant and reliable energy in a way that does not harm the economy or consumers," said Joe Sparano, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, the main oil industry trade group in California.LiNeBrEaKChu's father, Ju Chin Chu, came to the United States in 1943 to continue his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering. Two years later, Steven's mother, Ching Chen Li, joined him to study economics. When they married in 1945, China was in turmoil so they stayed in the United States.LiNeBrEaKChu grew up in Garden City, N.Y., where his father was a professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. There were only two other Chinese families in town. "But to our parents, the determining factor was the quality of the public school system," Chu wrote in an autobiography for the Nobel Foundation. "Education in my family was not merely emphasized, it was our raison d'&ecirc;tre."LiNeBrEaKAs a young child, he loved building things. He started with plastic model airplanes and warships, then moved to devices "where the main design criteria was to maximize the number of moving parts and overall size," littering the living room with hundreds of nuts, bolts and metal girders.LiNeBrEaKThere were no tennis players in the family, so Chu taught himself to play by reading a book.LiNeBrEaKBut in a family of accomplished scholars, "my performance was decidedly mediocre. I approached the bulk of my schoolwork as a chore rather than an intellectual adventure."LiNeBrEaKGeometry came to the rescue. "Instead of memorizing facts, we were asked to think in clear, logical steps. Beginning from a few intuitive postulates, far-reaching consequences could be derived, and I took immediately to the sport of proving theorems." He embraced advanced placement physics and calculus with the same passion.LiNeBrEaKWith an A-minus average, he was rejected by the Ivy League so enrolled at the University of Rochester. "At least nobody had heard of my brothers and cousins," who had earned a total of two M.D.s, four Ph.D.s and a law degree. "As I prepared to go to college, I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family."LiNeBrEaKHis love affair with physics started with the textbook "The Feynman Lectures on Physics." He came to California for graduate school, working with UC-Berkeley's Eugene Commins, who shared Chu's thrill of fundamental physics. Chu's youthful construction skills came in handy. He recalled that one experiment needed a state-of-the-art laser. "I brashly told him not to worry; I would build it and we would be up and running in no time."LiNeBrEaKFrom Berkeley, he joined Bell Labs, where his work in the field of laser cooling and trapping led to a deeper understanding of the interaction between light and matter   and the Nobel Prize in 1997.LiNeBrEaKHe ascended through the ranks, eventually becoming chairman of the physics department at Stanford and head of the electronics research laboratory at Bell Labs. Since 2004, he has been director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	State panel urges better scrutiny of product chemicals  	The Associated Press  	NEWS  	585 words  	SACRAMENTO - A panel launched by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger wants California to force companies to disclose the chemicals they put in their products and consider their long-term effect on the environment, or risk having them banned from sale in California. LiNeBrEaKThe proposals released Tuesday by the California Green Chemical Initiative would again put California at the forefront of environmental policy.LiNeBrEaKIts six-point plan is an effort to help the state immediately start reducing the toxic chemicals in everything from dish soap to prescription drugs.LiNeBrEaK"We will have authority over products sold in California and we will be able to require the manufacturer to tell us what's in it, and what were the other alternatives they could have used that would be safer. ... I don't know of any other government that has that," said Maureen Gorsen, director of the state Department of Toxic Substances Control, which led the initiative.LiNeBrEaKCompanies will be urged to replace toxic substances with safer ingredients or eventually lose the right to sell them in California - regardless of where they're made, Gorsen said.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger set up the panel of scientists, policy makers and industry officials in 2007 to come up with broad recommendations on how to deal with chemicals. He was seeking a streamlined system rather than the piecemeal legislation being adopted as new problems came up.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger said the policy would mark a change in how people look at household products as varied as children's toys to varnish on wood furniture.LiNeBrEaK"Instead of paying attention to the toxic substances in our everyday products only when it comes time to throw them away in the landfill, we will now pay attention to those substances every step of the way - from when the product is designed, manufactured, used and recycled," the governor said in a statement Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKThe plan also calls for the state to expand its pollution prevention initiatives, add "green chemistry" to public school curriculum and gather international research on toxic products in one central place so the public can access it.LiNeBrEaKThe panel said all products should be weighed by how they affect the air, water and land.LiNeBrEaKTheir proposals come less than a week after state officials adopted sweeping, landmark laws to cut back greenhouse gases in California. Those regulations are expected to transform everything from the way factories operate to the appliances people buy and the fuel they put in their cars.LiNeBrEaKDan Jacobson, legislative director for Environment California, said the plan released Tuesday also would make California a national leader.LiNeBrEaKFor the past eight years, the group has "worked to ban individual chemicals and thus draw attention to the need for greater chemical reform. The plan worked," he said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger already signed laws implementing two of the panel's recommendations: allowing the Department of Toxic Substances Control to start identifying and prioritizing the most toxic chemicals and studying alternatives, and setting up a Web site to give the public more information about toxic chemicals.LiNeBrEaKGorsen said she expects the others will start becoming policy over the next year. Some need further legislation, while others can be implemented by an executive order from the governor.LiNeBrEaKThe state Environmental Protection Agency has not calculated the estimated costs for the state or businesses. Gorsen said the recommendations are still too broad and the chemicals that could be banned are unknown, making it impossible to measure.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	OBAMA READY TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE  	THE INDEPENDENT  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A19  	789 words  	It could be called talking-shop tourism. Representatives of all the countries of the world gather, under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss climate change. They meet in cities that hope to lend their names to international agreements. There was Rio de Janeiro and Kyoto. Last year it was Bali; next year it is Copenhagen. Last week it was Poznan. Apart from introducing the former capital of Greater Poland to a traveling circus of politicians, officials, journalists and hangers-on, what did it achieve? The green movement criticized the conference for doing little about a planetary emergency, apart from talking.LiNeBrEaKOf course, the critics are right, but they are also missing the point. This month was never a good time to hold the conference. The most important event on the route to Copenhagen was never going to be this talking shop, but the inauguration of a new U.S. president next month. Although representatives of the Bush administration were in Poznan last week, they might as well not have been, as they have no authority to commit the world's greatest, and most polluting, power beyond Jan. 20. LiNeBrEaKSo, if it has been a struggle for journalists to find anything new to report from Poznan, and if it has been a struggle for consumers of media outputs to work out whether anything new happened last week, the reason is simple.LiNeBrEaKThe world is waiting for Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKThat does not mean that Poznan was pointless. The politics, economics and technical design of global policy to mitigate the effect of humanity on the climate are headachingly difficult. The frankly tedious detail of how to limit carbon emissions, and to put a price on activity that harms the environment, needs a lot of talking, not all of it newsworthy.LiNeBrEaKBut it is the attitude of the U.S. government that is most important of all, and for once it is no exaggeration to say that, on this issue, President-elect Obama is the most powerful person in the world. What is even more extraordinary, perhaps, is that the early signs from that U.S. constitutional peculiarity, the transition, are hopeful.LiNeBrEaKSome of the more extravagant expectations of candidate Obama are, of course, bound to be disappointed. But the Independent regards the satirical demands of some leftists on the Internet to "Impeach Obama!" as, well, premature.LiNeBrEaKIn any case, on climate change, the embryo Obama administration is preparing for a flying start.LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu, the Nobel physics laureate chosen as energy secretary last week, has an impressive green record. John Podesta, the head of Obama's transition team, is himself the main author of the "green new deal" by which the new administration hopes to create millions of jobs. Initially, we thought that the new team's early action would be limited to expanding renewable energy. Unlike in Britain, wind, wave and solar power has blue-collar support in the U.S. on the grounds that they create jobs that cannot be outsourced abroad.LiNeBrEaKNow, however, it looks as if Obama will do much more. Not only will he go for the "quick win" of boosting green energy at home, but he seems prepared to engage with global negotiations in a way that was quite alien to the outgoing president. At the same time, some middle-sized countries seem to sense a change in mood. Mexico last week committed itself to cutting carbon emissions in half by 2050. Suddenly, the prospect opens up that other countries might find themselves exposed as climate-change refuseniks: Canada, Japan, Australia.LiNeBrEaKThe big-picture deal that needs to be struck at Copenhagen is becoming clearer. The rich countries have to commit themselves to credible deep cuts in carbon emissions. The European Union has led the way. Meanwhile, the developing world has to accept caps on emissions, but in return for money from the rich world - compensation, if you like, for our having pulled up the ladder behind us. We can contain our disappointment at the lack of concrete results at Poznan. What matters is the difference that Obama can make in the year running up to Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaKThe Independent is published in Britain.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   THIRD EDITION	World of difference  		EDITORIAL; Pg. D6  	609 words  	On Monday, President-elect Barack Obama named Steven Chu, winner of the Nobel Prize for physics, as his choice to lead the Department of Energy. It's hard to imagine a greater contrast between Mr. Chu and the man he probably will replace at the energy department, Samuel Bodman.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bodman was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2004. He is a former Texas businessman whose company was one of the Lone Star State's top five polluters. It released 54,000 tons of toxic emissions into the Texas air during 1997 alone. LiNeBrEaKThat was the same year Mr. Chu received the Nobel Prize for the "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light." In an interview last year with The Washington Post, the son of Chinese immigrants said he turned his attention to energy and climate change after earning the Nobel honor. "Many of our best basic scientists (now) realize that this is getting down to a crisis situation," he told the newspaper.LiNeBrEaKAs head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Mr. Chu has been a champion of innovative approaches to solving climate and energy problems. He already has expressed support of a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, as well as for cleaner cars and greener buildings. Under Mr. Bodman and, before him, Spencer Abraham, the Bush administration's approach to energy issues has been summarized best by the chant at last summer's Republican National Convention: "Drill, baby, drill."LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama also named Carol Browner, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Bill Clinton, as senior White House advisor to coordinate environmental and energy policy. He chose Lisa Jackson to head the EPA and Nancy Sutley, who holds a top environmental post in Los Angeles, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKIn the Bush administration, the council has been stocked with former industry lobbyists. Rather than advancing environmental issues, the council frequently has been used to block efforts to address problems and suppress inconvenient scientific findings.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama's nomination of Mr. Chu signals a serious new approach to addressing global climate change. More fundamentally, it signals the return of respect for science and the scientific method in American government.LiNeBrEaKFor the past eight years, the Bush administration has elevated its anti-regulation ideology over science, especially when scientific findings would hamper the pursuit of corporate profits. It also has downgraded scientific, medical and health concerns to curry favor with special interest groups in its political base. Thus, in the area of public health, information on the effectiveness of condoms in combatting sexually transmitted diseases was removed from government websites. When it came to climate change, White House political appointees altered reports by scientists and silenced experts.LiNeBrEaKNow, as the president's term winds to a close, the administration has embarked on a fast-paced anti-regulatory spree. It has weakened the Endangered Species Act, opened public lands to drilling and mining exploitation and approved rules to permit mining waste to be dumped into rivers and streams. No longer is there even any attempt to disguise its anti-environmental actions with such Orwellian labels as "Clear Skies" and "Healthy Forests."LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration's new focus on science doesn't mean that there suddenly will be simple or miraculous solutions to society's most pressing scientific and technoloigical challenges. But it does indicate that the search for solutions will take place in the real world, not one ruled by ideology and wishful thinking instead of scientific principles.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Plan aims to slash emissions  		BUSINESS; Pg. 027  	665 words  	The Corzine administration yesterday unveiled an aggressive plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a document that envisions sweeping changes in what kinds of cars people drive, where development occurs and how electricity in the state is produced.LiNeBrEaKThe 131-page document lays out a blueprint of how the state can achieve ambitious targets for reducing emissions contributing to global warming by up to 80 percent below 2006 levels within 42 years.LiNeBrEaKThe plan was developed under the leadership of former Department of Environmental Protection commissioner Lisa Jackson, who yesterday was formally nominated to be the new administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaKTo meet those goals, the plan outlines more than 30 steps requiring either regulatory or legislative action as well as market-based initiatives to encourage environmentally friendly and greener technologies.LiNeBrEaKIt does not project the cost of undertaking these efforts, some of which call for hefty investments in cleaner sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, and costly retrofitting of old and new buildings to lower their energy consumption.LiNeBrEaKHowever, a study by Rutgers concluded the cost of achieving a reduction to 1990 greenhouse gas levels by 2020 would have a negligible effect on the state's economy, largely because of other initiatives under way to reduce the state's carbon footprint, said Marjorie Kaplan, manager of the Office of Climate Change and Energy at the DEP.LiNeBrEaK"While this plan is still in draft form, it lays out an ambitious vi sion for New Jersey and what we must do to reduce greenhouse gases for the next 40 years," Gov. Jon Corzine said in a statement announcing the release of the plan. Some of the recommendations in it reflect previous policies adopted in the state's new energy master plan and a program designed to encour age low-emission vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThe plan will be the subject of six public hearings in January after which it will be revised and final ized. It is certain to be a contentious issue, given the far-reaching scope of some of its recommendations, such as a recommendation to require 90 percent of develop ment in the state to occur in areas already served by public infrastructure.LiNeBrEaK"It's a good plan overall, but it needs more detail, including how much it will cost," said Jeff Tittel, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club of New Jersey. "A lot of this stuff will be very tough to get through the Leg islature, particularly the land-use and transportation recommenda tions."LiNeBrEaKOne of the more important recommendations to environmental ists is a proposal to impose a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, generally regarded as one of the largest industrial sources of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"From both a global warming and public health perspective, we just cannot allow new coal plants," said David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. He also praised the plan for beginning to address pollution coming from the transportation sector. For in stance, the plan calls for limiting the growth in vehicle miles traveled in the state by no more than 1 percent per year.LiNeBrEaKPringle noted some of the administration's other policies contradict such a goal. "You can't expand the NJ Turnpike and Garden State Parkway and achieve these goals," Pringle said. The state generally sees about a 2 percent growth in vehicle miles traveled each year.LiNeBrEaKThe plan also envisions adoption of policies to promote the use of zero-emission vehicles, such as electric cars, greening the state- owned fleet of vehicles and study ing the feasibility of having an auto insurance policy that provides incentives to consumers to drive less.LiNeBrEaKNot all of the recommendations will be adopted, said Jeanne Herb, DEP's policy director. The draft is aimed at providing a framework, so people will understand the way the economy could be affected to reach the state's aggressive global warm ing goals.LiNeBrEaKTom Johnson may be reached at tjohnson@starledger.com or (973) 392-5972.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Not everyone in Jersey is enamored of EPA pick  	JOAQUIN SAPIEN, PROPUBLICA  	NEWS; Pg. 001  	1287 words  	Lisa Jackson, whom President-elect Barack Obama named yesterday to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, is already being hailed as a historic choice.LiNeBrEaKThe former head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection would be the first African-American EPA chief, and supporters - including many New Jersey environmental leaders - have praised her work ethic, approachability and efforts to regulate greenhouse gases in the state.LiNeBrEaKBut Jackson's critics, including a senior scientist who quit her department in frustration, say she has been too close to industry, has withheld information from the public, and fell well short of the pledge she made when taking office in early 2006 to fix the state's beleaguered toxic waste program.LiNeBrEaK"The most important thing we are doing is developing a new ranking system to prioritize sites so that we focus our resources on the worst cases, those that present the greatest risk to public health and the environment," Jackson told the state Senate in October 2006. LiNeBrEaKBut two years into Jackson's tenure, the new system for cleaning up New Jersey's 16,000 abandoned toxic waste sites still hasn't been deployed.LiNeBrEaK"She identified this as her highest priority, but she never followed through," said Jeff Ruch, executive director of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a nonprofit group whose members often push for more aggressive governmental action on environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKA DEP spokesperson said the system is being tested and should be ready within a year. Jackson did not respond to repeated requests for comment.LiNeBrEaKIn a report released this summer, the EPA's inspector general criticized New Jersey's failure to clean up several toxic-waste sites in a timely manner, and accused the DEP of going easy on polluters. The report concluded the department was at least partly responsible for not implementing agreements on "cleanup milestones, agency responsibilities and enforcement actions."LiNeBrEaKThe report recommended that the EPA take over cleanup at seven sites, including the former American Cyanamid complex in Bridgewater, the former Brick Township Landfill, and the Jones Industrial Services Landfill in South Brunswick. It was a surprising recommendation, considering the inspector general had consistently faulted the federal agency's handling of toxic Superfund sites.LiNeBrEaK"If the EPA is saying that New Jersey's enforcement is bad, you know there is a serious problem," said Robert Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association, which monitors Superfund sites in the state. Spiegel said he had urged Jackson to take action on the sites, and that Jackson's field staff had done the same, but their pleas had been ignored.LiNeBrEaKNew Jersey, long a center for the chemical manufacturing industry, has 115 Superfund sites, more than any other state. Cleanups have been finished at 22.LiNeBrEaKIn a written response to the inspector general report, the state's director of hazardous waste said, "New Jersey's new proposed reforms may be a model for other states when looking to improve their cleanup programs."LiNeBrEaKTWO HOT SPOTSLiNeBrEaKCritics of Jackson's approach also have focused on what they see as her weak response to two contaminated New Jersey sites. The first involves a multimillion-dollar condominium community in Jersey City built on top of land that has high levels of chromium, a carcinogen. In September, a division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study concluding that people who live near the chromium-contaminated sites have higher rates of lung cancer.LiNeBrEaKA DEP scientist, Zoe Kelman, quit out of frustration over what she saw as Jackson's lax response to the contamination.LiNeBrEaK"I had high hopes when Jackson took over," said Kelman, who had been a chemical engineer for the state. Kelman said Jackson "ignored" a 50-page letter Kelman wrote about flaws she saw in the cleanup plan. "I was perplexed that someone with her background would not be able to understand the issue, and recognize that we should be erring on the side of caution," Kelman said.LiNeBrEaKThe department did respond to Kelman's letter, saying she was criticizing standard scientific processes used to determine risk.LiNeBrEaKThe other case that critics focus on is Kiddie Kollege, a day care center built inside an abandoned thermometer factory in Gloucester County. More than 30 children there were exposed to mercury, a neurotoxin that slows brain development in children.LiNeBrEaKIn August 2006, Jackson asserted that "inspectors moved in, took samples and shut it down" when they discovered mercury.LiNeBrEaKBut the New York Times reported shortly afterward that an internal memo showed the department had known of contamination at the site for years. Inspectors found out that the building was being used as a day care center in April 2006, but didn't shut it down until that July.LiNeBrEaKJeff Tittel, who heads the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, blames Jackson's predecessor - Bradley Campbell - for removing the site from the state's list of contaminated sites.LiNeBrEaK"Under Jackson, an inspector went out there on his own time and found out that there was a day care center there," Tittel said. "Did it take longer than it should have? Maybe, but the government doesn't always move as quickly as we would like it to."LiNeBrEaKHIRING OF A LOBBYISTLiNeBrEaKMany state environmental advocates say Jackson inherited most of the department's problems from previous commissioners, and from staff cuts made under Gov. Christie Whitman, who went on to become EPA administrator herself under President Bush.LiNeBrEaK"The department in charge of hazardous waste used to have 270 people, now they are down to 150," Tittel said.LiNeBrEaKJackson's staffing decisions also have been criticized. As an example of her ties to industry, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility points to her 2006 appointment of Nancy Wittenberg, a former New Jersey Builders Association lobbyist, as assistant commissioner environmental regulation.LiNeBrEaKPEER filed a petition with the department for details on its meetings with lobbyists, but the department rejected the petition.LiNeBrEaKJackson's supporters defend her record and instead point a finger at Gov. Jon Corzine. They say that while Corzine has offered lofty rhetoric about environmental goals, he has not helped Jackson accomplish them. (Jackson left the department to take a job as Corzine's chief of staff at the beginning of this month.)LiNeBrEaK"Corzine just has different priorities, and if the leader isn't willing to lead, it is hard for somebody that's been appointed to take the reins," said Amy Goldsmith, policy director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation.LiNeBrEaKA Corzine spokesman declined comment.LiNeBrEaKOthers point to Jackson's work on climate change as an example of why she would make a great EPA chief.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Corzine signed the Global Warming Response Act, which aims to cut greenhouse gases in New Jersey 80 percent by 2050. In naming Jackson to the job, Obama yesterday made specific reference to Jackson's role in making New Jersey "a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions."LiNeBrEaKBut Ruch argues that the DEP failed to meet crucial deadlines for drafting procedures to actually implement the law.LiNeBrEaK"As a result, despite much ballyhoo, New Jersey does not have a coherent game plan for achieving its climate change goals," Ruch wrote in a letter to Obama opposing Jackson's nomination.LiNeBrEaKAgain, New Jersey environmentalists come to her defense.LiNeBrEaK"No one worked more on this issue than my group, and if we thought missing that deadline was a huge concern, we would have criticized it, and we didn't," said Dena Mottola, executive director of Environment New Jersey.LiNeBrEaKThis story was reported and written by ProPublica, a nonprofit group specializing in investigative reporting.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	Obama fills the rest of his green team  		NEW JERSEY; Pg. 020  	352 words  	WASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama yesterday named an environmental and energy team that he said signals his determination to tackle global warming quickly and develop alternative forms of energy. He vowed to "move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy." LiNeBrEaKObama selected Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, 60, as energy secretary and Carol Browner, 53, a confidante of former vice president Al Gore's, to lead a White House council on energy and climate. Browner headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration.LiNeBrEaKObama made those announcements, and the selection of Deputy Los Angeles Mayor Nancy Sutley to chair the White House Council on Environment Quality, at the same time he presented Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as his choice for EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaKChu is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading advocate of reducing greenhouse gases by developing new energy sources.LiNeBrEaKThe selection of Chu, a Chinese-American who shared a Nobel Prize for physics in 1997, received widespread praise on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he looked forward to "confirming Dr. Chu as quickly as possible."LiNeBrEaKObama said at a news conference in Chicago: "His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science. We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKObama made clear he plans take energy policy in a sharply different direction from President Bush's, promising aggressive moves to address global warming and pump money and support into research into alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and biofuels.LiNeBrEaK"America must develop new forms of energy and new ways of using it," he said.LiNeBrEaKObama said the dangers of being too dependent on foreign oil "are eclipsed only by the long-term threat of climate change, which, unless we act, will lead to drought and famine abroad, devastating weather patterns and terrible storms on our shores, and disappearance of our coastline at home."

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Dynamite found in Parisian department store  	Pioneer Press  	NATIONAL  	828 words  	PARIS -- Police acting on a warning Tuesday found a bundle of dynamite inside a Paris department store at the height of the Christmas season, and a group demanding that France withdraw from Afghanistan claimed responsibility. Sticks of dynamite tied together but without a detonator were found in the Printemps department store, a favored shopping destination for tourists and a Christmas season attraction because of its festive window displays. Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said the explosives appeared 'relatively old.' Police said they were found in the third-floor restroom of the menswear department. Five sticks were found together. 'There was no risk of explosion,' the minister said. Epilepsy drugs get warningsLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Drugs used by millions of patients to control epileptic seizures must carry warnings about heightened risks of suicide, federal regulators said Tuesday. The Food and Drug Administration announcement comes almost a year after the agency first said patients taking the drugs have a slightly higher risk for suicide than those taking dummy pills. According to the new language, only about 1 in 500 patients faces an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior while taking the drugs. The new warning emphasizes the risks are about the same among all anti-seizure drugs.Small cars improve in safety LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Small cars, which have become more popular with the fluctuation in gas prices, are becoming better equipped to protect motorists in serious crashes, according to tests released by the insurance industry today. "Automakers have made big improvements to small cars to better protect people in frontal crashes," said Joe Nolan, a senior vice president at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. "They've also added stronger structures and standard head-protecting side air bags to help in side crashes, which are tougher on smaller, lighter cars." Results for the 2009 model year are available at iihs.org .Bus plunge kills 26 in IsraelLiNeBrEaKEILAT, Israel -- A bus filled with Russian tour guides crashed through a roadside barrier Tuesday and tumbled down a steep ravine in southern Israel, killing at least 26 people in Israel's worst traffic accident. Officials said the 60 passengers on the bus had just arrived from St. Petersburg, Russia, to visit potential spots for tours and were heading for Eilat, a popular Red Sea resort. Israel's rescue service said 24 people were declared dead at the scene, and Eilat's hospital said two more died later of injuries. Hospital officials said several more people were in critical condition.Global temperature declinesLiNeBrEaKThe global average temperature fell in 2008 as Pacific Ocean winds caused by the La Nina weather phenomenon helped cool the planet. The worldwide average measured 14. 31 de-grees Celsius (57. 76 Fahrenheit) from January to November, the U.K. government forecaster, the Met Office, said Tuesday. That was 0. 1 degree below 2007 and 0. 21 degree lower than in 1998, the hottest year since global measurements began in the 1800s. The cooling in 2008 may represent a short-term reversal in an overall warming trend; this year is still set to be the 10th-warmest on record.Burglar's description: shortLiNeBrEaKBEAUMONT, Texas -- Texas police responding to a store's burglar alarm found a less-than-hardened criminal inside: He was 4, and playing with the toys. Detective Randy Stevens said the child apparently unlocked a door at his nearby home, got out, then crossed a street to reach the discount store. Store surveillance video showed the unidentified boy trying one of the front doors to a Family Dollar store about 3 a.m. Monday, only to find it locked. But the second door was unlocked, and the child went inside. That triggered the silent alarm.Models bare all in protestLiNeBrEaKPARIS -- Paris City Hall wants to strip art school models of the tips they receive from painters and sculptors -- and the nude models decided they weren't going to take that with their clothes on. About 15 models braved near-freezing temperatures to strip outside the city's cultural affairs bureau Monday to protest a new municipal order that again bans the age-old practice of tipping those who pose nude. The order affects about 100 people. City officials said the tips have long been illegal -- it's just that enforcement has lagged -- and they pledged to discuss ways of boosting the models' pay.Doctor guilty in bomb plotLiNeBrEaKLONDON -- A British-Iraqi doctor was convicted of conspiracy to murder Tuesday for failed car bomb attacks upon nightclubbers and rescue workers in London and airport travelers in Scotland. Prosecutors said he plotted to kill hundreds in revenge for the deaths of loved ones in Iraq. Bilal Abdulla, 29, who is to be sentenced today, was also convicted of conspiring to cause explosions in central London and at Glasgow airport. His co-defendant, Jordanian neurologist Mohammed Asha, 28, was acquitted of playing any role in the plot.LiNeBrEaK-- Associated Press, Bloomberg News	CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DRUGS (90%); EPILEPSY (90%); RETAILERS (90%); RESCUE OPERATIONS (89%); WEATHER (89%); MOTOR VEHICLES (89%); SUICIDE (73%); ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (88%); GLOBAL WARMING (87%); CHRISTMAS (78%); MENTAL ILLNESS (74%); HOSPITALS (74%); INSURANCE (73%); RESORTS (72%); DESTINATIONS and ATTRACTIONS (71%); VEHICLE AIRBAGS (70%); MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY EQUIPMENT (70%); ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES (69%); TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS (69%); MOTORCOACHES and BUSES (67%); AUTOMAKERS (65%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (65%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (65%); INSURANCE ASSOCIATIONS (64%); EL NINO and LA NINA (62%); MEN'S CLOTHING (55%); OIL and GAS PRICES (50%)  		MICHELE ALLIOT-MARIE (57%)  	PARIS, FRANCE (94%); SAINT PETERSBURG, RUSSIA (52%) MINNESOTA, USA (79%); PACIFIC OCEAN (74%); INDIAN OCEAN (69%) FRANCE (94%); ISRAEL (94%); RUSSIA (92%); UNITED STATES (92%); AFGHANISTAN (91%); UNITED KINGDOM (79%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved  				FOOD and DRUG ADMINISTRATION (56%)  											
St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: A world of difference on energy policy  	St. Louis Post-Dispatch  	COMMENTARY  	680 words  	Dec. 16--On Monday, President-elect Barack Obama named Steven Chu, winner of the Nobel Prize for physics, as his choice to lead the Department of Energy. It's hard to imagine a greater contrast between Mr. Chu and the man he probably will replace at the energy department, Samuel Bodman.LiNeBrEaKMr. Bodman was nominated by President George W. Bush in 2004. He is a former Texas businessman whose company was one of the Lone Star State's top five polluters. It released 54,000 tons of toxic emissions into the Texas air during 1997 alone. LiNeBrEaKThat was the same year Mr. Chu received the Nobel Prize for the "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light." In an interview last year with The Washington Post, the son of Chinese immigrants said he turned his attention to energy and climate change after earning the Nobel honor. "Many of our best basic scientists (now) realize that this is getting down to a crisis situation," he told the newspaper.LiNeBrEaKAs head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Mr. Chu has been a champion of innovative approaches to solving climate and energy problems. He already has expressed support of a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, as well as for cleaner cars and greener buildings. Under Mr. Bodman and, before him, Spencer Abraham, the Bush administration's approach to energy issues has been summarized best by the chant at last summer's Republican National Convention: "Drill, baby, drill."LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama also named Carol Browner, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Bill Clinton, as senior White House advisor to coordinate environmental and energy policy. He chose Lisa Jackson to head the EPA and Nancy Sutley, who holds a top environmental post in Los Angeles, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKIn the Bush administration, the council has been stocked with former industry lobbyists. Rather than advancing environmental issues, the council frequently has been used to block efforts to address problems and suppress inconvenient scientific findings.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama's nomination of Mr. Chu signals a serious new approach to addressing global climate change. More fundamentally, it signals the return of respect for science and the scientific method in American government.LiNeBrEaKFor the past eight years, the Bush administration has elevated its anti-regulation ideology over science, especially when scientific findings would hamper the pursuit of corporate profits. It also has downgraded scientific, medical and health concerns to curry favor with special interest groups in its political base. Thus, in the area of public health, information on the effectiveness of condoms in combatting sexually transmitted diseases was removed from government websites. When it came to climate change, White House political appointees altered reports by scientists and silenced experts.LiNeBrEaKNow, as the president's term winds to a close, the administration has embarked on a fast-paced anti-regulatory spree. It has weakened the Endangered Species Act, opened public lands to drilling and mining exploitation and approved rules to permit mining waste to be dumped into rivers and streams. No longer is there even any attempt to disguise its anti-environmental actions with such Orwellian labels as "Clear Skies" and "Healthy Forests."LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration's new focus on science doesn't mean that there suddenly will be simple or miraculous solutions to society's most pressing scientific and technoloigical challenges. But it does indicate that the search for solutions will take place in the real world, not one ruled by ideology and wishful thinking instead of scientific principles.

Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Washington)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Energy secretary nominee boon to PNNL  	Annette Cary, Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	943 words  	Dec. 16--Stephen Chu's nomination as energy secretary may be good for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, but how Hanford might fare under his leadership is tougher to predict.LiNeBrEaKScientists at national laboratories will "have a distinguished peer at the helm," President-elect Barack Obama said Monday as he formally announced Steven Chu as his pick for energy secretary.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science, we will make decisions based on the facts and we understand that the facts demand bold action," Obama said during a news conference in Chicago. LiNeBrEaKChu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, is the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California and is known for his advocacy of developing energy sources that will not add to greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKHe will bring an appreciation of the role of the national laboratory system to the Department of Energy, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said in a statement.LiNeBrEaK"This will be helpful in continuing to ensure that Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has the resources needed to provide high tech jobs in our state and to continue developing pioneering security solutions for our country," she said.LiNeBrEaKChu is passionate about several areas in which PNNL has significant expertise and leadership, including finding scientific solutions to combat climate change and creating renewable sources of energy and energy-efficient buildings, PNNL Director Mike Kluse said in a statement.LiNeBrEaK"We believe the Department of Energy, under Chu's leadership, will continue to turn to PNNL as it increases U.S. energy capacity, reduces dependence on imported oil, prevents and counters terrorism and creates sustainable systems," he said.LiNeBrEaKChu listed DOE responsibilities at the news conference as supporting research that will lead to innovation in energy in the private sector, nurturing broad based research that will be essential to the nation's prosperity and providing scientific leadership to minimize the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons.LiNeBrEaKMurray plans to meet with him in the coming weeks to discuss an additional responsibility, "the legal and moral obligation we have to cleaning up the Hanford nuclear reservation," she said.LiNeBrEaK"I will be meeting with Dr. Chu to discuss the importance of a robust national budget for (DOE) environmental management that will keep Hanford cleanup on track," she said. "I will also ensure that he knows the importance of coming together with the state to resolve differences over the Tri-Party Agreement so that we meet important cleanup deadlines."LiNeBrEaKIt will be important for a deputy secretary to be named under Chu who understands the importance of Hanford cleanup and the work remaining to be done, said Gary Petersen, TRIDEC vice president of Hanford programs.LiNeBrEaKRep. Doc Hastings, R-Wash., said he has had productive relationships with energy secretaries under the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and expects that to continue with Obama.LiNeBrEaKChu's background as a scientist with management experience should serve DOE well, Hastings said in a statement. He said he'll be working with Chu to ensure Hanford cleanup is a top priority and that PNNL has the resources it needs.LiNeBrEaKThe Tri-City Development Council sees both advantages and disadvantages to Chu's nomination.LiNeBrEaKHe is expected to oppose opening a national repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., which has been planned as the disposal site for Hanford's high-level radioactive waste once it has been turned into sturdy glass logs at the vitrification plant under construction.LiNeBrEaKBut Chu supports nuclear energy and reusing spent commercial nuclear fuel, Petersen said. Not only does that bode well for the Tri-Cities, but his push for other clean energies also holds promise here, Petersen said.LiNeBrEaKThe Tri-Cities and the region are "almost a centerpiece for energy," he said. It has production or research being conducted in nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, carbon dioxide sequestration and biofuels.LiNeBrEaK"Now the trick is to make sure the new secretary of energy recognizes that," he said.LiNeBrEaKMurray said she would be working in the coming months to ensure that federal investments in creating green jobs will be made in Washington.LiNeBrEaKChu faces a difficult task as he balances the need for clean and affordable energy supplies, safeguarding the nation's nuclear stockpile, maintaining the United States as a leader in science and technology and cleaning up Hanford and other Cold War nuclear sites, said Bush's Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman in a statement.LiNeBrEaKBut after working with Chu for four years Bodman has confidence Chu will bring the needed leadership, vision and scientific expertise to the job, he said.LiNeBrEaKAlso Monday, Obama named Carol Browner, Nancy Sutley and Lisa Jackson as his picks for other key energy and environment jobs. Browner, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, would coordinate White House energy and climate policy; Sutley, deputy mayor for energy and environment in Los Angeles, would be the chairwoman of the White House council on Environmental Quality; and Jackson, a former New Jersey environmental protection commissioner, would be the EPA administrator.LiNeBrEaK* Annette Cary: 509-582-1533; acary@tricityherald.com	ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); TALKS and MEETINGS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); RESEARCH (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); NOBEL PRIZES (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (76%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (74%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (71%); GREEN BUILDING (69%); AWARDS and PRIZES (69%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (66%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (65%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (63%); MILITARY WEAPONS (50%); TERRORISM (50%); BUDGET (50%)  	Construction  	BARACK OBAMA (91%); PATTY MURRAY (69%); BILL CLINTON (50%); GEORGE W BUSH (50%); DOC HASTINGS (50%); STEVEN CHU (85%)  	WEST USA (93%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081216-PK-Energy-secretary-nominee-boon-to-PNNL-1216  	Newspaper  	PK  	2008 Tri-City Herald   															
Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   Final Edition	Obama names energy team  	AP Wire Services  	News; Pg. A8  	347 words  	WASHINGTON (AP) President-elect Barack Obama on Monday named an environmental and energy team that he said signaled his determination to tackle global warming quickly and develop alternative forms of energy. He vowed to "move beyond our oil addiction and create a new hybrid economy." Obama selected Nobel-prize winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary and Carol Browner, a confidante of former Vice President Al Gore, to lead a White House council on energy and climate.  LiNeBrEaKBrowner headed the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration. Chu, 60, is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., and is a leading advocate of reducing greenhouse gases by developing new energy sources. The selection of Chu, a Chinese American who shared a Nobel Prize for physics in 1997, received widespread praise on Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he looked forward to "confirming Dr. Chu as quickly as possible." "His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science. We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action," Obama said at a news conference in Chicago. Obama also announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as EPA administrator, and Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, as chairwoman of the White House Council on Environment Quality. Obama made clear he plans take energy policy in a sharply different direction from President George W. Bush, promising aggressive moves to address global warming and pump money and support into research into alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and biofuels. "America must develop new forms of energy and new ways of using it," he said. Obama said the dangers of being too heavily dependent on foreign oil "are eclipsed only by the long-term threat of climate change, which unless we act will lead to drought and famine abroad, devastating weather patterns and terrible storms on our shores, and disappearance of our coastline at home."

USA TODAY 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday   FINAL EDITION	3 companies stay on alternative-energy path  	Paul Davidson  	MONEY; Pg. 5B  	1193 words  	President-elect Barack Obama has made renewable energy a centerpiece of his plan to resuscitate the U.S. economy and fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKYet the credit crunch and nose-diving energy prices are prompting companies to scale back or cancel alternative-energy projects. In 2008, total spending on clean-energy projects is expected to fall 4% to $142 billion from 2007, research firm New Energy Finance says. But venture capital and private-equity firms are still investing in emerging technologies, it says. This year, such investments will increase to $14. 2 billion from $9. 8 billion in 2007.LiNeBrEaKHere are three companies that are forging ahead:LiNeBrEaKGEOTHERMAL POWER LiNeBrEaKRaser Technologies' hot ideaLiNeBrEaKGeothermal power, which generates electricity by tapping a virtually limitless reserve of the Earth's natural heat, is perhaps the most promising renewable energy. But the richest and most accessible resources are dwindling, and it typically takes five to 10 years to build a plant.LiNeBrEaKStart-up Raser Technologies aims to solve both problems.LiNeBrEaKIts modular design makes building a geothermal plant as simple and quick as putting up a house. And it can use cooler, more widely available water, which increases the number of potential sites.LiNeBrEaKThe company recently completed a 10-megawatt geothermal plant -- enough to power about 9,000 homes -- in six months. By year's end, it plans to start selling electricity from the Thermo, Utah, facility to the city of Anaheim, Calif.LiNeBrEaKRaser and its supplier, UTC Power, want to build another seven generators in the western United States by the end of 2009. It says they can churn out a jaw-dropping eight to 10 plants a year for at least the next decade.LiNeBrEaK"I call it Lego ... building-block style," says Raser CEO Brent Cook.LiNeBrEaKGeothermal makes up 3% of the nation's renewable energy,  according to the Geothermal Energy Association. Geothermal, unlike wind and solar, makes power around the clock.LiNeBrEaKDevelopers typically drill for water that's at least 350 degrees Fahrenheit; most is in the West. As it's pumped from the ground, the hot water turns to steam, which cranks a turbine.LiNeBrEaKA relatively new binary process uses cooler water -- 250 to 300 degrees -- to heat a refrigerant that vaporizes at lower temperatures. UTC Power says it can tap water as tepid as 165 degrees.  "There are a lot more low- and moderate-temperature resources than higher-temperature resources," says Joseph Moore of  the Energy and Geoscience Institute at the University of Utah.LiNeBrEaKRaser and UTC executives realized they could streamline the process by simply using air conditioners.  For the Utah plant, UTC combined off-the-shelf air conditioners from its Carrier division, the nation's top air conditioning supplier, with generators and turbines to mass produce 50 units. In the meantime, Raser drilled wells, laid the foundation and installed wiring at the Utah site.LiNeBrEaKThen UTC delivered 50 systems in just 10 days.LiNeBrEaK"I've seen projects studied to death," Cook says. "This gave us the business courage to say, 'Let's go ahead and do this project.' "LiNeBrEaKWIND ENERGYLiNeBrEaKDesign maximizes gustsLiNeBrEaKMore wind, more electricity. Right?LiNeBrEaKWrong.LiNeBrEaKA big drawback of wind energy is that generators operate at a steady speed regardless of how hard the wind blows. That means energy is wasted when gusts are too weak or too strong.LiNeBrEaKA Vancouver, British Columbia-based start-up called ExRo says it has a solution. It has invented a variable-speed generator that fluctuates with the wind. ExRo CEO John McDonald says the new generator can boost power output 20% to 50%, slashing electric rates.LiNeBrEaK"Alternative energy is still far too expensive," McDonald says. "What we're attempting to do is materially reduce the cost per kilowatt hour."LiNeBrEaKWind makes up about 1% of U.S. power generation and has been growing about 45% a year.LiNeBrEaKHere's how a wind turbine works: Wind turns the blades, which spin a shaft. The shaft rotates copper coils that generate electric current when they pass by magnets. But the coils and magnets run at a set speed. So if wind speeds are too low, a gearbox must use power from the turbine to spin the shaft faster, wasting electricity. Similarly, the generator can't handle strong winds that would make the shaft spin too rapidly. So blades are positioned to let much of those gusts pass by.LiNeBrEaKExRo Chief Technology Officer Jonathan Ritchey has devised a generator with  54 coils and magnets that work independently. If the wind is weak, only a couple of coils rotate. If it's strong, they all kick in.LiNeBrEaKThe company has raised $1. 5 million in seed money and is seeking $10 million next year for field trials. McDonald expects to team with manufacturers and start turning out generators in 2010. "No matter what the wind does, we have the right size generator at peak efficiency," he says.LiNeBrEaKSOLAR SYSTEMSLiNeBrEaKMaking solar affordableLiNeBrEaKHere's a way to bring down the cost of that $35,000 solar system you're thinking of putting on the roof of your house: Turn the solar system into your roof.LiNeBrEaKInstallation fees now make up about 30% of the price of solar panels. Panels, after all, must be individually mounted with racks and frames. Letting them double as roof tiles or building facades can eliminate those fees.LiNeBrEaKFor 10 years, about a dozen companies have been laminating or gluing panels directly onto the roofs of homes or businesses as they're built.  Sometimes solar cells are embedded within glass facades of office buildings.LiNeBrEaKYet this segment of the solar business -- known as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) -- makes up less than 5% of the industry, partly because systems are pricey, says consultant Paul Maycock of Photovoltaic Energy Systems.LiNeBrEaKA start-up called HelioVolt aims to jump-start the market with a less costly BIPV system for homes that it says is also more aesthetically appealing. It plans to start churning out panels for roofs and facades at its Austin factory by the end of 2009.LiNeBrEaK"My vision is to change solar from being a retrofit to being an electronic component embedded in the building construction material," Helio CEO B.J. Stanbery says.LiNeBrEaKBIPV providers that target the home market typically use wafers made of expensive silicon as a semiconductor.  Individual solar cells must be electronically linked to form modules as large as 36 square feet. The links create grid-like lines on solar panels.LiNeBrEaKWhen a manufacturer builds a smaller module that doubles as a roof tile, it reduces efficiency and increases cost.LiNeBrEaKHelioVolt, by contrast, is a thin-film solar maker that uses a fraction of the semiconductor found in silicon wafers, slicing costs.LiNeBrEaKAlso, Stanbery says the company creates electronic connections within each solar cell, eliminating the need to combine cells into large modules. As a result, he says, it can build smaller panels that naturally function as roof tiles and are 40% cheaper than current BIPV models.LiNeBrEaKAnd since the electronic links are deeply ingrained within the panels, the lines are virtually invisible, lending the panels a more natural solid gray look.LiNeBrEaK"You have no idea how many people I've talked to where the guy wants to put ... panels on the roof, and the wife says, 'You've got to be kidding. You know how ugly those things are?' " Stanbery says.

LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of nearly 200 nations met in Poland to work on a successor to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that limited emissions of global-warming gases. Little headway was made, and talks ended Saturday.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Obama vowed to try to change that.LiNeBrEaK"America will lead not just at the negotiating table -- we will lead, as we always have, through innovation and discovery," he said at a news conference in which he announced picks for energy and environmental posts.LiNeBrEaKThe nominees are:LiNeBrEaK*Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, for Energy secretary.LiNeBrEaK*Lisa Jackson, who headed New Jersey's environmental agency, for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief.LiNeBrEaK*Nancy Sutley, Los Angeles' deputy mayor for environment, to be chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK*Carol Browner, President Clinton's EPA chief, to coordinate climate and energy issues across the government.LiNeBrEaK"What the world does in the coming decade will have enormous consequences that will last for centuries," said Chu, who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.LiNeBrEaKExpectations are high, both in the U.S. and around the world. At the climate talks, participants had studied the speech Obama gave to state officials just after Election Day about the need to act on global warming, said Robert Stavins, a Harvard University economist who attended the meeting.LiNeBrEaKMany nations want the United States to "play a leadership role" in early 2009, Stavins said. "It's not a lot of time for the new administration to come up to speed." Adding urgency, nearly 200 nations will meet a year from now to write a new global warming treaty. Before those talks, Obama's advisers must work out how ambitious the treaty should be.LiNeBrEaKThe Clinton administration signed the 1997 treaty but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification.LiNeBrEaKThe timing of the next session poses another challenge: For credibility's sake, the United States wants to take domestic action on global warming before the talks, said Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank.LiNeBrEaKObama has said he wants to cut emissions of the gases that cause global warming -- which are produced by the burning of coal and gasoline -- by 80% by 2050.LiNeBrEaKTo do so, Obama will need Congress to pass a law. Democrats control both houses of Congress, but there is division within the Democratic Party over how to tackle climate change.LiNeBrEaK"Congress is by no means in agreement," said Jonathan Pershing of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. "Getting 60 votes will be hard," referring to the number of senators needed to stop opponents from tying up legislation.LiNeBrEaKThe circumstances are the best they've been for passing legislation, said Steve Cochran of the Environmental Defense Fund, but the economic downturn makes the situation dicey. "It is very difficult to effect change when people are scared," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn a related appointment, the Associated Press reported that Obama will tap Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., this week to be his Interior secretary. The wire service cited an unnamed Democratic source who asked for anonymity to avoid pre-empting Obama's announcement.

The Washington Times 		December 16, 2008 Tuesday 	Greens grapple with economy for Obama priority;  Energy team emerges 	By Valerie Richardson, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	PAGE ONE; A01  	1012 words  	Environmentalists fear their top priority - a national climate-change policy - will be sidetracked in Congress by concerns over the slumping economy.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has said the policy is a "matter of urgency" and furthered his commitment on Monday by naming the top members of his energy and environment team. He said the team would lead his drive toward renewable energy and away from oil and would coordinate the often interlocked domains of energy and climate policy.LiNeBrEaKYet the green lobby, filled with optimism after the election of a Democratic president and a Democrat-controlled Congress, now sees the expanding meltdown of the economy as a major obstacle. LiNeBrEaK"One thing we face is the inaccurate assessment that additional environmental concerns will affect the economy the wrong way," said Tony Iallonardo, public-policy communications director for the Audubon Society. "Overcoming some of that will be a challenge, and that's what we're trying to do."LiNeBrEaKRoger Schlickeisen, chief executive officer of the Defense of Wildlife Action Fund, said critics should remember that economic activity depends on a healthy planet.LiNeBrEaKAt a minimum, he said, a federal policy on climate change should call for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050, more so if technological advances allow it.LiNeBrEaK"It is the living natural world that provides for our [gross national product]," Mr. Schlickeisen said. "If we let that biodiversity diminish, we will be perilously undermining our economy. You can't have a strong economy without a healthy environment."LiNeBrEaKWhether most Americans agree with that connection is another matter. "I don't think they do," he said. "That's part of the education problem."LiNeBrEaKA coalition of 27 leading environmental groups last month released a report, "Transition to Green," aimed at providing an environmental blueprint for the Obama administration. The 391-page document, which offers recommendations on a host of environmental issues, refers to the promise of a green economy led by the renewable-energy industry.LiNeBrEaK"In November, Americans made their preference clear that the federal government has a critical role to play in unleashing homegrown, innovative energy solutions that would create new jobs, reduce global warming pollution and cut our nation's dependence on oil," the coalition said in a Nov. 25 statement.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, however, coalition members made it clear that their top environmental priority remains climate change. The solution, they say, is a federal policy that would feature a carbon cap-and-trade system aimed at reducing emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Such a system is critical to address climate change and raise revenue needed to transition to a clean energy economy," the statement said.LiNeBrEaKAnd there's the rub, critics said. Placing restrictions on automobile, airplane and industrial emissions or charging a fee to those unwilling or unable to reduce theirs, isn't exactly a recipe for economic revitalization.LiNeBrEaK"There's no question that invoking a policy that's going to reduce emissions is going to have a damaging effect on the economy, and everybody knows that," said Robin Rivett, president of the Pacific Legal Foundation, a pro-industry group based in Sacramento, Calif.LiNeBrEaK"This administration's top priority is economic recovery," he said. "There's going to be a tremendous backlash if you put global warming at the top of the agenda. We're going to have a very strong economy before you can regulate business in that way."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups already have moved to curb emissions through the Endangered Species Act. Earlier this year, they scored a key victory when the Fish and Wildfire Service agreed to list the polar bear as a threatened species because of threats to its habitat caused by climate change.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama's announcements Monday included Carol M. Browner, who was Environmental Protection Agency administrator in the Clinton White House. Taking the new post as White House energy and environment coordinator, Mrs. Browner will be in charge of integrating the often disparate federal agencies that deal with energy and climate policies.LiNeBrEaKLisa M. Jackson, New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine's chief of staff and former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, was picked to head the EPA. Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Nancy Sutley was selected to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"The pursuit of a new energy economy requires a sustained all-hands-on-deck effort because the foundation of our energy independence is right here in America, in the power of wind and solar, in new crops and new technologies, in the innovation of our scientists and entrepreneurs and the dedication and skill of our work force," Mr. Obama said Monday.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists and Democratic congressional members widely lauded the naming of the "Green Dream Team" on Monday. Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman Barbara Boxer, California Democrat, called the group "exciting and experienced."LiNeBrEaKDavid Hayes of the World Wildlife Fund and John Leshy, who served as solicitor general under President Clinton, are members of the Interior Department transition team and have been mentioned as candidates for interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKThose names have already run into resistance from groups concerned about the economic effects of the Obama administration's policies. The American Land Rights Association has issued an alert to its largely rural members urging them to lobby their senators against the appointment of any Clinton administration alumni.LiNeBrEaK"You do not want to have to fight for survival in a new Obama War on the West," the alert said.LiNeBrEaKChuck Cushman, who heads the group, predicted "a hard next four years" for rural communities that depend on mining, ranching and other environmental bete noires for their survival. At the same time, he said, no one really knows what Mr. Obama will do.LiNeBrEaK"Obama's a very interesting guy," he said. "The jury is still out on whether Obama has it in his heart to carry out the culture war the environmentalists want him to carry out."LiNeBrEaK* Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: Obama moves left  	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	463 words  	Dec. 15--With his choices of top aides in the areas of economics and national security, President-elect Barack Obama veered toward the center of the Democratic Party, appointing mostly people who initially supported the misbegotten Iraq war (and keeping nominal Republican Robert Gates on) to national security posts and people with Clinton-era experience to positions dealing with economic issues. In fact, certain elements of the "netroots" and the markedly leftist wing of the party were showing a certain amount of restiveness. LiNeBrEaKWith his choices in the energy and environmental fields, however, he is should put such discontent to rest. As the ever-so-green Web site Forecast Earth put it, these choices "suggest Barack Obama is going to be progressive where it really counts."LiNeBrEaKStephen Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, former chair of the physics department at Stanford and the 1997 Nobel Prize winner in physics, certainly seems qualified to be Secretary of Energy (if there should be such a position). He heads a laboratory that is part of the Department of Energy, so he is likely to know some of the ropes already.LiNeBrEaKIt should concern taxpayers, however, that in addition to having developed a keen concern about climate change in the last few years, he is an enthusiastic advocate of aggressively developing non-petroleum alternative fuels. Besides funding research, that is likely to include major taxpayer subsidies.LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency for eight years under Clinton, will fill a new White House post overseeing and coordinating energy, environmental and climate change policies. She was brought into the Clinton administration by Al Gore. Does she share his extreme views on the need to get rid of petroleum-based energy in 10 years?LiNeBrEaKLisa Jackson, now chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, is slated to head the EPA. Nancy Sutley, now a Los Angeles deputy mayor for environmental affairs, will chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Their experience suggests that their skills are more political than scientific.LiNeBrEaKThe financial crisis suggests modesty in expanding programs and regulations that increase the cost of doing business. Obama's choices in energy and environmental affairs suggest a more aggressive, expensive and probably ineffective approach.

The Arizona Daily Star (Tucson)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	UA professor helps lead climate-change push  	Evan Pellegrino, The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	452 words  	Dec. 15--Scientists say climate change is inevitable and, thus, humans will need to adapt.LiNeBrEaKThree of the nation's leading climate-change experts, including Jonathan Overpeck, a University of Arizona geosciences professor, will hold a news conference today in San Francisco to address policy changes needed for life in warmer and drier weather. LiNeBrEaK"The purpose of the conference will be to prepare local and regional stake-holders for climate change," said Overpeck, co-director of the UA's Institute for Environment and Society, a campus research coalition.LiNeBrEaKOverpeck said the aim of the conference will be to persuade the scientific community and the federal government to be responsive to the needs of people whose jobs will be affected by climate change, like water managers, forest managers, public heath officials, ranchers and farmers.LiNeBrEaK"We need to provide them with sustained efforts and information so that they will be able to meet their job requirements," Overpeck said.LiNeBrEaKThere is no place more ready to serve as an example than the Southwest because the region has seen climate change already and is familiar to warm weather with less water, he said.LiNeBrEaKOverpeck said he will speak on what is necessary to get the nation to focus on the matter and address the essential elements to meet the challenge of climate change in different regions in the United States.LiNeBrEaK"We need to anticipate, plan and adapt," Overpeck said.LiNeBrEaKThe conference is part of the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The panel on climate-change adaptation is organized by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.LiNeBrEaK"Scientists are becoming more and more a part of policy change because they have the information needed," said David Hosansky, a spokesman for the conference's organizers.LiNeBrEaK"Many cities and states are starting to take steps to adapt and plan for issues resulting from the impact of climate change," he said, noting challenges like the rising cost for emergency services during heat waves, providing clean drinking water and concerns regarding sewage systems.LiNeBrEaK"The goal is for more coordination and communication to prepare for the changes."LiNeBrEaK--Contact NASA Space Grant intern Evan Pellegrino at 573-4125 or at epellegrino@azstarnet.com	CLIMATE CHANGE (92%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); METEOROLOGY (89%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (89%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (89%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (89%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (77%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (77%); WATER SUPPLY UTILITIES (74%); PRESS CONFERENCES (72%); WATER QUALITY (67%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (55%)  	General  		TUCSON, AZ, USA (92%) ARIZONA, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 15, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081215-AZ-UA-professor-helps-lead-climate-change-push-1215  	Newspaper  	AZ  	2008 The Arizona Daily Star   		MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)  		UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA (84%); AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION (54%)  											
Bluefield Daily Telegraph (West Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Project taking CO2 to new depths  	Bill Archer, Bluefield Daily Telegraph, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	845 words  	Dec. 15--BLUEFIELD, Va. -- The secret to addressing the growing concerns over carbon dioxide emissions and the so-called "greenhouse effect" may lie deep beneath the surface of the earth -- deeper than perhaps even Jules Verne would have dreamed.LiNeBrEaKA joint public-private partnership that includes the Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research at Virginia Tech and a Tazewell County, Va., geological firm, Marshall Miller and Associates are on the verge of plunging a probe deep into the earth, into rock strata that was formed more than 300 million years ago, and depositing the noxious byproduct of burning coal -- CO2 -- as a permanent solution to part of the emissions problem that contributes to global warming. While disposing of the CO2 stood as part of the initial reason for the center's Russell County, Va., test project, the science behind the project may produce a beneficial byproduct in itself -- the release of natural gas trapped in the coal seams. LiNeBrEaK"It's kind of a two-for-one package," Marshall Miller said. Miller is chairman and chief executive officer of the geological company he founded in 1975. From its humble origins in Miller's Bluefield, Va., garage, the company has evolved into a global leader in terms of consulting for fossil fuels, transportation, land and mineral development industries.LiNeBrEaK"When we inject the carbon dioxide into the Mississippian aged coal deposits that were deposited 260-340 million years ago, the CO2 will stay there permanently," Miller said. "The good situation is that out from the coal seam comes a gas, CH4, (methane) that gives you additional fuel."LiNeBrEaKMiller said that new equipment that can drill holes thousands of feet below the earth's surface can be used to inject the carbon dioxide into the coal seams. "The CO2 loves that (Mississippian) formation and stays down there forever," Miller said. "We have studied it before and the Russell County test project has gone quite well.LiNeBrEaK"Global warming is an issue that often stimulates a lot of discussion," Miller said. "This test project is something that is addressing that."LiNeBrEaKMiller talked with Scott Keim, president of Marshall Miller and Associates, and an expert in the field of carbon sequestration. Miller said that the two agreed that the citizens of the region need to know that "the country needs a lot more power plants, but the country does not need more carbon dioxide," he said. "We've studied the issue and that geological strata that holds the methane gas, uniquely has more of an affinity for the carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK"The gas that comes out when we inject the CO2 is a clean-burning byproduct," Miller said. "When you go down in the earth 4,000 to 8,000 feet, you have flat-line coal beds that will take the CO2 and flush out the CH4. The uniqueness is that they're very well-preserved. This country has not had a new power plant in years. Right now, we have sophisticated equipment that can go down in the earth and inject this CO2."LiNeBrEaKOfficials at the Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research at Virginia Tech are equally excited about prospects for the project, according to Margaret Radcliffe, assistant director for operations. She said the Russell County test site is "the only one testing permanency," in the Southeast Carbon Sequestration Partnership that includes states from Maryland to Texas.LiNeBrEaK"It may be our best chance to store carbon dioxide," Radcliffe said. Scientists have been learning more all of the time about the "characteristics" of the Russell County rock strata. "We're at task 10 of phase 2 of the study to prepare for the larger injection," she said.LiNeBrEaKDr. Michael Karmis, the director of Tech's well-known and highly-successful mine land reclamation project known as the Powell River Project, is heading the VCCER team. Radcliffe said the Russell County project is one of three carbon sequestration projects underway.LiNeBrEaK"Energy consumption in the United States has been going up, and that's not likely to change," she said. She added that coal is one energy source that is capable of meeting a growing demand for energy.LiNeBrEaKVirginia State Senator Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell, has been watching the developments at the center's test site and is excited about the potential of mixing the two concepts of carbon sequestration to permanently store the carbon dioxide and also freeing the methane from the very deep coal seams for possible use in a power plant.LiNeBrEaK"We're pushing for that project," Puckett said. "Congressman (Frederick C. "Rick") Boucher (D-Va.) is also helping us. A power plant like that could bring in 90-100 full time jobs that we can really use," he said.LiNeBrEaK-- Contact Bill Archer at barcher@bdtonline.com	GEOLOGY and GEOPHYSICS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); METHANE (89%); COAL INDUSTRY (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); ENERGY RESEARCH (76%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (76%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (76%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (76%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (76%); PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (72%); POWER PLANTS (71%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (56%)  	General  		EARTH (93%); VIRGINIA, USA (92%); WEST VIRGINIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  	20081215-WF-Project-taking-CO2-to-new-depths-1215  	Newspaper  	WF  	2008    															
The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: Future  	The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	COMMENTARY  	518 words  	Dec. 15--CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- While Congress and the White House sweat over multibillion-dollar bailouts for Detroit's gasoline car industry, a different future might be taking shape, barely noticed. LiNeBrEaKElectric cars seem poised to become a major part of U.S. life -- fulfilling Barack Obama's vow to break America's dependency on Mideast oil, plus create new jobs using alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKThe biggest push comes from a Silicon Valley high-tech firm called Better Place (as in "make the world a better place"). The company has secured $200 million in funding from U.S. and Israeli backers, and has sponsored a neat little commuter car, the Rogue, built by Nissan Renault, which gets 100 miles per battery charge.LiNeBrEaKBetter Place envisions an unusual business model: It will own the costly lithium-ion phosphate batteries in the cars, and will set up networks of replacement stations where drivers may stop to exchange for fresh-charged batteries, in the manner that today's drivers stop at gasoline stations. (As a side-effect, this will create a large energy-storing system.)LiNeBrEaKIn the past couple of months, Better Place has entered major agreements to launch operations in several locales. Three California cities -- San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose -- pledged to authorize numerous battery-exchange spots. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger endorsed the plan, implying that it may go statewide.LiNeBrEaKHawaii also signed up for electric cars. So did Israel, Denmark and Australia, so far. All-electric Rogues are expected to cruise these places by 2012 or sooner. The first pilot operation began in Israel this month. As part of the agreement, regions pledge to seek more electricity generated by nonpolluting energy.LiNeBrEaKLast week in The New York Times, columnist Thomas Friedman speculated that electric autos may swiftly displace gasoline ones, rather like digital music via iTunes and iPods overtook the CD music business. Friedman's landmark book, The World Is Flat, outlined rapid economic changes in the high-tech computer age that equalize business opportunity in all parts of the planet.LiNeBrEaKImproved batteries will "make the business model work for electric cars at six cents a mile," Friedman wrote. "The average American is paying today around 12 cents a mile for gasoline transportation, which also adds to global warming and strengthens petro-dictators."LiNeBrEaKBetter Place founder Shai Agassi, a 39-year-old Israeli, declared grandly: "If what I'm thinking is right, this will be the largest dislocation in the history of capitalism."LiNeBrEaKTherefore, while Washington agonizes over how to save Detroit's gasoline car industry, seeds already are sprouting for a different crop that might push Detroit to the fringe.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Congress, public keep focus on energy independence  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1012 words  	WASHINGTON _ Breaking America's foreign-oil addiction was all the rage on Capitol Hill when gas cost $4 a gallon. Now that it's under $2 and falling, history suggests the enthusiasm for alternative fuels and more-efficient cars will subside. It did that in the mid-1970s and again in the '80s and '90s.LiNeBrEaKBut this time could be different. A confluence of factors that didn't exist or played lesser roles in previous "energy independence" efforts has congressional leaders and environmental groups thinking that major action to reduce oil imports and replace fossil fuels may still be possible. The new elements in the equation include increasing public anxiety over global warming, broad enthusiasm for making sure the coming stimulus package has a "green" tinge and repeated vows for action from President-elect Barack Obama. LiNeBrEaKAlso this time, many consumers and oil company executives appear convinced it won't be long before high gas prices come back to stay.LiNeBrEaK"In the past, when the price of oil and gas have dropped, it has caused us to lose our focus" on energy independence, said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who heads the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "I don't think that'll happen this time."LiNeBrEaKRecent opinion polls and exit surveys from the November election back him up, but perhaps nothing illustrates the change in attitudes better than a survey of 52 high-level oil and gas executives released last week by the auditing and consulting firm Deloitte.LiNeBrEaKIt found that less than a quarter of those executives expect oil and gas to be Americans' cheapest energy source in 25 years, and three-quarters say it's a good idea for the country to turn away from fossil fuels for transportation.LiNeBrEaKThat's a "sea shift" for the industry, said Joseph Stanislaw, a Deloitte senior adviser and longtime oil and gas analyst. "People are saying, prices go up and prices go down," he said, "but something's broken here, and we've got to fix it."LiNeBrEaKAmericans have worried about their dependence on foreign oil since the early 1970s, when Arab oil producers stunned the developed world by halting oil shipments. The results were soaring energy prices, long lines at gas stations and an "energy shock" to the economy it took years to recover from.LiNeBrEaKRichard Nixon became the first modern president to offer an energy plan for freeing the nation from dependence on imports within a decade. When the embargo was lifted a year after it began, however, supplies picked up, prices fell and Nixon's Project Independence faded with a whimper.LiNeBrEaKThe cycle repeated for the next 30 years. When oil prices spiked, lawmakers pushed measures to boost wind, solar and other alternative power sources. When prices fell, so did the support for those fuels.LiNeBrEaKToday the United States imports nearly two-thirds its oil, a 50 percent increase from the Nixon years, even though every president in that time has pledged to wean the nation from foreign energy.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKObama, in announcing his energy policy team Monday, noted how presidents for decades had failed to curb the nation's oil addiction.LiNeBrEaK"This time has to be different," he said. "This time we cannot fail. Nor can we be lulled into complacency just because, for now, the price of gas has fallen below $4 a gallon."LiNeBrEaKOil prices hit record heights over the summer, fueled in part by explosive demand in developing nations such as China and India. Both Obama and his GOP opponent, John McCain, promised ambitious plans to reduce oil use, and Americans cut back on driving and demanded more efficient cars to cope with wallet-draining gas prices.LiNeBrEaKThen the global economy slipped rapidly into recession, energy demand ebbed and prices sank again.LiNeBrEaKInstead of backing off his alternative energy push, though, Obama doubled down. Since the November election he has promised to make so-called green projects a cornerstone of the massive economic stimulus plan that will anchor his early agenda. And he repeatedly pledged swift action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, an issue heavily wrapped in the politics of oil.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKObama's concern over global warming is increasingly shared by voters. That's a big difference from the 1970s, said Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat who has urged Obama to focus heavily on energy alternatives. "We weren't paying attention to climate policy the way we are now," Ritter said.LiNeBrEaKClimate change has become "part and parcel" of federal energy policy, said Andy Karsner, a former assistant energy secretary in the Bush administration who is now at the non-profit Council on Competitiveness. "You will see climate, as an issue, embedded in the ongoing energy debate," he said.LiNeBrEaKMany Republicans warn that the economic downturn could make any climate change legislation _ which analysts project would increase household energy costs _ a tough sell.LiNeBrEaKRep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who sits on two key energy committees, cautioned Obama to focus on plans to increase efficiency and boost alternative fuels, which would combat warming and oil dependence. "We ought to be looking for strategies that give us a dual benefit," he said.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists say the opposite: that lower gas prices weaken the argument against a cap-and-trade plan for greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKLawmakers and analysts agree that even with cheaper gasoline, cash-strapped Americans aren't likely to immediately splurge on SUVs or resume the driving habits they learned to curb over the summer. They also agree that prices aren't likely to stay low for long. Once the world economy speeds up, oil demand almost certainly will surge again. As the International Energy Agency declared in a November report, "The era of cheap oil is over."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	'My administration will value science,' Obama promises  	By Jim Tankersley and Tom Hamburger, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1084 words  	WASHINGTON _ With the nomination of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu for energy secretary, President-elect Barack Obama made sure no one missed the message in the resume.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science," Obama said at a Chicago press conference on Monday. "We will make decisions based on facts, and we understand that the facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, headlines a quartet of appointments that also includes former Environmental Protection Agency chief Carol Browner as a coordinator of energy and climate policy, former New Jersey environmental protection commissioner Lisa Jackson as EPA administrator and Los Angeles deputy mayor Nancy Sutley to run the White House Council on Environmental Quality. LiNeBrEaKWith this team, some environmentalists and former federal research scientists expect Obama's White House to break from what they view as the Bush Administration's record of overlooking science in favor of politics.LiNeBrEaK"It's such an incredible contrast, compared to the years of darkness under the current administration, to see a scientist in such a position of authority and influence in the Cabinet," said Alan Nogee, who directs the Clean Energy Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists, which has accused the administration of silencing and overruling scientists in policy-making. "It's night and day."LiNeBrEaKCritics _ including Nogee's organization and former EPA Administrator Christie Todd Whitman _ have complained about the influence of industry lobbyists and ideologues on administration decision-making.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Rep. Henry Waxman is among the Democrats who repeatedly have charged top Bush officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and political advisor Karl Rove, with pressing federal agencies to take positions that put them at odds with their own scientists on energy, global warming and stem cell research.LiNeBrEaKThe critics say many high-ranking scientists have fled federal jobs or have been forced from advisory panels in an effort to tilt agency decision-making to be more favorable to corporate interests or, in at least one case, to help secure the re-election of a Republican.LiNeBrEaKIn 2001, Waxman issued a 40-page report accusing the administration of having "manipulated the scientific process and distorted or suppressed scientific findings." In 2004, 60 prominent scientists accused the administration of "misrepresenting and suppressing scientific knowledge for political purposes."LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, the top climate scientist at NASA, James Hansen, said the Bush Administration tried to gag him from speaking publicly since he gave an academic lecture calling for prompt reductions in greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, the Interior Department's inspector general issued a report detailing how one administrator intervened in at least 13 decisions under the Endangered Species Act. The official's "zeal to advance her agenda has caused considerable harm to the integrity" of the Endangered Species Act program, the inspector general wrote, "as well as potential harm to individual species. Her heavy-handedness has cast doubt on nearly every ESA decision issued during her tenure."LiNeBrEaKJeremy Symons, former climate policy adviser at the EPA, was so shaken after his service as EPA representative to Cheney's Energy Task Force in 2001 that he left government service to become a vice president at the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaK"There was no interest in considering the scientific evidence of the impact our energy policy would have on the environment," Symons said in an interview on Monday. "When science was brought up for discussion, it was dismissed as not important to developing the energy plan."LiNeBrEaKObama stressed the importance of energy and climate policy to the nation's economy and security on Monday _ though he declined, when asked by a reporter, to say when he plans to grant a waiver for California to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKChu, who won his Nobel Prize for developing methods to trap atoms with lasers, has oriented the Berkeley lab to focus on renewable energy and climate change. On Monday he stressed the Energy Department's role in supporting scientists, public and private, and innovations which he said "can transform the entire landscape of energy demand and supply."LiNeBrEaKHis appointment has won wide praise across industries and party lines. Current Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said in a statement that Chu "understands the significance of our energy and environmental challenges, and more importantly, understands the technical solutions necessary to address them . . . I hold him in the highest regard."LiNeBrEaKA leading energy lobbyist said he was "cautiously optimistic" about Chu and his fellow appointees. "I hope they do welcome science first," said Scott Segal of Bracewell and Giuliani in Washington. "But that means being clear about it when the technology isn't ready to solve climate issues. Good science cuts both ways. It also cuts against unrealistic policy proposals that could endanger the U.S. economy."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups lauded the appointees for their commitment to alternative fuels and fighting global warming. They also welcomed them as symbols of science ascendant.LiNeBrEaK"I'm quite sure we'll have policy disputes with the Obama Administration," said Michael Hirshfield, chief scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ocean protection. "But we expect that the facts of the case, whatever the issue is, will be out there more. We expect more transparency. We expect scientists to be able to speak more."LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKReid Detchon, executive director of the nonpartisan Energy Future Coalition, which advocates for renewable energy, said he expected Chu to be the first in a succession of "first-rate scientists" whom Obama will bring in as advisers and restore what Detchon calls eight years of damage to the "scientific apparatus" of the federal government.LiNeBrEaK"What political appointments can do," Detchon said, "political appointments can undo."

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 15, 2008 Monday 	Editorial: Chu will change direction  	MediaNews editorial  	OPINION; Editorials  	389 words  	PRESIDENT-ELECT Barack Obama will demonstrate his commitment to major change on energy policy with his expected announcement of UC Berkeley Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to be the next U.S. energy secretary. LiNeBrEaKAfter eight years of Bush administration policy on global warming in which science has taken a back seat to politics, the Chu appointment signals that Obama is serious about dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and alternative energy development.LiNeBrEaKAs Obama said this week, "The time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way."LiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Berkeley lab since 2004 as well as professor of physics and molecular and cell biology, has emphasized a cross-disciplinary approach to research into finding ways to combat climate change, including development of biofuels and solar energy. He is formerly the head of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKAs director of the Berkeley lab, the oldest of the Energy Department's national laboratories, Chu oversees 4,000 employees and a $650 million budget.LiNeBrEaKHe has pushed the lab to be a world leader in alternative and renewable energy research.LiNeBrEaKHe shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1997 with two other scientists for his research into ways to cool and trap atoms using laser light. By supercooling atoms, they found the movement of atoms can be slowed to a point where they could be trapped and manipulated.LiNeBrEaKChu began focusing his work on energy and climate change after becoming concerned about the growing evidence that global warming is a significant threat.LiNeBrEaKTo be sure, Chu's responsibilities as energy secretary will extend far beyond climate change and alternative energy development. He will also be responsible for overseeing maintenance of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and modernizing the nation's electric power delivery system.LiNeBrEaKWe are confident that Chu, one of the nation's brightest scientists, is up for the task. Indeed, along with the selection of UC Berkeley economics professor Christina Romer to be chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Obama is tapping some of Berkeley's smartest people to be part of his team.

Contra Costa Times (California) 		December 15, 2008 Monday 	Obama taps Bay Area physicist Steven Chu to lead energy department  	By Lisa M. Krieger Mercury News  	EDUCATION; Science; News  	866 words  	He won the Nobel Prize in physics, rose to leadership posts at Stanford and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was tapped Monday as President-elect Obama's Energy Secretary, but Steven Chu long considered himself the "academic black sheep'' of his family.LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants recalls spending his lunch money to build homemade rockets and fashioning a pole vault out of bamboo from the carpet store. But growing up on Long Island he thought he could never match his siblings' Ivy League academic achievements. LiNeBrEaKYet, there he was Monday, being lauded as a visionary leader who will push America's energy policy into a new era, promoting groundbreaking research into new clean technologies.LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science,'' President-elect Barack Obama said at a news conference. "We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Sentate, Chu, 60, would be the first Nobel winner named to the post and the only DOE chief in recent memory to have run a major laboratory. He is expected to take the nation's energy policy into a sharply different direction, strengthening research into advanced biofuels, artificial photosynthesis and other solar energy research.LiNeBrEaKObama also on Monday announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, as chair of the White House Council on Environment Quality; and former Clinton EPA chief Carol Browner as head of a White House council on energy and climate. The nomination of Chu   who is married to former San Jose State physics professor Jean Chu   was applauded by his scientific colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Throughout his life, and at all points in his career, he goes after near-impossible goals, but with an appropriate sense of what is, and is not, attainable,'' said Stanford physics professor Steve Harris, who would talk physics with Chu while they mountain biked up to Skyline Drive.LiNeBrEaK"Obama has filled up the Cabinet so far with folks who know how to navigate 'inside the Beltway' to get things done,'' said Stanford professor Stephen Schneider, who wrote the influential book on climate change, "Laboratory Earth.'' "That's fine. But they are not visionary thinkers. Steve Chu is. There will be real dialogue in Cabinet meetings.''LiNeBrEaKChu's conviction that technology can solve energy problems appeals to some of those in the energy industry as well, although they urged him to be sensitive to the economic impact of his policies.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully he'll take the view that our industry has taken, that we need to use every drop of energy that we can bring to the supply side to ensure that we will continue to have affordable, abundant and reliable energy in a way that does not harm the economy or consumers,'' said Joe Sparano, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, the main oil industry trade group in California.LiNeBrEaK"He is not just sitting in an ivory tower anymore,'' cautioned Frank Maisano, a lobbyist and spokesman for coal-fired power plants. "He'll need to focus on the art of the possible ... and be realistic about the role that coal plays in providing power and jobs.''LiNeBrEaKChu's father, Ju Chin Chu, came to the United States in 1943 to continue his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering. Two years later, his mother, Ching Chen Li, joined him to study economics. When they married in 1945, China was in turmoil so they stayed in the United States.LiNeBrEaKChu grew up in Garden City, N.Y., where his father was a professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. There were only two other Chinese families in town. "But to our parents, the determining factor was the quality of the public school system,'' Chu wrote in an autobiography for the Nobel Foundation. "Education in my family was not merely emphasized, it was our raison d'&ecirc;tre.''LiNeBrEaKAs a young child, he loved building things. He started with plastic model airplanes and warships, then moved to devices "where the main design criteria was to maximize the number of moving parts and overall size,'' littering the living room with hundreds of nuts, bolts and metal girders.LiNeBrEaKThere were no tennis players in the family, so Chu taught himself to play by reading a book.LiNeBrEaKBut in a family of accomplished scholars, "my performance was decidedly mediocre. I approached the bulk of my schoolwork as a chore rather than an intellectual adventure.''LiNeBrEaKGeometry came to the rescue. "Instead of memorizing facts, we were asked to think in clear, logical steps. Beginning from a few intuitive postulates, far-reaching consequences could be derived, and I took immediately to the sport of proving theorems.'' He embraced advanced placement physics and calculus with the same passion.LiNeBrEaKWith an A-minus average, he was rejected by the Ivy League so enrolled at the University of Rochester. "At least nobody had heard of my brothers and cousins,'' who had earned a total of two MDs, four PhDs and a law degree. "As I prepared to go to college, I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family.''

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 		December 15, 2008 Monday   Home Final Edition	Open-minded students ready for future  		EDITORIAL and COMMENT; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. 06A  	292 words  	I have taught English at Columbus State Community College since 1991. Each quarter, as I rate the grades on students' papers, I also review their comments. The makeup of my students' faces has changed remarkably over that time, from native-born Americans -- white and African-American students -- to gradually including Ethiopians, Somalis, Israelis, Palestinians, Greeks, Russians, Syrians, Argentinians, gay and straight, middle-aged and high-school students. LiNeBrEaKIn other words, community colleges have truly become America's melting pot.LiNeBrEaKAs I have led discussions on abortion, on undocumented immigration, on the war on terror, on global warming and on the price of gasoline, there have been heated debates. Apparently there also was listening. \ In looking over final comments from my autumn quarter's students, I'm struck by the comments:LiNeBrEaK* "Politically speaking, I got to hear some different views on current events, not that I agreed per se, but it was nice to hear them."LiNeBrEaK* "Our discussions were often heated but really interesting. (Your class) helped open up my mind to the fact that people constantly have different opinions on a topic."LiNeBrEaK* "I learned that there are various opinions to every issue. Not everybody is going to think the same way; everybody can be right as well as wrong. I learned that no two people think the same, and that's a good thing. We need arguments to keep things interesting. No offense, but class wouldn't have been as entertaining without the arguments. I also learned that people need to be more open-minded about issues."LiNeBrEaK* "Thank you for having important conversations in class and making sure everyone knows that we're all in this together."LiNeBrEaKThat's the comment that keeps me teaching and hoping.LiNeBrEaK\ CHRIS ANDERSON \ Columbus	COMMUNITY COLLEGES (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (78%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (77%); CAUCASIAN AMERICANS (72%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (72%); IMMIGRATION (70%); OIL and GAS PRICES (55%); GLOBAL WARMING (55%); GASOLINE PRICES (55%); HIGH SCHOOLS (73%) Letters  			COLUMBUS, OH, USA (94%) OHIO, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%); SOMALIA (92%); PALESTINIAN TERRITORY (92%); ETHIOPIA (90%); ISRAEL (88%); SYRIA (72%)  	December 15, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  							Letter  								
Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Obama says review found staff had no 'inappropriate' contact with Ill. governor  	By Margaret Talev and Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	864 words  	CHICAGO _ President-elect Barack Obama said on Monday that an internal review confirms that no one on his staff had any "inappropriate" discussions with disgraced Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, but he's postponing release of the full review until next week at the request of federal prosecutors investigating Blagojevich for corruption.LiNeBrEaK"I would ask for your patience because I do not want to interfere with an ongoing investigation," Obama said during a news conference in Chicago, which he called to formally announce his picks to lead energy and environmental policy. LiNeBrEaKHe planned to name his choice to lead the Department of the Interior and some other administration posts later this week before leaving for a family visit to Hawaii.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental activists applauded the selections of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as energy secretary; former Clinton Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner to fill a new White House post dubbed "climate czar" to coordinate or energy and climate policy; Lisa Jackson as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; and Nancy Sutley as chairwoman of the Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists said the selections suggest that Obama will move quickly on policies to curb global warming and expand alternative energy research. Obama's selections will "restore scientific integrity" to the federal government, said Natural Resources Defense Council president Frances Beinecke.LiNeBrEaKThe Republican National Committee quickly noted that Chu has supported slowly raising gasoline taxes to encourage greater fuel efficiency and conservation.LiNeBrEaKObama said his team would create a "new energy economy" and is committed to curbing climate change and dependence on foreign oil. He said that Chu's appointment specifically "should send a signal to all that my administration will value science, we will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKBrowner, an attorney who's worked as an environmental consultant for businesses, told Congress in September that climate change is "one of the greatest environmental, social and economic challenges our country has ever faced," but also "a tremendous opportunity" to move toward energy independence and new clean jobs. She said it was in the nation's best economic and environmental interests to act quickly.LiNeBrEaKOne of the EPA's main achievements in the eight years that Browner directed it was a program that sharply reduced acid rain. It called for businesses to trade sulfur dioxide allowances granted by the government, and cost far less than originally expected.LiNeBrEaKChu, who's directed the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, advocates more substantive government action to address global warming and has overseen alternative energy research for transportation, including fuels from non-food plants, solar power and artificial photosynthesis.LiNeBrEaKEPA pick Jackson ran New Jersey's department of environmental protection, while Sutley has been involved in energy policy at several levels in California, including as top energy adviser to former Gov. Gray Davis. She's also a former special assistant to Browner at EPA.LiNeBrEaKEarlier in the day, Obama met privately with his national security team, but his staff declined to release any details about that meeting.LiNeBrEaKObama took three questions at the news conference.LiNeBrEaKHe declined to directly answer how quickly he intended to give California permission to regulate greenhouse gas emissions or whether he'd reinstate a ban on offshore oil drilling.LiNeBrEaKHe said his new energy and environment team would review such questions, but added that he felt California had traditionally led the way on environmental policy. He also said he's "not thrilled" with the offshore ban simply having lapsed, even though he's open to the idea of more offshore drilling as part of a comprehensive program to achieve energy independence.LiNeBrEaKHe was asked when the economy would get better and how Americans should hold him accountable. "I don't have a crystal ball," he said, but said ultimately the test would be whether he creates jobs and strengthens the economy as he's promised.LiNeBrEaKObama described Blagojevich's alleged machinations, including accusations that he sought to sell Obama's vacated Senate seat, as an "appalling set of circumstances" and emphasized that his transition team's review confirmed that he'd had no direct contact with Blagojevich on the matter.LiNeBrEaKHe declined to discuss details, however, including the nature of any contacts his incoming chief of staff, Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., may have had with the governor's office, pending the public release of the internal review.LiNeBrEaK(Talev reported from Chicago, Schoof from Washington.)

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	608 words  	Dec. 15--Marin County's 2009 legislative program, which seeks more federal money and several new state laws, reflects areas of broad consensus among top officials at the Civic Center.LiNeBrEaKIn general, the plan seeks to protect revenue while boosting climate change, health, transit and flood protection initiatives.LiNeBrEaKThe program, approved by county supervisors last week, seeks more federal funding for projects in each supervisorial district. Priority projects are flood control involving Corte Madera Creek and Santa Venetia, as well as a study related to the Bothin Marsh-Coyote Creek flood project; replacing Pacific Way Bridge at Muir Beach; the Highway 101 Narrows program in Novato; restoration programs affecting Hamilton wetlands and Bolinas Lagoon; wastewater treatment along Tomales Bay, and continued funding to study breast cancer in Marin. LiNeBrEaK"It is always difficult to whittle down our federal requests," said Dan Eilerman, a principal analyst in the county administrator's office, noting the county has a long list of additional projects described as "other federal projects of continued interest." These include projects like the Muir Woods shuttle, Doyle Drive improvements and sudden oak death program.LiNeBrEaKSupervisor Steve Kinsey described the priority list as a "workbook" that clarifies the county's federal and state wish list.LiNeBrEaKAfter toying with the idea of changing allocation requests, supervisors decided to go along with staff suggestions the county seek reauthorization ofLiNeBrEaKtransportation spending including $50 million for the Nonmotorized Transportation Pilot Program that involves bicycle and walkway improvements, $50 million for the Novato Narrows project and $3. 5 million to replace the Pacific Way Bridge at Redwood Creek.LiNeBrEaKSupervisor Judy Arnold wondered whether the county should consider "asking for even more" in light of an expected federal economic stimulus program authorizing a host of public works programs, and Kinsey instructed staff to "be ready with big numbers" if the Obama administration opens the federal treasury for county governments.LiNeBrEaKSupervisor Susan Adams, noting that social programs such as one benefiting mentally ill offenders have taken a beating from state budget cuts, called for "a little bit more focus on some of our service things that have really taken a hit." Earlier, she suggested the board consider a special holiday allocation to help the homeless.LiNeBrEaKSupervisor Charles McGlashan said the board is best served by pinpointing a short list of priorities, and for that reason, he considered but dropped a plan to advocate priority funding for a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge.LiNeBrEaKThe board's state legislative program for 2009 calls for three bills dealing with the pension system, flood funds and Marin General Hospital.LiNeBrEaKOne bill would allow the county retirement system to operate as a special district, removing supervisors from overseeing pension board decisions.LiNeBrEaKOther bills would prioritize funding provided by a $20 million Bay Area flood control allocation, and ease deadlines for Marin General to make earthquake improvements.LiNeBrEaKContact Nels Johnson via e-mail at ij.civiccenter@gmail.comLiNeBrEaKRead more San Rafael stories at the IJ's San Rafael section.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	EarthTalk: What to do about beach erosion  	By E/The Environmental Magazine, Emagazine.com  	LIFESTYLE  	705 words  	Dear EarthTalk: I've noticed a lot of beach erosion along the eastern U.S. coast. Beaches are virtually non-existent in places. Is this a usual cycle that will self-correct, or are these beaches permanently gone from sea level rise or other environmental causes? _ Jan Jesse, Morristown, Tenn.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately for beach lovers and owners of high-priced beach-front homes, coastal erosion in any form is usually a one-way trip. Man-made techniques such as beach nourishment _ whereby sand is dredged from off-shore sources and deposited along otherwise vanishing beaches _ may slow the process, but nothing short of global cooling or some other major geomorphic change will stop it altogether. LiNeBrEaKAccording to Stephen Leatherman ("Dr. Beach") of the National Healthy Beaches Campaign, beach erosion is defined by the actual removal of sand from a beach to deeper water offshore or alongshore into inlets, tidal shoals and bays. Such erosion can result from any number of factors, including the simple inundation of the land by rising sea levels resulting from the melting of the polar ice caps.LiNeBrEaKLeatherman cites U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that between 80 and 90 percent of the sandy beaches along America's coastlines have been eroding for decades. In many of these cases, individual beaches may be losing only a few inches per year, but in some cases the problem is much worse. The outer coast of Louisiana, which Leatherman refers to as "the erosion 'hot spot' of the U.S.," is losing some 50 feet of beach every year.LiNeBrEaKOf particular concern is the effect climate change, which not only causes sea levels to rise but also increases the severity and possibly the frequency of harsh storms, has on beach erosion. "While sea level rise sets the conditions for landward displacement of the shore, coastal storms supply the energy to do the 'geologic work' by moving the sand off and along the beach," writes Leatherman on his DrBeach.org Web site. "Therefore, beaches are greatly influenced by the frequency and magnitude of storms along a particular shoreline."LiNeBrEaKBesides collectively lowering our greenhouse gas emissions substantially, there is little that individuals _ let alone coastal landowners _ can do to stop beach erosion. Building a bulkhead or seawall along one or a few coastal properties may protect homes from damaging storm waves for a few years, but could end up doing more harm than good. "Bulkheads and seawalls may accelerate beach erosion by reflecting wave energy off the facing wall, impacting adjacent property owners as well," writes Leatherman, adding that such structures along retreating shorelines eventually cause diminished beach width and even loss.LiNeBrEaKOther larger scale techniques like beach nourishment may have better track records, at least in terms of slowing or delaying beach erosion, but are expensive enough as to warrant massive taxpayer expenditures. In the early 1980s, the city of Miami spent some $65 million adding sand to a 10-mile stretch of fast-eroding shoreline. Not only did the effort stave off erosion, it helped revitalize the tony South Beach neighborhood and rescue hotels, restaurants and shops there that cater to the rich and famous.LiNeBrEaKGOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTION?

The New York Times 		December 15, 2008 Monday   Late Edition - Final	Battle Unfolds in a Poor Land For the Riches Beneath the Soil  	By LYDIA POLGREEN  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; THE SPOILS; Pg. 1  	1827 words  	, NigerUntil last year, the only trigger Amoumoun Halil had pulled was the one on his livestock-vaccination gun. This spring, a battered Kalashnikov rifle rested uneasily on his shoulder. When he donned his stiff fatigues, his lopsided gait and smiling eyes stood out among his hard-faced guerrilla brethren. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Halil, a 40-year-old veterinary engineer, was a reluctant soldier in a rebellion that had broken out over an improbable -- and as yet unrealized -- bonanza in one of the world's poorest countries. LiNeBrEaK  A battle is unfolding on the stark mountains and scalloped dunes of northern Niger between a band of Tuareg nomads, who claim the riches beneath their homeland are being taken by a government that gives them little in return, and an army that calls the fighters drug traffickers and bandits.  LiNeBrEaK  It is a new front of an old war to control the vast wealth locked beneath African soil. Niger's northern desert caps one of the world's largest deposits of uranium, and demand for it has surged as global warming has increased interest in nuclear power. Growing economies like China and India are scouring the globe for the crumbly ore known as yellowcake. A French mining company is building the world's largest uranium mine in northern Niger, and a Chinese state company is building another mine nearby. LiNeBrEaK  Uranium could infuse Niger with enough cash to catapult it out of the kind of poverty that causes one in five Niger children to die before turning 5. LiNeBrEaK  Or it could end in a calamitous war that leaves Niger more destitute than ever. Mineral wealth has fueled conflict across Africa for decades, a series of bloody, smash-and-grab rebellions that shattered nations. The misery wrought has left many Africans to conclude that mineral wealth is a curse. LiNeBrEaK  Here in the Sahara, the uranium boom has given new life to longstanding grievances over land and power. For years, the Tuareg have struggled against a government they largely disdained. But this new rebellion has shed the parochial complaints of an ethnic minority, claiming instead that the government is squandering the entire country's resources through corruption and waste. Armed with a slick Web site and articulate spokesmen in Europe and the United States, the movement has gotten sympathy from Westerners drawn to the mysterious Tuareg and their arguments for justice. LiNeBrEaK  It has also pulled in a wide variety of fighters -- not only illiterate herdsmen but also college students, aid workers, even former pacifists like Mr. Halil. LiNeBrEaK  ''This uranium belongs to our people; it is on our land,'' Mr. Halil said. ''We cannot allow ourselves to be robbed of our birthright.'' LiNeBrEaK  Useful or UselessLiNeBrEaK  When Mr. Halil was in high school, an old French map hung in his classroom. The verdant crescent along the southern border was labeled ''useful Niger.'' The vast, dun-colored swath across the north that he called home was labeled ''useless Niger.'' LiNeBrEaK  It was a profound lesson, in politics as well as geography. The agricultural belt along the south had all the power. The herders of the north were irrelevant. LiNeBrEaK  It had not always been so. The Tuareg have plied the barren peaks here for centuries, ruling over the caravan routes that crossed the Sahara with the riches of Africa -- from salt to slaves. With their camels and swords, they enriched themselves through tribute and plunder. LiNeBrEaK  By the time Mr. Halil was born, that era was long gone. As a boy he dreamed of having a huge herd of camels, as his father had before the great droughts of the 1970s wiped out the herd. After excelling in school, Mr. Halil went to college in Benin, but he failed to get the Niger government to give him a scholarship to veterinary school abroad. LiNeBrEaK  ''My family had no connections,'' he said. ''Unless you have a friend in government, your chances of getting a scholarship are zero.'' LiNeBrEaK  Instead, he started a union of herders to try to get those notoriously individualistic people to band together for their common interests. LiNeBrEaK  In his travels, Mr. Halil began to notice the stream of geologists from France, China, Canada and Australia scouring ever deeper into Tuareg grazing lands. Little seas of flags, used to mark potential mining areas, sprang up everywhere, he said. LiNeBrEaK  ''I asked myself, 'What do we Tuareg get out of this?' '' he said. ''We just get poorer and poorer.'' LiNeBrEaK  An Insurgency BeginsLiNeBrEaK  Mr. Halil's efforts were part of a wave of civic activism that has swept over Africa in the past 15 years as the continent has become more democratic. Many of the new elected governments are deeply flawed, but because of a more youthful, urban population in touch with new technology, their citizens are often better informed and less willing to tolerate the corruption that has squandered so much of Africa's potential. LiNeBrEaK  In February 2007, a group of armed Tuaregs mounted an audacious attack on a military base in the Air Mountains. A new insurgency was born. They called themselves the Niger Movement for Justice and unfurled a set of demands: that corruption be curbed and the wealth generated by each region benefit its people. LiNeBrEaK  Far from useless, as Mr. Halil's high school map had said, Tuareg lands produce the uranium that accounts for 70 percent of the country's export earnings. But almost none of those earnings returned to those who lost access to grazing land and suffered the environmental consequences of mining, the rebels argued. LiNeBrEaK  To fight the rebellion, the government has effectively isolated the north, devastating its economy. International human rights investigators have also documented serious misdeeds on both sides. The rebels use antivehicle land mines that have killed soldiers and civilians, while the army has been accused of extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and looting of livestock. In all, hundreds of people have been killed, and thousands have been pushed from their land. LiNeBrEaK  Despite the violence, mining and exploration continues largely unabated, but the rebels contend that corrupt officials siphon off much of that wealth. The country's prime minister was forced to step aside after being accused of embezzling $237,000, and last summer he was indicted. LiNeBrEaK  ''This wealth needs to be used to help the people, not the politicians,'' said Aghali Alambo, president of the rebel movement. ''Otherwise it is just plunder.'' LiNeBrEaK  The government argues that Niger is a democracy, if an imperfect one, with peaceful means of redressing grievances. LiNeBrEaK  Officials dismiss the men fighting in the north as bandits and traffickers who have moved drugs, untaxed cigarettes, gasoline and even human cargo across the vast Sahara for decades. Some rebels admit to trafficking, especially of cheap gasoline smuggled from Algeria, to support the rebellion. LiNeBrEaK  ''Niger is a democratic country that is ruled by laws,'' said Mohamed Ben Omar, Niger's minister of information. ''If someone has a grievance, let him form a political party and bring it to the ballot.'' LiNeBrEaK  Poor Amid RichesLiNeBrEaK  The Tuareg have been fighting here for centuries. The warriors cover their faces with long, blue scarves that stain their skin. LiNeBrEaK  After France lost its grip on most of its Saharan colonies in 1960, the Tuareg found themselves a small minority divided among new nations created by arbitrary borders that meant little to them. Worse, droughts reduced them to penury. LiNeBrEaK  But the parched land on which they lived was valuable. A French nuclear company, Areva, was scooping hundreds of tons of uranium from northern Niger every year. Unlike southern farmers, who owned their land, nomads could use pastureland but had no title to it. LiNeBrEaK  The hardships of global warming and desertification, which eats away grazing land, further impoverished the Tuareg, forcing many to abandon herding. Yet as its fertility degraded, their land became increasingly sought after as the global price of uranium rose steadily. This paradox would prove explosive. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Halil sat out the last Tuareg uprising, which began in 1990 and ended with a peace agreement in 1995. Back then, he was idealistic, hoping to avoid violence. But he knew his people's history well. LiNeBrEaK  ''Tuareg are fighters,'' he said. ''It is our nature.'' LiNeBrEaK  In June 2007, an army vehicle exploded after driving over a land mine planted by the rebels. Villagers say that the army then slaughtered three elderly men; the army says no one was killed. But the story of the slaughtered elders spread swiftly among the Tuareg. LiNeBrEaK  For Mr. Halil, it was a sign that nonviolence was foolish. LiNeBrEaK  ''If they were going to kill old, defenseless men, how could we even talk about negotiation?'' he said. ''Fighting was the only way to defend our communities and our way of life.'' LiNeBrEaK  After months of indecision, Mr. Halil sent his 2-year-old daughter and his pregnant wife to stay with her parents. He set off for the Air Mountains. LiNeBrEaK  An Oath With ExceptionsLiNeBrEaK  Once there, Mr. Halil found a growing army. He learned to use a weapon and march in formation, but he was more useful in jobs closer to his former vocations -- healer and organizer. LiNeBrEaK  Wounded fighters sought him out under his tree in the camp. He treated infections and counseled men on splinting broken bones. Fighters started calling him the doctor. LiNeBrEaK  ''I felt that I was useful,'' Mr. Halil said.LiNeBrEaK  Each new recruit must swear a three-part oath on the Koran: never betray the movement; never attack civilians or take their property; serve all of Niger's people, not just one tribe or clan. LiNeBrEaK  But the oath has exceptions, and stealing from outsiders is not only tolerated but encouraged. Armed men stole a new, white Toyota truck from Unicef's offices in April. The same vehicle turned up at a rebel base a few days later, its Unicef emblem scratched off. The rebels drove it to Mali to try to sell it. LiNeBrEaK  Such slips made Mr. Halil uneasy.LiNeBrEaK  ''I was not born to be a soldier,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  The fighters spend little time actually fighting. Mostly, they drive around on patrols, take shelter under the meager shade of thorny acacia trees and prepare Tuareg tea, a potent brew poured into small glasses. LiNeBrEaK  At such moments, Mr. Halil ached for home. He thought of his newborn son, whom he had never seen. He wondered if he had made the right choice, leaving his family and taking up the way of the gun. LiNeBrEaK  ''Sometimes I have doubts,'' he said, stoking the embers of a campfire. LiNeBrEaK  In late June, Mr. Halil was on a mission when the thwacking sound of helicopter rotors suddenly broke the desert silence, he said. There had long been rumors that the government had acquired attack helicopters, a power that would fundamentally change the conflict. LiNeBrEaK  In the firefight, 17 rebels were killed. Mr. Halil managed to get away and fled to Algeria, leaving the rebellion and taking up his studies once again. He hoped, at last, to become a real veterinarian. LiNeBrEaK  ''I won't abandon the struggle, but I will continue by other means,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  The fighters left behind, in bases deep in the mountains, vow that they are there to stay.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	467 words  	Dec. 15--DANBURY -- Several state and federal lawmakers from the area have been appointed to key political positions.LiNeBrEaKIncoming state House Speaker Chris Donovan, D-Meriden, appointed Rep. Jason Bartlett, D-Bethel, vice chairman of the legislature's Appropriations Committee, which has authority over all matters related to the state budget. LiNeBrEaK"The assignment that I've been given by Rep. Donovan is an important one, especially in light of the economic crisis that is not only affecting the state but also the entire country," Bartlett said.LiNeBrEaKMayor Mark Boughton congratulated Bartlett on the appointment, but noted the role of the committee has been somewhat muted in recent years.LiNeBrEaK"There has been a history of governors who have ignored the committee and created their own budget," he said. "Where it (being on the committee) is valuable is in the run-up to budget discussions.LiNeBrEaK"While the committee won't create the actual budget, they will be able to vet through the governor's budget and identify any issues or needs for local communities like Danbury. Bartlett has a huge task in front of him."LiNeBrEaKBoughton also congratulated U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy, D-5th District, for his appointment last week to the congressional Energy and Commerce Committee. Boughton said the appointment could help as local towns continue negotiations with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over issues relating to Candlewood Lake.LiNeBrEaK"It's good to have someone on the committee who has the ear of the decision-makers," Boughton said, adding that the appointment could also help local alternative energy companies. "Many of these companies are doing creative things that rely on federal funding to stay viable until their product goes to market."LiNeBrEaKMurphy said for the first time in more than a decade, Connecticut will have a seat on one of the most influential committees in Congress.LiNeBrEaK"I am thrilled to have been appointed to a committee that will allow me to play a major role in expanding access to health care, combating global warming, and making our country energy independent," he said.LiNeBrEaKDonovan last week also appointed Rep.

LiNeBrEaKFeeling mediocre yet?LiNeBrEaKThe students -- of an elementary school, mind you -- then constructed a robot made of Legos, designed a computer program to run it and displayed how small-scale technology can workwith the environment to produce solutions.LiNeBrEaKDa Nerdz, the team's moniker, was one of 48 teams, ages 9-14, that competed at the First Lego League state tournament Saturday at Gates Sports Center on the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne.LiNeBrEaKEach team used the tournament's theme of "Climate Connections" to decide on a specialized topic, then researched it and linked it to robotics.LiNeBrEaK"We're trying to connect the principles of robotics to the environment and how the kids can apply that," said Da Nerdz coach Jerome Hill, a network administrator with St. Vincent. "It's primarily awareness and secondarily a steppingstone toward possibly more advanced robotics in high school, or perhaps have a career in it."LiNeBrEaKLego robotics is just a decade old, but it has advanced quickly since its inception.LiNeBrEaKAbout 135,000 students throughout the world are now part of the program, which teaches children to tackle pressing global issues and relate them to something naturally fun for kids: Legos and robots.LiNeBrEaKIt's education mixed with fun that welcomes a range of students.LiNeBrEaK"You find kids getting excited about this who maybe you wouldn't normally think would excel in school, but suddenly, because they've been in this activity, they're now excited about science, they're now excited about computers," said First Lego League Director Carol Dostal, IPFW's director of outreach programs.LiNeBrEaK"They're actually improving in school. Other kids who already are excelling are having an opportunity to be enriched by the activity. It appeals to a wide range of interest levels, as well as a wide range of type of students."LiNeBrEaKEach team researched and assembled a presentation of their answer to a specific climate challenge and were judged on the project prior to running their robot. During the presentation, teams presented their challenge and the solution to it.LiNeBrEaKThen, their robots were allotted 2 1/2 minutes on the table to complete tasks, in front of several referees who scored them. The team's best score of its three runs was kept.LiNeBrEaKSaturday's winner, Tech Kids, from South Bend, will advance to the First Lego League World Festival at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta in April.LiNeBrEaKA Fort Wayne team, ZBOTs, came in second and will compete in the U.S. Nationals in Ohio.LiNeBrEaKSarah Michna, coach of the Lafayette Shamrocks from Lafayette Elementary in Hammond, said the competition was much more than scores and placements.LiNeBrEaK"The kids have learned a lot about ways to help the environment, and they came up with all these solutions that they can take back to the students at their school. I think it's a really great program for the kids, and they absolutely love it. Who doesn't love playing with Legos all day?"

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Senate Democrats praise Obama's environment, energy team picks  	By Jonathan Tamari and Sandy Bauers, The Philadelphia Inquirer  	NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS  	899 words  	PHILADELPHIA _ President-elect Barack Obama said Monday that his administration would "value science" and "make decisions based on facts" as he nominated an environmental team that includes New Jersey's Lisa Jackson as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who for nearly three years led New Jersey's environmental protection efforts, is poised to take over an agency where, critics say, politics has repeatedly trumped science. LiNeBrEaKObama signaled a change, saying Jackson "shares my commitment to restoring the EPA's robust role in protecting our air, our water, and abundant natural resources."LiNeBrEaKHe said energy independence is crucial for the nation's security and praised Jackson's work in New Jersey to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, an effort that moved forward Monday when the state Department of Environmental Protection released an overdue report detailing its ambitious plans.LiNeBrEaKJackson, a Princeton-educated engineer who has spent more than 20 years in environmental regulatory positions, said she hopes to show longtime EPA staff that their work is valued.LiNeBrEaK"EPA's mission has never changed. Its mode of doing business has changed over the years and probably needs to change again," Jackson said in a telephone interview from Chicago.LiNeBrEaK"As an environmentalist, (there's) no better job to have at this time right now, provided the agency is allowed to do what it's supposed to do."LiNeBrEaKJackson, 46, who must be confirmed by the Senate, worked at the EPA's Washington and New York offices. She joined New Jersey's DEP in 2002 and became Gov. Jon Corzine's chief of staff at the start of this month.LiNeBrEaKObama also nominated Steven Chu as energy secretary, Nancy Sutley to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and Carol Browner to be a newly created White House energy czar.LiNeBrEaKJackson co-chaired Obama's environment and energy transition team.LiNeBrEaKSenate Democrats praised the Obama picks.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., chair of the Environment Committee, said the team "signals that positive changes are coming as we work for energy independence and for solutions to global warming."LiNeBrEaKSen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., called Jackson an "excellent" choice.LiNeBrEaK"She understands we need real leadership to rebound from the neglect of the last eight years," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe ranking Republican on the environment committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, stressed the importance of balancing the environment and the economy, and said he looked forward to working with Jackson.LiNeBrEaKOutgoing EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson, who often bore the brunt of criticism heaped on EPA, called Jackson "uniquely qualified to recognize the challenges facing the agency and lead from Day One."LiNeBrEaKIn New Jersey, Jackson won praise as a consensus-builder from environmentalists and business groups in a state where industry has often complained of feeling under siege.LiNeBrEaKShe worked with a decreasing budget and was part of ambitious plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and shape the state's long-term energy plans.LiNeBrEaKSome critics say Jackson was slow to act. They cite a roughly four-month delay in issuing the details behind New Jersey's highly-touted global warming initiative and an EPA report that chided the state for moving slowly on cleaning up some of its most polluted sites.LiNeBrEaKJackson's successor at DEP, acting Commissioner Mark Mauriello, Monday released a draft report outlining how the state could meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKIt would entail an emissions reduction of about 25 percent below the levels anticipated under a business-as-usual scenario.LiNeBrEaKIn a statement, Corzine said, "This draft report outlines a New Jersey where employees commute without the frustration of traffic and the air pollution it causes, where energy is clean, and where waste is a thing of the past."LiNeBrEaKThe report concludes that three actions in progress _ the energy master plan, a low-emission vehicle plan, and a multi-state cap-and-trade program for the electric generating sector called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative _ could put New Jersey on track for meeting its 2020 limits.LiNeBrEaKMatt Elliott, the global warming and clean-energy advocate with Environment New Jersey, called the report "the nation's strongest and most comprehensive plan" to slash emissions.LiNeBrEaK"It's the first plan we've seen that looks all the way out to 2050 and figures out how to reduce emissions 80 percent," he said.LiNeBrEaK"It essentially means that by 2050 we'll be totally free from fossil fuels, even to the extent that we'll be powering our cars and trucks with electricity generated by the wind and the sun. It's a pretty big deal to see Gov. Corzine and the DEP say, 'Yes, indeed, we can do this.' "LiNeBrEaKBut the plan is, he cautioned, "just a plan."LiNeBrEaKCorzine yesterday announced that his chief counsel, Ed McBride, would replace Jackson as chief of staff.LiNeBrEaK(Philadelphia Inquirer staff writer John Shiffman contributed to this report.)

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 		December 15, 2008 Monday   SOONER EDITION	Dear Mr. President-elect  		ARTS and ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. C-7  	379 words  	Between now and Jan. 20, the Post-Gazette will publish letters written by local students to President-elect Barack Obama, who will be inaugurated as the nation's 44th president. They will appear intermittently on the My Generation page. LiNeBrEaKDear President-elect Barack Obama:LiNeBrEaKCongratulations on becoming the president!LiNeBrEaKIn my opinion, to help our country, we should do more reusing and recycling of products instead of always buying new things. When we reuse and recycle, someone could find another valuable use for the product.LiNeBrEaKWhen you get your daughters their dog, you should adopt it from a shelter. That gives a dog a second chance and a new life. The dog wouldn't just have a nice home but lots of care from a family. It could also help to inspire other people in our country to adopt a dog from a shelter. Also, please get your dog spayed or neutered.LiNeBrEaKWe should do more to protect our environment from damage to air, water and land. We shouldn't throw any fuels or trash in the water. If someone does damage to the environment, they should help clean it up.LiNeBrEaKAnd could we please just worry about our own country? We should end the war and stop violence. We should promote peace and give peace a chance. If we do these things, we could have a better country.LiNeBrEaKThank you for reading my letter.LiNeBrEaKP.S. My cousin, Kiely. would like to be the nanny for your daughters.LiNeBrEaKOlivia Rautio, age 11, Liberty ElementaryLiNeBrEaKDear President-elect Barack Obama:LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is a huge problem. But there are ways you could prevent it. One way is to make electric cars more available because they don't use much gasoline. If they are more available than cars that need more gasoline, then that might help stop global warming. Another way that might help prevent global warming is not using cars at all. You could encourage people to use bicycles or walk instead.LiNeBrEaKAnother problem is pollution, which is one of the causes of global warming. There are also ways to prevent pollution. One way is to put more garbage cans around cities, neighborhoods and other places where there are lots of people. This way people won't put their garbage on the ground. You should make a law that everyone should have to recycle or they will be punished. I hope you will consider my ideas.LiNeBrEaKNell Hendricks, age 10, Liberty Elementary	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (86%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (63%); MOTOR VEHICLES (63%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (63%)  		BARACK OBAMA (94%)  		December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 P.G.

The Porterville Recorder (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: Obama moves left with his enviro team  	The Porterville Recorder, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	546 words  	Dec. 15--With his choices of top aides in the areas of economics and national security, President-elect Barack Obama veered toward the center of the Democratic Party, appointing mostly people who initially supported the misbegotten Iraq war (and keeping nominal Republican Robert Gates on) to national security posts and people with Clinton-era experience to positions dealing with economic issues. In fact, certain elements of the "netroots" and the markedly leftist wing of the party were showing a certain amount of restiveness. LiNeBrEaKWith his choices in the energy and environmental fields, however, he should put such discontent to rest. As the ever-so-green Web site Forecast Earth put it, these choices "suggest Barack Obama is going to be progressive where it really counts."LiNeBrEaKStephen Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, former chair of the physics department at Stanford and the 1997 Nobel Prize winner in physics, certainly seems qualified to be Secretary of Energy (if there should be such a position). He heads a laboratory that is part of the Department of Energy, so he is likely to know some of the ropes already.LiNeBrEaKIt should concern taxpayers, however, that in addition to having developed a keen concern about climate change in the last few years, he is an enthusiastic advocate of aggressively developing non-petroleum alternative fuels. Besides funding research, that is likely to include major taxpayer subsidies.LiNeBrEaKAs Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute reminded us, however, the government has been subsidizing alternative and renewable energy for 30 years, and progress has been minimal. "I think we would have been further ahead on renewables without government subsidies," he said. "The companies that get these subsidies are seldom competitive or entrepreneurial, focusing on pleasing politicians more than bringing products to market."LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner, head of the Environmental Protection Agency for eight years under Clinton, will fill a new White House post overseeing and coordinating energy, environmental and climate change policies. She was brought into the Clinton administration by Al Gore. Does she share his extreme views on the need to get rid of petroleum-based energy in 10 years?LiNeBrEaKLisa Jackson, now chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, is slated to head the EPA. Nancy Sutley, now a Los Angeles deputy mayor for environmental affairs, will chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Their experience suggests that their skills are more political than scientific.LiNeBrEaKThe financial crisis suggests modesty in expanding programs and regulations that increase the cost of doing business. Mr. Obama's choices in energy and environmental affairs suggest a more aggressive, expensive and probably ineffective approach.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 		December 15, 2008 Monday   All Editions	Synagogues preach the value of going green;  Host fair focused on energy efficiency 	By HARVY LIPMAN, STAFF WRITER, North Jersey Media Group  	LOCAL; Pg. L01  	498 words  	TENAFLY ? Preserving the environment is "something that is core to our values as Jews," Rabbi Jordan Millstein of Temple Sinai in Tenafly said in explaining why his synagogue hosted a green energy fair Sunday. LiNeBrEaKA few dozen members of Millstein's Reform congregation and the Kehilat Kesher Community Synagogue, an Orthodox temple in Englewood, turned out to hear presentations by several experts on climate change and energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"The current estimate is that the sea level will rise 2 to 4 feet in New Jersey by the end of the century," said Anthony J. Broccoli, a professor of environmental sciences at Rutgers University. "Solving the problem will require new knowledge, the development of alternative sources of energy that do not produce greenhouse gases."LiNeBrEaKBut the average homeowner isn't in a position to do that. For most people, the first focus should be on improving the energy efficiency of their houses, said Frank E. DeWitt, owner of Alternative Energy Associates in Augusta, which designs and installs renewable energy systems.LiNeBrEaK"For every dollar spent on making your home more efficient, you'll save $3 in energy costs," DeWitt said. "The most affordable energy is that which is not used."LiNeBrEaKRobert Politzer, owner of Green Street Construction in Manhattan, cautioned not to cut corners on expenses when installing energy-efficient systems or constructing "green" buildings.LiNeBrEaK"I've been doing this for 10 years, and I guarantee you if you try to go cheap it's going to cost you in the long run," Politzer said.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the speakers, the fair featured exhibits from more than a dozen companies and non-profit groups involved in green technology and protecting the environment, from the U.S. distributors of the French-made Smart cars ? which can get 40 mpg or more ? to the Tenafly Nature Center.LiNeBrEaKThe synagogues' rabbis said they decided to co-sponsor the fair because protecting the environment fits with Jewish religious obligations. "Every time you have the opportunity to do something to make the world more green, you're participating in the perfection of the world, which is our responsibility as Jews," said Rabbi Jeffrey Fox of Kehilat Kesher.LiNeBrEaK"If you look at the fundamental values of our faith, God as the creator of our world has given us a charge: We are responsible as human beings to guard and protect the world for future generations," Millstein added.LiNeBrEaKHere are some ways to improve the energy efficiency of the average home, according to experts at Sunday's green fair:LiNeBrEaK* Get a thermal imaging scan of your home, to find out where heat is leaking out.LiNeBrEaK* Install low-flow shower heads and water fixtures to stop wasting hot water.LiNeBrEaK* When renovating your home, have contractors identify reusable cabinets, plumbing fixtures and other items that can be resold and kept out of landfills.LiNeBrEaK* Use low-odor paints, caulking and adhesives when doing renovations. If they emit less odor, they're putting fewer chemicals into the air inside your home.LiNeBrEaKE-mail: lipman@northjersey.com	ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (92%); JEWS and JUDAISM (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); RELIGION (90%); CLERGY and RELIGIOUS (89%); GREEN BUILDING (78%); HOMEOWNERS (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (77%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); BUILDING RENOVATION (73%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (72%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); ROAD and BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (65%); HIGHWAYS and STREETS (51%) ENVIRONMENT; ENERGY; JUDAISM  			NEW YORK, NY, USA (71%) NEW JERSEY, USA (90%); NEW YORK, USA (71%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 17, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Newspaper  		2008 North Jersey Media Group Inc., All Rights Reserved  			PHOTO, ADENA STEVENS, SPECIAL TO THE RECORD - Arden Taub, left, with Energy Star general contractor Nick Muccio at the green energy fair.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	The Sacramento Bee, Calif., Dan Walters column: Dan Walters: Jerry Brown's paddling his political canoe  	Dan Walters, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	582 words  	Dec. 15--Attorney General Jerry Brown made noises like a 19th-century states' rights zealot last week in opposing a looming federal court order requiring the state to spend up to $8 billion to improve health care in its much-overcrowded prison system.LiNeBrEaKAs Brown depicted it in his appellate filing opposing the order obtained by federal receiver Clark Kelso, the order violates a federal law barring courts from ordering states to build new prisons as well as constitutional guarantees of state sovereignty. LiNeBrEaK"In ordering the state to fund the receiver's massive prison construction program, the district court clearly violated federal law, and its decision must be reversed," Brown told the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, adding that the order is "particularly unacceptable at a time when California is facing a $25 billion deficit" and that the state had already acknowledged its prison health care problem and moved vigorously to solve it.LiNeBrEaKThere was a nice bit of irony attached to Brown's effort to block judicial interference in California's prisons -- the fact that he's been doing much the same thing vis-&Atilde; -vis local governments and their land-use decisions.LiNeBrEaKLast year, after Assembly Bill 32, the state's landmark anti-greenhouse gas law, went into effect, a newly elected Brown took it upon himself to begin suing, or threatening to sue, cities and counties that didn't alter their local housing and land use plans to suit his vision of "elegant density" that would reduce auto traffic and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKBrown acted even though the California Air Resources Board had not yet decided how land use would fit into its overall plan for reducing carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, so the only authority was his own assumption. And in fact the CARB plan places little emphasis on housing.LiNeBrEaKLaws governing prison health care are clearer than those affecting local land-use decisions. When the state locks someone behind bars, it becomes, in effect, the inmate's parent, responsible for feeding, clothing, medicating and educating the miscreant.LiNeBrEaKAnd when care is substandard, as a federal judge has decided and the state has acknowledged, intervention is warranted.LiNeBrEaKFortunately for Brown, none of the local officials he was browbeating had the guts to challenge his legal authority. Global warming is, after all, a popular cause for any politician to espouse, and Brown was already making noises about riding the issue into another stint as California's governor in 2010. Threatened with potentially endless litigation, the local officials backed down and allowed Brown to vet their land-use plans by whatever standard he deemed to impose.LiNeBrEaKOpposing federal intervention on behalf of felons is popular with those on the political right while opposing global warming endears Brown to the left. And after all, he is the man who, as governor three decades ago, espoused a political "canoe theory" in which one paddles on the right for a while and then paddles on the left to move ahead.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Dan Walters, (916) 321-1195.

Maryland State Police said that when they finally reached the 27-year-old man by telephone later that night, he agreed to come in for questioning, showed up early and willingly confessed to the crime. Police said the man told them he planned to sell some of the merchandise he took so he could make his car payment.LiNeBrEaKTown limits hours of mayor's workLiNeBrEaKThe South El Monte, Calif., city council has issued a curfew to restrict the hours worked by Mayor Blanca Figueroa. Council members say they have safety and liability concerns for Figueroa, who frequently works until the wee hours of the morning. She must now leave the building by 11 p.m. The mayor says she needs to stay late because her daytime schedule is filled with meetings and her inbox is overflowing with letters from residents affected by the worsening economy.LiNeBrEaKSecurity at game has rough timeLiNeBrEaKA woman was charged with biting a security officer who tried to break up a crowd at a Long Island high school basketball game. Nassau County police say the 20-year-old woman bit the man on his arm and leg at the Roslyn High School game, and another person punched the man in the head. The woman accused of biting the officer was charged with assault. The person who punched him in the head is being sought.LiNeBrEaKBeer drinker found on roofLiNeBrEaKA man called police in Fort Pierce, Fla., after he came home from work and spotted an intoxicated woman drinking a beer on the roof of his home. The 28-year-old woman was taken into custody when she refused to get down and leave. The police report said the woman agreed to leave only if the man agreed to give her more beer. The woman, who faces a disorderly intoxication charge, has been in trouble before. Police reports show she was suspected of stealing money from her sister to buy alcohol.LiNeBrEaKFox urine used to defend houseLiNeBrEaKA Minnesota man who told authorities he was fed up with teens toilet-papering his house faces charges after he squirted the offenders with fox urine. Scott Wagar, 50, pleaded not guilty in Kandiyohi County District Court to misdemeanor assault and other charges. Wagar told police he used night vision goggles to see 15-20 people running toward his place. He said he told them to leave, swore at them and sprayed them with the fox urine.LiNeBrEaKBird interrupts baby's mealLiNeBrEaKA large bird, apparently a Cooper's hawk, crashed through the window of a northern Idaho home, showering a youngster with glass. Karyn Holt said her 1-year-old son, Quinn, was eating breakfast in his high chair when the bird broke through the window facing their backyard. Quinn suffered only minor cuts. Holt picked up the stunned bird and moved it into the yard, where it rested for about 90 minutes before flying off.
