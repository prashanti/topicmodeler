San Antonio Express-News 	December 15, 2008 Monday   STATEandMETRO Edition	The Country Scientist;  U.S. weather data often flawed 	Forrest M. Mims III  	BUSINESS; Pg. 4C  	523 words  	In 1992 I used TOPS, a homemade $250 instrument that measures the ozone layer, to find an error in a costly NASA ozone satellite. TOPS later found problems in two other ozone satellites. I also used a $20 instrument made with Radio Shack parts to find an error in haze measurements by a NOAA weather satellite. LiNeBrEaKFellow amateur scientist Roger Baker devised a simple method to measure ozone near the ground. He soon found a major problem with a government ozone monitor in Austin.LiNeBrEaKI found an error of 10 percent in an ozone monitor in San Antonio during the summer of 2002. The EPA refused to remove the defective data because its strange rules allowed data to be within 20 percent of the correct value.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia TV meteorologist Anthony Watts became concerned by inconsistencies in temperature records used to predict global warming. Watts began a volunteer network of observers who visited hundreds of NOAA and private temperature stations across the U.S. and posted photos and findings at www.surfacestations.org.LiNeBrEaKWatts and his team created shock waves across the Internet when bloggers learned about the many problems they found.LiNeBrEaKThe National Weather Service and the World Meteorological Organization have rules for the placement of weather stations. Yet Watts and his team found that hundreds of stations did not fully meet the standards. They posted many photos of temperature monitors improperly mounted on roofs and too close to buildings, parked cars, air conditioners, roads and parking lots.LiNeBrEaKOne of their most dramatics discoveries was an official weather station maintained by the faculty of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Arizona. The station was installed in an asphalt parking lot.LiNeBrEaKOf the 534 stations Watts and his volunteers have surveyed to date, 69 percent are located within 33 feet of an "artificial heating source, such [as] a building, roof top, parking lot, or concrete surface."LiNeBrEaKIn short, much of the U.S. temperature network is biased toward warmer temperatures. Much of the network is also influenced by the warming caused by urban "heat islands."LiNeBrEaKCanadian mathematician Steve McIntyre caused a storm of his own when he found important errors in a climate model used in a United Nations report on global warming. More recently McIntyre, Watts and others have found errors in NOAA and NASA temperature records posted on the Web.LiNeBrEaKWhen NASA posted a sharp rise in the October global temperature, bloggers quickly found that some of the global temperatures were identical to those from September. NASA uses NOAA data, and neither agency caught the error until the amateurs pointed it out. The corrected data showed that the global temperature is still declining from the upward spike caused by the 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o.LiNeBrEaKAnthony Watts, Steve McIntyre and other climate bloggers are unpopular with some global warming scientists. Seems to me that we need more citizen scientists who volunteer their time to check up on environmental models, data and measurements.LiNeBrEaKForrest M.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Obama taps Bay Area physicist Steven Chu to lead energy department  	Lisa M. Krieger, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1097 words  	Dec. 15--He won the Nobel Prize in physics, rose to leadership posts at Stanford and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was tapped Monday as President-elect Obama's Energy secretary, but Steven Chu long considered himself the "academic black sheep" of his family.LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants recalls spending his lunch money to build homemade rockets and fashioning a pole vault out of bamboo from the carpet store. But growing up on Long Island he thought he could never match his siblings' Ivy League academic achievements.LiNeBrEaKYet, there he was Monday, being lauded as a visionary leader who will push America's energy policy into a new era, promoting groundbreaking research into new clean technologies. LiNeBrEaK"His appointment should send a signal to all that my administration will value science," said President-elect Barack Obama at a news conference. "We will make decisions based on the facts, and we understand that facts demand bold action."LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Sentate, Chu, 60, would be the first Nobel winner named to the post and the only DOE chief in recent memory to have run a major laboratory. He is expected to take the nation's energy policy in a sharply different direction, strengthening research into advanced biofuels, artificial photosynthesis and other solar energy research.LiNeBrEaKObama also on Monday announced his choice of Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; NancyLiNeBrEaKSutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor, as chair of the White House Council on Environment Quality; and former Clinton EPA chief Carol Browner as head of a White House council on energy and climate.LiNeBrEaKThe nomination of Chu -- who is married to Jean Chu, a former San Jose State University physics professor -- was applauded by his scientific colleagues.LiNeBrEaK"Throughout his life, and at all points in his career, he goes after near-impossible goals, but with an appropriate sense of what is, and is not, attainable," said Stanford physics Professor Steve Harris, who would talk physics with Chu while they mountain biked up to Skyline Drive.LiNeBrEaK"Obama has filled up the Cabinet so far with folks who know how to navigate 'inside the Beltway' to get things done," said Stanford Professor Stephen Schneider, who wrote the influential book on climate change, "Laboratory Earth." "That's fine. But they are not visionary thinkers. Steve Chu is. There will be real dialogue in Cabinet meetings."LiNeBrEaKChu's conviction that technology can solve energy problems appeals to some of those in the energy industry as well, although they urged him to be sensitive to the economic impact of his policies.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully, he'll take the view that our industry has taken, that we need to use every drop of energy that we can bring to the supply side to ensure that we will continue to have affordable, abundant and reliable energy in a way that does not harm the economy or consumers," said Joe Sparano, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, the main oil industry trade group in California.LiNeBrEaK"He is not just sitting in an ivory tower anymore," cautioned Frank Maisano, a lobbyist and spokesman for coal-fired power plants. "He'll need to focus on the art of the possible "... and be realistic about the role that coal plays in providing power and jobs."LiNeBrEaKChu's father, Ju Chin Chu, came to the United States in 1943 to continue his education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in chemical engineering. Two years later, his mother, Ching Chen Li, joined him to study economics. When they married in 1945, China was in turmoil so they stayed in the United States.LiNeBrEaKChu grew up in Garden City, N.Y., where his father was a professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. There were only two other Chinese families in town. "But to our parents, the determining factor was the quality of the public school system," Chu wrote in an autobiography for the Nobel Foundation. "Education in my family was not merely emphasized, it was our raison d'&Atilde;&ordf;tre."LiNeBrEaKAs a young child, he loved building things. He started with plastic model airplanes and warships, then moved to devices "where the main design criteria was to maximize the number of moving parts and overall size," littering the living room with hundreds of nuts, bolts and metal girders.LiNeBrEaKThere were no tennis players in the family, so Chu taught himself to play by reading a book.LiNeBrEaKBut in a family of accomplished scholars, "my performance was decidedly mediocre. I approached the bulk of my schoolwork as a chore rather than an intellectual adventure."LiNeBrEaKGeometry came to the rescue. "Instead of memorizing facts, we were asked to think in clear, logical steps. Beginning from a few intuitive postulates, far-reaching consequences could be derived, and I took immediately to the sport of proving theorems." He embraced Advanced Placement physics and calculus with the same passion.LiNeBrEaKWith an A-minus average, he was rejected by the Ivy League so he enrolled at the University of Rochester. "At least nobody had heard of my brothers and cousins," who had earned a total of two MDs, four doctorates and a law degree. "As I prepared to go to college, I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family."LiNeBrEaKHis love affair with physics started with the textbook "The Feynman Lectures on Physics." He came to California for graduate school, working with UC-Berkeley's Eugene Commins, who shared Chu's thrill of fundamental physics. Chu's youthful construction skills came in handy. He recalled that one experiment needed a state-of-the-art laser. "I brashly told him not to worry; I would build it and we would be up and running in no time."LiNeBrEaKFrom Berkeley, he joined Bell Labs, where his work in the field of laser cooling and trapping led to a deeper understanding of the interaction between light and matter -- and the Nobel Prize in 1997.LiNeBrEaKHe ascended through the ranks, eventually becoming chairman of the physics department at Stanford and head of the electronics research laboratory at Bell Labs. Since 2004, he has been director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.LiNeBrEaKContact Lisa M. Krieger at lkrieger@mercurynews.com or (408) 920-5565.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Study: Climate change may force skiers uphill  	The Associated Press  	BREAKING; News; State  	124 words  	Denver &raquo; A study of two Rocky Mountain ski resorts says climate change will mean shorter seasons and less snow on lower slopes. LiNeBrEaKThe study by two Colorado researchers says Aspen Mountain in Colorado and Park City in Utah will see dramatic changes even with a reduction in carbon emissions, which fuel climate change.LiNeBrEaKUniversity of Colorado professor Mark Williams says the resorts will be in fairly good shape the next 25 years, but after that there will be less snow -- or no snow at all -- at the base areas, and the season will be shorter because snow will accumulate later and melt earlier.LiNeBrEaKWilliams says if carbon emissions increase, the average temperature at Park City will be 10. 4 degrees warmer, and there will likely be no snowpack by 2100.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 15, 2008 Monday 	Utahns hopeful for U.S. policy change  	By Judy Fahys The Salt Lake Tribune  	NEWS; State  	271 words  	Utah activists are breathing easier with the signal of a dramatic change in national environmental policy under a President Obama. LiNeBrEaK"If we have an [Environmental Protection Agency] that actually understands and appreciates science, then we will have a lot less work to do," said Brian Moench, co-founder of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment.LiNeBrEaKHe said much of his group's work has been to counter a pro-industry, anti-science slant of Bush administration regulations.LiNeBrEaK"This gives us hope public health will be given the priority it deserves."LiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City attorney Joro Walker said the Bush administration had loosened many environmental laws, including one that will allow further degradation of air quality in national parks. The attorney, who represents a wide range of environmental groups for Western Resource Advocates, also welcomed a more science-based orientation for national environmental programs as reflected in the Obama environment and energy team.LiNeBrEaK"It shows a new respect for science and the idea we need to pay attention to experts in the field and the things they are saying," she said.LiNeBrEaKGreg Spencer, president of Holladay-based Blue Source said the appointments reflect "a change of course, a course correction" in climate-change policy. Blue Source, a company that manages carbon offsets, has a business plan that assumed carbon-trading would be mandated someday, and it has been helping companies get into the game for more than seven years.LiNeBrEaK"It's a central development for carbon trading," he said of the change at the White House, "and the development of alternative energy and renewable fuel technologies."

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 15, 2008 Monday   THIRD EDITION	Green activists find new ally in labor unions  	By Vanessa Gera THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. A12  	499 words  	POZNAN, Poland - Some U.S. labor groups that have long feared environmental campaigns as a threat to jobs are seeing advantages in going green.LiNeBrEaKThis evolution was clear at this week's U.N. climate talks in Poland, where several American labor groups and environmental activists made joint appeals for policies that would promote high-tech renewable energy as the answer to both climate change and job losses. LiNeBrEaKAbout 25 representatives of U.S. unions were in Poznan - about twice the number as at last year's U.N. talks in Bali, Indonesia - representing workers from the electrical, transit, steel, service and other sectors. LiNeBrEaK"There is a very wide cross-section of American unions that reflects the growing engagement of American unions' support of climate change policies," said David Foster, executive director of the Blue Green Alliance. The group was founded by the United Steelworkers, North America's largest manufacturing union, and the Sierra Club, the United States' largest and oldest grass-roots environmental group.LiNeBrEaKThe Blue Green Alliance was founded in 2006 and expanded this fall to include three more unions and another green group.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental protection and labor rights have intersected before, especially in battles to eliminate toxins and other pollutants from the workplace.LiNeBrEaKBut the two sides also have found themselves at odds. Unions have often seen nature lovers as idealists willing to sacrifice American jobs for the sake of endangered species.LiNeBrEaKBut both groups also have felt growing pressure over the last decade because of manufacturing job losses and what they see as an erosion of workers' rights and weakening environmental protection. Environmentalists want clean energy - such as wind and solar power - to reduce gases that degrade the environment. It is in their interest that new jobs in the sector offer good pay and benefits, to win labor's support for their agenda.LiNeBrEaKRobert Baugh, chairman of AFL-CIO's energy task force, said that his federation still had "some differences" with environmental groups but that "we also have a lot of common interests."LiNeBrEaKAs environmentalists push for clean-energy policies, he said, it's vital that labor get involved to ensure that as those policies are put in place, workers' interests are not ignored.LiNeBrEaKBaugh noted, for instance, that there are about 8,000 parts in a windmill - and that his group wants to ensure that American workers will be making them.LiNeBrEaKThe labor leaders going green cite examples of green policies that have led to new jobs.LiNeBrEaKPennsylvania passed renewable-energy standards several years ago that persuaded the Spanish wind energy company Gamesa to open four plants in Pennsylvania, generating 1,400 jobs making wind turbines. And last year, about 500 laid-off steelworkers returned to work in two steel plate mills in Gary, Ind., to make steel for wind turbines.LiNeBrEaKFoster said unions and green groups had waged joint lobbying efforts nationwide for laws increasing energy efficiency and promoting renewable energies.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	December 15, 2008 Monday 	The case for a higher federal gas tax  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	697 words  	The following editorial appeared in the St. Louis Post Dispatch on Friday, Dec. 12:LiNeBrEaKConsumers are enjoying the lowest retail gasoline prices in years, a welcome ray of light in an ever-darkening economic picture.LiNeBrEaKThat's good news for financially strapped American families and for the domestic auto industry, which has struggled to produce the high-mileage vehicles consumers wanted when gas prices spiked at more than $4 a gallon over the summer.LiNeBrEaKBut in the long run _ as difficult as this is to accept _ low gasoline prices hurt America more than they help. They encourage continued reliance on gas-powered vehicles and harm the efforts to lower carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. They discourage research into new, nonpolluting transportation energy sources _ the single greatest technological challenge of the 21st century. LiNeBrEaKConsider what happened during the early 1980s, when gas prices soared to the then-unheard-of price of $1. 38 a gallon. It triggered a surge of research into alternative energy sources such as solar power and electric vehicles. But as soon as prices began to drop, as they did in 1982, so did the rush of investment and research into alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKAdjusted for inflation, that previous average high gas price of $1. 38 was the equivalent of $3. 14 a gallon. We didn't see average retail prices that high again until this year.LiNeBrEaKBut when gas prices and investment in alternative energy fell in this country in the 1980s, they didn't drop everywhere. In Europe and in Japan, high gasoline taxes kept fuel prices relatively high. That encouraged conservation and provided investors with greater confidence that the money they pumped into developing new technologies would earn an acceptable return.LiNeBrEaKThe result was that Japanese car companies were the first to market new hybrid cars, and European companies led the way in producing new, cleaner diesel vehicles. American car companies, meanwhile, kept churning out large, gas-guzzling SUVs.LiNeBrEaKAfter years of failed attempts to increase mileage requirements for new cars _ efforts steadfastly opposed by American auto manufacturers and their unions, Congress finally succeeded last year. As a result, U.S. cars must average 35 miles per gallon by 2020. European cars, in contrast, averaged 38 miles per gallon in 2006.LiNeBrEaKIf increasing mileage standards has been difficult, hiking gas taxes has been unthinkable. Although the idea is floated occasionally (most incongruously by then-Rep. Dick Cheney in the 1980s, who supported a plan to tax imported oil), it never has received a serious airing. It should.LiNeBrEaKThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in 2004 that increasing the federal gasoline tax _ which has been 18. 4 cents a gallon since 1993 _ would reduce consumption faster and at less cost than increasing mileage standards.LiNeBrEaKObviously, it would not be painless. Consumers would be paying significantly higher prices, and the federal Energy Information Administration predicts that as the global recession abates, gasoline prices will resume their upward climb.LiNeBrEaKBut the impact of higher gas prices could be offset somewhat by reducing other taxes or through a federal income tax rebate. In the meantime, it would reduce gas consumption significantly.LiNeBrEaKThat would help undercut the financial strength of such countries as Iran and Russia that, armed with a surplus of petrodollars, have been unfriendly to American interests. And combined with other tax incentives, it would encourage U.S. investment in energy alternatives.LiNeBrEaKThe nation that succeeds in developing and deploying new, green technologies will have a major economic advantage in the decades to come. It's crucial that the United States be that nation.LiNeBrEaKCongress should raise the federal gas tax and push America toward innovation and energy independence.LiNeBrEaKVisit the Post-Dispatch on the World Wide Web at http://www.stltoday.com	OIL and GAS PRICES (94%); GASOLINE PRICES (91%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (90%); ENERGY RESEARCH (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); GASOLINE (90%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (89%); GASOLINE MARKETS (89%); MOTOR VEHICLES (89%); FUEL TAX (89%); AUTOMAKERS (89%); PRICE INCREASES (89%); TAXES and TAXATION (87%); PRICE CHANGES (78%); RECESSION (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (78%); DIESEL FUEL PRICES (78%); SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (74%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (73%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (72%); SOLAR ENERGY (69%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (69%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (69%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (62%)  					SAINT LOUIS, MO, USA (90%) MISSOURI, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (94%); JAPAN (79%); EUROPE (79%)  	December 15, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 St. Louis Post-Dispatch   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	DICK CHENEY (51%)  	20081215-BC-GASTAX-EDITORIAL  	SL

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	December 15, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	NFL Math Adds Up To A Greener Tampa  	YVETTE C. HAMMETT, yhammett@tampatrib.com  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 5  	409 words  	Trees are being planted to offset the environmental impact of the Super Bowl.LiNeBrEaKBy YVETTE C. HAMMETTLiNeBrEaKyhammett@tampatrib.comLiNeBrEaKTAMPA - It takes some rather complicated math to determine how much pollution and environmental impact is created by a Super Bowl and all its trappings. LiNeBrEaKAnd even then, it's a best guess.LiNeBrEaKBut the theory that planting trees can help stabilize shorelines and draw polluting greenhouse gases from the air is pretty basic.LiNeBrEaKIn anticipation of the Super Bowl on Feb. 1 at Raymond James Stadium, the National Football League is taking a simple approach with what it calls "the greening of Super Bowl XLIII."LiNeBrEaKThe league is providing mangroves for plantings in the Terra Ceia Ecosystem Restoration Area near the Manatee County line and native trees for the McKay Creek Greenway in Pinellas County.LiNeBrEaK"It is a way to offset greenhouse gases, but we're going at it from a different angle," said Jack Groh, NFL director of environmental programs.LiNeBrEaK"We're approaching it more realistically, working with the state and U.S. Forest Service and will have volunteers periodically going out to measure the trees and determine exactly how much greenhouses gas reduction results from the plantings."LiNeBrEaKThe NFL started its planting program five years ago in Jacksonville, but this will be the first time it will include follow-up surveys.LiNeBrEaK"A year from now, we'll be able to say with real confidence what the environmental impact will be," Groh said.LiNeBrEaKTampa Bay Watch, a nonprofit agency that works to protect and restore the Tampa Bay estuary, is taking the lead on the mangrove planting in Terra Ceia, scheduled for Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKVolunteers and staff members will plant 740 red mangroves along the shoreline there.LiNeBrEaKThe mangroves will serve as a feeding, breeding and nursery ground for a variety of animals and marine life and will also help stabilize the shoreline, protecting it from erosion, Tampa Bay Watch spokeswoman Rachel Arndt said.LiNeBrEaKAt McKay Creek, students from Shorecrest Preparatory School in St. Petersburg will plant 400 native trees, including buttonwood, wax myrtle and fire bush recommended by the Florida Department of Forestry.LiNeBrEaKThe NFL contributes half the funds for the plantings - there will be 12 done by game day. The property owners pay the other half in cash or in-kind contributions.

Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News 	December 15, 2008 Monday 	It's cold all right, but no records yet  	K.C. Mehaffey, The Wenatchee World, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	765 words  	Dec. 15--WENATCHEE -- It's cold out there, but not cold enough to fill up local homeless shelters or break temperature records -- yet.LiNeBrEaK"We're abnormally cold, yes, but we're not setting any records," Bob Tobin, senior forecaster for the National Weather Service in Spokane, said this morning.LiNeBrEaKWaterville recorded one of the coldest temperatures in the region, with minus 16 degrees. That's not as cold as the record low of minus 21 degrees, set for this date in 1922. Winthrop and Washington Pass both dipped to minus 6 degrees, and Manson had a low of 3 degrees, he said. LiNeBrEaK"Wenatchee, actually, has been fairly warm," he said of the 14 degrees recorded for its low as of 6: 30 a.m. today. The record for this date was minus 3 degrees, set in 1964. The thermometer will stay below freezing night and day, and the frigid temperatures will last through the week and into next weekend, the agency predicts.LiNeBrEaKRon Roberson, executive director of the Hospitality House in Wenatchee, said the shelter housed 60 men over the weekend and has room for up to 100, including couches and floor space.LiNeBrEaKHe said he expects numbers to rise somewhat as the winter weather continues. "We've been giving out blankets and sleeping bags and extra clothing for those who wish not to live at the mission," he said.LiNeBrEaKBruce's Traditional Housing, which offers shelter for women and children, is full. But there's room for women and children at the Haven of Hope, said director Teria Kelley. "We're actually the lowest we've been in months." The shelter has 25 twin beds plus cribs.LiNeBrEaKKelley said one woman did come in on Friday with an emergency need for shelter. "I don't know how people could be out there in that cold," she said.LiNeBrEaKIn Okanogan County, where there are no permanent homeless shelters, some families are living in the newly insulated housing for farmworkers in Oroville, said Lael Duncan, executive director of Okanogan County Community Action Council.LiNeBrEaKShe said singles and couples are also being housed in churches throughout the county. "The churches have been really great. Individual churches are taking in families they know are having difficulties," she said.LiNeBrEaKDuncan said several families and unsheltered youth came to her office last week and were put up in motels as emergency shelter. "I think a lot of people knew the weather was going to be getting cold," she said.LiNeBrEaKTraveling poses one of the biggest dangers in this cold weather. The National Weather Service reports that 70 percent of winter deaths related to cold and snow occur in people's cars.LiNeBrEaKJeff Adamson, spokesman for the state Department of Transportation, said being prepared is the key to preventing problems on the road.LiNeBrEaKBefore traveling, drivers should check their antifreeze and make sure there's enough to go well below zero. Tire pressure also drops dramatically in cold weather, so a quick check with a pressure gauge can prevent an accident or breakdown, he saidLiNeBrEaK"Make sure you are properly dressed, in case something does happen and you find yourself in a car without a heater. It may not be attractive, but a stocking hat is a wise thing. Make sure you've got one, at least in the trunk," Adamson added. The same goes for a heavy coat, boots and gloves, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe coldest temperatures this week should hit tonight and early Tuesday, with a low of minus 3 predicted in Wenatchee, followed by a high of only 10 degrees Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKMeteorologist Kerry Jones said three storms will push into the region between now and next week, the largest on Tuesday night and Wednesday. Only a few inches of new snow is expected to fall in Wenatchee, he said.LiNeBrEaK"It's not going to warm up anytime soon," Jones added. "We're going to stay in this deep freeze through next weekend. I think our warmest weather, if you want to call it that, will be Wednesday and Thursday, when highs will be in the teens," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe best way to deal with the cold, Tobin suggested: "Stay inside."LiNeBrEaKK.C.

Aberdeen American News (South Dakota)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Proposed tax doesn't pass smell test  	American News, Aberdeen, S.D.  	COMMENTARY  	574 words  	Dec. 14--Ridiculous. That's how we sum up recent discussions about imposing fees on animals that belch and pass gas. If the talk pans out, farmers and ranchers could end up paying an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 for each head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog because the gases they emit could amount to air pollution.LiNeBrEaKBack in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases from motor vehicles amount to air pollution. In the court's majority opinion, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, it was stated that under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency was required to regulate the emission of "any air pollutant" that was likely "to endanger public health or welfare." LiNeBrEaKNow the EPA has published a report that identifies air pollutants and examines ways to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The report notes that the gases emitted by livestock are a contributor to greenhouse gases. That prompted speculation about a new kind of gas tax.LiNeBrEaKEPA officials haven't decided yet how to adress the issues raised by the Supreme Court ruling. In fact, John Millett, a spokesman for EPA's air and radiation division, said there has been an oversimplification of the EPA's recently published document.LiNeBrEaKWe certainly hope so.LiNeBrEaKBut just in case someone was thinking about taxing livestock gas, Sen. John Thune has filed a bill to exempt farm animals from the Clean Air Act. Thune said his legislation would, in effect, eliminate the chance that cattle and other livestock will be taxed as a way to cut down on their alleged contribution to air pollution. He said the original intent of the Clean Air Act was to target smokestacks in industrial states, not farm and ranch livestock.LiNeBrEaKThe American Farm Bureau Federation had used Agriculture Department statistics on the amount of greenhouse gases that come from livestock to calculate that any such EPA fee could cost owners of a modest-sized cattle ranch $30,000 to $40,000 a year. That's enough to bankrupt many livestock owners.LiNeBrEaKThere's no doubt that herds of animals produce plenty of methane gas. Taxing that gas, though, seems well, -- ridiculous.LiNeBrEaKWhat's next? Will we begin taxing fraternity houses and residence halls? Or how about shopping malls? Surely any place where hordes of people congregate, eat and drink would be at risk for such a tax?LiNeBrEaKIf we are to address the issue of the excess gases at all, let's put our focus on positive uses like capturing and controlling it.LiNeBrEaKThe S.C. Johnson company, which manufactures household cleaning products among other things, embarked on a plan in 2003 to power one of its plants with waste methane. After its first year of operation, the company's Waxdale, Wis., plant's emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) dropped 47 percent and fossil fuel energy use was slashed by 50 percent.LiNeBrEaKWhen a second turbine was added in 2006, it reduced the company's greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 20,000 tons per year.LiNeBrEaKNow that's innovation.LiNeBrEaKWe don't need a gas tax on cows.

Alaska Journal of Commerce  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Cordova's Ott honored for demand for spill accountability  	Margaret Bauman, Alaska Journal of Commerce, Anchorage  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	940 words  	Dec. 14--Riki Ott was a commercial fisherwoman when the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound and poured 11 million gallons of oil into the waters, contaminating some 900 miles of coastline.LiNeBrEaKSome 20 years later, the fiery marine biologist from Cordova is still waging her battle with Exxon. For her work, Ott received Cook Inletkeeper's Muckraker of the Year award.LiNeBrEaKIn her acceptance speech Dec. 6, Ott continued her battle, urging supporters of the conservation group to support a 28th amendment to the Constitution, to strip corporations of having the same rights as people. LiNeBrEaKUnder current laws, corporations are treated equally to people, and that's something that's got to stop, she said.LiNeBrEaKBob Shavelson, executive director of Cook Inletkeeper, in presenting the award, saluted Ott for her perseverance in holding government officials and corporate executives accountable for the disastrous spill, from which the coastal fishing communities have never fully recovered.LiNeBrEaKOtt's appearance in Anchorage came in the midst of an extensive tour to promote her new book, "Not One Drop: Betrayal and Courage in the Wake of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill." The book traces the 20 years of frustration of those harmed economically by the spill to be compensated for their losses, and of lessons learned.LiNeBrEaK"Holding the Cordova experience as a mirror, I saw reflected on the surface of America a nation of people so polarized by issues or hamstrung by politics that we could not make collective decisions or take action to save ourselves," she wrote.LiNeBrEaK"The map of red and blue states, sharp in relief of political divides, struck in my mind. However, in community after community, and region after region, people were linking arms and putting aside differences to work together on the central threat to our survival -global climate change."LiNeBrEaKIn the wake of a final oil spill settlement, that came too late for some 6,000 plaintiffs who died during the 20-year legal battle that erupted after the spill, Ott is speaking out for the need to change federal law that allows corporations to be treated like people in court, and the need to wean the nation off of its dependency on oil.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview during the 2008 Pacific Marine Expo in Seattle, Ott said that Cordova has become a case study for disaster trauma that creates dysfunctional people and corrosive relationships in communities. With considerable effort in the two decades since the spill, the people of Cordova have learned to restore community unity, "but we had to work together," she said.LiNeBrEaKOtt said residents of Cordova had to rise above an adversarial legal system that dishes out another layer of emotional trauma, and above Exxon's efforts to fight every single legal claim.LiNeBrEaKAll this came in the aftermath of an appearance from an Exxon representative, who told Cordova residents four days after the spill, "We will consider whatever it takes to keep you whole e the claims will be settled promptly," Ott said the oil company spokesman promised. "And then they fought every single claim."LiNeBrEaKOtt's new book on the spill documents the emotional and economic trauma that the spill left in its wake, of proud families of commercial fishermen left drowning in debt, and the ripple effects of marriages torn apart, families forced to leave the state, and general destruction of the social fabric of the community.LiNeBrEaKOne example was fisherman John Platt, whose once highly prized herring-seine permit was strangling him financially.LiNeBrEaK"When the herring fishery remained closed, year after year, the original debt from John's fishing permits had swelled alarmingly in size as his fisheries' earnings had shrunk," she wrote. "He signed over his fishing boat, all of his permits, including ones that were fully paid off, and his entire punitive damage award to the unrelenting state of Alaska to avoid bankruptcy. He lost his wife and sons to Oregon and his home to debt."LiNeBrEaKAt the root of the legal and social problems that have plagued plaintiffs in the Exxon Valdez litigation is the rights of "corporate persons who have destroyed the systems of checks and balances," she said. "Our legal system is not working. Equal treatment under the law: forget it," she said. "I'm not saying get rid of corporations; I'm saying rebalance the power."LiNeBrEaKTo that end, Ott said she had already talked with members of the transition team for President-elect Barack Obama about the need for change.LiNeBrEaKOtt said she hopes that the sociological lessons learned by the destruction and rehabilitation of the social fabric of Cordova can be applied to other areas of the world struck by disaster, to teach communities torn apart by distrust in the wake of disaster to find common ground and make their communities whole again.LiNeBrEaK"We had learned from the spill that communities polarized by issues or hamstrung by trauma are not able to make collective decisions or take action to save themselves," Ott wrote. "Yet, when people set aside their differences and focus instead on what they have in common, relationships and trust grow and it becomes possible to work together to resolve mutual concerns."

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Federal regulators call for stricter control of pollock fishing  	By Wesley Loy, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	607 words  	ANCHORAGE, Alaska _ Federal fishery regulators meeting in Anchorage on Saturday recommended a deep cut in next year's catch of Bering Sea pollock, the whitefish widely used for such goods as fish sticks, fast-food fish sandwiches and imitation crab.LiNeBrEaKThe action was expected and had the broad support of government scientists who study the fish and believe the stock is healthy but trending down. LiNeBrEaKActivists with environmental groups Oceana and Greenpeace, however, called for a much deeper cutback in next year's catch, arguing the commercial fleet is fishing too hard on a stock important not only as human food but as nourishment for sea lions and other Bering Sea creatures.LiNeBrEaKThe pollock fishery is the nation's largest by weight, yielding products worth more than $1 billion annually.LiNeBrEaKThe North Pacific Fishery Management Council, an 11-member panel of government officials and industry representatives that helps regulate commercial fishing off Alaska, voted unanimously to limit next year's pollock catch to 815,000 metric tons.LiNeBrEaKThat's an 18. 5 percent drop from this year's level and a 45 percent decline from the peak of nearly 1. 5 million tons in 2004. It's also the lowest catch limit in over three decades.LiNeBrEaKThe council action is subject to final approval by the U.S. commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKDoug Mecum, a council member and the Commerce Department's top fishery regulator in Alaska, said he was comfortable setting the pollock limit at 815,000 tons based on the work of federal scientists who spend millions of dollars monitoring the pollock population.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, he said, "don't make anything off this fishery. They have no vested interest."LiNeBrEaKFishery biologists believe a large group of young fish are on track to survive to harvestable size, which could support an increase in the catch limit in 2010, Mecum said.LiNeBrEaKJohn Henderschedt, a council member and employee of Seattle-based pollock fishing company Premier Pacific Seafoods, said the industry had hoped the cut to next year's catch wouldn't be so steep. But he said he had no problem voting to support the 815,000-ton limit the scientists recommended.LiNeBrEaKHenderschedt wasn't sure whether a smaller Alaska catch _ Russia also is a big pollock producer _ could drive up consumer prices for goods such as fish sticks or McDonald's fish sandwiches.LiNeBrEaKBut he said a lower Alaska pollock catch could serve to maintain the current high wholesale prices for goods made from pollock, chiefly fillets and a protein paste called surimi.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental activists had urged a much smaller catch limit of 458,000 tons, or less than half what the fleet netted this year.

Anchorage Daily News (Alaska)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Feds advise slashing pollock catch by 18. 5%: UNANIMOUS COUNCIL VOTE: Environmental activists, however, seek even deeper cutback next year.  	Anchorage Daily News, Alaska  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	626 words  	Dec. 14--Federal fishery regulators meeting in Anchorage on Saturday recommended a deep cut in next year's catch of Bering Sea pollock, the whitefish widely used for such goods as fish sticks, fast-food fish sandwiches and imitation crab.LiNeBrEaKThe action was expected and had the broad support of government scientists who study the fish and believe the stock is healthy but trending down. LiNeBrEaKActivists with environmental groups Oceana and Greenpeace, however, called for a much deeper cutback in next year's catch, arguing the commercial fleet is fishing too hard on a stock important not only as human food but as nourishment for sea lions and other Bering Sea creatures.LiNeBrEaKThe pollock fishery is the nation's largest by weight, yielding products worth more than $1 billion annually.LiNeBrEaKThe North Pacific Fishery Management Council, an 11-member panel of government officials and industry representatives that helps regulate commercial fishing off Alaska, voted unanimously to limit next year's pollock catch to 815,000 metric tons.LiNeBrEaKThat's an 18. 5 percent drop from this year's level and a 45 percent decline from the peak of nearly 1. 5 million tons in 2004. It's also the lowest catch limit in more than three decades.LiNeBrEaKThe council action is subject to final approval by the U.S. commerce secretary.LiNeBrEaKDoug Mecum, a council member and the Commerce Department's top fishery regulator in Alaska, said he was comfortable setting the pollock limit at 815,000 tons based on the work of federal scientists who spend millions of dollars monitoring the pollock population.LiNeBrEaKThe scientists, he said, "don't make anything off this fishery. They have no vested interest."LiNeBrEaKFishery biologists believe a large group of young fish are on track to survive to harvestable size, which could support an increase in the catch limit in 2010, Mecum said.LiNeBrEaKJohn Henderschedt, a council member and employee of Seattle-based pollock fishing company Premier Pacific Seafoods, said the industry had hoped the cut to next year's catch wouldn't be so steep. But he said he had no problem voting to support the 815,000-ton limit the scientists recommended.LiNeBrEaKHenderschedt wasn't sure whether a smaller Alaska catch -- Russia also is a big pollock producer -- could drive up consumer prices for goods such as fish sticks or McDonald's fish sandwiches.LiNeBrEaKBut he said a lower Alaska pollock catch could serve to maintain the current high wholesale prices for goods made from pollock, chiefly fillets and a protein paste called surimi.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental activists had urged a much smaller catch limit of 458,000 tons, or less than half what the fleet netted this year. They said their review of the federal science found weaknesses in the pollock stock that could lead to a collapse, depending on climate change. They also said fishery scientists seem to be putting too much faith in young fish reaching adulthood.LiNeBrEaK"To us, this is a time when you need to be extra cautious because there's not a lot of insurance," said Chris Krenz, who works for Oceana and holds a doctorate in marine ecology.LiNeBrEaKCouncil members, however, said they believe the catch limits the federal scientists recommend are amply precautionary.LiNeBrEaK"The harvest strategy that's in place has resulted in a sustainable harvest for quite a long time," Mecum said.LiNeBrEaKFind Wesley Loy's commercial fishing blog online at adn.com/highliner or call 257-4590.

Appeal-Democrat (Marysville, California)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif., Off Beat column: FEMA's winning ways  	Harold Kruger, Appeal-Democrat, Marysville, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	543 words  	Dec. 14--For Sutter County residents bewildered about flood insurance and revised flood maps, you may have wondered if the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which produced the maps, knows what it's doing.LiNeBrEaKMaybe not, says the Government Accountability Office.LiNeBrEaKThat's a harsh assessment, but it seems FEMA is swimming upstream when it comes to this flood stuff. LiNeBrEaK"The variety of factors and uncertainties involved in generating flood maps render these maps less definitive and authoritative than communities frequently assume them to be," the GAO said in its recent report, "Flood Insurance: FEMA's rate-setting process warrants attention."LiNeBrEaKThe National Flood Insurance Program is about $17 billion in the hole, thanks to Hurricane Katrina and other disasters. Congress wanted some answers.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the GAO study:LiNeBrEaK--"Some of the data used to estimate the probability of flooding have not been updated since the 1980s."LiNeBrEaK--"The maps FEMA uses to set premium rates remain substantially out of date despite recent modernization efforts."LiNeBrEaK--"Some data FEMA used in rate setting are outdated or inaccurate, including data on flood probabilities, damage estimates, and flood maps."LiNeBrEaK--"FEMA allows some properties that were remapped into riskier flood zones to keep their previous lower rates."LiNeBrEaK--"FEMA's rate-setting process does not fully take into account ongoing and planned development, long-term trends in erosion, and effects of global climate change."LiNeBrEaK--"Two properties that are of the same NFIP risk class (for example, both are one-story, single-family homes with no basement and are elevated a certain number of feet above a reference level) are charged the same rate per $100 of insurance although they may be located in different states with differing flood experiences or rest on different topography such as a shallow floodplain versus a steep, mountainous valley."LiNeBrEaK--"Flood probability estimates have not been updated since the 1970s and 1980s, most (flood insurance rate maps) are out of date despite FEMA's recent modernization efforts, and the claims data used to calculate full-risk premiums may be inaccurate."LiNeBrEaK--"As of April 2008, 50 percent of the nation's approximately 105,700 flood maps were at least 15 years old, 58 percent were more than 10 years old, and 70 percent were at least five years old. To the extent that these older maps are inaccurate and the risk of flooding has changed, reliance on these older maps could lead to inaccurate flood risk assessments, which in turn could lead to inaccurate premium rates."LiNeBrEaKFEMA, through the Department of Homeland Security, disagreed with much of the GAO report, saying the "analysis does not grasp some generally accepted principles of insurance and actuarial rate-setting and misrepresents the status of their map modernization effort and its impact on rate adequacy."

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	Refining the art of seeing the hidden  	Dan Zehr AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF  	BUSINESS; Pg. D01  	1495 words  	Hao Ling can see through walls.LiNeBrEaKHis X-ray vision is a little blurry right now, but he's sharpening it with the help of a team of researchers at the University of Texas.LiNeBrEaKLing, an electrical engineering professor at UT, is one of handful of experts nationwide researching radar technologies that eventually could help soldiers, police and rescue workers locate human movement on the other side of walls or inside crumbled buildings.LiNeBrEaKHis latest project is funded by a National Science Foundation program aimed at developing fresh ways to combat roadside bombs and other terrorist activity.LiNeBrEaKLing and his team at UT are researching ways to take Doppler radar technology - the same basic systems meteorologists use to track storms - and put it to work identifying people as they move around in places the naked eye can't see. The goal is to transform waves the radar produces into understandable images of whoever is behind the wall. LiNeBrEaKThe research is still in the early stages, but the potential is easy to see. Future systems could help in situations such as the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, where police needed to know where the attackers were holed up in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. It could help soldiers in Iraq detect whether someone is hiding in a house, and whether they have a gun. It could help a rescue workers pinpoint a survivor struggling under the rubble left in a tornado's path.LiNeBrEaKLing, 49, is one of the country's pre-eminent experts in his niche of radar research. He is also part of Austin's community of innovators &shy;- the researchers and entrepreneurs whose new ideas could someday produce solutions to problems as such as global warming, disease prevention and using technology to make the country safer. Austin likes to bill itself as a city of ideas, and these innovators are at the core of that reputation.LiNeBrEaKCutting-edge basic research is the ground floor for Austin's growth economies. It's the platform for applied research, which can turn technological innovation into new companies and jobs.LiNeBrEaK"If you don't have that base, you don't get to play at the next level," said Pike Powers, an Austin lawyer and longtime player in building the city's high-technology foundation.LiNeBrEaKIn his lab at UT's Pickle Research Campus, Ling and his team bounce radar signals off people as they walk, run or crawl around the room. They built a makeshift cinder-block wall so they can run tests that track people moving on the other side.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the optical waves that produce human sight, certain radar signals can penetrate walls. But the image produced by the radar looks more like some esoteric wave pattern than a visual image. The systems can't return a definitive picture of the person on the other side of the wall, let alone suggest what they might be up to.LiNeBrEaKSo researchers are working to develop a sort of radar brain that can take the feedback, filter out extraneous data and translate the results into an easily recognizable picture. Ling and his team at UT hope to use their physical experiments to craft a proven simulation program that radar experts can use to train those radar brains.LiNeBrEaKBlending theory, pragmatismLiNeBrEaKThe human brain already is "trained to recognize, 'This is a scene. Here is a person walking,'" Ling said. "All that (optical) knowledge base is already between your ears.LiNeBrEaK"The unfortunate thing about radar is, it's an unfamiliar thing for a person to recognize," he said. "It's starting from ground zero, so you have to train it to make it understandable."LiNeBrEaKWhen Ling came to UT in 1986, he already was a rising star in electromagnetics, colleagues and former students said. He finished his doctoral work at the University of Illinois and came out with what colleagues described as a rare balance of the theoretical and the pragmatic.LiNeBrEaKUnlike many researchers who see only the intricacies of their research, they said, Ling also could see the practical application of his work.LiNeBrEaK"That's a combination of skills that, frankly, not a lot of people have," said Robert Rogers, a research engineer at UT's Applied Research Laboratories . Ling sat on Rogers' doctoral dissertation committee.LiNeBrEaK"He never tries to grandstand or snowball anybody with what he knows, although he easily could," Rogers said. "He tries to bring people up to his level. I think that's the mark of a good teacher."LiNeBrEaKLing, who moved with his family from Taiwan to Maryland when he was 13, had started to strike that balance during his undergraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His first major was physics, and he added electrical engineering around his junior year. Electromagnetism gave him the best combination of his interest in engineering and his passion for physics.LiNeBrEaK"In some ways, it's sort of God's rule versus man-made rule," Ling said. "Usually, engineering is about designing things, but in some ways physics is sort of unveiling what nature lets you do. I've been more interested in uncovering what nature lets you do."LiNeBrEaKChallenges of detail, radar noiseLiNeBrEaKHis current project has roots in the Persian Gulf War and the dozens of friendly-fire incidents that occurred. Frustrated by the difficulty of identifying certain targets, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratories and other federal agencies launched programs to improve radar-detection techniques.LiNeBrEaKOne key problem stemmed from the interference that the moving parts of a vehicle would cause on a Doppler radar's feedback. When a police officer bounces a radar wave off a car, its frequency changes - increasing if the vehicle moves closer and decreasing if it moves away.LiNeBrEaKBut police radar only needs to find the vehicle's speed. The technical challenges grow when the objective is to track a vehicle over distance or identify it as friend or foe.LiNeBrEaKThat work often is muddled by smaller wave patterns, called micro-Dopplers, generated by the moving parts of a larger body. Imagine, for example, the feedback a helicopter's rotors would generate in addition to the signal from the chopper as a whole.LiNeBrEaK"They were almost a nuisance in the image," Ling said, "so I wanted to find ways to extract something useful out of these micro-Dopplers."LiNeBrEaKHe's one of a relatively small and obscure group of researchers who have taken up that task.LiNeBrEaKBacked by the National Science Foundation grant, Ling and his team at UT have taken a somewhat different approach to the problem. Rather than just test different hardware and software models, they hope to craft a program that would simulate the wide variety of wave patterns created by people in motion.LiNeBrEaK"That in a sense illustrates what we're after: outside-the-box ideas," said Bruce Hamilton, director of the National Science Foundation program funding Ling's research. "We're not trying to compete with the Department of Defense. The idea was to really open up a new window, namely to academic researchers who might otherwise not be involved."LiNeBrEaKDefining the possibleLiNeBrEaKIf all goes well, Ling and his team could prove the accuracy of the simulation with actual testing. With that work in place, they could turn the program loose to train radar systems to translate the feedback they receive. In theory, these radar systems could track people in a hostage situation as they moved and identify those who were carrying weapons. Troops in urban combat could identify threats inside buildings before barging in.LiNeBrEaKWith that knowledge, users could craft better plans for handling different situations, said Chao Lu, a micro-Doppler researcher and acting dean of Towson University's College of Graduate Studies and Research . That's the driving push behind much of this radar research.LiNeBrEaK"It's an estimate; you never know exactly" what's going on if you don't have a line of sight into a room, Lu said. "But it can make a difference if people are walking around in the room carrying a weapon or if they're empty-handed. That type of movement would be different on the radar."LiNeBrEaKFor now, Ling and his team can track a person moving on the other side of their wall. They can point out the parts of the resulting micro-Doppler wave pattern that relate to a person's torso, arms, legs or a stick they're carrying. But even to their trained eyes, there's a wide gap between their wave patterns and a full identification of what's on the other side.LiNeBrEaKBut then that's why Ling got into this work: to seek out the boundaries nature has set and to go "exploring the art of the possible," as he said. After all, he said, nothing in engineering and physics theory says it's impossible to build a radar system that will help him see through walls.LiNeBrEaK"Optical is electromagnetic radiation," he said. "Radar is electromagnetic radiation, but at different frequencies. " The sexiness of using radar is, you can do through-wall detection. When people walk around a corner, you can still continue to track them."LiNeBrEaKdzehr@statesman.com; 912-5932LiNeBrEaKSpotlight on Austin innovatorsLiNeBrEaK First in an occasional series profiling the scientists, tech wizards and inventors whose creativity helps make Austin a city of ideas.

The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, Steve Pollick column: Holiday bird count still valuable tool  	Steve Pollick, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	801 words  	Dec. 14--When it comes to treasures in the natural scheme of things, birds count -- and that's why people count birds this time of year.LiNeBrEaKToday marks the opening of the 109th Audubon Christmas Bird Count season, a time when thousands of bird enthusiasts will fan out across much of North America and Central America and beyond to index the numbers and distribution of bird species in more than 2,000 counts. The count ends Jan. 5.LiNeBrEaKEach local count occurs within an established 15-mile-diameter circle. Information gathered helps scientists learn more about how birds are faring throughout North America, adding to more than a century of data collected by previous generations of volunteers. LiNeBrEaKWith habitat and wild areas disappearing at an alarming rate and global warming affecting some ranges, the National Audubon Society says, scientists will rely on CBC data to help identify birds in most urgent need of conservation action.LiNeBrEaK"Everyone who takes part in the Christmas Bird Count plays a critical role in helping us focus attention and conservation where it is most needed." said Dr. Tom Bancroft, chief scientist for Audubon. "Their observations are the foundation for Audubon's State of the Birds Reports, like our Common Birds in Decline analysis, which revealed precipitous declines among many of our nation's most common and familiar birds."LiNeBrEaKThe holiday bird count also is instrumental in developing Audubon's WatchList, which most recently identified species in the continental U.S. and in Hawaii in dire need of conservation help.LiNeBrEaKDuring last year's count, nearly 70 million birds were counted by more than 58,000 participants in all 50 states, every Canadian province, parts of Central and South America, Bermuda, the West Indies, and Pacific Islands.LiNeBrEaKThe Christmas Bird Count began over a century ago when the founder of Audubon magazine, Frank Chapman, changed the course of ornithological history. In 1900, Chapman led a small group on an alternative to the "side hunt," when teams competed to see who could shoot the most game. Instead, Chapman proposed they identify, count, and record all the birds they saw, founding what some consider to be the world's most significant citizen-based conservation effort.LiNeBrEaKTo learn more about how to participate in a Christmas Bird Count near you, visit audubon.org/bird/cbc.LiNeBrEaKThe longest-running and leading count in northwest Ohio is that run by the Toledo Naturalists' Association. It has developed a reputation as one of the state's most productive counts with a species total usually around 90.LiNeBrEaKThe 2008 TNA count, the organization's 77th, is under way today. Among areas being surveyed by various teams include Bay Shore Power Plant (morning) and Maumee Bay State Park, and surrounding areas; Bay Shore Power Plant (afternoon)/Woodlawn Cemetery/Ottawa City Park; Pearson Metropark and Mallard Club State Wildlife Area; Point Place/North Toledo; Maumee River Watershed/downtown Toledo/Rossford, and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuge, led by Elliot Tramer.LiNeBrEaKThose unable to go afield but wanting to participate can maintain a list of birds coming to their backyard feeding stations, and submit them to TNA compiler Matt Anderson at Matt_Anderson@andersonsinc.com, or call him at 419-891-6532.LiNeBrEaKA post-count countdown gathering is set for Tony Packo's Restaurant on Consaul Street in East Toledo at 5 p.m. Other details and contacts can be found by calling the rare bird hotline, 419-877-9640, or at toledonaturalist.org.LiNeBrEaKOther notable counts in the region during the CBC cycle include:LiNeBrEaKThe third annual Rudolph area count, set for Dec. 21 and led by Tom Kemp, 419-356-5704. Meet at Frisch's Big Boy, East Wooster Street, Bowling Green, 7 a.m.LiNeBrEaKThe Fremont area count, also Dec. 21, done in conjunction with the Ohio Young Birders Club, Green Creek Wildlife Society, and Black Swamp Bird Observatory. Meet at 7 a.m. at Karen's Restaurant, 921 East State St., Fremont, compiler Paul Sherwood. Call BSBO 419-898-4070.LiNeBrEaKThe 42nd annual Grand Rapids/Waterville count, Jan. 3, also led by Kemp, meeting at 7 a.m. at Mikey P's Restaurant in Whitehouse.LiNeBrEaKThe Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge count, Jan. 4, led by Tom Bartlett, 419-447-0005 or via tomb@tiffinohio.com Meet at 7: 45 a.m. in the old refuge parking lot.

The Boston Globe 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE SKEPTICS  		LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. K8  	799 words  	Debate shouldn'tLiNeBrEaKstop us fromLiNeBrEaKtaking stepsLiNeBrEaKJEFF JACOBY'S "Skepticism on climate change" (Op-ed, Dec. 7) suggests we need to listen to both sides of the global warming debate. There are two extremes: Some scientists feel global warming is not happening, or is a natural phenomenon, and some feel we have grossly underestimated the impact of global warming. Then there is the majority in the middle, who feel that global warming is happening and is caused by humans. I'm going to side with them.LiNeBrEaKBut what scares me most is the possibility that we are underestimating global warming, not overestimating it. And what if global warming is bunk? Should we stop trying to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and instead continue sending money to countries that support terrorism? Should we stop trying to conserve energy? Should we continue to invest in fossil fuels that pollute instead of moving to clean-energy technologies? Should we ignore the huge potential market for clean-energy technology, which could boost our ailing economy and create millions of jobs? LiNeBrEaKWhich side you take on global warming does not change the fact that investing in renewable energy makes sense for America.LiNeBrEaKMark GreenlawLiNeBrEaKWaylandLiNeBrEaKJEFF JACOBY'S "Skepticism on climate change" may be distilled to a few brief points: Science is complicated; climate change is no exception; and, not everybody agrees on everything all the time. This, however, is nothing new.LiNeBrEaKWhat is new is the nature and breadth of potential consequences. Most of the effects caused by the warming of our planet are unpleasant, and it would seem reasonable that they be avoided. LiNeBrEaKWhat then must we do? First, we embrace the complexity and disagreement. Their presence is unavoidable in any scientific debate, and their inclusion will strengthen the deliberative process. At the same time, however, it is unwise to be paralyzed by controversy or the humble limits of our understanding; good policy is about making sound decisions based on imperfect information. Climate change will always be complicated, and our understanding perpetually limited. Jacoby, and his readers, would be better served by moving beyond these tired realities.LiNeBrEaKJames A. HamiltonLiNeBrEaKArlingtonLiNeBrEaKDon't silenceLiNeBrEaKalternative viewsLiNeBrEaKIT WAS encouraging to read about the growth of alternative viewpoints on the possible causes of and solutions to global warming as presented by Jeff Jacoby. For far too long there seems to have been only one allowed public view on global warming, and those who disagreed were labeled deniers. Science is about gathering facts, exploring theories, and having healthy debates. Open debate has been sorely missing on the issue of global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe political left's favorite argument is that there is no argument on global warming. They try to silence or discredit anyone who disagrees. As George Will has said, "People only insist that a debate stop when they are afraid what might be learned if it continues." I remember how strong the consensus was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and look how wrong that turned out.LiNeBrEaKAs researchers further explore causes and solutions, and the so-called consensus on global warming starts to weaken, I urge scientists and public officials to keep an open mind.LiNeBrEaKCarl SchwarzLiNeBrEaKHanoverLiNeBrEaKWhere interestLiNeBrEaKmeets ideology?LiNeBrEaKSO THE obfuscation begins. We finally have in the wings a Congress and an administration that may be ready to take real action to reverse human-caused global warming, and the climate-change deniers are coming out of the woodwork yelling "alarmist." Jeff Jacoby failed to note in his Dec. 7 op-ed that the Heartland Institute, which he reports is sponsoring the scientific conference he cites, is a conservative-libertarian think tank, funded in part by Big Tobacco, Big Oil, and other interest groups who will fight any legislation that may threaten their bottom line or ideology.LiNeBrEaKIt's one thing to be skeptical in the search for truth, but quite another to wear the cloak of scientific skepticism to advance one's self interest at the cost of the greater good.LiNeBrEaKStan HitronLiNeBrEaKNeedhamLiNeBrEaKJEFF JACOBY misses the point in arguing about the need for ongoing debate on climate change. Sure, there is a tiny minority of climate change skeptics, and they might even be right, but so what? Is Jacoby making an academic argument for the purity of scientific debate? Or is he suggesting, given the potential stakes, that the world can risk the possibility - dare I say likelihood - that the skeptics are wrong, and not take steps to address the perceived threat? By arguing for the need for skepticism, Jacoby perpetuates the wishful thinking that nothing as big and bad as the predicted impacts of climate change could happen. I hope he is right, but I'm skeptical.LiNeBrEaKJack KutnerLiNeBrEaKCambridgeLiNeBrEaKThe writer is chief operating officer of BigBelly Solar.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Stimulus 'is like chum in the water for lobbyists,' critics claim  	By James Oliphant and Richard Simon, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	1230 words  	WASHINGTON _ Since President-elect Barack Obama laid out plans for the largest injection of federal spending into the economy since the New Deal, just about everyone has started angling for a piece of the action.LiNeBrEaKWith estimates of the package that will be considered by the new Congress starting in January topping out at anywhere between $500 billion and $1 trillion, ailing sectors such as home builders and sellers, the airlines, railroads, and, yes, the auto industry view the stimulus as a means to get healthy again. That includes the air conditioning industry, America's libraries and catfish farmers. All of them, and many more, have deployed lobbyists on Capitol Hill in hope of benefiting from the spending spree.LiNeBrEaK"The ever-increasing cost of the yet-to-be-seen stimulus is like chum in the water for lobbyists circling to snap up some taxpayer cash for their clients," said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group.LiNeBrEaKThe primary goal of Obama's stimulus is job creation. His plan, he says, could lead to 2. 5 million new jobs by 2011 and rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure, make school buildings more energy efficient, modernize hospitals and extend broadband to underserved areas. LiNeBrEaKBut so far, Obama has offered little in the way of specifics or a price-tag. That is an opening for industry groups with no shortage of suggestions. "It's not very often business and government run on parallel tracks," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. "You've got to spend money to make money."LiNeBrEaKMuch of the interest has centered on Obama's pledge to rebuild the nation's roads, bridges, and highways. The business community, led by the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce, places the emphasis on "shovel-ready" projects that can be undertaken once funding is approved. Otherwise, the Chamber says, any jolt to the economy will arrive too late. Rather than rebuilding highways, a nonprofit group called Reconnecting America wants the government to focus on a "21st Century National Transportation System" of mass transit and walking and bike paths.LiNeBrEaKAnd a consortium of environmental groups has unveiled a $160 billion pitch for "green" stimulus, including investments in national parks, renewable fuels and energy efficiency. Just as notable is what they are lobbying against: any construction work that widens existing roads or builds new ones, which the groups contend would amount to investing in the automobile traffic that contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We must be careful to spend this money on programs that are going to benefit both our economy and our environment," said Colin Peppard of Friends of the Earth. Infrastructure, however, is defined in many ways. The Air Transport Association is seeking $1 billion to upgrade airports and $3 billion to modernize avionics.LiNeBrEaKMagellan Midstream Partners, owner of the longest refined-oil pipeline in the nation, wants to develop the first "dedicated ethanol pipeline" from Iowa to New York City. It's seeking a loan guarantee of $3. 5 billion through the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaKThe National Association of Railroad Passengers is pushing for $10 billion for inter-city passenger rail projects, including development of a high-speed train in California and funding for a high-tech braking system that has gained new attention since the commuter train-freight train collision that killed 25 people and injured 135 in Chatsworth.LiNeBrEaK"Travel stimulates the economy," said Ross B. Capon, the group's president.LiNeBrEaKThe travel industry wants a "multimillion-dollar marketing and public outreach effort to educate visitors about changing security policies and promote the U.S. as a destination," according to the Travel Industry Association. The group is seeking a start-up federal loan of $10 million.LiNeBrEaKCTIA-The Wireless Association, trade group for wireless service providers, wants to eliminate "roadblocks to deployment of towers and other wireless infrastructure." The industry wants to build 16,000 new towers.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKSome interests are lobbying for tax breaks to spur the economy.LiNeBrEaKFor instance, the business community is seeking a series of tax breaks which it says will foster growth and return money to the federal treasury. It favors, among other things, a tax rebate to middle-class taxpayers, a sizable reduction in the corporate capital gains tax and a sharp reduction in the tax rate on earnings that firms in the United States get from foreign subsidiaries. The idea, according to U.S. Chamber executive vice president R. Bruce Josten, is to propel more cash through the financial system and loosen credit markets: "There are two bookends to the economy: credit and confidence. The reality is that there's not a whole of either of the moment."LiNeBrEaKThe beleaguered housing industry wants all buyers to receive a tax credit for a home purchase and to have the government subsidize mortgage rates through a "buy-down" program lowering borrowing costs. The goal is to eliminate a 12-month backlog in unsold houses.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Conditioning Contractors of America calls increased efficiency the "low-hanging fruit" in the effort to cut energy consumption and stimulate the economy. The group wants tax incentives for homeowners and businesses to upgrade heating and air conditioning systems. The National Automobile Dealers Association is seeking a tax break encouraging more people to buy cars and a "cash for clunkers" program that helps people trade in older vehicles for new, more fuel-efficient ones.LiNeBrEaK"You get people buying cars again, you get the economy back on track pretty fast," said the association's Bailey Wood.LiNeBrEaKThen there are sectors making pitches with a less-certain payoff.LiNeBrEaKIt's unclear, for instance, how $100 million for libraries sought by the American Library Association would stimulate the economy.LiNeBrEaK"Every day, across the country, libraries are doing all kinds of things to help get America back to work," said Melanie Anderson, the group's associate director of government relations.LiNeBrEaKAnd then, there are the catfish.LiNeBrEaK"The catfish industry is on the verge of collapse," said Marty Fuller of the Catfish Farmers of America, citing high feed prices and an increase of imports. Some 6,000 jobs are at stake, mostly in economically depressed areas in states such as Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Officials are talking about seeking $50 million in aid as a stimulus.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKThe risk, of course, is that any final stimulus package could become so larded with requests that nothing takes high priority, or that it becomes so huge that it simply worsens the nation's mounting budget deficit.LiNeBrEaKThe bigger, the better, says the Home Builders' Howard, if the goal is economic revival. "I'm more concerned about Congress undershooting the goal that overshooting the goal," he said. "I don't think you can keep doing this piecemeal. I think you have to do it in one fell swoop."LiNeBrEaK(The Chicago Tribune Washington Bureau's Jim Tankersley contributed to this report.)

Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, is crowing that he has officially secured a seat on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which deals not only with those namesake issues but also has input on health care and consumer affairs and protection. McNerney, a wind energy engineer by trade, said he's "thrilled."LiNeBrEaK"I'm anxious to delve into some of the committee's issues, including the development of a new national energy policy that focuses on the use and production of renewable energy and addressing the need for affordable and accessible healthcare for all Americans," he said in his news release.LiNeBrEaKMcNerney in his first term had served on the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming; the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee; the Veterans Affairs Committee; and the Science and Technology Committee.LiNeBrEaKSpokesman Andy Stone said McNerney will probably have to relinquish one of those seats, given the fact that he already needed a waiver to let him serve on four committees at once.LiNeBrEaKHis new appointment became official today after a vote in the Steering and Policy Committee and then a ratifying vote by the entire Democratic Caucus. The vote and ratification also cemented last month's palace coup staged by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, to replace Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., as Energy and Commerce's chairman   a change which seems to be taking the panel in a much more liberal direction. Waxman is seen as more aligned with President-elect Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, on issues such as cutting greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental concerns; Dingell, the panel's top Democrat for close to three decades, was a staunch supporter of Detroit automakers and other big industries such as electric utilities.LiNeBrEaKSo, an interesting place for McNerney to be, at an interesting time.LiNeBrEaKDec. 10LiNeBrEaKRep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, joined House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., today in releasing a report to President-elect Barack Obama on the House's goals and recommendations in working towards peace in Darfur.LiNeBrEaK"It has been over five years since Congress declared that genocide was taking place in the Darfur region of Sudan," Lee said in a statement issued later today. "With hundreds of thousands killed, deteriorating conditions and no end in sight, we felt it important to release this white paper outlining our recommendations for the incoming administration on addressing this genocide."LiNeBrEaK"The U.S. must be leaders in the peace process in Darfur. President-elect Obama has already stated his commitment to addressing the genocide in Darfur, and we in Congress are prepared to work diligently with his administration towards a swift resolution to this dire situation."LiNeBrEaKHoyer, Lee and nine other House members from both sides of the aisle signed the white paper, which among other recommendations urges Obama to appoint a full-time, senior-level envoy to lead the charge on a new round of peace talks; to conduct an immediate assessment of the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the region; and to coordinate with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon as soon as possible to give peacekeepers the authority and resources they need to save lives.LiNeBrEaKLee's been very active on Darfur; she pushed successfully for a law letting states to divest from companies doing business with the government of Sudan (she'd introduced it as H.R. 180, though it was U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd's similar S. 2271 that was eventually signed into law), and her resolutions calling for action from the League of Arab States and China to use their leverage with Sudan to end the genocide both passed in the House.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Home Final Edition	QandA / KATHY MATTEA;  'Coal' a yule treat for singer 	Gary Budzak, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	FEATURES - LIFE and ARTS; Pg. 07E  	608 words  	Getting a lump of coal in one's Christmas stocking means you've been bad. But Kathy Mattea's latest recording, Coal, is a good stocking stuffer.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this month, the album of 11 songs about coal mining was nominated for a Grammy in the traditional folk album category. Mattea, 49, has previously won Grammys in the country (1990) and gospel (1993) genres. In addition to singing, she is an activist for causes ranging from AIDS awareness to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe West Virginia-born singer and her six-person band will perform Saturday in the Midland Theatre to mark the Newark landmark's 80th anniversary. The Dispatch recently spoke to her by phone from her home in Nashville, Tenn. LiNeBrEaKQ: Will you be doing your hits as well as holiday tunes in your concert?LiNeBrEaKA: Yes. The second half is all Christmas, and the first half is mostly older stuff and requests. We'll do a lot of the songs we're known for because I always think this might be the only chance someone would have to hear 18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses.LiNeBrEaKQ: You've played at the Midland before, and you're back for its birthday.LiNeBrEaKA: It's really one of the great restorations and one of the places you remember.LiNeBrEaKQ: Some of your relatives worked in the mines. Did that inspire you to do Coal ?LiNeBrEaKA: Both my grandfathers were coal miners. My mom worked for the United Mine Workers when she was young. My dad was the first one in his generation to get out of the mines. The tradition is very strong: Both my parents grew up in coal towns.LiNeBrEaKThe seed of (Coal) was the Sago (W.Va.) mine disaster in January of 2006. A week after, I saw Al Gore give a slide show at Vanderbilt University . . . and I started making this record . . . and then suddenly, all these different (things) in my life became about the same thing, and coal was at the center of all of it.LiNeBrEaKI am astonished how this black rock is at the center of so many of the big questions we face, from human-rights issues to environmental issues to the future of the planet and our ability to live here to traditions that we hold dear to a sense of attachment to place and a way of life.LiNeBrEaKQ: Some people think singers shouldn't speak out on social issues. Why do you?LiNeBrEaKA: I can understand, and I think it's really important to me to not just be someone who kind of flings my voice around and does more harm than good, jumping into something that I don't know anything about.LiNeBrEaKFor me, what's going on in the coal fields, the struggle about mountaintop removal, and global warming and all those implications, it's not arbitrary. I grew up in the mountains doing it all (spelunking, hiking, fishing, running trout lines), so I just didn't hang out in the suburbs. I feel like I do have a point of view.LiNeBrEaKIf I can help give voice to people who don't have a multimillion-dollar political action committee at their disposal . . . then I do think I have something I can add.LiNeBrEaKQ: When you were a little girl, did your parents ever say that Santa will bring you a lump of coal if you're bad?LiNeBrEaKA: (Laughs) I missed that tradition, somehow. . . .LiNeBrEaKI did this interview (Jan. 2) at this old bed-and-breakfast (in Lexington, Ky.) that happened to be run by a British couple, and they said, "In England, it's good luck on New Year's Day for the first person in your house to bring you a lump of coal."LiNeBrEaKI looked at them, smiled, reached into my bag and pulled out a chunk of coal. And you would have thought I gave them a million dollars.LiNeBrEaKgbudzak@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKBox Story: * Kathy Mattea will present "Songs and the Season" at 8 p.m. Saturday in the Midland Theatre, 36 N.

DISPATCHES; Pg. 07A  	508 words  	The official papers of GOP Reps. Deborah Pryce of Upper Arlington and Ralph Regula of Navarre, both of whom are retiring from Congress in January, are being donated to Ohio State University, OSU President E. Gordon Gee said last week. LiNeBrEaK"I am grateful to Deborah Pryce and Ralph Regula for donating these historic papers to the Ohio State University," said Gee in a statement. "These collections contain a wealth of information on the history of Congress and our country during the past four decades."LiNeBrEaKPryce will leave the House after 16 years and Regula after 36 years.LiNeBrEaKThe school said that the pair's official papers will be put into the Ohio Congressional Archives administered by the university libraries. The papers will be open to OSU students, faculty members and the public for research purposes after an estimated two- to three-year sorting process.LiNeBrEaKAlso last week, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, asked the U.S. General Services Administration to name a planned new federal building in Canton after Regula. \ \LiNeBrEaK\ Campaign manager will be Kilroy's chief of staff \LiNeBrEaKDemocrat Mary Jo Kilroy, the Franklin County commissioner who won a close election to replace retiring Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Upper Arlington, in the 15th Congressional District, last week announced that Randy Borntrager will be her chief of staff.LiNeBrEaKBorntrager, a graduate of Ohio State University, has served as communications director for the Ohio Democratic Party and an aide in the Ohio Senate. He also spent two years in Washington working for a survey research firm.LiNeBrEaKHe was Kilroy's campaign manager in the race against Republican Steve Stivers. \ \LiNeBrEaK\ Space, Sutton named to Energy and Commerce \LiNeBrEaKRep.

Betty Sutton, D-Barberton, as the Ohio lawmakers on the committee, which is chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Sutton also was named to the panel last week. \ \LiNeBrEaK\ Stivers outraised Kilroy in final weeks of campaign \LiNeBrEaKIt took awhile after Election Day for Democrat Mary Jo Kilroy to be declared the winner over Republican Steve Stivers in a squeaker of a congressional race, and the cash race in the final days also was close.LiNeBrEaKFederal Election Commission reports filed this month, covering the period of Oct. 16 through Nov. 24, showed that Stivers outraised Kilroy in that period: $331,363 to $306,564. But Kilroy outraised Stivers overall: $2. 46 million to $2. 22 million, the reports showed.LiNeBrEaKMajor donors to Kilroy in the final days of the campaign included the AFL-CIO's political action committee, which gave $2,500 on Oct. 30 for a total of $7,500 over the course the race, and the National Education Association political action committee, which gave $5,000 on Oct. 30 for a total of $10,000 overall to Kilroy's campaign.LiNeBrEaKCompiled by Jack Torry and Jonathan Riskind of the Dispatch Washington BureauLiNeBrEaKjtorry@dispatch.comLiNeBrEaKjriskind@dispatch.com	US REPUBLICAN PARTY (90%); COLLEGES and UNIVERSITIES (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US FEDERAL ELECTIONS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); ELECTIONS (89%); APPOINTMENTS (88%); LEGISLATORS (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (78%); ACADEMIC LIBRARIES (78%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); CAMPAIGN FINANCE (73%); POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES (73%); LIBRARIES (71%); EMISSIONS (68%); COUNTIES (67%); ELECTION AUTHORITIES (66%); GLOBAL WARMING (62%)  		OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY (91%); GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (56%)  			COLUMBUS, OH, USA (73%) OHIO, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 14, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Briefs  	Newspaper  	2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  		DEBORAH PRYCE (96%); RALPH REGULA (95%); SHERROD BROWN (56%); ZACHARY T SPACE (53%); HENRY WAXMAN (52%); BETTY SUTTON (52%)  														
Daily Oklahoman  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Prep football: They love their football down under  	Ryan Aber, The Oklahoman, Oklahoma City  	SPORTS  	459 words  	Dec. 14--It's doubtful anyone in attendance at Saturday night's Class 2A championship game between Heritage Hall and Chandler came farther to watch than David Karoly. LiNeBrEaKKaroly made the trip from Melbourne, Australia, to cheer on Heritage Hall.LiNeBrEaKHe was to have been at an OU graduation Saturday night but once he found out the Chargers were in the finals, there was a change of plans.LiNeBrEaK"I was here for five years and I learned my priorities," Karoly said. "Football comes first."LiNeBrEaKAfter the game, Karoly was on the field celebrating Heritage Hall's 37-7 win with the rest of the Chargers faithful.LiNeBrEaKKaroly is an adjunct professor at the University of Oklahoma's school of meteorology and served on the faculty at the school from 2003-07.LiNeBrEaKHis son, Chris, played for Heritage Hall during that time, playing offensive and defensive lines.LiNeBrEaKChris is currently going to college at Melbourne's Monash University and playing American football for an amateur team there.LiNeBrEaK"He was definitely jealous of me coming here," Karoly said. "He's been watching the online videos Heritage Hall has been posting this year and just loves those."LiNeBrEaKHeritage Hall wasn't the first school choice for the family when they moved to Norman from Melbourne.LiNeBrEaKChris started out at Norman High his freshman year but transferred to Heritage Hall for his sophomore year, wanting to go to a school that was smaller than Norman.LiNeBrEaKSo the family made daily drives up either I-35 or Sooner Road from Norman to Heritage Hall to school, practices and games.LiNeBrEaK"He loved it here," Karoly said.LiNeBrEaKChris eventually adjusted and wound up an honor roll student at Heritage Hall. He also adjusted to American football after playing Australian rules football at home.LiNeBrEaK"He's a big boy," Karoly said. "Six-foot-4 and he came over at 180 pounds. They added some weight on him here though."LiNeBrEaKWhen Chris graduated and decided to head back to Australia for college, the family decided to move back as well.LiNeBrEaKKaroly is currently a professor at the University of Melbourne's School of Earth Sciences and researches climate change.LiNeBrEaKHe will also get to see his wife, Susan, graduate from Oklahoma City University on Friday with a degree in religion and philosophy.LiNeBrEaKShe had one semester of study left when the family moved back to Australia. Susan was to have been at Saturday night's game but came down with a cold and stayed in instead.

Dayton Daily News (Ohio) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Obama's victory plants seeds of inspiration and leadership  	MARY MCCARTY COMMENTARY  	LOCAL; Pg. A12  	628 words  	"How many of you think you could grow up to be president?"LiNeBrEaKJohn Boucuvalas posed the question to his students at the Dayton View Academy, expecting only a few raised hands from a student body that's nearly entirely black.LiNeBrEaKInstead, nearly two-thirds of the students raised their hands. Boucuvalas looked for the telltale smirks but found none. LiNeBrEaK"Seriously," he persisted, "who thinks they might grow up to be president?" Same result.LiNeBrEaKBoucuvalas thought it was a fluke. Then he posed the same question to students at various grade levels, with similar results. "That's when I realized something deeper was going on," he said.LiNeBrEaKAnd that's when the Future Obamas of America was born. It's a club designed to recognize and encourage leadership in students at two charter schools, the Dayton View Academy and the Dayton Academy.LiNeBrEaKIt's capitalizing on the momentum of the presidential campaign which gave many of these students their first realistic hope that they, too, are part of that tired old adage: "Anybody can grow up to be president."LiNeBrEaKFrom the start of Obama's campaign, seventh-grader Jordan Jones had a strong hunch that "he can do it, he can do it." Still, on election night he found himself "shocked, shocked. Finally, there will be an African-American in the White House."LiNeBrEaKEighth-grader Solomon Parker also believed in Obama from the beginning. He was troubled when people said they didn't believe a black man could be elected president - or worse yet, that he wouldn't be capable of leading the country. Parker followed his candidate's example and brushed aside such comments. "It's a very childish thing to say," Parker said. "But Obama's a smart guy, and he pushed and he pushed. He didn't listen to the criticism; he didn't care about it because he had his mind set on the goal."LiNeBrEaKThat's exactly the kind of lesson Boucuvalas is trying to instill. As student engagement director for both schools, he creates programs, clubs and contests to keep kids interested in school and involved in their communities. So far the club has 32 members who have been elected by their classmates.LiNeBrEaKEach winner penned a short essay detailing what he or she would do "if I were president."LiNeBrEaKParker wrote, "I would try to find a solution to global warming and work to lower the price of gas."LiNeBrEaKFourth-grader Brooke White promised, "I would make the world a better place by making sure school work and other activities were fun."LiNeBrEaKJones wrote, "I would travel around the country to listen to the opinions of people in each state. I would also build more homeless shelters for those in need."LiNeBrEaKTrue, these students can't run for president just yet. They manage to find practical application in their daily lives for the inspiration they've derived from Obama. Parker ran for student council vice president - and won. Despite naysayers who said he wasn't good enough, Jones tried out for the basketball team - and made it. "I learned that you reach for it and grab it," he said. "Even if you don't make it, it's worth the effort."LiNeBrEaKSixth-grader Rayona Vinson-Simon joined the Future Teachers of America, in spite of friends who discouraged her. "Obama inspired me because he showed me not to listen to what everyone else says, but be who you want to be," she said.LiNeBrEaKParker took note of Obama's support system. "Anybody can do what they set their mind to do if the believe in themselves and have people who believe in them," he said.LiNeBrEaKThird-grader Ty'Najion Hayes wrote, "If I were president, I would make sure people got treated fairly at all times. I would give money to school for more field trips. I would give $10,000 to charity."LiNeBrEaKQuick! Put her to work on the bailout plan.LiNeBrEaKFuture Obamas? Forget about it.LiNeBrEaKLet's elect these kids right now.LiNeBrEaKContact this reporter at (937) 225-2209 or mmccarty@DaytonDailyNe ws.com.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Act now on renewable energy  	R. Keith Schwer  	D; Pg. 4D  	739 words  	SPECIAL TO THE REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKAdverse events of the past two years have exacted a heavy toll on the Silver State's economy. The most recent unemployment rate stands at 7. 3 percent, the sixth highest among the states. Conditions will likely deteriorate further in the months ahead; a drawn-out recession remains a possibility.LiNeBrEaKBiting economic woes come as we face challenges from global warming and environmental degradation. Raising energy efficiency and finding alternative energy sources to replace heavy reliance on unpredictable foreign oil and polluting coal are tasks to challenge Nevadans. LiNeBrEaKAnswering the challenge would leave a legacy for our grandchildren.LiNeBrEaKState and local resources are scarce in the current economic upheaval, growing scarcer each month, suggesting, perhaps, that we can do nothing but wait and endure. To do so, however, is to cower from our heritage.LiNeBrEaKLet me suggest that we pause and reflect on the darkest hour on the western European front in World War II. In the winter of 1944, as the Battle of Bulge raged and the outcome looked bleak, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower summoned his command and with his characteristic smile and matter-of-fact Midwestern approach, convinced his generals that the dire environment in which they found themselves was a window of opportunity. Today, we find ourselves beleaguered with rising unemployment, deflating home values, and shrinking 401(k)s, yet the darkest hour is also the time to gain focus. Focusing on renewable energy, seeding research and advancing knowledge, and pursuing enlightened public policy are a fruitful use of our time and efforts. Our economic difficulties offer us the chance to advance Nevada's renewable energy resources.LiNeBrEaKBoth of this year's presidential candidates stressed the need for policy changes on energy and the environment. Changes they discussed included grappling with our dependence on unfriendly governments for oil, the need for prudent decisions in our nation's best interest, sustainable growth, and improved national defense with more readily available domestic sources. The incoming administration has energy policy on its immediate "to do" list. What are the residents and leaders of the Silver State to do?LiNeBrEaKNevadans can contribute significantly to the national economy if we take advantage of the existing opportunity in renewable energy. We can be a forerunner in clean energy production and technology development because of our vast natural resources and strong congressional leadership. Our state is rich in solar power, geothermal energy and wind, and we have the capacity to expand production on all fronts and create good paying new jobs. There has never been a better time to invest in our state's future.LiNeBrEaKThe next two years present a unique prospect to pass legislation at the state and federal levels. We need policies that encourage the creation and expansion of renewable energy industries in Nevada. This will provide jobs and raise revenue. The state of Nevada should increase incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency investments. Our universities need support to advance their research mission, improve sustainable economic-growth, and expand renewable energy development in the state.LiNeBrEaKJob opportunities linked to renewable energy cut across the work force. They include tradesmen, craftsmen, engineers and scientists. Workers will install solar panels and wind turbines, expand mass transit and renovate buildings. Engineers and scientists will develop smart electrical grids and formulate better bio-fuels. Renewable energy and higher energy efficiency are good for Nevada's economy.LiNeBrEaKEnergy use and the economy are inescapably linked, and the steps we take now will not only create jobs for Nevada's workers, but will also impact the prosperity of future generations.LiNeBrEaKIt is time to turn the challenges we face into new opportunities. We can do this by contacting our government leaders and supporting our congressional representatives as they take steps to develop effective energy policy and pass new legislation, in short, fulfilling our citizenship obligations. Public sentiment among U.S. voters supports renewable energy initiatives and clean, affordable solutions, and no other issue is as important and pressing for the economy and the environment. Action and prudent decisions are called for.LiNeBrEaKR. Keith Schwer (schwer@unlv.nevada.edu) is director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at UNLV.

The Modesto Bee (California)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: Denham's ambition is no big surprise  	Judy Sly, The Modesto Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	440 words  	Dec. 14--Sen. Jeff Denham, R-Atwater, has been planning a run for lieutenant governor for 18 months, so his announcement last week should have surprised no one. What is interesting is that at least two other candidates for the post are from the Central Valley and Mother Lode. There are a number of others considering a 2010 run to replace John Garamendi. LiNeBrEaKThe point of an early announcement, of course, is to amass endorsements and money, thereby discouraging and edging out other possible candidates. Denham has lined up an impressive list of Republican supporters, including the Republican legislators from our area -- Sen. Dave Cogdill and Assemblymen Bill and Tom Berryhill.LiNeBrEaKAs for money, at the midsummer reporting deadline, Denham had a little more than $1. 1 million in his various campaign accounts. The next statements are due at the end of January.LiNeBrEaKThe effort to recall Denham, which failed last spring, could work in his favor because it gave him statewide media attention that he otherwise would not have gotten.LiNeBrEaKJust how far off is this election? Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, who was among the first out of the gate to run for governor in 2010, has a counter on his Web site indicating that it is 541 days until the June 2010 primary. So don't feel obliged to pay much attention just yet. By the way, Tom and Bill Berryhill show up on Poizner's endorsement list.LiNeBrEaKRep. Jerry McNerney has gotten a seat on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, considered one of the most powerful bodies in Congress, with jurisdiction over energy, the environment, consumer protection, telecommunications and health care programs. Rep. Henry Waxman took over as committee chairman from John Dingell and is expected to be aggressive on issues such as global warming.LiNeBrEaKEvery year or two, The Bee works with the Modesto Chamber of Commerce and Democratic and Republican leaders to offer a free workshop for people interested in running for office. The idea is to help people understand what is involved so they can be better candidates. The next workshop is tentatively set for the evening of Feb. 26. Details and registration information is forthcoming.LiNeBrEaKSly is the editor of the opinions pages. Contact her at jsly@modbee.com or 578-2317.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   01 EDITION	One state's gain, another's loss in flood program  	BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer  	B; Pg. 07  	519 words  	One state's gain, another's loss in flood programLiNeBrEaKBy BEN EVANSLiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - Gulf Coast states have collected billions of dollars more in federal flood insurance claims than they have paid into the system over the past 30 years, while states like Florida and California have paid far more than they have received. LiNeBrEaKThe disparity, according to a government audit, shows that the deficit-ridden program needs updating to better reflect risks in different parts of the country.LiNeBrEaKResidents and businesses in Louisiana got the most out of the program, taking in nearly $12 billion more in claims than they paid in premiums, according to the Government Accountability Office audit. The massive imbalance was linked to the 2005 hurricanes Katrina and Rita; Louisiana, however, had paid more into the system than it collected before those storms hit.LiNeBrEaKBut other Gulf States - Alabama, Mississippi and Texas - had large net gains even before 2005. By 2007, Mississippi had a $2. 5 billion advantage, Alabama's was $746 million and Texas' was $222 million. Other states with consistent surpluses include Missouri and West Virginia, which have seen heavy river flooding in recent years.LiNeBrEaKOn the other extreme, Florida paid almost $10 billion more in premiums than it collected, California paidLiNeBrEaK$2. 4 billion more, and New Jersey paid $1. 3 billion more.LiNeBrEaKGeorge Riedel, deputy director for the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said he wasn't surprised at the findings because the program only loosely uses sound actuarial rates.LiNeBrEaKBecause major changes in federal flood insurance must ultimately be approved by Congress, he said a reluctance in Washington to increase premiums for the program's 5. 5 million customers is part of the problem.LiNeBrEaK"Nobody likes to see increases, but if people are going to choose to live along areas that are at risk they need to share some of the cost that goes along with that," Riedel said. "Hopefully we will get a reform act at some point soon."LiNeBrEaKCongress has been working on legislation for several years but has not been able to agree on a final bill. The program, meanwhile, is saddled with almost $18 billion in debt - mostly from Hurricane Katrina - with interest payments to the U.S. Treasury eating up a large chunk of its budget.LiNeBrEaKThe audit reiterated earlier recommendations that the Federal Emergency Management Agency update the flood maps and other data it uses to assess risk and adjust premiums accordingly. The report noted that the agency sets rates based on national averages, for example, and has not begun analyzing the effects expected from climate change as private insurers have.LiNeBrEaKFEMA agreed with the major points of the audit but criticized parts of it. The agency said the audit painted an overly negative picture of the program and did not adequately account for progress the agency has made or for the complexities of setting rates.LiNeBrEaKThe National Flood Insurance Program was created in 1968 to help homeowners and businesses in flood-prone regions get affordable insurance not usually available on the private market and to reduce federal costs in natural disasters.

The New York Times 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Climate-Change Defense, The  	By JONATHAN MINGLE  	Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; 8TH ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Pg. 50  	349 words  	Few would fault someone who kicks down the front door of a neighbor's empty house to put out a fire. Neither would the law, generally: in Britain, the common-sense defense of ''lawful excuse'' (a variant is known as the ''necessity defense'' in the United States) usually succeeds in precisely this kind of situation. Which leads you to wonder: What acts might the law permit in the name of fighting a threat of global, even catastrophic, proportions?  LiNeBrEaK  In September, a British jury shook up the world of green politics when it accepted a lawful-excuse defense for property damaged with the intention of averting even greater damage from climate change. In an effort to draw public attention to government support for new coal-fired electricity projects, six Greenpeace activists painted Prime Minister Gordon Brown's last name on a smokestack at the Kingsnorth power plant in Kent. The plant's owner, the energy company E.ON, claimed that the paint cost more than $50,000 to remove. LiNeBrEaK  With supporting testimony from the NASA climate-change expert James Hansen and a representative of the Inuit community of Greenland (who described watching villages ''eroding into the sea''), the protesters convinced the jury that the threat posed by Kingsnorth carbon was not only real but also immediate enough to justify their high-profile graffiti. What's more, they claimed, by halting the plant's carbon-dioxide emissions for a day, they averted more than $1. 5 million worth of damage to human health and wealth around the globe. LiNeBrEaK  The decision has elicited strong reactions, including concern that it will be used to excuse a wide range of normally criminal acts. Some legal analysts doubt that other courts will follow suit. Though he hasn't publicly commented on the verdict, former Vice President Al Gore, for one, seems intent on ensuring that its reasoning is tested again soon. In a recent public forum at the Clinton Global Initiative, he called on young people to engage in ''civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration.''

The New York Times 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	The Green Power Broker  	By MARGUERITE HOLLOWAY. 	Section CY; Column 0; The City Weekly Desk; Pg. 1  	2525 words  	Marguerite Holloway, director of the science program at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, is working on a book about nature and cities to be published by W. W. Norton.LiNeBrEaKMAJORA CARTER, one of the city's best-known advocates for environmental justice, was sitting on a picnic table in Barretto Point Park in the South Bronx under the intense lights of an NBC film crew. LiNeBrEaK  On this late September afternoon, after a month of traveling, delivering speeches, serving as host of a Sundance Channel program and a Science Channel pilot, Ms. Carter was noticeably flagging. Yet her signature feistiness was much in evidence when the producer of the documentary for which Ms. Carter was being interviewed asked her to explain why global warming affects not just polar bears but people around the globe.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter responded by describing air pollution in troubled urban areas like Hunts Point, the South Bronx neighborhood where she was raised and currently works.LiNeBrEaK  The producer rephrased her question, in response to which Ms. Carter snapped, ''I don't do that.''  LiNeBrEaK  If the producer had a specific response in mind, Ms. Carter added with an edge to her usually warm voice, she should feed her a line, which the producer did not. Then she elaborated on her argument, which is that if richer communities suffered from air pollution as much as poorer neighborhoods do, affluent citizens would long ago have fought for alternatives to fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK  Two months earlier, Ms. Carter had visited the land of those iconic polar bears, touring the Arctic with former President Jimmy Carter, Senator Tom Daschle and leaders of various political, corporate, scientific and nongovernmental organizations.LiNeBrEaK  ''It was the trip of a lifetime,'' Ms. Carter said in one of several conversations about her work. ''Look, there are just a handful of people who get to do that, and I am incredibly grateful to be one of the few. But at the same time, I didn't need to go to the Arctic Circle to see the impacts of global warming. I am living it.'' LiNeBrEaK  In just over a decade, Ms. Carter, 42, has vaulted from working as a volunteer for what was a nascent organization called the Point Community Development Corporation and knowing almost nothing about environmental issues to becoming a nationally known advocate for environmental justice.LiNeBrEaK  Her reputation was burnished in 2005 when she won a MacArthur Foundation award for her work at the Point and at Sustainable South Bronx, a nonprofit organization she founded after leaving the Point in 2001. LiNeBrEaK  Now, after seven years at Sustainable South Bronx, Ms. Carter is starting something new. Over the summer, she formed a for-profit consulting company, the Majora Carter Group. Along with her husband, James Chase, who serves as the group's vice president for marketing and communications, Ms. Carter hopes that community groups, institutions and corporations will hire her to help them solve environmental problems and create green jobs -- employment that betters the environment, such as producing clean energy -- so she can put to national and perhaps international use the experience she gained in Hunts Point. LiNeBrEaK  By singling out individuals, the $500,000 MacArthur awards can sometimes engender resentment. Perhaps partly for this reason, Ms. Carter is a controversial figure in certain activist circles. A few of some three dozen people contacted for this article refused to talk about her or to describe their criticisms on the record. But many who have worked with her said her celebrity is deserved. LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter's fame is also proving somewhat double-edged for her start-up. She is in high demand for speeches all over the country, yet in the eyes of many she remains synonymous with Sustainable South Bronx, and it is taking time to establish a separate identity. LiNeBrEaK  ''Now I go and I talk about what I think I can bring to the rest of the world with this consulting firm,'' Ms. Carter said one afternoon in her new offices at 901 Hunts Point Avenue. ''And it is hard, because I am still so much seen as this ground-breaking visionary who ran community groups. And I am like, that is nice and all, but I am a groundbreaking visionary who has a consultancy. LiNeBrEaK  ''It is fun,'' she added. ''I am not complaining. I am just so tired I can't keep my eyes open.''LiNeBrEaK  On the HustingsLiNeBrEaK  Several weeks before the NBC interview, Ms. Carter could be found leaning against a wall outside a conference room in the United Federation of Teachers building in Lower Manhattan, tugging off her brown suede heels and pulling on green Wellingtons -- the very ones, she later confided, that President Carter had scuffed in the Arctic. ''I'll never wash them,'' she said with a laugh.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter had just spoken about green jobs at a conference sponsored by the Center for Working Families, a New York State group formed in 2006, and her speech was emotional, as her speeches usually are. She invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and choked up when she described jobless men and women who have become environmental heroes by finding and holding green jobs in their community. LiNeBrEaK  The talk seemed ill suited to the setting: Most of the people in the audience were activists, politicians and union and other organizers, many of whom regularly fight for social justice and know inside out the issues and struggles that Ms. Carter seemed to be urging them to embrace. LiNeBrEaK  Yet for some, the speech resonated deeply. LiNeBrEaK  ''You are such an inspirational person,'' one woman gushed as Ms. Carter suited up for the rain. ''I teared up the whole time.'' LiNeBrEaK  ''Thank you so much,'' Ms. Carter responded, smiling with the warmth, earthiness and energy that strike many who meet her, qualities that have helped make her such a powerful leader. LiNeBrEaK  Within a few minutes, Ms. Carter was dashing through a downpour to the PATH station in her waterproof black anorak, its hood snug around her dark hair, to address a symposium on green jobs in Newark. Under the netting cloaking the partially restored rotunda in City Hall, Ms. Carter gave the identical speech and choked up at the same point. LiNeBrEaK  ''I am proud to have started one of the first green-collar job training programs,'' Ms. Carter declared in rousing fashion. Many in the audience nodded throughout the speech, then applauded wildly.LiNeBrEaK  ''She is so inspiring,'' one woman said with a sigh to her son as they headed out into the wet Newark night.LiNeBrEaK  Although just back from Stockholm and jet-lagged, Ms. Carter spent the next 10 days crisscrossing the United States, giving speeches in Washington, Indiana, Tennessee and North Carolina. The Majora Carter Group earned about $60,000 that week, said Ms. Carter, who charges $25,000 for some appearances, but the organization has a way to go before it can hire more people. Currently the paid staff consists only of Ms. Carter, her husband and Isabella Moreno, who is vice president for operations and client relations.LiNeBrEaK  But the team was thrilled about the week's big development. In North Carolina, Ms. Carter had impressed Willie Gilchrist, chancellor of Elizabeth City State University, who plans to hire Ms. Carter to develop a regional plan to create green jobs. The university would be the group's first client. LiNeBrEaK  The new consultancy ''really plays to Majora's strengths,'' said Hugh Hogan, director of the North Star Fund, a New York nonprofit group that supports grass-roots efforts around the city.LiNeBrEaK  ''She knows how the system works,'' added Mr. Hogan, who worked with Ms. Carter at Sustainable South Bronx and at the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. And, he added with a laugh, ''That woman has no fear.'' LiNeBrEaK  Anexample of this quality is still broadly disseminated on the Web: video of a Technology, Entertainment, Design conference shows Ms. Carter chiding Al Gore, who is sitting in the front row, for brushing off her offer of collaboration and instead directing her to apply for a grant. LiNeBrEaK  A Girl From Hunts PointLiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter, the youngest of 10 children, was born in Hunts Point, a community, largely populated by blacks and Latinos, that is part of the infamous South Bronx. For decades it was plagued by poverty and violence, and many working-class families moved away during the 1960s and '70s. LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter's family stayed. Her father worked as a janitor at the Spofford juvenile detention center; her mother raised her many children and then worked at a residence for mentally impaired adults. Although Ms. Carter says neither of her parents was particularly active politically, the neighborhood in which she came of age was steeped in activism.LiNeBrEaK  Seemingly every few blocks, there is evidence of projects that community groups have successfully fought for, including, in the last two years, 2,500 units of affordable housing and plans for an additional high school, according to Roberto S. Garcia, chairman of Community Board 2. The Bronx River Greenway, a plan to establish 10 miles of paths and parks along the waterway, came about because some 60 public and private groups formed the Bronx River Alliance, said Linda Cox, the alliance's executive director.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter, who studied acting and received a degree in film from Wesleyan in 1988, did not become involved in her neighborhood until she returned to live with her parents after graduating from New York University in 1997 with a master's degree in fine arts.LiNeBrEaK  ''It was because I was broke,'' she said of her return home. ''It was just a place for me when I needed a place to stay.'' LiNeBrEaK  In 1997, she started working as a volunteer for the Point, which had been formed in 1994 to help revitalize the area's cultural and economic life. Just as Ms. Carter started at the Point, the Giuliani administration announced plans to build a waste transfer station in Hunts Point, an area already riddled with waste transfer stations, a battalion of garbage trucks and the asthma-inducing exhaust they produce.LiNeBrEaK  Maria Torres, president and co-founder of the Point, recalled that in the late 1990s an awareness of the local impact of environmental problems was relatively new to the organization, but that Ms. Carter, who had started out doing art and film projects for the group, readily took on these problems. LiNeBrEaK  ''She went out and did her research,'' Ms. Torres said. ''And she became very knowledgeable about things.'' LiNeBrEaK  First at the Point, then at Sustainable South Bronx, working with politicians and with South Bronx groups like Mothers on the Move and Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice, Ms. Carter successfully fought against the transfer station and lobbied for the creation of the Bronx River Alliance and new public green spaces in Hunts Point. LiNeBrEaK  In 2003, along with Mr. Hogan and Annette Williams, Ms. Carter started a green jobs training program at Sustainable South Bronx. As of this winter, said Ms. Williams, who directs the program -- now called BEST, for Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training -- 112 people will have learned about invasive species, tree husbandry and other subjects related to restoration and ecology. Of these 112 graduates, Ms. Williams said, 95 have jobs and 8 have returned to school.LiNeBrEaK  ''It was the only program I ever heard of in my community doing what they were doing at the time,'' said Penny Matta, who works for the Bronx River Alliance and the city's parks department.LiNeBrEaK  As a child growing up in Hunts Point, said Ms. Matta, 37, she was never aware of the nearby river. LiNeBrEaK  ''You couldn't see the water from the road and, in that neighborhood, you didn't go down there by yourself,'' Ms. Matta recalled. ''Now I bring my kids to remove invasives on the weekends. All three of my daughters have done water-quality testing with me.''LiNeBrEaK  A Sharp TrajectoryLiNeBrEaK  Ms. Carter's recognition of the link between environmental improvement and economic revitalization set the stage for her national prominence. Green jobs are a major campaign in the environmental justice movement. At a meeting last year of  the Clinton Global Initiative, for example, Ms. Carter and Van Jones of Oakland, Calif., started a job-generating group called Green for All. LiNeBrEaK  ''It was at the time I began to want to move to a national level and so did she,'' said Mr. Jones, author of ''The Green Collar Economy: How One Solution Can Fix Our Two Biggest Problems,'' who got his start as a community activist in 1996 when he created the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. ''At this point Majora is going to be focusing exclusively on her consultancy, but we are still going to be partners. She took her clout and helped get us up and running.'' LiNeBrEaK  To his mind, he added, ''she is the Rosa Parks of the green jobs movement.''LiNeBrEaK  For many who know her, Ms. Carter's trajectory was inevitable. LiNeBrEaK  ''I always thought she had the capacity to be a real star, and the South Bronx -- and the Bronx as a whole -- needs a star, someone who makes it a little bigger,'' said Dart Westphal, president of the Mosholu Preservation Corporation, a neighborhood improvement organization active in the north Bronx. ''She is really smart and really beautiful, and she just has a certain star quality.''LiNeBrEaK  Others say that Ms. Carter has achieved some of her fame by taking or getting credit for accomplishments or funding that haven't been only hers to claim, or for projects that have not yet been completed, such as the Bronx River Greenway. LiNeBrEaK  But in the opinion of people like Mr. Westphal, the resentment some feel toward Ms. Carter grows out of the hero narrative that Americans -- and the nation's media -- often gravitate toward. LiNeBrEaK  ''Majora is like Paul Bunyan; the stories have become legendary in some cases,'' he said. ''It is not that Majora has done anything wrong; it is that some other people working aren't getting so much attention.'' LiNeBrEaK  Omar Freilla, coordinator of the Green Worker Cooperatives in Hunts Point, agrees. LiNeBrEaK  ''There is always the tendency to spin what is a group effort into an individual effort,'' Mr. Freilla said. ''The backlash is that people who are part of the community start to resent the attention.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Torres of the Point acknowledges that roles do sometimes get muddied in press reports, but says that ultimately Ms. Carter is responsible for setting the record straight.LiNeBrEaK  Sitting in the conference room in her new offices one day not long ago, Ms. Carter discussed the resentment some in her community feel about her celebrity. At first, she became uncharacteristically silent, and neighborhood sounds dominated: cars and trucks, screeching brakes, sirens. LiNeBrEaK  The suite of offices occupies the second floor of a two-story building, above an auto-glass repair shop and just a block from the Bruckner and Sheridan Expressways overpass. Rainbow curtains billowed out above the gray street, making each window a different bright color. LiNeBrEaK  But Ms. Carter has not gotten where she is by sitting quietly.LiNeBrEaK  ''There is a light that comes to this community because of what I have done,'' she said, her usual moxie restored. ''I am in a completely different milieu right now, and if I didn't take advantage of that, then I would be a fool. If I wasn't flipping out about being away so much, I would be at the Clinton Global Initiative right now. Because I could do that. Because I know there are people there who would like to talk to me. LiNeBrEaK  ''That is what I do,'' Ms. Carter said. ''Am I supposed to feel guilty because I have those advantages?''LiNeBrEaK(PHOTOGRAPH BY ANGEL FRANCO/THE NEW YORK TIMESLiNeBrEaKBELOW LEFT, JAMES CHASE)LiNeBrEaKMs. Carter, at right, conducting an interview for the pilot of a cable TV series.LiNeBrEaK(PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHELLE V.

The New York Times 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Eat Kangaroos To Fight Global Warming  	By CHARLES WILSON  	Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; 8TH ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Pg. 55  	300 words  	 Of all the ideas developed to combat the climate crisis, George Wilson of Australian Wildlife Services may have the least intuitive: eating more kangaroos. In a paper published in June by the U.S.-based Society for Conservation Biology, however, he explains that 11 percent of Australia's total greenhouse-gas emissions come from the methane produced by the rumen of cattle and sheep. ''It's been long known that kangaroos don't produce methane,'' Wilson says, noting that kangaroos' stomachs have different microorganisms to ferment their food. ''I began to speculate, What if we managed the kangaroo population up and the cattle population down?''  LiNeBrEaK  Kangaroo is a specialty meat, gamy in taste, that is already available in some restaurants and many grocery stores in Australia. Wilson calculated that if by 2020 the kangaroo population was managed upward from its current 35 million to 175 million -- and if Australia could remove 36 million sheep and 7 million cattle from production -- the country would see a reduction of 16 megatons of greenhouse-gas emissions, 3 percent of its national total. LiNeBrEaK  Reaction in Australia and abroad to Wilson's suggestion has not been altogether positive. ''Skippy on the Menu'' read one headline. Wilson initially tried for months to get financial support for his study, without success. He says he wanted his work to provoke discussion; he points out that 200 years ago, before the arrival of cattle in Australia, the indigenous population there survived for more than 40,000 years on kangaroo and other wildlfe. His paper suggests (menacingly) that Australia could reverse-engineer that process and send kangaroos to America to help with its greenhouse-gas problem. ''All I'm saying is we have some production animals here that aren't bad either,'' he says.

The New York Times 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Carbon Penance  	By JASCHA HOFFMAN  	Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; 8TH ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Pg. 48  	251 words  	We all contribute to climate change, but none of us can individually be blamed for it. So we walk around with a free-floating sense of guilt that's unlikely to be lifted by the purchase of wind-power credits or halogen bulbs. Annina Rust, a Swiss-born artist-inventor, wanted to help relieve these anxietes by giving people a tangible reminder of their own energy use, as well as an outlet for the feelings of complicity, shame and powerlessness that surround the question of global warming. LiNeBrEaK  So she built a translucent leg band that keeps track of your electricity consumption. When it detects, via a special power monitor, that electric current levels have exceeded a certain threshold, the wireless device slowly drives six stainless-steel thorns into the flesh of your leg. ''It's therapy for environmental guilt,'' says Rust, who modeled her ''personal techno-garter'' on the spiked bands worn as a means of self-mortification by a monk in Dan Brown's novel ''The Da Vinci Code.'' (Brown derived the idea from the bands worn by some celibate members of the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei.)LiNeBrEaK  Rust built her prototype while working at the Computing Culture group of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She also designed the band to punish wearers if they don't spend enough time talking to their carbon-fixing houseplants. But first Rust may have to address a more mundane matter. When the spikes dug in, Rust says, she noticed that the device ''doesn't hurt that much.''

The New York Times 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	THE 8th ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Brickley Engine, The  	By CLIVE THOMPSON  	Section MM; Column 0; Magazine Desk; 8TH ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Pg. 44  	364 words  	The auto industry worldwide is scrambling for ways to make cars consume less gas, but mostly it pursues the same few concepts -- like making cars lighter and smaller, using alternative fuels or creating hybrid designs that use electricity. Mike Brickley has another idea: why not rethink the internal-combustion engine itself? LiNeBrEaK  Five years ago, Brickley, a self-taught ''engine inventor'' in Austin, Tex., decided to give it a try. He realized that one of the biggest drags on engine efficiency is friction: whenever two parts interact with each other, they generate heat and drain energy out of the system. So he began designing a new type of engine that reduced friction by doing away with several traditional parts. In the Brickley Engine -- as he calls it -- there are no piston skirts and several fewer crankshaft and crankpin bearings. What's more, the cylinders are connected through a pinned joint that rotates a comparatively small amount. The resulting device has a curious, flattened appearance: two sets of pistons face away from each other and punch in opposite directions, joining in the center to drive the engine's shaft. LiNeBrEaK  This configuration produces 35 percent less friction than a regular engine. Brickley projects that this would give the engine up to 20 percent better mileage than a regular car. If you were to burn diesel fuel in the Brickley Engine, it would use almost 50 percent less fuel than a normal gas-powered engine, with greatly reduced emissions. ''It'll work in anything that burns fuel -- trains, tractors, automobiles, you name it,'' he says. A nation of Brickley-equipped vehicles could satisfy the Kyoto Protocol's demands for greenhouse-gas reduction several years in advance. Brickley received a patent for the engine last year and this year began working on a prototype to place in a compact car -- to prove that his design performs as well as his calculations predict.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	655 words  	Dec. 14--Grace and delicacy don't jump to mind if you try to describe a snowplow -- or its driver. But those attributes might be all that allow Tracy Nelson to drive a 28,000 -pound truck with a 9-foot-wide snow blade down narrow alleys and SUV-lined streets. It's that time of year when Nelson might get called on to drive a plow for the city of Greensboro.LiNeBrEaKPublic safety reporter Sonja Elmquist recently took Nelson, a four-year veteran of the city's Field Operations Department , away from a holiday potluck to talk about the curiosities of keeping the roads clear during winter weather. LiNeBrEaKQ. How do you pass the time waiting for the snow to start?LiNeBrEaKA. In a snow event, there's no time to kill. But we'll be on standby in the yard if nothing is started. I read books. Some listen to the radio. You have to be in the truck.LiNeBrEaKQ. How does your truck handle?LiNeBrEaKA. Mine's pretty good. It's not a new truck, but it steers a tighter turn than some of them, which is good on some of the roads. With the truck unloaded with no equipment, it's 28,000 pounds. If it gets going, it's going where it wants to go. You don't go out there and see if you can go sliding around. We drive in third gear at 25 miles per hour.LiNeBrEaKQ. What's the trickiest maneuvering you have to do?LiNeBrEaKA. The biggest problem we run into is on residential streets with parking on both sides -- a 30-foot-wide street with an SUV parked on both sides. That only leaves 10 feet in the middle, and we have a 9-foot blade. You just deal with it.LiNeBrEaKQ. Have you ever gotten stuck?LiNeBrEaKA. Not yet. I like it (snow). It doesn't bother me. I have a work truck and when it's icy I have a blue, 45-gallon drum that I fill up with water and I put that right up against the tailgate. I haven't had problems yet.LiNeBrEaKQ. You are out in the weather that the rest of us are told to stay home through. What kind of driving do you see out of other drivers when you're out?LiNeBrEaKA. During "A" shift (from midnight to noon ) we don't have the bulk of the traffic. I see about three dozen cars at night. I see fast driving. I've seen them do 360s in front of me. They'll pull out to pass me, then when they get in front of me, they spin out. Most everybody drives pretty good.LiNeBrEaKQ. Does global warming worry you? Do you think there will come a day when it won't get cold enough to snow here and you'll be out of a job?LiNeBrEaKA. I do asphalt and paving. I'm a heavy equipment operator. Repairs are constant.LiNeBrEaKQ. Do people ever stop you and beg you to plow their street first?LiNeBrEaKA. Not me. Some have asked me not to plow their street. Some throw snowballs at the truck. I think they mean it playfully.LiNeBrEaKQ. What's the worst weather you've ever seen?LiNeBrEaKA. We really haven't had a bad winter. Last season, there was a light dusting. Eight or 10 years ago it snowed 4 to 6 inches every Wednesday or Thursday for four or five weeks. The guys here worked 17 days straight, 12 hours a day.LiNeBrEaKQ. What's the biggest thing you've ever driven?LiNeBrEaKA. I've operated a motor grader. It's the length of a semi, and it has a blade underneath and teeth out front. It's mainly used for grading dirt roads. It's used sometimes in the city during snow events, but then I'm in the truck.LiNeBrEaKQ. If a snowplow hits a manhole, who wins?LiNeBrEaKA. Snow blades are equipped with a spring so if we hit something hard enough it folds down to avoid damage. If you hit a manhole cover sticking up, you just go back and pick it up and put it back. Some of the guys have hit mailboxes. Those are replaced within 24 hours.LiNeBrEaKQ. Have you ever hit a mailbox?LiNeBrEaKA. No, thank goodness. Not yet.

The News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Obama's 'green dream team' puts science out front  	The News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash.  	COMMENTARY  	573 words  	Dec. 14--A president's cabinet picks say a lot about his priorities. Barack Obama's latest choices say he is determined to combat global warming and to put smart people in charge of the fight.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect has tapped a "green dream team" that includes a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and a chemical engineer whose career has been distinguished by efforts to curb greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKTogether, Steven Chu, Obama's choice for secretary of energy, and Lisa P. Jackson, his nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, are a one-two punch.LiNeBrEaKChu has the passion and know-how to bring new energy technology to market, while Jackson -- formerly New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection -- is likely to seek deep reductions in carbon-based emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe United States will have to do some measure of both if it is to make real progress toward mitigating the threat of climate change and reducing its dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKChu left Stanford University four years ago to head the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he has focused on alternative and renewable energy research.LiNeBrEaKSome observers say his views on climate change may be the most forceful ever held by a cabinet member. He favors putting a price on greenhouse emissions and calls talk about climate change being caused by something other than humans "reminiscent of the dialogue in the 1950s and '60s on tobacco."LiNeBrEaKObama himself declared last week, "The time for denial is over." With Chu's selection to head the Department of Energy, the president-elect adds an exclamation point.LiNeBrEaKChu's advocacy will run up against its practical limits in Congress, especially given his Washington outsider status.LiNeBrEaKBut his technical expertise at least promises that his policies will be grounded in the art of the possible. Indeed, he is well respected in the scientific community for his judgment on public policy issues.LiNeBrEaKLikewise for Jackson, who is described as pragmatic but who also pushed New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine to adopt greener policies. Jackson helped usher in New Jersey's plan to reduce carbon emissions 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKBoth Chu and Jackson, whose nominations are expected to be announced next week, would take the helm of agencies with big challenges.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Department does fund some research for innovative energy technologies, but it is largely focused on cleaning up and managing the legacy of past energy and national defense operations.LiNeBrEaKAt EPA, Jackson would take over an agency that has been blatantly politicized and suberverted by the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKSome are worried that Obama's top energy and environmental advisors, which include a new energy czar, signal a shift to the left after moderate choices on early cabinet choices. Perhaps -- but reducing dependence on fossil fuels and addressing global warming should not be a matter of right or left.LiNeBrEaKWhat those nominations also suggest is a return to letting science shape politics.LiNeBrEaKThe nation has had enough of the opposite the last eight years.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  		LETTERS; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. F02  	428 words  	Another bailout Here we go with another bailout. This time the automakers need our money. I'd like something in return but like every other handout, I won't hold my breath waiting. Why don't our lawmakers come up with concrete ideas? Giving the Big Three automakers a break from corporate taxes would be a start. LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. inflicts the second-highest corporate tax upon business. We're told that it is corporate greed when companies then move offshore. That's nonsense. Congress could give those corporations a break from taxes and also loosen regulation. It wouldn't cost taxpayers a cent.LiNeBrEaKWe're scared with words like "depression." During the depression unemployment peaked over 20 percent. We are no where near to that. Like global warming, the news media, our new president's handlers, are creating another phony crisis to fleece us.LiNeBrEaKThis country pays people not to work. Next time our new president says that we have to dig further into our pockets to help the "poor" and these corporations, remember that. Let's tell our representatives "no" to any more bailouts, "yes" to rewarding people that produce.LiNeBrEaKJAMES PARSONS CarlisleLiNeBrEaK'No' to bailoutLiNeBrEaKI disagree with using American tax dollars to bail out poorly run companies. I make far less than a unionized auto worker. Yet I and others are expected to pay for this person's salary, health care and pension.LiNeBrEaKAuto workers are some of the most overpaid blue collar workers. The Big Three keep saying that if they file for bankruptcy, people won't buy their cars. People fly airlines that have filed for bankruptcy and I've known people who have filed. They adjusted the way they managed their finances and moved on.LiNeBrEaKThe American auto companies are producing a product that is average at best, while tacking on outlandish labor costs to the sticker price.LiNeBrEaKI realize that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are deeply indebted to the unions of America, but they shouldn't be forcing the rest of us to throw our tax dollars down a hole. If my elected leaders in the Keystone vote for this handout, I will not be voting for them in the future.LiNeBrEaKKEN WHEELER Lower Paxton Twp.LiNeBrEaKOutsource the bailoutLiNeBrEaKThe last two General Motors cars we bought were made in Canada. A few years ago on vacation to Mexico we saw a Ford Motor Co. plant there.LiNeBrEaKAlso, in the information packet that came with our GM cars it stated there were various components in the car that were manufactured in foreign countries.LiNeBrEaKSo, my question is, will Canada, Mexico and other countries help pay for the auto bailout?LiNeBrEaKDONALD UNDERKOFFLER Halifax	LETTERS and COMMENTS (92%); BAILOUTS (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); AUTOMOTIVE WORKERS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (77%); LEGISLATORS (77%); BUSINESS INSOLVENCY and BANKRUPTCY (76%); POLITICAL PARTIES (75%); WAGES and SALARIES (74%); LABOR UNIONS (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (54%); INSOLVENCY and BANKRUPTCY (78%); OUTSOURCING (75%)  	FORD MOTOR CO (84%); GENERAL MOTORS CORP (58%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (58%)  		FORDP (PAR) (84%); FDM (LSE) (84%); F (NYSE) (84%); GMP (PAR) (58%); GMB (BRU) (58%); GM (NYSE) (58%); F (SWX) (84%)  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (84%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (84%); SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES and PASSENGER CAR BODIES (84%)  	PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%); MEXICO (92%); CANADA (91%); NORTH AMERICA (79%)  	December 14, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Patriot News Co.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	TIMBER INDUSTRY MORE A NECESSITY, LESS A THREAT  	Kirk Johnson, The New York Times  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-8  	1003 words  	SEELEY LAKE, Mont. -- A scramble is under way here in Montana to save the historically important, culturally resonant timber industry -- once a pillar of the state's identity, now under siege as demand for housing and wood products has plummeted in the national economic downturn.LiNeBrEaKBut what makes this debate different from those about saving automobile makers and banks and whoever else is in line for a bailout are the multiple layers of connection to things that might seem to have nothing to do with two-by-fours, plywood or even jobs. LiNeBrEaKClimate change, for example -- how to manage state and federal forest lands as new diseases and insects threaten them in a warmer future -- and the soaring costs of fighting wildfires in the West have both become part of the discussion. If the state loses its base of roughly 200 interconnected sawmills, pulp buyers and family-owned tree-cutting contractors, advocates say, who will be left to work in the woods to make them usable, beautiful and safe, and at what cost?LiNeBrEaK"Our fear is that we could lose our infrastructure -- the base of knowledge and experience of working in the forest," said Mary Sexton, the director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. "Once it's gone, it's gone."LiNeBrEaKMs. Sexton is part of a team of state officials, business leaders and environmentalists combing through lists of ideas to reduce costs to sawmills or help them find new sources of revenue to raise their chances of getting by and getting through. Elected officials in Washington are concentrating on speaking up for timber in the next stimulus package that the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama is putting together.LiNeBrEaKFor logging and sawmill operators, the coalition has inspired hope. The difference is stark, they say, between the environment they face today, however bleak, and the erosion of their industry in recent years. In the early 1980s, by contrast, when a bad recession wiped out much of the industry, the timber wars were still aflame, and many environmentalists were more likely to dance on a lumber company's grave than work to save it. Almost 20 percent of the state's lumber-mill jobs have disappeared since 2005, according to state figures.LiNeBrEaK"The difference today is that we have built a lot of long-term relationships, partners in the conservation community who make things happen on the ground," said Gordy Sanders, resource manager at Pyramid Mountain Lumber, a family-owned sawmill in this small town northeast of Missoula. "In the early '80s that wasn't there."LiNeBrEaKGroups like the Wilderness Society, which is working on contracts to expand lower-cost wood supplies to mills like Pyramid, say that working forests with controlled harvests of trees are healthier, safer and more likely to be preserved, and that small towns like Seeley Lake with an anchoring employer are less prone to real estate speculation and development.LiNeBrEaKBut the organization's regional director, Robert Ekey, conceded that such a strategy was easier now because the industry is only a shadow of its former might. Mr. Ekey said the lumber industry is no longer a threat to the landscape; it is a necessity. Montana is the nation's fourth-largest state, with about 26,000 square miles of national forest.LiNeBrEaK"Timber cutting is one-seventh what it was on Forest Service lands 20 or 25 years ago at its height," Mr. Ekey said. "Then, the environmental movement rightly had to be about, 'no,' and how to stop it." Now, he added: "We're at the level where we can really have a good rational discussion -- what does success look like? What does successful forest management look like?"LiNeBrEaKThe years of experience as the industry faded around much of the West -- mainly as a result of reduced timber sales in the national forests -- has also given people here in Montana a glimpse of what can happen when an industry does go away. In Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, for example, once-formidable forest industries have all but disappeared over the last decade, leading to higher costs for forest management and fire protection; a recent study at the University of Montana said that forest costs to taxpayers and landowners could quadruple in Montana in coming years if the industry is lost.LiNeBrEaKBut the economic downswing is revealing how interconnected everything is, and how the smallest and most innocuous of things can loom large in a crisis.LiNeBrEaKThink wood chips.LiNeBrEaKWood chips, the humble left over bark-and-end-piece crumbs of the logging business, have emerged this fall as an Achilles' heel in Montana.LiNeBrEaKThe chain of logic looks like this: Sawmills make beams and boards and logs for housing and are struggling with an inventory that mostly cannot be sold because of the record decline in housing starts. So they have been making ends meet by selling the pieces of bark and scrap to a mill near Missoula owned by Smurfit-Stone, which makes chips into packaging material -- a corner of the consumer economy that until this fall was not suffering.LiNeBrEaKBut in just the last two months, consumers have retrenched and are buying fewer items that come in boxes made by the Smurfit-Stone mill, which has suddenly needed to buy fewer truckloads of chips from the sawmills.LiNeBrEaKAt Pyramid Mountain, managers told the company's 135 employees (25 of whom were laid off in early November) that the operation would close Thanksgiving week because the pulp mill was not buying chips. A last-minute sale to another mill, at a sharply reduced price, kept Pyramid running for the week, said the company's president, Roger Johnson, whose father, Fred, helped found the mill in 1949.LiNeBrEaKSome people see a greater role in electricity production for mill operators, if federal incentives toward renewable energy make things like biomass or cogeneration -- using wood fiber to generate both electricity and heat -- more attractive or viable. Others see a reduced industry that finally gives up competing with more efficient mass market loggers in Canada and Asia and turns toward niche products with higher profit margins.

SPORTS  	633 words  	Dec. 14--STATE COLLEGE -- When doomsday arrives because of a nuclear holocaust or global warming, the last man standing will be a skinny-legged geezer with thick glasses, shirt and tie, rolled-up pants and white socks.LiNeBrEaKJoe Paterno is indestructible. LiNeBrEaKFor those who have scoffed at suggestions that he's Superman, Paterno truly is a man of steel now.LiNeBrEaKLess than three weeks after receiving a titanium hip, Penn State's legendary football coach walked into an auditorium Friday without a cane, stood at a podium and answered questions for 30 minutes or so without getting off his feet. Then he walked out of the room.LiNeBrEaKContrast that scene with the one fi ve weeks earlier at Iowa, where a feeblelooking Paterno labored to get into and out of a chair for a postgame press conference because of throbbing pain from the arthritis in his right hip.LiNeBrEaK"It's tough when you're in pain all day," Paterno said, "and sometimes you get to the point where you wonder whether it's worth it. I feel great, I really do. There's no reason for me not to think that I can go for a while. How long is a while? I don't know."LiNeBrEaKPaterno's hip began bothering him when he tried to kick a ball at the end of a practice the week of Penn State's opener against Coastal Carolina. A few days later, he tried to run out of the Beaver Stadium tunnel and lead the Nittany Lions onto the field as he had done throughout his career, but he clearly was hobbling.LiNeBrEaKHe tried to coach from the sideline, but the pain was excruciating. He retreated to the press box for the second half of a couple games before spending all of Penn State's final seven games upstairs. He even gave in to using a cane.LiNeBrEaK"Most people would have literally been bedridden or chair-ridden," said team doctor Wayne Sebastianelli, who performed the surgery on Paterno. "He was really in a lot of pain. It's miserable being like that.LiNeBrEaK"The team means so much to him. The university means so much to him. If he wasn't there (at games), he thought he'd be letting the team down."LiNeBrEaKSo, Paterno agreed to undergo hip replacement surgery the day after Penn State's regular season finale against Michigan State. He was out of the hospital in two days and walking with a cane a few days later. His recovery is ahead of schedule, of course.LiNeBrEaKHe has about five one-hour sessions a week with a physical therapist at his home, Sebastianelli said. He spends about two hours a day doing exercises himself. He takes only an "occasional Tylenol" for pain.LiNeBrEaK"There has to be stiffness and pain just from the incision," Sebastianelli said. "Most people would be limited by that. This guy was at practice today (Saturday). He got out of the cart and walked onto the field for a 9-on-7 drill.LiNeBrEaK"The kids looked at him like, 'What the hell are you doing out here?' He wanted to get out there so he could feel and hear things by being close. He's such a competitor."LiNeBrEaKPenn State will travel to California next Sunday, Paterno's 82nd birthday, to prepare for the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl against Southern Cal. Will Paterno be walking the sideline for the first time since September?LiNeBrEaK"That's going to be a tough call," Sebastianelli said. "I don't think we'll have cold weather, but we could have wet weather. That wouldn't be good for him. I can't say for sure. If anybody is able to do it, it's him. I guarantee you most people would not even come close."LiNeBrEaKWe found out a long time ago that Joe Paterno is tougher than most people.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	Schools restart nuclear programs;  Tech, VCU, U.Va. respond to surge of interest in new reactors 		BUSINESS; Pg. D-1  	1011 words  	 Nuclear engineering studies is making a comeback in Virginia.LiNeBrEaK Some of the state's universities have added programs, are planning to do so or are considering it because of renewed interest in the nuclear industry with growing emphasis on finding alternative energy sources.LiNeBrEaK Last year, Virginia Commonwealth University began offering a nuclear engineering track to its master's degree program, and the school plans to offer an undergraduate program in 2009. LiNeBrEaK Virginia Tech - which once offered degrees in nuclear engineering and supported a research reactor - began offering classes for students to earn a nuclear engineering certificate. Tech is working to bring master's and doctoral degrees by fall next year.LiNeBrEaK  The University of Virginia, which a decade ago shut down its reactor after 38 years of research, is discussing adding a minor in nuclear studies to its engineering school.LiNeBrEaK "We are responding to the demands of the industry," said Rosalyn Hobson, VCU's associate dean for graduate studies.LiNeBrEaK Many universities in Virginia and elsewhere once offered undergraduate and graduate programs in nuclear engineering.LiNeBrEaK But schools stopped providing them as interest in the field waned after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. Virginia Tech and U.Va. were among the schools that eventually shut down their graduate programs and research reactors.LiNeBrEaK Universities offer 31 nuclear engineering programs in the U.S., but twice as many programs were offered before the Three Mile Island accident.LiNeBrEaK Now, rising gas prices, concern about fossil-fuel use and global warming has prompted renewed interest in the nuclear industry and in programs to train the next generation of workers.LiNeBrEaK In the United States, 20 percent of electricity comes from nuclear power. Virginia uses 40 percent, and that makes the state a logical choice for the nuclear industry to focus, said Mohamed Gad-el-Hak, chairman of the mechanical engineering program at VCU and a professor in biomedical engineering.LiNeBrEaK "Virginia is already a very important player in the nuclear power industry," he said.LiNeBrEaK Companies with nuclear power interests, including those operating in Virginia, are pushing for an educational revival as the need for engineers grows with more nuclear reactors being planned.LiNeBrEaK "For 30 years, there were no new nuclear reactors," Gad-el-Hak said. "Suddenly, that landscape is changing. The alternatives to fossil fuels are renewable energy. The technology for those exist, but it's too expensive. Nuclear can compete with fossil fuels."LiNeBrEaK As of September, applications had been filed for 32 new nuclear power plants in the United States, many in the Southeast.LiNeBrEaK Yet in the next five years, roughly 45 percent of all workers in the nuclear industry could either be eligible to retire or will have left the field, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. The starting salary can be in the mid-$60,000 range, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.LiNeBrEaK "In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a lot of hiring going on," said Kerry Basehore, director of nuclear analysis and fuel for Richmond-based Dominion Resources Inc.LiNeBrEaK Tech professor Gene Brown said the nuclear industry is the force behind the new and proposed degree programs.LiNeBrEaK The VCU program began at the prompting of Dominion, Gad-el-Hak said. Employees from the utility teach the nuclear courses.LiNeBrEaK Much of a nuclear degree consists of mechanical engineering courses. VCU professors are teaching those, while adjunct faculty from Dominion covers the nuclear courses.LiNeBrEaK Next fall, VCU hopes to add two nuclear professors to the faculty, Gad-el-Hak said. The master's program is part-time right now and has about 20 to 25 students, with the first class set to graduate in 2010.LiNeBrEaK Also in 2009, a bachelor's degree track will be offered, with hopes of eventually attracting 100 students.LiNeBrEaK Dominion and other companies in Virginia have a need.LiNeBrEaK The state's largest utility operates two reactors each at its North Anna plant in Louisa County and its Surry Power Station in Surry County. The company has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license that would give the utility the option of building and operating a third reactor at North Anna.LiNeBrEaK In October, Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipbuilding announced a $363. 4 million joint venture with the French firm Areva to build components for holding nuclear fuel in commercial power plants. No nuclear materials or fuel are to be produced at the facility, which will bring 540 jobs.LiNeBrEaK Mike Hobbs, Areva's manager of workforce planning and staffing, said the company has increased its recruiting efforts in the past eight years, realizing it needs to get engineers in the door who can then be mentored by the employees with nuclear knowledge who are nearing retirement.LiNeBrEaK Areva employs roughly 70,000 people worldwide - 2,000 in Virginia - and is trying to bring seven new power plants online in the U.S. between 2015 and 2030, Hobbs said.LiNeBrEaK Other companies with ties to Virginia also have fanned out across the country recruiting recent college graduates as well as students for internships.LiNeBrEaK Once hired, young engineers now have a greater opportunity to move up in their companies quicker than in past decades, said Dave Van Auker, manager of college recruiting for Babcock and Wilcox, a Lynchburg-based company that also builds heavy-pressure vessels to hold nuclear fuel.LiNeBrEaK The recruiting efforts are paying off nationally, according to a survey by the Nuclear Energy Institute, which showed a 34 percent increase in the number of engineers under 27 entering the utility work force between 2005 and 2007.LiNeBrEaK Nuclear power "is going to become a bigger piece of the energy equation in the next couple of years," said Gregory H. Wingfield, president of the Greater Richmond Partnership, a regional economic-development group. "Having VCU and other schools putting a pipeline together will give [Virginia] a competitive edge."LiNeBrEaK* Staff writer Emily C.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: Virginia fights climate change with trees  	Christian Trejbal, The Roanoke Times, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	772 words  	Dec. 14--Last week, I urged readers to use live holiday trees suitable for planting as an environmentally friendly alternative to chopping down conifers. Individual effort, even collectively, can only go so far.LiNeBrEaKTrees absorb carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their trunks, roots and leaves. Think of them as natural carbon sequestration. Instead of capturing the emissions at the source and trying to pump them deep underground, the trees take them off the breeze and grow.LiNeBrEaKAnd unlike promised technological solutions to global climate change, trees are ready for widespread deployment. LiNeBrEaKBlacksburg Town Manager Marc Verniel put it perfectly succinctly last week. "Trees are good," he said.LiNeBrEaKYet the commonwealth suffers a net loss of forested acres every year.LiNeBrEaKSome communities work against that trend.LiNeBrEaKBlacksburg, for example, runs its own nursery. They call it "Trees for the future."LiNeBrEaKThe town's goal is to plant two trees every time it must remove one. Replacements don't necessarily go where the old tree was, but in a logical location.LiNeBrEaK"We're trying to be smart about planting the right tree in the right spot, not just what looks pretty, and we have to cut it down when it hits the power lines," Dean Crane, town director of parks and recreation, explained. "Because of our park system and the way we use our land, you can't forest everything. You still need land for recreation and parking lots and so on."LiNeBrEaKUnlike localities that worship asphalt and concrete, Blacksburg knows that trees improve quality of life and have far-reaching benefits.LiNeBrEaKThe Virginia Department of Forestry knows it, too. It operates nurseries that provide seedlings for establishing timber stands, pulpwood crops, holiday tree plantations, urban forestry and other uses. It sold more than 33 million seedlings last year and helped reforest 81,000 acres.LiNeBrEaKTimber companies purchase many of those seedlings to replant land they have harvested. Many tree-huggers protest logging, but it's not all bad. If loggers responsibly replace the trees they remove and other variables align properly, their work can be a net gain for the climate.LiNeBrEaKIt works like this:LiNeBrEaKAs a tree grows up, it absorbs carbon. A logger chops it down and sends the wood to a mill. Eventually it winds up in the frame of a house or as furniture.LiNeBrEaKThe carbon in that wood no longer contributes to climate change. Meanwhile, new trees grow in the same place. They absorb more carbon until the next round of harvesting.LiNeBrEaKThe Forestry Department also runs the Reforestation of Timberlands Conservation Incentive Program. It offers landowners cash for planting trees. An acre of loblolly or Virginia pine is worth $25, for example. If it's on land protected by a conservation easement, that's worth $75.LiNeBrEaKAnd that is just for starters. A number of state and federal programs can make reforestation affordable.LiNeBrEaK"There really are a bunch of different ones out there," Dean Cumbia, director of forest research management with the department, said. "Depending on the circumstances of the land owner, what their objectives and circumstances are, there are many that would be helpful to them."LiNeBrEaKHistorically, settlers cleared a lot of land for agriculture. The state actively encourages protecting that land with conservation easements.LiNeBrEaKIt should put equal effort into encoraging reforestation. Idle acreage is a lost opportunity to reduce the state's carbon balance.LiNeBrEaK"By planting trees on open land that might be marginal pasture land that isn't currently being cropped or grazed, we can store more carbon more quickly than if we were to go through the stages of natural forest succession," Cumbia said.LiNeBrEaKTrees alone will not end climate change, but preventing global calamity will take effort on multiple fronts.LiNeBrEaKVirginia will never be as forested as it once was, but the commonwealth is well short of where it could be.LiNeBrEaKBesides, who doesn't like a tree? They are nice to look at. They offer shade. They are what the land wants in its natural state.LiNeBrEaKTrejbal is an editorial writer for The Roanoke Times based in the New River Valley bureau.LiNeBrEaKPlant a forestLiNeBrEaKLandowners interested in reforestation programs can call the Virginia Department of Forestry regional office in Salem at 540-387-5461 for more information.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia)  	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	EDITORIAL: Put mass transit into high gear: Even with falling gas prices, Americans are showing a new willingness to use public transportation.  	The Roanoke Times, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	522 words  	Dec. 14--More and more Americans are voting for mass transit with their seats.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Obama should have that in mind when he takes office, and goes to make good on his recent promise to create the biggest public works construction program since the interstate highway system in the 1950s. LiNeBrEaKHe and congressional leaders are working to come up with legislation he could sign soon after his January inauguration. Likely it would include billions of dollars for road and bridge projects, as it should. These critical pieces of transportation infrastructure have been too long ignored.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama made it clear he was thinking beyond traditional public works and even beyond the green of money for his economic stimulus package, with its goal to create or save 2. 5 million jobs by the end of 2012. He's thinking of a newly green economy built on alternative energy and energy efficiency, information technology upgrades and accessibility -- a New-Era Deal, it seems.LiNeBrEaKMass transit fits easily in both the transportation and the green economy camp. Yet as tax revenues slide, public transit agencies are looking at raising fares and cutting service -- and at a most inopportune time.LiNeBrEaKThe economic crisis may have created a historic opportunity to break Americans' near-total dependence on their cars. They have found mass transit and are ready to ride, not drive, even when gas is cheap.LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus should expand their opportunities.LiNeBrEaKMajor cities began to see record highs in subway and commuter rail ridership last year, when gasoline prices around the country started climbing and didn't stop until they topped $4 a gallon this July.LiNeBrEaKThe Roanoke Valley, where the city is small and mass transit is scaled to match, saw an uptick in metro bus ridership, car pooling, bicycling and commuting the Smart Way. From July through October, ridership on the bus between the Roanoke and New River valleys was up 45 percent over the same period a year ago.LiNeBrEaKNow gas prices have fallen dramatically and lots of commuters nationwide have lost their jobs. Still, a survey released last week by the American Public Transportation Association shows that in many parts of the country, mass transit ridership continues to climb.LiNeBrEaKRoanoke-based Ride Solutions reports the uptick in use of alternative transportation modes continues, virtually unaffected by falling pump prices.LiNeBrEaKEconomic insecurity has a lot to do with the trend: Gas isn't the only expense related to driving a car. There are insurance, maintenance and repair costs, too.LiNeBrEaKAnd mass transit's savings to consumers is not its only benefit. Lessening the country's dependence on foreign oil and its impact on global warming are factors, too.LiNeBrEaKTransportation planning is ripe for a major shift.

Idle acreage is a lost opportunity to reduce the state's carbon balance.LiNeBrEaK"By planting trees on open land that might be marginal pasture land that isn't currently being cropped or grazed, we can store more carbon more quickly than if we were to go through the stages of natural forest succession," Cumbia said.LiNeBrEaKTrees alone will not end climate change, but preventing global calamity will take effort on multiple fronts.LiNeBrEaKVirginia will never be as forested as it once was, but the commonwealth is well short of where it could be.LiNeBrEaKBesides, who doesn't like a tree? They are nice to look at. They offer shade. They are what the land wants in its natural state.LiNeBrEaKTrejbal is an editorial writer for The Roanoke Times based in the New River Valley bureau.Plant a forestLiNeBrEaKLandowners interested in reforestation programs can call the Virginia Department of Forestry regional office in Salem at 540-387-5461 for more information.LiNeBrEaKYour thoughtsLiNeBrEaKDoes Virginia do enough to encourage reforestation?

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   New River Edition	OFFICIALS EXPLAIN HOW ELECTRICAL POWER IS MADE IN GLEN LYN  	Michael Abraham bikemike@swva.net  	CURRENT; New River Journal; Pg. NRV10  	752 words  	The power plant situated beside the New River where U.S. 460 crosses the border between Giles County and Mercer County in West Virginia is one of the most familiar and dramatic scenes throughout the New River Valley.LiNeBrEaKI recently had the opportunity to speak with Frank Tanner, an engineering department manager for the plant, and Brad Jones, the plant manager of the facility owned by Appalachian Power Co.. Their comments spoke volumes about the way they view our national energy situation as well as how they perceive their work is viewed by the public.LiNeBrEaKTanner, a Virginia Tech mechanical engineering graduate, said, "This power plant at Glen Lyn is relatively small at 335 megawatts, enough to power a city about the size of Roanoke." Rather than powering a specific city or region, it pumps power into the nationwide grid, where it flows wherever there is demand. LiNeBrEaK"Our plant, which began operation in 1919, burns low-sulfur bituminous coal, which is mined primarily in Southwestern Virginia. I think the current rate for a kilowatt hour in this region of Virginia is $0. 067, which is among the lowest in the country." (Note: A recent rate increase will take the cost to $0. 09, effective in January.)LiNeBrEaKMost thermal power plants generate heat either through combustion -- as in the case of coal, oil or natural gas -- or through fission in a nuclear plant. That heat is used to boil water into steam, which generates pressure. This pressurized steam spins a turbine, which, in turn, spins a shaft in a dynamo that generates electricity. Once the steam has given up most of its energy, it needs to be condensed. At the Glen Lyn plant, the New River condenses the steam back to water where it is reheated in a closed loop.LiNeBrEaK"Before we burn the coal, it is pulverized to the consistency of talcum powder," Tanner said. "As it enters the boiler, it almost literally explodes into flame. The portion that is burned is converted into heat and gaseous chemicals like NOx [nitrogen oxides] and CO2 [carbon dioxide]. The unburned portion is ash, virtually all of which is now captured. In the old days, you could stand outside the plant and see clouds of black ash flowing from the smokestacks. Sometimes people will ask me why the plant isn't running because they don't see anything coming from the stacks. It is running, but now you don't see that because the ash is collected in our electrostatic precipitators."LiNeBrEaKStill, coal-fired power plants are associated with other environmental maladies such as acid rain and global warming. Tanner explained that "clean coal" still is experimental, with no commercial plants using these technologies yet.LiNeBrEaK"The next generation will have to make some serious decisions," he said. "Our government does not seem to be presenting to us a clear energy or environmental strategy. Demand for electricity is continuing to rise, and we are not building new generating capacity. Roughly 50 percent of our nation's electricity is generated from burning coal, 20 percent is generated with nuclear, and another 20 percent is generated with natural gas. A few percent are generated with hydroelectricity. Only 2 [percent] or 3 percent are generated with renewables like wind and solar.LiNeBrEaK"If we were to remove coal and nuclear plants from the grid, we would need to replace around 70 percent of our current usage. It is not technically feasible to replace those watts solely with solar and wind. People need to be reasonable with their expectations."LiNeBrEaKBut Tanner remains optimistic. "There is nothing like American entrepreneurship and innovation. We have always come up with the right technology at the right time. I won't come out and say we are in trouble, but it certainly concerns me."LiNeBrEaKHe said that American Electric Power is involved in the energy conservation business by providing information on its Web site and complimentary compact florescent light bulbs. But Jones, the plant manager, said it best: "Conservation is our best new energy source. My personal feeling is that there is no cheaper kilowatt than the one you never use."LiNeBrEaKMichael Abraham lives in Blacksburg and is a businessman and writer.LiNeBrEaKUpdateLiNeBrEaKA couple of months ago, I wrote about Michael McMahon, a Pearisburg physician who has been providing free medical care in Africa over the past few years. He'd had a heart attack, and his condition necessitated open-heart surgery recently to repair a diseased valve. When I spoke with him by phone, he was recuperating and was his typical, fast-talking, exuberant self, expecting a full recovery.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 14, 2008 Sunday 	Governor, others in Calif. await Obama's agenda for environment  	Mike Lee and Michael Gardner, STAFF WRITERS  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1294 words  	For eight years, the Bush administration routinely frustrated California's environmental agenda.LiNeBrEaKNow, with President-elect Barack Obama poised to set federal policy, environmentalists believe they will have a friend in the White House, even if some policy changes might be slower and smaller than they would like.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Obama picked his top environmental deputies: Carol Browner as adviser on energy and climate change, Steven Chu as energy secretary and Lisa Jackson as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKThe three officials, whose appointments are expected to be formally announced this week, are veteran regulators and scientists who are expected to combat climate change. LiNeBrEaK"Obama is going to stop attacking the foundations of our environmental policy," said David Larom, who researches and lectures on international environmental issues at San Diego State University.LiNeBrEaK"Whether he's going to aggressively pursue real environmental change with all the problems on his plate remains to be seen. But even if he turns out to be another centrist, he will be 1,000 times better than Bush," Larom said.LiNeBrEaKBush frequently clashed with Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger over environmental policy, most notably after the president blocked California's attempt to more closely regulate tailpipe emissions in December 2007.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger is eager for Obama to change the environmental agenda, particularly on global warming and renewable energy.LiNeBrEaK"We in California are ready to go and do everything that it takes in order to help his administration follow through ... with his environmental vision," Schwarzenegger said during a global warming summit he hosted in Beverly Hills last month.LiNeBrEaKThe governor's office expects a quick reversal of the Bush administration's decision to reject the state's application to impose its own tailpipe-emissions rules, technically known as a waiver.LiNeBrEaK"The most exciting thing for us in the immediate time frame is we'll get our waiver. We've waited for years," said Eileen Tutt, a Schwarzenegger adviser.LiNeBrEaKThe governor isn't the only one with high expectations of the president-elect. Since Election Day, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth, American Rivers and the Environmental Defense Fund have pressed Obama to boost protections.LiNeBrEaKAt the Beverly Hills summit, Obama told world leaders, "My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process. Denial is no longer an acceptable response."LiNeBrEaKNot appeased, major environmentalists pressed Obama to force deeper cuts in carbon emissions than he has outlined.LiNeBrEaKThey also have urged aggressive programs to clean the air, protect oceans, increase oversight of mining, require farmers to save more water and guard forests from over-logging. And they want economic stimulus packages to include more money for battery-electric cars and mass transit.LiNeBrEaKGary Jacobson, a political scientist and author at the University of California San Diego, said such sweeping requests by environmentalists aren't realistic because they would cost too much. The worsening economy certainly doesn't help.LiNeBrEaK"The world will never be green enough for them," he said. "But I think there is public support for considerably more green policies than the current administration has followed."LiNeBrEaKTraditional foes of conservationists disagree. Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, dubbed their ideas "a blueprint for disaster" and said in a statement that Obama "should reject these poorly conceived environmental demands as an economy-killer."LiNeBrEaKAs Obama's environmental team takes shape, conservation groups are trying to gauge whether Obama will maintain the centrist approach he took as a senator and candidate toward certain topics such as ethanol and nuclear power.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists don't like ethanol made from subsidized corn, but the industry has clout in the Capitol.LiNeBrEaK"That's a tough one to take on in Congress," said Bill Magavern, director of Sierra Club California. Obama has expressed support for corn-based ethanol, but on the campaign trail he suggested that waste sources can be used.LiNeBrEaKConservationists also aim to steer Obama away from quick approval of more nuclear power. The president-elect has signaled that more nuclear power could be a viable alternative to fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaK"We will try to convince the Obama administration that there are much better ways to spend our energy dollars," Magavern said.LiNeBrEaKOthers are far less optimistic that the nation's environmental policy is heading in the right direction, including the American Land Rights Association based in Battle Ground, Wash., which advocates for private-property protections.LiNeBrEaKExecutive director Chuck Cushman worries about the possible return of the "radical preservationists" from the Clinton administration.LiNeBrEaK"They didn't get everything locked up and closed down during the eight Clinton years, largely because the Republicans won control of the House and Senate. ... (They) want to finish what they started," he said in a recent statement.LiNeBrEaKAfter Bush took office in 2001, the environmental lobby was almost always on the defensive. His administration moved to allow more roads in national forests, lift mining restrictions, open areas near parks to oil exploration and rewrite the Endangered Species Act in favor of business interests. He also opposed the regulation of greenhouse gases and only grudgingly proposed better gas mileage for vehicles.LiNeBrEaKBush's approach to science has drawn sharp rebukes. Investigations by watchdog groups and political opponents highlighted a pattern of high-level interference by his White House into the environmental affairs of various agencies, including censoring top scientists who disagreed with the president's policies.LiNeBrEaKDespite such criticism, Rob Rivett, who represents farmers and ranchers as president of the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, disputed the idea that Bush gave away the environment to business interests.LiNeBrEaK"That's basically the (environmentalists') professional propaganda designed to scare folks and try to raise money," he said.LiNeBrEaKRivett pointed to the administration's decision to list the polar bear as an endangered species because of threats linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKBush also created a nearly 140,000-square-mile marine monument northwest of Hawaii and told top deputies to consider establishing what could become the world's largest marine reserve.LiNeBrEaK"Parts of his environmental legacy are not very good, but this could be one area where he would really set the high mark and protect more of the Earth's surface than any other person," said Lance Morgan, vice president for science at the Marine Conservation Biology Institute in Glen Ellen.LiNeBrEaKBUSH AND OBAMA ON THE ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration is still taking shape, but it's already clear it will take a different approach to environmental protection than the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKGlobal warming:LiNeBrEaKBush has been reluctant to regulate greenhouse gases or let California do so independently. Obama is expected to seek national controls and allow California to set its own standards for tailpipe emissions.LiNeBrEaKEndangered species:LiNeBrEaKBush deputies weakened safeguards for several species but opted to protect polar bears. Obama is likely to be less sympathetic to industry demands for fewer regulations.LiNeBrEaKFuel economy:LiNeBrEaKBush was slow to seek increased national standards while Obama has signaled he wants to take aggressive steps, referring to a potential 40 mpg average.LiNeBrEaKOil drilling:LiNeBrEaKBush backed drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and off the nation's coast. Obama has opposed drilling in the refuge, but left the door open for more offshore exploration as long as the decision is left to coastal states and safeguards are included.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	'Enormity of task' grows more daunting  	LIZ SIDOTI, ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. 003  	674 words  	President-elect Barack Obama, relatively young and inexperienced, is facing a rapidly growing list of monumental challenges as he prepares to take the reins of a nation in turmoil.LiNeBrEaK"I do not underestimate the enormity of the task that lies ahead," Obama said after his historic election a little more than a month ago.LiNeBrEaKIt was a sobering assessment at the time, but the country's problems have only worsened since then. Now, Obama sounds dire, particularly as he talks about the economy: "We're in an emergency." LiNeBrEaKHe spoke during a week in which Congress killed a bailout of the failing auto industry, the government reported that jobless claims spiked to their highest levels in more than a quarter-century, and the Treasury Department said the nation registered a record federal budget deficit for November.LiNeBrEaKWith woes foreign and domestic on more fronts than even Franklin Delano Roosevelt encountered when he took office in the midst of the Great Depression, Obama will be sworn in as the country's 44th president next month.LiNeBrEaKHis leadership will be tested immediately and in many ways. His performance from the outset could well set the tone for his presidency.LiNeBrEaKNot only is Obama saddled with lingering wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he is inheriting from President Bush, but he also must deal with:LiNeBrEaKA deepening recession in the U.S. and a spreading global economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKAn automotive industry on the brink of collapse and soaring national debt.LiNeBrEaKIncreasing unemployment and its ripple effects.LiNeBrEaKThe threat of terrorism amid a historic transfer of power.LiNeBrEaKAt the same time, Obama may be drawn into an unfolding political scandal over Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's alleged efforts to trade the president-elect's former Senate seat for personal gain. The ongoing federal investigation could ensnare some of his top advisers and taint the self-styled reformer .LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect says he's "absolutely confident" his aides did not try to cut deals with Blagojevich, but at the very least, the scandal is a distraction.LiNeBrEaKObama also has promised an ambitious foreign and domestic policy agenda that includes withdrawing most U.S. combat troops from Iraq, cleaning up government, overhauling the health care system, fighting global warming and developing alternative energy sources.LiNeBrEaKThe question is how quickly he can accomplish his goals while simultaneously confronting the growing list of major problems.LiNeBrEaK"There's a lot of ground giving under him. It's a terrific challenge," said Fred Greenstein, a Princeton University professor emeritus of politics and a presidential historian.LiNeBrEaK"From one perspective, it's as if he's about to take over the captain's job on a sinking ship. From the other perspective, he could be on a glide path to Mount Rushmore if he does a combination of morale building and energizing people while dealing with the economic distress by producing some constructive changes in the society and in the economy."LiNeBrEaKObama has surrounded himself with people in his incoming White House and cabinet who have decades more experience than he in government, as well as foreign and domestic policy.LiNeBrEaKMost historians liken the situation facing Obama to that which confronted Roosevelt - but the comparison does not seem to do justice to the colossal challenges Obama is facing.LiNeBrEaKRoosevelt was already an established politician when he came into office at the depths of the Great Depression in a society with no safety net for the suffering. And the economy was much worse then than it is now. But he did not have two wars on his plate, nor a political scandal swirling nearby.LiNeBrEaKRoosevelt also let his four-month transition pass by keeping his distance from Republican Herbert Hoover, and staying mum between his election and his inauguration.LiNeBrEaKNot Obama. He's been extraordinarily active since his election.LiNeBrEaKWith each new bit of bad economic news, he makes his views known, but defers to Bush when it's decision time.LiNeBrEaK"Part of what he's doing is paying lip service to the notion that there's only one president while sucking up all the oxygen," Greenstein said.

The Sunday Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Sunrise Edition	Where will you go with cheap gas?  		Editorial  	463 words  	SUMMARY: The plunge in oil prices tests the nation's commitmentLiNeBrEaKto fuel conservation, renewable energy and a greener worldLiNeBrEaKWhere will you go with cheap gas?LiNeBrEaKG as prices are going back, back, back, perhaps even all the way back to March 1999, the last time gasoline in this country cost less than a dollar a gallon on average. LiNeBrEaKThe big question is, are we all going back, too?LiNeBrEaKThere's a whole lot riding on our collective answer: The rise of renewable energy, the transformation of the auto industry, the success of public transit, the struggling global economy, the future of a warming world.LiNeBrEaKFour-dollars-a-gallon changed us. Americans quickly discovered how to drive 10 billion fewer miles. Those odd-shaped, fuel-sipping little cars suddenly looked pretty cool. MAX and those lumbering buses turned out to be convenient, and not nearly as scary as we'd heard. People got back on bicycles for the first time in decades. Started walking, too.LiNeBrEaKWe took an interest in the economics and politics of everything from wind farms to big solar. We remembered that nuclear power has zero greenhouse gas emissions. We hardly noticed when our new president chose a Nobel Prize winner in physics, instead of the usual political crony with no experience in energy policy, to serve as secretary of energy.LiNeBrEaKLet's not go back. Let's not do what we did after the 1970s oil embargo and run-up in gas prices. We forgot so very quickly what it meant to be utterly dependent on foreign oil. Our dependence only deepened, and we found ourselves fighting and dying over access to oil, and watching the dials spin 'round and 'round on the gas pumps, knowing that billions of our own dollars were now financing the very terrorist groups and rogue governments bent on harming us.LiNeBrEaKLet's not go back. Not to driving around town alone in hulking vehicles churning up a gallon of gas every 10 miles. Not to sneering at investments in public transit and bicycle lanes. Not to the lame excuses of an American auto industry that argued that it couldn't meet tougher fuel standards, that, in effect, it couldn't be as creative and resourceful as its foreign competitors.LiNeBrEaKLet's not go back. Not to a president who denied the overwhelming scientific evidence of human-caused climate change, not to head-in-the-sand policies on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Not to a place when the United States was last, not first, among nations responding to the serious threat of global warming.LiNeBrEaKInstead, let's go forward. Let's power our economy with renewable energy. Let's put a price on spewing carbon into the atmosphere. Let's agree on a large increase in fuel taxes that could fund the Manhattan Project-style research and development on fuel-efficient vehicles we need to break our addiction to foreign oil. Let's never go back.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Eat Their Words  	JEFF HOUCK  	BAYLIFE MAGAZINE; Pg. 19  	291 words  	"American Cheeses," by Clark Wolf (Simon and Schuster, $25)LiNeBrEaKIn the cheese universe, the United States lags in reputation behind the great cheesemakers of Europe who have been doing it for, like, a bazillion years. That's changing quickly, though, and Wolf does yeoman's work spotlighting the best regional, artisan and farmhouse cheeses in the country. Some, like Vermont's Cabot Creamery, have been so successful that they've been able to mass produce wonderful cheeses such as aged cheddar through a cooperative while still keeping a very high standard. LiNeBrEaK"Cool Cuisine," by Laura Stec with Eugene Cordero (Gibbs Smith, $24. 99)LiNeBrEaKThere's a danger when dropping the words "global warming" into any sentence. Readers will either cotton to the theory or violently oppose whatever follows. Knowing that, we'll only say that this book examines how the "agrochemical food system" affects global warming and offers tips that anyone can follow for reducing their environmental impact. (You'd be surprised at what a recyclable grocery bag can accomplish.)LiNeBrEaK"Betty Crocker's Guide To Easy Entertaining," by Betty Crocker (Betty Crocker, $16. 95)LiNeBrEaKFirst published 50 years ago, this book was intended to help Eisenhower-era homemakers be more efficient and successful as they entertained visitors.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	State's Slump Offers A 2nd Chance For Sustainable Development  	VICTORIA TSCHINKEL, Special to the Tribune  	VIEWS; Pg. 1  	1133 words  	The slowdown allows us breathing room to plan transit and communities.LiNeBrEaKBy VICTORIA TSCHINKELLiNeBrEaKSpecial to the TribuneLiNeBrEaKFlorida is in a painful pause, as is most of the world. I suggest that we view this period, to the extent that we can, as not as being in the middle of a bad accident on the way to the emergency room, but allow ourselves to be in a sunny convalescence, planning for our healthful future.LiNeBrEaKTrue, a lot of terrible things are happening. Many are hurting as the national financial crisis deepens. We are third in the country in the rate of foreclosures (one in every 157 homeowners in Florida are now in foreclosure) and thousands more families are facing the loss of their homes. Our net worth is declining from deflating housing values. With today's higher food prices we are paying considerably more for everyday needs, and we have seen how quickly a rise in fuel prices makes commutes to work, school and the store a source of financial misery. LiNeBrEaKAs if that were not enough misery, we know that Florida will be expensively and heartbreakingly affected as hotter temperatures increase the risk of devastating hurricanes and loss of habitat. We have borrowed $672 million from the hurricane recovery fund just to keep us afloat until the Legislature can meet to revise our budget.LiNeBrEaKFloridians are paying the price for the way this state has grown and developed during the past 50 years. Although it's true that growth management laws have lessened the catastrophic public costs of unwise growth, taxpayers are still subsidizing roads and sewer lines for sprawling development. We get hit in the pocketbook again when we pay for long commutes on congested roads. Transportation in Florida generates almost half of the state's contribution to greenhouse gases, speeding the impacts of climate change. Water managers have already declared portions of the state off-limits for additional withdrawals, and expensive non-traditional sources are contemplated. If we continue the same sprawling pattern of development for the next 50 years, the state could lose as much as another 7 million acres of agricultural lands and natural habitat, permanently altering the face of Florida and leaving our grandchildren the bill.LiNeBrEaKSome are looking for a quick fix to the state's crippled real estate industry. Wasting no time to find yet another excuse to maintain the old development model, they are proposing policies to roll back land management and environmental laws and regulations under the guise of "jump-starting" the economy. These include proposals to eliminate Florida's growth management laws, and dismantle the Florida Department of Community Affairs. We know that this will just make our existing challenges impossible to overcome.LiNeBrEaKFlorida has a second chance! More than ever, Florida needs strong leadership and a strong backbone to meet these challenges. We must and can save taxpayer dollars, promote sustainable economic development, protect natural lands and address climate change, wisely reduce water and energy consumption and lessen greenhouse gas emissions. Gov. Charlie Crist has set a good pace with his bold energy policies and the protection of the Everglades. Now is not the time for our Legislature to hunker down and hide out in Tallahassee.LiNeBrEaKLet's focus our efforts and our financial resources on creating great urban places and keeping Florida's rural lands rural. Federal dollars will be available, and we must not waste them. We will promote affordable, energy-efficient housing close to jobs, schools and shops.LiNeBrEaKFlorida will continue to grow and lead in adopting green residential technology, making us the envy of the world. Our communities will be energy-efficient, walkable and bike-friendly, reducing our dependence on the automobile but also helping our waistlines and health.LiNeBrEaKWe will support public transportation to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel and give citizens alternative, less costly ways to get to their jobs. Public investment in the building of this new infrastructure will create jobs and stimulate the economy.LiNeBrEaKVibrant cities include attractive and usable parks and recreation areas and protected natural features. Recycling historic and older buildings for new uses can save energy and help maintain a community's unique identity. Promoting cultural opportunities is essential. These must remain high priorities if our cities are to flourish.LiNeBrEaKMuch of our rural land can maintain its character. Some will remain natural, providing opportunities for recreation for humans and habitat for wildlife. This state's great farmlands will remain productive, providing fresh and reasonably priced nourishment for Floridians and others, and hopefully significant energy supplies.LiNeBrEaKThese undeveloped lands also offer the greatest potential for carbon sequestration to offset the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Thirsty Floridians will be grateful for the water supplies rural lands protect.LiNeBrEaKFinding the way to acquire lands identified as essential for maintaining Florida's natural balance, and to encourage landowners to keep their lands in agriculture, forestry or other sustainable land practices needs to be one primary goal. The other is to support responsible and meaningful local planning with state oversight. Florida's citizens will have access and meaningful participation in their future.LiNeBrEaKWhile Florida's growth management process showed great promise when it was enacted in 1986, it has been steadily chipped away over the years. We need to cheerfully applaud the successes achieved, and rededicate ourselves during this opportunity (not wished for, surely) to recapture the Florida dream and thoughtfully rededicate ourselves to a sustainable Florida.LiNeBrEaKLet's give short shrift to those who want to give up on the dream for their own short-term gain. Our country has learned a lesson forever that the common good is not served by the narrow focus of a few. We must commit to smart, sustainable communities throughout our state.LiNeBrEaKUrgent, strong and decisive leadership is needed to bring Florida into the 21st Century. In this time of economic hardship and declining natural resources, no longer can we afford to pay the high costs associated with sprawling, automobile-dependent, resource-wasting development.LiNeBrEaKThe basic tools are in place. Even as we help those who are struggling through these financial times, let's plan and direct ourselves to the exciting and sustainable Florida in our future.LiNeBrEaKVictoria Tschinkel, former head of Florida's environmental enforcement, is chairwoman of 1000 Friends of Florida. This statewide nonprofit organization was created in 1986 to serve as watchdog over Florida's growth management process.

B8  	926 words  	Fly ash flyoverLiNeBrEaKWe've all seen the slick commercials and ads for Dominion Resources: the clean-cut guys with great teeth and soft hands whose sole purpose in life is to make your life better with electricity.LiNeBrEaKWho are they kidding? There's no real competition in the electricity business, no doorbuster specials, so the only purpose of these ads is to make you look the other way when Dominion does something like whisk hundreds of truckloads of poisonous fly ash out from under environmental oversight and deposit them on a golf course where its contaminants are probably polluting nearby wells. LiNeBrEaKGet wise. The real line workers at Dominion are great people, but their corporate bosses just want to make more money. You can bet no fly ash gets trucked to their neighborhoods.LiNeBrEaKKenneth BradfordLiNeBrEaKRichmondLiNeBrEaKBolster Coast GuardLiNeBrEaKI read with admiration "Rebuild Navy, Marines to keep America secure," op-ed, Dec. 8, and generally agree with the premise. We should, however, not forget or dismiss the importance of our Coast Guard.LiNeBrEaKThis is not your grandfather's or father's Coast Guard and should be recognized for its importance to national security and defense. Since my son joined four years ago, the scope of his service and missions have turned out to be mind-boggling.LiNeBrEaKYes, his missions have included the expected -- port security, rescues, drug patrols and busts, monitoring commercial fishing and all the publicized deployments.LiNeBrEaKWe never imagined him in the Mediterranean and Black seas, training with the Bulgarian Coast Guard and less than an hour from heading to Cyprus to aid in evacuating Americans. The Far East was a surprise as well, with goodwill and training exercises with China, Japan, Korea and Russia. If that is not enough, he deploys to Iraq next month to provide security in the Gulf and elsewhere.LiNeBrEaKThe Coast Guard needs our support and admiration as well. I hope President-elect Obama will look kindly on the most underfunded military organization under his command. God bless our Coast Guard.LiNeBrEaKPeter PulmanLiNeBrEaKChincoteagueLiNeBrEaKEmission omissionsLiNeBrEaKRe "Kaine receptive to panel's call for deep cuts in greenhouse emissions," front page, Dec. 5:LiNeBrEaKRecently, the Governor's Commission on Climate Change presented its final report on global warming, which recommends more than 100 specific policies for the General Assembly. Although I extol the commitment to the environment that the volunteer commissioners have demonstrated, their recommendations come up short.LiNeBrEaKFor one, the commission's greenhouse gas emission recommendations are weaker than levels recommended by the United Nations commission of scientists. While Virginia recommends keeping emission levels equal to what was released in 2000, thousands of scientists agree that levels should be reduced to 80 percent below 1990 levels. Considering current greenhouse gas emission levels are 30 percent higher than in 1990, the commissioners have failed to set a credible goal.LiNeBrEaKNoticeably absent from the report is a call for a mandatory renewable energy standards (RES). This was a grave mistake. RES encourage investment in renewable energy technology (that is undeniably the future of the country's energy needs) and facilitate a whole new sector of jobs so desperately needed in today's economy.LiNeBrEaKWhile the commission has begun to forge Virginia's path toward more sustainable practices, it did not pursue aggressively enough standards to combat the global warming that is so aggressively pursuing our planet.LiNeBrEaKMallory M.

The Washington Post 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Every Edition	comingandgoing  		TRAVEL; Pg. P02  	1068 words  	 ENVIRONMENTAL WATCH LiNeBrEaKHow Green Was My Vacay LiNeBrEaK"One Vacation Can Be Worse Than Commuting for a Year."LiNeBrEaKSo reads one troubling headline  in a study released last week by the Union of Concerned Scientists,  a nonprofit organization that has been  researching modes of vacation transport to find out which are the most environmentally friendly. The full report, "Getting There Greener: The Guide to Your Lower-Carbon Vacation," is available at the group's Web site (http://www.ucsusa.org) and is more than 50 pages. So at the risk of ruining the suspense, CoGo can reveal that the mode of transport with the smallest carbon footprint is the motor coach, which CoGo was a lot more excited about before remembering that "motor coach" is  just a fancy term for "bus."LiNeBrEaKWhich isn't to say we weren't impressed. Says the study, "A couple traveling on a motor coach will generate nearly 50 percent less global warming pollution than they would driving a fuel-efficient hybrid car," not to mention 55 to 75 percent less than they would by flying.  Plus, bus travel is getting nicer all the time -- right? -- what with all the new companies offering WiFi and other perks on some routes.LiNeBrEaKOn the downside, it's still the bus. LiNeBrEaKAnother thing to keep in mind when planning a green vacation: the number of travelers in your group. For parties of one or two, taking a nonstop coach flight is nearly always greener than driving (first-class seats take up twice as much room as those in coach and therefore are responsible for twice the carbon emissions.) Then again, a family of four would better serve the planet by driving than by flying, especially if they take the study's advice and rent a hybrid or other fuel-efficient automobile. And for couples traveling 500 miles or less, taking the train is almost always the next-best option after the bus, especially here on the East Coast.LiNeBrEaKJust don't be like the Elsens, a hypothetical Orlando-bound family of four from Chicago who the study imagines "pull out all the stops for their first trip to Disney World and use frequent flyer miles to travel first-class," changing planes in Houston. That one vacation, according to the UCS, creates 1 1/2  half times the  pollution generated by the family's two cars in a year's worth of commuting between home and  work and running weekday errands.LiNeBrEaKINAUGURAPALOOZA LiNeBrEaKThe Balls in Their Court LiNeBrEaK Want to enjoy the inauguration but can't afford tickets to the hottest balls in town? Here's an idea: Celebrate the inauguration somewhere else.LiNeBrEaKSome, no doubt, will see that as a heretical notion, but think of it this way. The Hawaii State Society's ball at the Mandarin Oriental is one of D.C.'s hottest tickets (it's Barack Obama's home state, after all), so hot that tickets were gone weeks ago, with scalpers now hawking them online for up to $2,000 apiece (original price: $200). For that kind of money, during the same period in January, you can fly from Washington to Honolulu round-trip ($462), stay six nights at the  Queen Kapiolani Hotel with a view of Diamond Head ($635) and still have plenty of cash left over for a $250 ticket to the Jan. 20 inaugural gala at the Royal Hawaiian hotel on Waikiki Beach. (For info on the party, visit http://www.hawaiidemocrats.org.)LiNeBrEaKTickets for the Texas State Society's always-popular Black Tie and Boots Ball are already going for $500 on Craigslist. Tickets to Dallas on American Airlines, meanwhile, are going for $167; three nights at the Best Western Dallas are $217; and a ticket to the Dallas Presidential Inaugural Ball on Jan. 20 is a mere $75 (http://www.dallasinauguralball.com).LiNeBrEaKAnd then there's the sold-out Illinois inaugural gala. Thanks to Obama's association with that state (and rumors that he'll actually attend that ball), tickets are commanding $800 or more online, which is 323 bucks more than the total cost of round-trip airfare to Chicago ($217), three nights at the Essex Inn across from Grant Park ($260) and, well, nothing in the Second City ball-wise as of yet, which is odd when you think about it. But we'll keep you posted about expat inaugural activities as we hear of them.LiNeBrEaKCRUISE NEWS LiNeBrEaKFuel Surcharges End LiNeBrEaK Most major cruise lines have suspended fuel surcharges for 2009 itineraries. But if you've already paid in full, don't expect a cash refund: The cruise companies instead will hand out rebates in the form of shipboard credits.  Travelers who have booked but haven't paid  yet won't be charged.LiNeBrEaKMost cruise lines, which started adding fuel surcharges when the price of oil hit $100-plus per barrel, had removed the surcharges for 2010 cruises earlier this fall.  In recent weeks, they've extended the policy change to 2009 cruises.LiNeBrEaKPrestige Cruise Holdings, which owns Regent Seven Seas and Oceania Cruises, last week became the latest line to announce elimination of its surcharge, which was $15 per person per day, effective Jan. 1. Other lines that have  abandoned the  fees  include:LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; For  cruises booked starting Dec. 1, Disney Cruise Line, which had charged $8 per person per day for the first two passengers in a cabin plus $3 per day for each additional passenger.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Effective Jan. 1, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., owner of Royal Caribbean, Celebrity and Azamara, which had charged $5 to $15 per person per day for the first two passengers and $3 to $5 for additional passengers.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Effective Jan. 1, Norwegian Cruise Line, which had charged between $7 and $11 per person per day for the first two passengers in a cabin and between $3 and $5 for the third and fourth passengers.LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; For departures on or after Dec. 17, Carnival Corp., owner of Carnival, Costa, Cunard, Holland America, Princess and Seabourn, which, for all lines except Seabourn, had charged $9 per person per day for the first and second guests and, for all lines, $4 per person per day for extra guests. Seabourn had charged  $15 per person per day for the first two passengers.LiNeBrEaKMost of the lines noted that they will reinstate the charge if fuel prices rise above $65 per barrel. Cruise lines have been under fire to jettison  the fees: Earlier this year, a civil lawsuit filed in Florida accused the major lines of fixing prices by charging false fuel surcharges.LiNeBrEaKReporting: Scott Vogel, Carol Sottili LiNeBrEaKHelp feed CoGo.

The Washington Post 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Suburban Edition	Next Climate Summit May Turn on Rich Nations' Approach to Poor Ones  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A08  	930 words  	The acrimonious end to the United Nations talks here early Saturday morning highlights the challenge rich and poor countries will face as they seek a global climate pact in the coming year, as well as a possible path toward compromise.LiNeBrEaKMuch of the debate this year focused on how to structure the year-old adaptation fund, which devotes a small portion of the money industrial nations pay on clean-energy projects in developing nations to helping those same countries cope with global warming. LiNeBrEaKPoor nations had hoped to strike a deal in which some of the money raised by auctioning international pollution allowances in the next few years would go toward this effort, but industrialized countries resisted. While this sparked a slew of impassioned speeches in the closing hours of the two-week conference, it also underscored that a future global warming agreement will depend in large part on the extent to which developed nations address the needs of vulnerable countries and emerging nations that have become a growing source of the greenhouse gases responsible for human-induced climate change.LiNeBrEaKDavid Waskow, climate change program director for Oxfam America, said delegates hoping to finalize an agreement next December in Copenhagen recognize that they need a better way to fund poor nations' adaptation needs, which could run between $50 billion and $80 billion a year, according to independent and U.N. estimates. The current fund -- which became operational after negotiators reached an accord this week -- collects between $200 million and $300 million annually from a 2 percent levy on the clean development mechanism, which allows nations to meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments by reducing emissions in developing countries.LiNeBrEaK"The current funding is a small fraction of the progress that is needed to help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change and to ensure that we can reach an ambitious climate change agreement," Waskow said. "It became clear at the end of the talks here that hard-hit countries won't agree to a deal in Copenhagen next year unless these concerns are addressed in a serious way."LiNeBrEaKAfter negotiators decided to put off this question until next year, half a dozen delegates expressed their disappointment publicly. Indian delegate Prodipto Ghosh said that out of the 12 annual U.N. climate meetings he had attended, "this is one of the saddest moments in all these years."LiNeBrEaKChristiana Figueres Olsen, Costa Rica's special adviser for climate change, said: "Given the content of this issue, we should have been discussing in one of the most vulnerable countries, where we would have been faced with the reality of adaptation every day. . . . Adaptation, Mr. President, is the human tragedy of climate change."LiNeBrEaKIn a news conference afterward, Yvo de Boer -- executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which hosted the talks -- said "this conference caused some bitterness" because of its failure to resolve the adaptation question.LiNeBrEaK"Let's be honest, doing a deal in Copenhagen is to an important extent about engaging developing countries. And an important part of engaging developing countries is mobilizing financial resources," de Boer said. Rich countries, he said, held off making a commitment because they see it "as part of a financial package to deliver a much broader agreement."LiNeBrEaKNed Helme, president of the Center for Clean Air Policy, said the fact that developing countries were putting concrete emissions-reduction plans on the table and emphasizing what they need to cope with global warming shows how the impetus for action has become stronger in the past year.LiNeBrEaK"The tenor has changed," Helme said, noting that officials from these countries are more committed to act now that they have witnessed what is at stake for their citizens. "We've really seen a shift."LiNeBrEaKWhite House Council on Environmental Quality Chairman James L. Connaughton, one of the members of the U.S. delegation to Poznan, said the United States has already funded infrastructure and other projects in developing countries that can address climatic effects. "All of these steps are going to help with adaptation," he said.LiNeBrEaKDe Boer noted that adaptation funding was "part of the challenge in Copenhagen, not the challenge in Copenhagen," since a final deal needs to include firm emissions commitments from industrial countries and outline what major emerging economies will do to curb their own carbon outputs. In meetings with foreign ministers here, Connaughton cautioned that it will be difficult for the United States to reach President-elect Barack Obama's target of bringing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKIn an interview Friday, Connaughton said he based that assessment on the political climate in Congress as well as the lengthy analysis the administration conducted in recent years. "I don't see that," he said of Obama's projections. "It does not appear supportable."LiNeBrEaKBut most participants here predicted an Obama administration would be able to deliver on its promises, which in turn could help forge a global agreement. "Obviously, we are all hoping that there will be greater support for the post-Kyoto framework for the world" from Obama, said Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai.LiNeBrEaKPaula J. Dobriansky, undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs and head of the U.S. delegation, said this month's talks laid the groundwork for such a global pact.LiNeBrEaK"What's being advanced here is going to be important for the United States," she said in an interview. "We want the United States to be part of a new international agreement."

The Washington Post 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Regional Edition	A Greener Version of Washington  		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B08  	445 words  	Mom was right when she told us to turn off the lights and lower the thermostat.LiNeBrEaKGiven that much of the Washington region's greenhouse gas emissions are a result of our collective choices, Mom's advice not only saves the budget but  the planet, too. Now, a new report by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments sets regional goals and outlines best practices to stop climate change. The good news is that many of the recommendations contribute to other goals as well. LiNeBrEaKAs the Council of Governments holds its annual meeting this month, we are highlighting the Climate Change Report: an ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 10 percent by 2012, 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050. The report recommends   choosing Energy Star-rated appliances, changing to compact fluorescent light bulbs and reducing energy consumption. It also includes strategies for local governments, such as expanding transit, increasing commuter options and promoting transit-oriented development. To achieve our goals, we'll need the help of the incoming Obama administration in setting consistent energy efficiency standards and stricter fuel economy standards nationwide.LiNeBrEaKMany of the 20 local governments that participate in the Council of Governments already have implemented some of the strategies. For example, Montgomery County offers residents rewards for purchasing clean energy and property tax credits for installing energy efficiency devices. Some jurisdictions are working toward a goal of purchasing 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources or switching to energy-efficient street lights and traffic signals.LiNeBrEaKGiven  the current economic conditions, some may ask how we can commit to such an ambitious plan. The answer is easy. Combating climate change makes good economic sense. Conserving energy, using efficient appliances, driving less and walking more all save money in the long run. Even better, investing in transit, clean energy production and green technology stimulates the economy and positions us well in the rapidly growing global green-collar sector.LiNeBrEaKMany of the Council of Governments' recommendations also contribute to air and water quality, agricultural preservation and congestion relief. It's a win-win-win situation.LiNeBrEaKThanks to the Climate Change Report, the regional goals are in front of us, and so are the strategies to reach them. All we have to do is join forces to think globally and act locally. But first, put on a sweater -- Mom's orders.LiNeBrEaK -- Nancy Floreen  LiNeBrEaKRockvilleLiNeBrEaKThe writer is chairman of the Climate Change Steering Committee of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and a member of the Montgomery County Council.

The Washington Post 	December 14, 2008 Sunday   Regional Edition	Climate Change Lessons;  It's not easy going green. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06  	481 words  	PRESIDENT-ELECT Barack Obama is committed to ending the United States' inaction on global warming. He wants to reduce emissions through a cap-and-trade system. But a report from the Government Accountability Office on problems with Europe's system and the inability of climate talks in Poland last week to settle on a specific number for the "long-term global goal for emissions reductions" shows how difficult the task will be. LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. He would accomplish this by auctioning all of the emission allowances that would be available through a cap-and-trade system that would put an annual declining cap on the number of pollution permits. The European Union created its own cap-and-trade system in response to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. But European experience shows that this complicated regime is no guarantee of success. The GAO report confirms that  the European Union erred in its calculation of emissions and then compounded the error by giving away all of the pollution permits. The results were higher energy prices for customers and windfall profits for utilities.LiNeBrEaKThe United States didn't sign Kyoto and has been roundly -- and rightly -- criticized for resisting efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and thwarting attempts to establish a long-term goal with specific targets. The Europeans have been the chief critics, but they've had a hard time living up to their self-righteous railings against the United States. They haven't been terribly successful at meeting their own targets. At meetings in Brussels last week, a move to auction all emissions permits starting in 2013 was resisted by Poland and other Eastern European countries worried about the impact on their industries. So a two-tiered system was created. For Eastern European utilities, there would be an auction of 30 percent of emissions allowances in 2013, going to 100 percent by 2020. The rest of the E.U. power companies would have to buy all of their pollution permits in 2013. Meanwhile, the just-concluded U.N. gathering in Poznan, Poland, failed to quantify the goal that would be the foundation for Kyoto II, which is slated to be signed next December.LiNeBrEaKTo reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen dependence on fossil fuels, there must be a price on carbon. A cap-and-trade system is the easiest way to integrate into an international regime, but its pitfalls are legion. A gas tax would be simpler and less subject to bureaucratic manipulation and undermining by lobbying interests. It would be the easiest way to change behavior, meet emissions targets and spark the innovation that will produce the next generation of energy production that will save the planet. We hope that Mr. Obama will give this approach serious consideration as he takes up the mantle of leadership  on global warming that President Bush shunned.

Aiken Standard (South Carolina)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Some wary over Obama's pick for energy secretary pick  	Mike Gellatly, Aiken Standard, S.C.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	475 words  	Dec. 13--In an area where the largest employer, by some way, is funded by The Department of Energy, the appointment of a new secretary can have quite an impact. LiNeBrEaKThis week, one of the country's most renowned scientists Steven Chu has emerged as President-elect Barack Obama's choice for that position.LiNeBrEaKFor years Chu has been a vocal advocate for more research into alternative energy, arguing that a shift away from fossil fuels is essential to combat global warming. Many around the CSRA will be anxious to see if Chu's vision meshes with their own, either eagerly awaiting a nuclear renaissance or looking to move in a less-toxic direction.LiNeBrEaKThose in South Carolina's federal delegation, who all favor nuclear as the way forward, seem unsure what the prospect of the new secretary holds.LiNeBrEaK"I would hope the next secretary would be pro-nuclear," U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett said briefly after Obama's election. "We need to continue the move toward making the country energy independent. And I don't see any other viable way forward besides nuclear."LiNeBrEaKWith not much known by average America about the 1997 Nobel laureate physicist, many do not want to commit to an opinion until Chu's expected appointment is closer to reality.LiNeBrEaKSen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) will not be giving any statements on any of Obama's selected appointees until the hearings have begun, a spokesperson said Friday.LiNeBrEaKBefore Chu's name was announced, DeMint made clear what he felt the secretary must prioritize.LiNeBrEaK"A new energy secretary needs to pledge to expedite the exploration of offshore oil and natural gas reserves so we can keep our economy strong," said Wesley Denton, spokesman for DeMint. "A new secretary also needs to break with the Carter-era nuclear policies that set us back decades and help remove obstacles to clean, safe nuclear power including the important MOX program and opening Yucca Mountain."LiNeBrEaKChu, 60, is currently the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. In recent years, he has campaigned to bring together a cross-section of scientific disciplines to find ways to counter climate change.LiNeBrEaKSince 2004, Chu has been director of the Berkeley lab, with its 4,000 employees and a budget of $650 million. The laboratory has been a center of research into biofuels and solar energy technologies.LiNeBrEaKObama has promised to move quickly on energy issues, including a push for more alternative fuels and to get Congress to address climate change.

The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	County mulls carbon credit deal  	Donnie Fetter, The Augusta Chronicle, Ga.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	416 words  	Dec. 13--THE ISSUELiNeBrEaKTo promote a healthy environment, and possibly add some dollars to county coffers, Columbia County commissioners recently agreed to seek out potential partners to manufacture and sell carbon credits generated by the Baker Place Road Landfill. LiNeBrEaKWHAT IS IT?LiNeBrEaKThrough a burning process, it is possible to convert methane gases generated by landfill waste into less harmful carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThe carbon dioxide then can be sold as carbon credits to companies manufacturing more greenhouse gases than the law allows.LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency assigns a monetary value, which changes based on market forces, to each tonnage of methane converted into carbon dioxide. Overpolluting companies are allowed to purchase that tonnage, or credits, to reduce their carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaKTHE ECONOMICSLiNeBrEaKA carbon credit operation at the county landfill might generate $1 million in revenues during a 10-year span, according to a study by Atlanta-based consulting firm Jordan, Jones and Goulding Inc.LiNeBrEaKThe gross profits over a decade could reach nearly $2 million, according to the study.LiNeBrEaKTo establish a collection and control system at the landfill might cost as much as $525,000. The operations and maintenance of such a facility might cost between $20,000 to $30,000.LiNeBrEaKAny profits generated with carbon credits would have to be split with whatever private company the county chooses to partner with. The study recommended that the county seek out a partnership with a group with the technical expertise needed to construct and operate a carbon credit facility.LiNeBrEaKTHE TIME FRAMELiNeBrEaKCounty officials hope to start advertising in February for those interested in partnering on a carbon credit venture.LiNeBrEaKOnce the proposal is advertised, county Construction and Maintenance Division Director Scott Herring said he would expect responses by March or April. It will then likely take four to six weeks to review proposals and make committee recommendations.LiNeBrEaKShould commissioners approve moving forward with a proposal, it might take another month to settle on a term and sign contracts, Mr. Herring said.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Reforming the carbon culprits  	Umesh Pandey, Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	959 words  	Dec. 13--SINGAPORE -- As the talks on the global climate change concluded in Poznan, Poland, yesterday, the world has agreed to take action ahead of the key summit about to take place in Copenhagen next year and replace the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKThe key to achieving the target is to tackle the biggest cause of the greenhouse effect -- power generation. LiNeBrEaKAs you and I have become addicted to usage of power for the light needed to make the house more beautiful, or for that air conditioning that we still switch on at night during this cool weather, or the one floor that we take the elevators for, the biggest cause of the greenhouse effect is none other than power generation.LiNeBrEaKAccording to reports, about 24 percent of the 42 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted each year is caused by power-generation companies burning fossil fuel to meet the demand that we are splurging with.LiNeBrEaKVarious studies have suggested this notion but as power stations collectively are the largest suppliers of electricity, it is an issue that needs to be delicately taken into account.LiNeBrEaKThe burning of coal, oil and gas in power stations releases a number of air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, according to various reports published globally.LiNeBrEaKSulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can cause respiratory disorders, with children and asthmatics being particularly vulnerable.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, these two primary pollutants are converted to acids in the atmosphere which can damage a range of ecosystems, including freshwater lakes and forests, when they are returned to earth as acid rain.LiNeBrEaKThis still holds true although the polluting power generators have come a long way and these days fossil fuel-burning power generation is emitting far less amount of the pollutants in the air.LiNeBrEaKAs the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change summit in Poznan discussed various issues such as pollution caused by land use, agriculture, or transport, which account for 18 percent, 14 percent and 14 percent respectively of the 42 gigatonnes of CO2 emitted, the bigger problems such as the pollution caused by these factors are left to be sorted out by themselves.LiNeBrEaKFor countries like Thailand and others in the region that have some natural sources for power generation such as hydropower, any new regulations that are implemented on emission of greenhouse gases would have limited consequences in the long term. On the other hand, for smaller countries such as Singapore, the impact is tremendous. For lack of the natural resources to generate electricity, these countries have to rely on fossil fuel for electricity generation.LiNeBrEaKToday, about 42 percent of Singapore's pollution stems from the power generation sector, says Roy Adair, president and chief executive of Senoko Power Ltd, the 3,300-MW generator that provides about a third of Singapore's electricity needs.LiNeBrEaKThe power company was formerly owned by Temasek Holdings, and earlier this year sold to a consortium led by the Japanese trading house Marubeni, which has been looking for overseas acquisitions to increase power output. The consortium paid $2. 5 billion and also assumed Senoko's $323 million in debts.LiNeBrEaKMr Adair said that Singapore did not have many options. The only thing power companies can do is to bring down their costs by optimising their operations.LiNeBrEaK"If you look at Singapore, we cannot rely on wind power. It is not a solution right now as we cannot produce the electricity demand that is required in the country," he said when asked if alternative energy was an option.LiNeBrEaKSingapore's electricity market is about the size of 37. 5 terawatt hours (TWh) and all the generators combined currently produce about 20 million tonnes of CO2 per year.LiNeBrEaK"At this rate, what we have to do is to be a very good neighbour. We are a very small country and therefore we have to try our best to keep the emissions to the lowest possible levels," he said.LiNeBrEaKAs such, most power generators in Singapore have started to shift to a more economical and less-polluting method of using natural gas (combined-cycle) production of electricity, a phenomenon that is evident in most other countries in this part of the world.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Mr Adair, Singapore's various power producers use fossil fuel such as diesel and coal to produce 34. 60 percent of the country's electricity in 2003 but today the use of these materials to generate power is down by nearly 50 percent to about just 17. 80 percent, while the use of natural gas has risen to 78. 70 percent against 60. 80 percent seen in 2003.LiNeBrEaKFor Senoko, about 70. 7 percent of its energy sources are fuels such as oil and coal in 1998. The proportion was drastically reduced to 8. 5 percent in 2007, replaced by natural gas, which made up 91. 3 percent in that year, from a mere 26. 3 percent in 1998. The proportion has reached 95 percent in 2008.LiNeBrEaKHe says that the switch to gas is economical and sensible since natural gas is abundant in the resource-rich region.LiNeBrEaKMr Adair says that the firms has managed to cut its carbon footprint in a big way by switching its fuel source.LiNeBrEaK"Today, due to the switch, we have reduced our emission by 2. 5 million tonnes per year. This is equal to removing all cars from the streets of Singapore," he says.LiNeBrEaKEven the largest contributors to greenhouse gases who do not have too many options can help cut greenhouse emissions, he added.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	International community becoming more active in climate change mitigation  	By Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	962 words  	POZNAN, Poland _ If one message has emerged from the long and often tortuous hours of climate negotiations in recent years, it is this: In the end, progress is being made.LiNeBrEaKThe level of international ambition to deal with climate change is growing, as was evident at the latest round of UN climate talks, which ended Friday in Poland. It's happening despite a range of obstacles _ and sometimes even because of them.LiNeBrEaKThe looming economic crisis has raised widespread fears that the costs of achieving deep greenhouse gas cuts might be intolerable, at least in the short term, as families struggle to pay mortgages and heat their homes. But nations including the United States, under President-elect Barack Obama, have responded by promising to use economic stimulus packages to push green technology and create green jobs. LiNeBrEaKUnder what UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon is calling a green New Deal, laid-off employees are expected to be put to work insulating houses rather than building dams, and companies manufacturing solar panels and efficient cars will get government investment.LiNeBrEaKAfter months of wavering, Europe also agreed Friday to adopt tough binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020, or 30 percent if other developed nations match their ambition, a move that "puts Europe firmly on the road to becoming a sustainable, low-carbon economy," said Stavros Dimas, European commissioner for the environment.LiNeBrEaKAround the world, combating climate change is becoming a greater priority, particularly as more nations begin to see evidence of problems at home. A growing number of hurricanes and other severe storms, droughts, wildfires, floods and melting glaciers have added a sense of urgency to talks that once seemed to focus on a distant threat.LiNeBrEaKClimate negotiators agreed at Poznan last week to step up interim talks in the coming months to help ensure a deal next December in Copenhagen on a treaty to replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol, which requires most developed nations to cut their emissions. The U.S. never ratified the Kyoto treaty.LiNeBrEaKIf a deal is reached at Copenhagen, it will then have to be approved by legislatures around the world, which could take years, according to UN climate head Yvo de Boer.LiNeBrEaKBut there are signs of support for the deal even from former bitter opponents of the process. A growing coalition of major U.S. businesses, afraid of losing competitive advantage to counterparts overseas, has pressed for the government to set mandatory emissions reduction levels, which they see as crucial to preparing long-term business plans. U.S. states, cities and regions also have set emission reduction targets.LiNeBrEaKMore businesses also support the establishment of national carbon markets and a cap-and-trade system whereby emission permits can be bought and sold, a measure Obama has promised to make a priority.LiNeBrEaKAt climate meetings, a consensus is growing on the need for measures ranging from a fund to help the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations adjust to a changing climate, to mechanisms to ensure that new emission-cutting technologies are shared with developing countries.LiNeBrEaKHow far have attitudes shifted? Saudi Arabia, which has long tried to stall climate treaty negotiations, fearing a wholesale shift away from fossil fuels, began laying the groundwork at Poznan to try to eventually win benefits itself from adaptation and technology-transfer funds.LiNeBrEaKMajor developing nations including China, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico similarly have proposed national emissions reductions after long insisting that developed countries act first. Most developed countries that have not set targets for emissions reductions now expect to do so by March.LiNeBrEaK"A pattern is emerging of countries taking the negotiations seriously," said Jennifer Haverkamp, climate policy expert with the Environmental Defense Fund. Like the talks in Bali, the Poznan negotiations "could have been more ambitious and detailed. But they're enough" to push forward, she said.LiNeBrEaKThe bigger question, some climate analysts say, is not whether a new treaty will be passed, but whether it will work. The Kyoto Protocol, negotiated a decade ago before a widespread sense of urgency emerged, has failed to produce significant emissions cuts, new research shows.LiNeBrEaKNegotiators say a new treaty is more likely to result in real progress, not least because it will encompass a broader range of countries and because the technology needed to bring about cuts is better understood.LiNeBrEaKStill, some scientists warn that the slow pace and limited ambition of negotiations up to now mean substantial climate change is already unavoidable and that the current target of holding greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to 450 parts per million _ up from about 380 ppm at present _ is impractical. More likely, they say, are higher concentrations that could lead to a disastrous 7- to 11-degree rise in global temperatures.LiNeBrEaK"The scale and immediacy of emission reductions necessary cannot be reconciled" with the current efforts to make them, said Kevin Anderson, research director at the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester.LiNeBrEaK"We're running out of reserves of time," said Henry Derwent, president of the International Emissions Trading Association and a former UK climate negotiator. "But unless you get the deal right, [needed cuts] are just not going to happen."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Global climate talks achieve 'bare minimum': Developing nations make major commitments  	Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	772 words  	Dec. 13--POZNAN, Poland -- With developing countries offering more emissions cuts than anticipated and richer nations in many cases offering fewer, global climate negotiators wrapped up lackluster talks Friday that UN officials said nonetheless kept the world on the path toward a new treaty by next December.LiNeBrEaKIn the final day of talks, negotiators agreed on principles of financing for a fund to help the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations cope with the effects of climate change. Earlier they approved a mechanism to incorporate forest protection into efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKBut basic questions over an equitable balance of emissions cuts between richer and poorer nations for the most part remained unresolved, particularly because many richer nations balked at making firm or ambitious promises to cut emissions in the coming decade.LiNeBrEaK"We got the bare minimum of what we needed from the talks," said Jennifer Haverkamp, international climate policy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. Coming out of Poznan, "there's a lot to do and less than a year to do it."LiNeBrEaKNegotiations have been hampered by growing worries in Europe, long the world leader in pushing a climate deal, about the costs of cutting emissions as its industries come under pressure during a spreading global recession.LiNeBrEaKDespite those worries, however, Europe managed to sign its own climate agreement Friday, committing the region to a 20 percent cut in emissions by 2020 as well as a doubling of use of renewable energy and a 20 percent boost in energy efficiency over the same period.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's promise to make combating climate change a priority for his administration has produced as much frustration as enthusiasm at Poznan, simply because his negotiators are not yet at the table, which has led other countries to delay decisions on cuts until seeing a new U.S. proposal.LiNeBrEaKNegotiators "want to be sure they're not committing their economies and populations to some kind of quixotic emissions reductions regime which costs them much more than their neighbors and exports competitors," said Henry Derwent, president of the International Emissions Trading Association and a former British climate negotiator.LiNeBrEaKStill, "Poznan can't be judged by the number of decisions made here. Everybody knows without the United States a lot of decisions have to wait," Haverkamp said.LiNeBrEaKOne of the brightest spots of the talks was a series of vows by major developing countries to cut their greenhouse gases, in recognition of the global scope of the problem and in line with promises made at talks last December in Bali.LiNeBrEaKBrazil announced a new commitment to cut deforestation by 70 percent by 2017, a move that would effectively cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions by more than a third. South Africa has promised to cut emissions growth by 2020 and begin reductions by 2030, and Mexico has said it will cut its emissions, measured at 2002 levels, by half by 2050.LiNeBrEaKMany of those countries expressed frustration that richer countries, responsible for the majority of the emissions that have brought on climate change, have offered ambitious cuts for the most part only by 2050, with little firm promise of action in the crucial intervening decades.LiNeBrEaKCanada, Japan and Australia, worried about their economies and waiting to see the level of U.S. commitment, have all dragged their feet at Poznan, activists said.LiNeBrEaKIn a speech at the talks Friday, former Vice President Al Gore called the "synchronized" economic bailouts around the world a good sign that nations can pull together and find the needed resources to face an international crisis if they feel a sufficient threat.LiNeBrEaKBut he warned that time is running short for making the dramatic emissions cuts needed to stem the worst effects of climate change, from rising sea level to increased droughts, floods, heat waves, hurricanes and other forms of severe weather.LiNeBrEaKUN climate scientists have urged industrialized countries to make emissions cuts of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020, from 1990 levels, to minimize the effects of climate change.LiNeBrEaKClimate change will not be resolved with simply "a good try," Gore said. "We will succeed, or we will fail."LiNeBrEaKlgoering@tribune.com	EMISSIONS (91%); TALKS and MEETINGS (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (90%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (78%); EXPORT TRADE (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (78%); DEFORESTATION (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (77%); RECESSION (75%); ECONOMIC NEWS (75%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (75%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (75%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (73%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (72%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (70%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (64%); US PRESIDENTS (69%)  		ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE (56%)  		General  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%) ILLINOIS, USA (90%) EUROPE (92%); UNITED STATES (90%); POLAND (90%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARACK OBAMA (54%)  	20081213-TB-Global-climate-talks-achieve-bare-minimum-1213  	TB

The Dominion Post (Morgantown, West Virginia)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Ebanks now cares about the caroms: Frosh collects 34 boards in past 2 games  	Justin Jackson, The Dominion Post, Morgantown, W.Va.  	SPORTS  	655 words  	Dec. 13--There was a time in his life, Devin Ebanks admits, when he cared just as much about rebounding the basketball as he did about global warming, the stock market and who was appearing on "Meet the Press."LiNeBrEaK"I'll admit I didn't take rebounding seriously until my junior year in high school," Ebanks said. LiNeBrEaKHe was too busy being a 6-foot-9 scoring machine, who could shoot 3-pointers as well as drive to the basket.LiNeBrEaKRebounding? That was for the guys who couldn't score.LiNeBrEaKAt Connecticut's St. Thomas More school, Ebanks averaged just five rebounds per game as a junior, but 23 points per game.LiNeBrEaKHis senior season, Ebanks' rebounding average doubled to 10.LiNeBrEaKWhat made the difference? Well, sometimes it's something simple, like hearing something in passing. To this day, Ebanks can't remember who gave him the inspirational talk, but the words stuck with him nonetheless.LiNeBrEaK"I remember being told that defense wins games, but rebound- ing wins championships," Ebanks said. "That's always stuck with me. After that, I've always tried to be a rebounder."LiNeBrEaKLooking at the WVU freshman's past two games, it's so far, so good. Against Cleveland State and Davidson, Ebanks corralled a total of 34 rebounds -- 17 in each game.LiNeBrEaKImpressive? You don't know the half of it.LiNeBrEaKEbanks became the first WVU freshman ever to grab 17 rebounds in consecutive games, and the first Mountaineer to do it since Maurice Robinson, in 1977.LiNeBrEaKEbanks also recorded double-doubles in those two games, scoring 10 points against Cleveland State and 13 against Davidson. He was the first WVU freshman in 13 years to post a double-double.LiNeBrEaKOh, and if Ebanks were to grab another 17 (or more) rebounds in today's 7 p.m. game, against Duquesne, he would join the eliteest of elite company.LiNeBrEaKThe last WVU player to grab 17 or more rebounds in three consecutive games? Jerry West.LiNeBrEaK"Coach [Bob] Huggins is preaching at us to rebound, rebound, rebound all the time," Ebanks said. "That's what I'm trying to do."LiNeBrEaKTo say Ebanks has suddenly come out of nowhere would be inaccurate. WVU coaches and players felt Ebanks could have this kind of impact from the start of the season.LiNeBrEaKBut Ebanks started out playing tentatively, while trying to fit in with his new teammates. Meanwhile, his new teammates were preaching to him to become more aggressive.LiNeBrEaK"That's what [Joe] Mazzulla, Al [Ruoff] and Da'Sean [Butler] have been talking to me about. They want me to be more aggressive," Ebanks said. "They need me to do anything. I kind of took that to head. I'm just trying to play as hard as I can every night now."LiNeBrEaKThe Mountaineers have followed Ebanks' rebounding lead, with 58 against Davidson, the most since grabbing 58 against Alabama AandM in 1998. WVU also had 29 offensive rebounds, the most since 31 against Rutgers in 2002.LiNeBrEaKStill, Huggins is cautious when it comes to Ebanks' recent rebounding explosions. "Everybody looks for epiphanies, you know? I don't know, if he comes out the next game and gets two rebounds and doesn't score, people are going to wonder what's wrong with the guy.LiNeBrEaK"Now, if he continues to come out and do that through the course of the season, that's different. A year ago at the end of the year, Joe Alexander did it on a continued basis. So you could say he figured it out. [With Devin,] we're talking about two games."LiNeBrEaKInjury updateLiNeBrEaKRuoff (shoulder) had a light shoot-around prior to Friday's practice, while Mazzulla (shoulder) worked out on a treadmill. Huggins said both would be a game time decision, but added it was possible neither would play.

El Paso Times (Texas)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	UTEP exhibit allows look into beauty of polar regions  	Ramon Renteria, El Paso Times, Texas  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	833 words  	Dec. 13--EL PASO -- Most of us will never make it to the ends of the earth.LiNeBrEaKStudents and faculty at the University of Texas at El Paso have been doing recent scientific research in the Arctic region and Antarctica.LiNeBrEaKTheir stories, adventures and research into global climate change are now shared in "To the Ends of the Earth: UTEP at the Poles," an exhibition on display through March 20 at the Centennial Museum at UTEP. LiNeBrEaKThe exhibition features photographs, artifacts and information on what we can do to minimize global warmingLiNeBrEaKand its devastating impact on the environment, animal and plant life in the polar regions.LiNeBrEaKScientists have been sounding the alarm, suggesting that global warming is melting huge ice sheets, such as those in Antarctica, where El Pasoans have visited as researchers or tourists within the past year.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't expect to fall in love with the place, but I did," said Marshall Carter-Tripp, the museum's interim director. "It's like a frozen desert."LiNeBrEaKCarter-Tripp visited Antarctica with an 18-year-old niece almost a year ago, just a few days after a group of UTEP faculty led students on a scientific field trip into the region.LiNeBrEaK"It's an emotional feeling to be so far away from the rest of the world, where there are no native people," sheLiNeBrEaKsaid. "It's the least touched by human activity, and yet we are affecting it by what we do in El Paso."LiNeBrEaKUTEP's research is part of a federally funded program called IPY-ROAM, or International Polar Year Research and Educational Opportunities in Antarctica for Minorities.LiNeBrEaKThe program inspired Sarah Renteria, 21, a senior majoring in environmental science, to start thinking about a career in which she might help educate ordinary people to understand the importance of science and scientific inquiry.LiNeBrEaK"What I gained was a better awareness," she said. "I actually went there and witnessed firsthand the massive amounts of ice and the unique creatures that live there."LiNeBrEaKThe exhibition includes interactive activities for children, a deliberate move by Anne M. Gianguilio, a graphic designer and assistant professor in the UTEP art department who helped assemble the exhibition.LiNeBrEaK"We wanted children to get into it because they are the future," Gianguilio said. "We want people in El Paso to recognize that even though we're in the desert, far from the north and south poles, our actions still have effects in terms of global warming."LiNeBrEaKJohn Subia, an East Side retiree who once worked on the Alaska pipeline, recently checked out the exhibition.LiNeBrEaK"I find this interesting. I didn't even know the university had anything like this," Subia said. "This shows how much this place has grown."LiNeBrEaKEli Greenbaum, an assistant professor in UTEP's department of biological sciences, escorted friends Richard Tobe and Susan Bring Tobe of Buffalo, N.Y., through the exhibition.LiNeBrEaK"This is fantastic," Greenbaum said. "It's a rare opportunity to see a part of the world that few of us will ever get to see."LiNeBrEaKRichard Tobe, an attorney, echoed his wife's sentiments that UTEP's scientific research is impressive.LiNeBrEaK"We're quite surprised at what a first-rate university this is in the middle of the desert and on the Mexican border," Tobe said. "This exhibit is helping with the basic distinction between the Arctic and Antarctic, which so many people get confused, and helping with an understanding of the poles and what's occurring to their environments."LiNeBrEaKTobe summed up what organizers hope El Paso gains from this glimpse into the polar regions.LiNeBrEaK"Hopefully," he said, "these early trips of these young people will be lifelong interest in helping us to understand the planet better."LiNeBrEaKRamon Renteria may be reached at rrenteria@elpasotimes.com; 546-6146.LiNeBrEaKMake plansLiNeBrEaK--What: "To the Ends of the Earth," an exhibition showcasing University of Texas at El Paso's scientific research in the polar regions is on display through March 20.LiNeBrEaK--Where: Centennial Museum, at Wiggins and University.LiNeBrEaK--Hours: 10 a.m.-4: 30 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday.

Fort Worth Star-Telegram (Texas)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Arlington, UTA join effort to encourage more federal funding of green initiatives  	Susan Schrock, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Texas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	476 words  	Dec. 13--ARLINGTON -- Investing in environmental initiatives and projects is good not only for the health of the community but for the health of its economy, too, local leaders said Friday. LiNeBrEaKArlington and the University of Texas at Arlington joined a national campaign encouraging the government to give municipalities money directly for projects that create "green" jobs and reduce greenhouse gases, increase sustainable building practices, explore alternative energy sources and provide greener transportation options.LiNeBrEaKMunicipalities are joining together to encourage President-elect Barack Obama's administration and Congress to increase federal support for such initiatives.LiNeBrEaK"We breathe the same air," UT-Arlington President James Spaniolo said. "We have an extraordinary responsibility to protect that air and that water and the environment in which we live."LiNeBrEaKSpaniolo, Arlington Mayor Robert Cluck and former Arlington Mayor Richard Greene highlighted recent environmental initiatives they said show that local governments are strongly committed to making a difference.LiNeBrEaKAmong them:LiNeBrEaKBoth the college and the city recently conducted a carbon footprint analysis and are working on ways to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKUT-Arlington is building a $100-million-plus Engineering Research Complex that is expected to reach the silver level of LEED certification. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, a building rating system, is the nationally accepted benchmark for green buildings, according to the U.S. Green Building Council.LiNeBrEaKThe city has been working with the Dallas Cowboys to encourage the team to incorporate environmentally friendly practices at its new stadium, such as conserving water and using less energy. The stadium is participating in an Environmental Protection Agency program and will be audited every three years to see whether it is meeting green goals.LiNeBrEaKArlington plans to incorporate several LEED principles during construction of the new Arlington Municipal Airport terminal, although the city does not expect it to be LEED-certified.LiNeBrEaKThe city switched all its traffic signals to LED lights, which use less energy.LiNeBrEaK"Time after time, we can see where local leadership and local initiatives are charting the course for success," said Greene, who is also an administrator for the EPA.LiNeBrEaKThis report includes material from the Star-Telegram archives.LiNeBrEaKSUSAN SCHROCK, 817-548-5475	ENVIRONMENTALISM (92%); GREEN BUILDING (91%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); MAYORS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (89%); STADIUMS and ARENAS (86%); ENGINEERING (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); TRAFFIC SIGNALS (76%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (76%); AIRPORTS (71%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (51%); US PRESIDENTS (75%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)  	UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS (58%); DALLAS COWBOYS (54%)  		Construction  	DALLAS, TX, USA (79%) TEXAS, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARACK OBAMA (57%)  	20081213-FT-Arlington-UTA-join-effort-to-encourage-more-federal-funding-of-green-initiatives-1213  	FT  												
The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Will it happen again?: Author cites ??global weirding?'  	Orlan Love, The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	731 words  	Dec. 13--C EDAR RAPIDS -- Only time will tell if the great flood of 2008 turns out to be a once-in-an-epoch aberration or the harbinger of a trend.LiNeBrEaKIt took an unthinkable chain of weather events to swell the Cedar River to the 31. 12-foot-tall, 1. 6 mile-wide tsunami that swamped Cedar Rapids on June 13.LiNeBrEaKNow those events -- heavy autumn rains followed by near record snowfall and three spring deluges in three weeks -- are eminently thinkable. LiNeBrEaKThe last of those deluges, the June 12 dumping of 5 inches on an already record-shattering flood, spelled the difference between the National Weather Service's predicted 24. 9-foot crest and the epic surge that engulfed 10 square miles of the city.LiNeBrEaKWhile no one can know if and when another epic flood will occur, Iowa climate and weather experts believe massive floods will be more likely in the future.LiNeBrEaK"If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say the likelihood of this type of event is increasing," said Eugene Takle, a professor of atmospheric science and agricultural meteorology at Iowa State University.LiNeBrEaKTakle's Iowa State colleague, meteorology professor Elwynn Taylor, said he be lieves documented increases in Iowa's annual precipitation, coupled with anticipated precipitation increases linked to global warming, greatly increase the likelihood of more frequent and severe flooding.LiNeBrEaKPrecipitation increaseLiNeBrEaKSince 1950, Iowa's annual precipitation has increased byLiNeBrEaK10 percent, which in turn has doubled the amount of water carried by rivers in the state, according to Taylor.LiNeBrEaKState Climatologist Harry Hillaker, who pegs the increase in annual statewide precipitation at 8 percent since 1959, said rainfall increases translate directly into increased storm runoff, which fuels flooding.LiNeBrEaKA 10 percent precipitation increase, roughly 3 more inches per year, makes rivers six times more prone to flooding because it all runs off, rather than soaking in for use by vegetation, according to Taylor.LiNeBrEaKWhat had been considered a 100-year flood -- a flood with a 1 in 100 chance of happening any given year -- is now a 17year flood, Taylor said.LiNeBrEaKIt gets worse, when you factor in global warming, he said. Taylor said the consensus among scientists working on global warming is that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- it has increased by one-third since 1960 and at its present rate of increase will double in 50 years -- will yield an increase of 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the global temperature.LiNeBrEaK"That means air coming to Iowa from the Gulf of Mexico (the source of most of Iowa's precipitation) will hold 17 percent more moisture, which translates into 17 percent moreprecipitation," Taylor said.LiNeBrEaKIf that occurs, what had been considered a 100-year flood will become a 5-year flood by 2058, Taylor said.LiNeBrEaKYardstick changesLiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Geological Survey, which tracks floods and predicts their likelihood based on historical data, has revised its odds for extreme floods after adding information on the 2008 floods to its database.LiNeBrEaKBased on data up to and including 2006 for the Cedar River at Cedar Rapids, the USGS figured a so-called 100year flood had a discharge rate of 85,600 cubic feet per second and that a so-called 500-year flood had a discharge rate of 109,000 cfs. (Interestingly, based on those measurements, Cedar Rapids has never had a 100-year flood before 2006.) But with data from this year and last, the USGS increased those figures to 94,100 cfs for a 100-year flood and 122,000 cfs for a 500-year flood -- increases of 9 percent and 12 percent, respectively.LiNeBrEaKEven though the parameters of 100-year and 500-year floods have increased dramatically, the odds of a recurrence of the June flood -- with its estimated maximum discharge of 140,000 cfs -- remain well more than 1 in 500 in any given year, according to David Eash, a hydrologist with the USGS in Iowa City.LiNeBrEaKThe odds of another flood like the one in June are about 1 in 250 in a given year, according to Witold Krajewski, a water resources engineer at IIHR Hydroscience	WEATHER (91%); METEOROLOGY (90%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); FLOODS and FLOODING (90%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); RIVERS (89%); FLOOD ZONES (78%); TRENDS (77%); NATURAL DISASTERS (73%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (71%); SCIENCE NEWS (71%)  		IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY (82%)  		Science  	IOWA, USA (97%); ATLANTIC OCEAN (79%); GULF OF MEXICO (73%) UNITED STATES (97%); NORTH AMERICA (79%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Gazette   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081213-CR-Will-it-happen-again-1213  	CR  												
Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   ALL S EDITION	EU pushes global warming goals  		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A6  	289 words  	BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The leaders of Europe adopted what they described as a historic pact to combat global warming Friday and challenged President-elect Barack Obama to join in their commitment to drastically reduce greenhouse gases despite the global economic crisis. LiNeBrEaKThe 27 European Union nations also endorsed a $260 billion economic stimulus plan, equivalent to 1. 5 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product, and urged the Obama administration to prepare similarly ambitious measures and financial reforms for coordinated action at a summit of the world's 20 major economic powers scheduled April 2 in London.LiNeBrEaKThe appeals, at a two-day European Union summit in Brussels, reflected widespread expectations among European leaders that Obama and his team will be easier to work with than the Bush administration and that, to a large extent, the president-elect shares their assessment of the need for bold steps to slow global warming and revive economies that have sapped by financial turmoil.LiNeBrEaK"Our message to our global partners is, 'Yes, you can'," said Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the union's executive commission.LiNeBrEaKThe European leaders, particularly President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who holds the union's rotating presidency, committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Europe by 20 percent before 2020 -- and by 30 percent if other countries make comparable pledges at a U.N. environment conference scheduled next year in Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaKTo reach their goals, the leaders pledged that 20 percent of their energy will come from renewable sources by 2020, leading to predictions of windmill farms across the European countryside and carpets of solar panels such as those that were recently installed atop the Vatican in Rome.

"If the world follows the example of the EU, it is on a trajectory to disastrous climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe Brussels summit coincided with the end of a two-week, 190-nation U.N. conference in Poznan that worked on a global climate treaty to be adopted next year in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Monterey County Herald (California)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Xyxyx xyxyx: Former political outsider set to take on Sacramento  	Larry Parsons, The Monterey County Herald, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1311 words  	Dec. 13--Twenty years ago, Bill Monning prepared to give a speech as executive director of an international physicians group against nuclear war. He was introduced as "a Renaissance man of progressive causes."LiNeBrEaKIn his late 30s then, Monning had worked as a lawyer for Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. He had pushed for tougher pesticide safety laws for farmworkers in Monterey County, and he participated in a fast against Reagan administration policies in Central America.LiNeBrEaKPolitics -- primarily politics as an activist outside the corridors of power -- have been essential to Monning since his days as a University of California-Berkeley undergraduate.LiNeBrEaKThis month, Monning moved to the political inside, being sworn in as the new assemblyman for the 27th District, which runs from Big Sur to southern Santa Clara County. LiNeBrEaKThe Sacramento Bee, which called the Carmel Democrat one of five new state legislators to keep a special eye on, noted it took Monning nearly 15 years to achieve his first win for public office.LiNeBrEaK"It's been quite a ride since Dec. 1," Monning said this week, a day after an emergency budget session in Sacramento and a few hours after he spoke at a Monterey conference on global warming.LiNeBrEaKTwice in the early 1990s, after former Central Coast Rep. Leon Panetta set in motion a musical-chair frenzy among local Democrats by quitting his congressional seat, Monning ran for election -- first for Congress in 1993, then for the Assembly in 1994.LiNeBrEaKHe came in second both times, surprising people who admired his energy and his organizational skills, but questioned his politics as being too far left for the times on the Central Coast.LiNeBrEaKAs a succession of Santa Cruz County residents -- Republican Bruce McPherson, then Democrats Fred Keeley and John Laird -- won the 27th District seat, Monning stayed out of electoral races. But he didn't leave politics.LiNeBrEaK"I told people that I was a recovering politician," Monning said, recalling the particularly bruising primary and general election campaigns in 1994.LiNeBrEaKHe continued to work on issues -- toxic waste at Fort Ord, electoral reform, conflict mediation -- and went to work teaching at the Monterey Institute for International Studies and Monterey College of Law. He is on leave now from those jobs. And he had the chance to see his two daughters grow up.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't miss a basketball game," he said during an interview at the East Village Coffee Lounge in Monterey.LiNeBrEaKWearing a black suit and limping slightly from an old high school football injury, Monning, 57, looked much older than the young men and women around the outdoor tables at the coffee shop.LiNeBrEaKBut a youthful exuberance became evident as he talked about former colleagues from California Rural Legal Assistance who are now in the Legislature with him. He smiled as he compared the no-frills tactics used by the youth-oriented campaign of President-elect Barack Obama in the first primaries to the organizing style of the UFW in its early days.LiNeBrEaKHe proudly carried a copy of the first bill bearing his name that he introduced in the Legislature. The measure would allow teachers continuing education options for training in negotiations, conflict resolution and nonviolence.LiNeBrEaK"Look, I got No. 1," he said, noting that his bill was numbered AB1, the first Assembly bill in the new session.LiNeBrEaKMonning was upbeat about his new Sacramento home, a studio apartment across the street from the Capitol. It has a great view of the Capitol rotunda "if I spend some time there," he said.LiNeBrEaKMonning said he'd just hired a chief of staff and was putting together the rest of his staff. He said he is keeping his district offices in Monterey and Santa Cruz in the same locations Laird had his.LiNeBrEaKAnd he said he is fired up about requests he made to Assembly Speaker Karen Bass for committee assignments, which should be announced in the next two weeks. His choices: Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials, Judiciary, Natural Resources and several budget subcommittees.LiNeBrEaKIt's been a whirl, but the 18-month campaign for the Assembly seat prepared him, Monning said. "I put 50,000 miles on my Prius," he said.LiNeBrEaKCertainly, Monning said, the state's looming two-year, $42 billion budget deficit and the sour national economy don't make it the best of times to go to Sacramento.LiNeBrEaK"Anyone would prefer not to have a budget crisis," he said. "It's a tumultuous time to come in."LiNeBrEaKBut he said California is not alone in facing a fiscal crisis, and the challenge is for politicians to bridge the gap between the Sacramento budget battles and the people back home.LiNeBrEaK"It sounds like dry stuff on some levels, but it touches everything we care about," he said, from schools and parks to infrastructure and health care.LiNeBrEaKWith Assembly District 27 carved from parts of three state Senate districts represented by senators from Palo Alto, Merced and Santa Maria, Monning said he is especially aware that he is the lone statehouse representative for the Santa Cruz-Monterey coastline.LiNeBrEaKHe said he wants to work with Assemblywoman Anna Caballero, D-Salinas, a former colleague from California Rural Legal Assistance, to bridge the "east-west" gap between the Peninsula and the Salinas Valley, and the "north-south" gap between Santa Cruz and Watsonville.LiNeBrEaKFor years, Monning worked for Latino farmworkers and for Latin American human rights campaigns. He speaks Spanish fluently and talks about the benefits of building healthful communities.LiNeBrEaKHe said his staff will get together and brainstorm on his legislative program, which will partly be shaped by the desires of communities in the district.LiNeBrEaKMonning said he likely will try again to pass a state park funding plan introduced by Laird, which would have tacked $10 on vehicle license fees.LiNeBrEaKAnd Monning, who supports the idea of a single-payer health plan, said the Obama administration likely will take the lead in health care at the federal level. But he said he still would like to see children's health benefits expanded by the state.LiNeBrEaKHe's also keeping tabs on issues stirring different parts of the district. As he believes Keeley and Laird did, Monning said he wants to be a good representative for the entire district.LiNeBrEaKWith winter rains coming on the heels of a vicious wildfire season, people in Big Sur, the Santa Cruz Mountains and Watsonville areas are worried about slides, Monning said. He said local and state officials are working together on the threat.LiNeBrEaKIf he survives three terms in the Legislature -- as his two predecessors did before hitting term limits -- Monning said he wants California to be "sitting on a balanced budget," with better infrastructure, a reformed school system and a world economic lead in green technology.LiNeBrEaKBut right now, he said his opportunity to represent the Central Coast in the Assembly has "retapped that energy" he felt 15 years ago, when he first tried to move inside the ropes of the political ring.LiNeBrEaKOn the bookshelf Here's what new Assemblyman Bill Monning says he is reading these days: --"Plan B 2. 0" by Lester Brown, on how to combat global warming. --"The Shock Doctrine" by Naomi Klein, an expose of "disaster capitalism." --"The Day of Battle" by Rick Atkinson, the second volume of World War II history about the Battle of Italy and Sicily, 1943-44. --"The Art of Political Murder" by Francisco Goldman, an account of the 1998 murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi, a leading Guatemalan human rights figure.

The New York Times 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   The New York Times on the Web	Emissions Plan for Europe Weakened  	By JAMES KANTER and STEPHEN CASTLE  	Section ; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg.   	624 words  	European Union leaders were on the verge  of presenting a dramatically weakened plan to reduce emissions at the end of their two-day meeting on Friday. LiNeBrEaK  Leaders said the plan, which offers a swathe of concessions to polluting companies and countries, would not jeopardize their overall target of reducing planet-warming emissions by 20 percent by 2020. LiNeBrEaK  ''The suggestion that there has been a watering down of ambition is complete nonsense,'' said Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch.  LiNeBrEaK  Environmental groups, however, said it was the end of European leadership on coping with climate change.  ''A flagship E.U. policy now has no pilot, a mutinous crew and numerous holes in its fuselage,'' said Sanjeev Kumar of the environmental  group WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund. LiNeBrEaK  Parts of the plan represent a significant retreat from plans drawn up in January by the European Commission  to alter Europe's pioneering Emissions Trading Scheme. LiNeBrEaK  Electricity companies, which can charge customers for  permits the companies  receive for free, could earn windfall profits worth tens of billions of dollars over the next decade. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Barroso acknowledged that issue. LiNeBrEaK  ''There is the possibility of windfall profits,'' he said Friday, adding that was ''one of the reasons the commission doesn't like the extension of free allowances.'' LiNeBrEaK  ''But sometimes, to get a consensus, we need to make concessions,'' Mr. Barroso said. LiNeBrEaK  Under the draft plan, some of the dirtiest companies in Europe, like the utilities that operate coal-fired power stations in Eastern European countries including Poland and Hungary, will no longer have to buy all of their pollution allowances starting in 2013 -- as the commission had proposed in January under a draft plan. Instead, those Eastern European utilities will buy just 30 percent of their permits starting in 2013, rising, in principle, to 100 percent in 2020, if the draft is approved. LiNeBrEaK  Eastern European countries would also receive money from a so-called solidarity fund paid for by Western European industries. LiNeBrEaK  Hungary had even raised the prospect during negotiations late Thursday of ditching fundamental parts of the proposal. LiNeBrEaK  ''It does not seem very appropriate at this stage to raise this,'' Mr. Barroso said curtly on Friday, referring to the Hungarian stance. LiNeBrEaK  Even so -- given the financial assistance offered by the European Union to the government in Budapest -- the likelihood that it will seek to block the package is low. LiNeBrEaK  It is not just relatively poor Eastern European countries that have pressured for a retreat. LiNeBrEaK  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has said changes are necessary to ensure job protection at a time when recession looms large over European industry. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy has threatened to veto any deal that was not in the interest of Italy's paper, glass, iron and ceramics sectors. LiNeBrEaK  A lobby group for chemicals sector, Cefic, which includes powerhouses like BASF of Germany, led a particularly forceful campaign for the rules to be relaxed. LiNeBrEaK  Along with companies that run factories in heavy industry sectors -- like operators of steel plants and chemical factories in Germany -- the chemicals sector has won guarantees of special treatment. Those sectors would receive free emissions permits if they can show their costs are increasing and that they are significantly exposed to international competition. LiNeBrEaK  Parts of manufacturing industry that are not exposed to international competition will have to pay for 20 percent of their permits beginning in 2013. And rather than paying for 100 percent of their permits by 2020, they would pay for only 70 percent under the draft.

The New York Times 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	Mr. Obama's Green Team  		Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 20  	528 words  	The League of Conservation Voters, starved for good news after eight years of the Bush administration's environmental policies, has hailed President-elect Barack Obama's choices for his top energy and environmental jobs as ''a Green Dream Team.'' Let's hope it is.  LiNeBrEaK  There is no question what this team must do -- mount a strong offensive on climate change, fashion a more efficient energy system, seek out and invest in next-generation, transformative technologies. These are extraordinarily difficult tasks that will face resistance from industry and many in Congress. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama's advisers fortunately seem united in their concern for the threats facing the planet and unafraid to use the pricing power of the market or the financial power of government to address them. LiNeBrEaK  This effort will also need the full and very public support of the president. So we are heartened by Mr. Obama's decision to name a senior White House adviser to coordinate energy and environmental policy. His choice, Carol Browner, ran President Bill Clinton's Environmental Protection Agency and did not shy from bureaucratic combat. She toughened air quality standards despite opposition from Mr. Clinton's economic advisers.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama's most intriguing selection may be his choice to run the Energy Department. Steven Chu is a physicist who shared a Nobel Prize in 1997 and the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He has a sophisticated grasp of the complexities of global warming and a strong belief in fighting it aggressively. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Chu also has refreshingly unconventional  ideas of what it would take to solve the problem. Like others, he  would  put a price on carbon, preferably through a cap-and-trade program, and supports the  various efficiency measures -- cleaner cars, greener buildings and a modernized electrical grid -- that Mr. Obama is likely to include as part of his economic stimulus package.LiNeBrEaK  What sets him apart is his  fierce  conviction that innovation is just as important as regulation, and that big energy problems, like climate change and the world's dependency on fossil fuels, will not be solved without major private and public investment in the development and deployment of nonpolluting technologies.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama appears to have chosen well for other essential posts, naming Lisa Jackson, until recently New Jersey's top environmental officer, to run the Environmental Protection Agency, and Nancy Sutley, who holds the top environmental post in Los Angeles, to head the White House Council on Environmental Policy. LiNeBrEaK  These are not the passive factotums who have occupied these jobs for most of the Bush years. Both believe in using and strengthening the government's statutory authority to control greenhouse gases and the ground-level pollutants that cause smog and acid rain.LiNeBrEaK  Admirable appointments would mean little unless Mr. Obama forces these issues to the top of his agenda. Ms. Browner can work from dawn to dusk gathering good ideas, selling them to the cabinet and sending them to Capitol Hill in persuasive legislative packages. But as we've learned in the last eight years, nothing happens unless the president wants it to.

The New York Times 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   Late Edition - Final	Amid a Hopeful Mood, U.N. Talks Set Countries on Path Toward a Global Climate Treaty  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 7  	996 words  	The United Nations climate talks concluded here early Saturday, having seemingly achieved their modest goals and then some: setting the world on the track to a new global climate treaty with a renewed sense of purpose and momentum. LiNeBrEaK  The final documents produced at the conference contained a few groundbreaking elements, most notably giving nations credit for saving forests and opening up a long-planned fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change. However, many countries complained bitterly that the fund did not provide adequate financing.LiNeBrEaK  Perhaps contributing most to the hopeful mood were signs from high-level United States officials that the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama would be ready to hit the ground running with a new United States climate policy. LiNeBrEaK  ''This is a challenge of leadership, and we have an enormous obligation to meet it,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who will be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and who has been here for past two days meeting with officials from various countries, including China and Australia.LiNeBrEaK  The new administration and the Congress ''are all on the same page,'' he said. ''The U.S. has to act, we must lead and we need to have mandatory emissions targets.'' LiNeBrEaK  The United States would need to have its climate negotiation team in place by late January or early February, Mr. Kerry said, so that it could be ''confident'' of shaping the next treaty negotiating session, scheduled for March in Bonn, Germany. Nations are aiming to have a treaty finished at a final negotiating session in Copenhagen in December 2009.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama has said he wants to return to 1990 greenhouse-gas emissions levels by 2020, but Mr. Kerry said he personally felt the cuts should be deeper. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said nations would need to reduce emissions 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 in order to avert the serious and potentially disastrous consequences of climate change.LiNeBrEaK  The struggles the European Union has had in passing its own climate and energy package, which was announced on Friday after rancorous negotiations in Brussels, showed how difficult it can be to get businesses to cut emissions or invest in clean technology against the backdrop of a global recession. LiNeBrEaK  Environmental groups like Greenpeace said the European Union package ''watered down'' an ambitious program by giving too many carbon credits for free, allowing some industries broad exceptions to the emissions limits and giving countries too much leeway to offset pollution at home by investing in green projects overseas. LiNeBrEaK  ''Just at the time that the U.S. is finally re-engaging with the international community on climate, it looks like the E.U.'s leadership is dropping away,'' said Joris den Blanken, the European climate and energy director for Greenpeace.LiNeBrEaK  Still, many here took heart that the European Union package did not backslide on previously announced commitments to reduce emissions by 2020 to 20 percent below 1990 levels. Indeed, they said the fights in Brussels demonstrated the flexibility of a so-called cap and trade system and were a preview of struggles to come in the United States. Under such a system, which is planned by the new administration, limits are placed on emissions by companies or industries; and if those limits are exceeded, carbon credits must be purchased from others who have not reached their limit.LiNeBrEaK  ''The most important thing is that they were not revisiting their targets,'' said Elliot Diringer, vice president of international strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.LiNeBrEaK  Indeed, the combination of a progress here, a new European Union package and the change of administrations in Washington left many delegates and environmental advocates here echoing the words of the Bellona Foundation, the largest environment group in Norway: ''Now the ball is rolling.''LiNeBrEaK  ''The expectations for this meeting weren't high, but there have been good developments and the E.U. package makes me happy,'' said Frederic Hauge, chief of Bellona, noting that the package contains billions of dollars for developing new clean technology. Still, some environmental groups left Poznan unsatisfied. ''Over all we are disappointed,'' said Savio Carvalho, of Oxfam Uganda, noting that developed nations seemed too consumed with their own financial troubles to provide genuine assistance to poorer countries.LiNeBrEaK  The conference mostly set out to define the final outlines of a treaty that will be negotiated over the next year, and in that regard ''the meeting got done what was needed,'' Mr. Diringer said.LiNeBrEaK  At the same time, battle lines were drawn for the coming year. Under the previous treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized nations had to commit to emissions reduction targets, while developing nations did not. The United States never ratified the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaK  That formula may no longer be acceptable, Mr. Kerry suggested, since some developing nations now contribute heavily to global greenhouse-gas emissions. China and India are the world's No. 1 and No. 3 emitters, respectively. The United States is No. 2.LiNeBrEaK  While Mr. Kerry said that no one expected China to accept the same kind of emissions commitment as industrialized countries, ''they will have to have some kind of target or we will not be able to ratify the agreement.''LiNeBrEaK  Another point of contention was control of a fund that had been created to help poor countries respond to climate change. The European Union initially proposed that an outside group like the World Bank do the job. But that angered many poor countries, and the proposal was dropped. LiNeBrEaK  ''We need something simple and responsive that developing countries control,'' said Masao Nakayama, the ambassador of the Federated States of Micronesia to the United Nations. ''There's a fire, and it's like they're arguing about whether to use a plastic bucket or a metal bucket or a hose.''

The News-Times (Danbury, Connecticut)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Area lawmakers appointed to key positions  	Dirk Perrefort, The News-Times, Danbury, Conn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	471 words  	Dec. 13--DANBURY -- Several state and federal lawmakers from the area were appointed to key political positions this week.LiNeBrEaKIncoming state House Speaker Chris Donovan, D-Meriden, appointed Rep. Jason Bartlett, D-Bethel, vice chairman of the legislature's Appropriations Committee, which has authority over all matters related to the state budget. LiNeBrEaK"The assignment that I've been given by Rep. Donovan is an important one, especially in light of the economic crisis that is not only affecting the state but also the entire country," Bartlett said.LiNeBrEaKMayor Mark Boughton congratulated Bartlett on the appointment, but noted the role of the committee has been somewhat muted in recent years.LiNeBrEaK"There has been a history of governors who have ignored the committee and created their own budget," he said. "Where it (being on the committee) is valuable is in the run-up to budget discussions.LiNeBrEaK"While the committee won't create the actual budget, they will be able to vet through the governor's budget and identify any issues or needs for local communities like Danbury. Bartlett has a huge task in front of him."LiNeBrEaKBougthon also congratulated U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy, D-5th District, for his recent appointment to the congressional Energy and Commerce Committee. Boughton said the appointment could help as local towns continue negotiations with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over issues relating to Candlewood Lake.LiNeBrEaK"It's good to have someone on the committee who has the ear of the decision-makers," Boughton said, adding that the appointment could also help local alternative energy companies.

Park Record (Park City, Utah)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	No rocking chairs needed for Elderhostel participants: Utah Valley University organizes ski clinics for travelers over 55  	Andrew Kirk, Park Record, Park City, Utah  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	663 words  	Dec. 13--Why let young people have all the fun? That's what Marty Knowlton wondered after a four-year walking tour of Europe seeing all the wonderful youth hostels there. In 1975, he and a partner started Elderhostel, a national and international traveling and learning program for people over age 55.LiNeBrEaKElderhostel was in Park City this week with a group sponsored by Utah Valley University (UVU). The group skied, saw "The Music Man" and heard lectures on climate from UVU professors all at an affordable rate with people their own age. LiNeBrEaKThe average participant only pays about $1,400 for 6 nights, 17 meals, skiing, lectures and other activities. Gary Nielsen, the UVU program director, estimated that the 10 winter ski sessions and 8 summer sessions generate about $16 million for the Park City economy.LiNeBrEaKSally Menesee, office manager for UVU community education in the School of Continuing Education, said its Elderhostel programs bring people from all over to appreciate this state.LiNeBrEaKDiana Hunter, senior director of Continuing Education said the school is able to expose participants to places and stories in Utah that many residents are unaware of.LiNeBrEaKTim Walus, a participant from Syracuse, New York, said he loved rubbing shoulders with people from all over the country and Canada.LiNeBrEaK"Friends talked us into it and I figured it was a good time to come and see what's going on. It's my first time in Elderhostel and it's been excellent," he said.LiNeBrEaKGary Nielsen, program director for UVU, saidLiNeBrEaKElderhostel started out working with universities to offer older people a fun college experience for a week. It has evolved into one of the largest older-adult travel programs in the world.LiNeBrEaKIt hasn't forgotten its beginnings on campuses. Program directors are supposed to arrange for instructors and academics to hold clinics and lectures during the week. The 10 sessions held at Park City Mountain Resort per year offer ski instruction for participants and Nielsen arranged for UVU professors to give evening presentations on global climate change and weather forecasting.LiNeBrEaKBecause Elderhostel is a nonprofit organization, it's able to keep prices affordable, he said.LiNeBrEaKRomana Fedasiuk from New Jersey said this was her second Elderhostel trip and said the Park City experience was fabulous.LiNeBrEaK"The programs they have for us are extremely interesting," she said. "This group of people are all friendly, outgoing and the same age. I'm hooked."LiNeBrEaKNielsen said the ski groups are the most popular, but during the summer there 8 sessions in Park City that are open to children and grandchildren. UVU also organizes a state-wide tour of Utah, a golfing session, an aviation session and new this year: A Sundance Film Festival session.LiNeBrEaKThe Sundance session will be less organized than the others, allowing participants to buy their own tickets to films they'd like to see, he said. But he hopes to get festival organizers and film experts to present to the group.LiNeBrEaKNielsen said one of peoples' favorite things about Elderhostel is that the costs are so well accounted for that participants almost don't need to bring any money with them.LiNeBrEaKHis only regret about the Utah program, he joked, is that he can't get his own mother to participate. When she learned more about Elderhostel, she wanted to fly away to sessions in Washington, D.C., or the Lewis and Clark Trail.LiNeBrEaKParticipants must sign up through the Elderhostel headquarters in Boston. The website is www.elderhostel.org and the telephone number is 1-877-426-8056.LiNeBrEaKTo learn more about Elderhostel, visit www.elderhostel.com or call 1-877-426-8056.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   SOONER EDITION	Nations on track for new climate pact;  Rich, poor countries spar over fairness of emission cuts 	Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  	WORLD; Pg. A-4  	490 words  	POZNAN, Poland -- With developing countries offering more emission cuts than anticipated and richer nations in many cases offering fewer, global climate negotiators yesterday wrapped up lackluster talks that U.N. officials said nonetheless kept the world on the path toward a new treaty by next December. LiNeBrEaKIn the final day of talks, negotiators agreed on principles of financing for a fund to help the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations cope with the effects of climate change. Earlier, they approved a mechanism to incorporate forest protection into efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKBut basic questions over an equitable balance of emissions cuts between richer and poorer nations for the most part remained unresolved, particularly because many richer nations balked at making firm or ambitious promises to cut emissions in the coming decade.LiNeBrEaK"We got the bare minimum of what we needed from the talks," said Jennifer Haverkamp, international climate policy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. Coming out of Poznan, "there's a lot to do and less than a year to do it."LiNeBrEaKNegotiations have been hampered by growing worries in Europe, long the world leader in pushing a climate deal, about the costs of cutting emissions as its industries come under pressure during a spreading global recession.LiNeBrEaKDespite those worries, however, Europe managed to sign its own climate agreement yesterday, committing the region to a 20 percent cut in emissions by 2020 as well as a doubling of use of renewable energy and a 20 percent boost in energy efficiency over the same period.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's promise to make combating climate change a priority for his administration has produced as much frustration as enthusiasm at Poznan, simply because his negotiators are not yet at the table, which has led other countries to delay decisions on cuts until seeing a new U.S. proposal.LiNeBrEaKNegotiators "want to be sure they're not committing their economies and populations to some kind of quixotic emissions reductions regime which costs them much more than their neighbors and exports competitors," said Henry Derwent, president of the International Emissions Trading Association and a former British climate negotiator.LiNeBrEaKOne of the brightest spots of the talks was a series of vows by major developing countries to cut their own greenhouse gases, in recognition of the global scope of the problem and in line with promises made at talks last December in Bali.LiNeBrEaKBrazil announced a new commitment to cut deforestation by 70 percent by 2017, a move that would effectively cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions by more than a third. South Africa has promised to cut emissions growth by 2020 and begin reductions by 2030, and Mexico has said it will cut its emissions, measured at 2002 levels, by half by 2050.LiNeBrEaKMany of those countries expressed frustration that richer countries have offered ambitious cuts for the most part only by 2050.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   Final Edition; All Editions	Feeling blue? Blame Cleveland's gray skies  	Michael Scott, Plain Dealer Reporter  	METRO; Pg. B5  	495 words  	You think it has been a dismal December so far?LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, you're right.LiNeBrEaKSix out of the first 12 days of December in Cloudy Cleveland have been sans sun - so there's a pretty good reason you're so glum. LiNeBrEaKThat's right, for more than half the days during this murky month, not one depression-breaking, body-warming photon of light fell on Northeast Ohio.LiNeBrEaK"The meter here says zero - another dark day," said Marty Thompson, a hydro-meteorological technician, after checking an electronic weather instrument scientists call a "Sunshine Meter" on the roof of the National Weather Service station Thursday at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.LiNeBrEaKMaybe it's not surprising, considering that the days will continue getting shorter through Dec. 21, the first official day of winter. But if you're not down in the dumps yet, consider this gloomy fact:LiNeBrEaKIf you live in Northeast Ohio, there's a nearly 60 percent chance each December day that you will get less than an hour of sunshine. The most wonderful time of the year for the holidays, sure - but not for sunny days.LiNeBrEaKAnd this year appears to have been worse than usual - with about half the average sunshine reaching our dark city. Global warming, indeed.LiNeBrEaKAnd the darkest day is dead ahead: Dec. 31 - a date to go back to bed.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the last 30 years of weather service records (the watchers of the skies mercifully stopped counting clouds after 1996), there's a 58 percent chance of no sun on the last day of any given year in Cleveland.LiNeBrEaKThe next two worst days are also usually in December - the 6th (56 percent chance of no sun) and the 12th (53 percent).LiNeBrEaK"That's why everybody goes south in winter for suntans and light," said meteorologist Walter Fitzgerald. "Cleveland is all about the clouds this time of year."LiNeBrEaK(In his defense, Fitzgerald did say he prefers Cleveland to Detroit, however, where "the sun disappears in October and comes back in April.")LiNeBrEaKSome pale-faced, light-deprived Clevelanders, however, seek answers closer to home - finding warmth and luminosity in local tanning beds.LiNeBrEaK"The people we get this time of year want to warm up and see a bright light," said Ed Staskus of Electric Beach, which has three West Side locations. "Let's face it. It's dark here this time of year. Cleveland is dark."LiNeBrEaKTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter: mscott@plaind.com, 216-999-4148LiNeBrEaKCloudy in ClevelandLiNeBrEaKIt's almost staggering how many ways we can demonstrate our dismal early winter status, but the bottom line is this: It's been cloudy all month so far, it's going to remain cloudy through the winter, and a coming spring (as usual) is our only hope.LiNeBrEaKDecember January February Average hours of sunshine per dayLiNeBrEaKChance of no sunshine each dayLiNeBrEaK41% 31% 20% Chance of less than an hour of sunshineLiNeBrEaKAnnually, Cleveland averages 202 cloudy days a year, which, amazingly, ranks us only 21st in the nation.LiNeBrEaKThe following fields overflowed:LiNeBrEaKSOURCE = SOURCES: National Climatic Data Center, National Weather Service	METEOROLOGY (89%); WEATHER (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (75%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (75%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); AIRPORTS (54%)  					CLEVELAND, OH, USA (92%) OHIO, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 16, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   Metro Edition	'EARTH' FALLS SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL  	By Chris Gladden Special to The Roanoke Times  	EXTRA; Pg. 1  	457 words  	"The Day the Earth Stood Still" could easily be retitled "Tree Huggers From Outer Space."LiNeBrEaKThe 1951 Robert Wise original came along at the dawn of the Cold War, the emerging nuclear age and the Korean War. The space aliens in that sci-fi classic feared human aggression might spread to other galaxies. LiNeBrEaKThis time around, they're here to wipe out environmental transgressions even if it means wiping out the human race in the process. Unfortunately for audiences, this remake isn't as gripping or as thoughtful as the original despite its good intentions.LiNeBrEaKThere are infallible movie rules: People threatened by homicidal maniacs always split up; cars don't work when you most need them to; and there's a trigger-happy idiot in every crowd.LiNeBrEaKThe last comes into play here. A giant, glowing sphere descends on Manhattan. Its inhabitant disembarks to shake hands with a pretty astrobiologist and is shot for his troubles. Keanu Reeves plays Klaatu, the space man who assumes human form. Jennifer Connelly plays Helen Benson, the scientist.LiNeBrEaKReeves got his movies mixed up. He gives a performance more appropriate to "Night of the Living Dead." He acts more like someone on the brink of a migraine than a being from a superior civilization. Connelly, on the other hand, acts her little heart out like she always does. The girl's got game.LiNeBrEaKTo Klaatu's credit, he brings along his trusty robot, Gort, who has a death ray where his eyes should be. The American military feels it can battle a giant robot that descends from a craft that's traveled at warp speed with tanks. Gort eats this stuff for breakfast.LiNeBrEaKDuring his hospital stay, Klaatu strikes up a friendship with Helen, who is the only person who feels any sympathy toward him. Everybody else, including Kathy Bates as the secretary of defense, wants to pull an Abu Ghraib on the visitor.LiNeBrEaKKlaatu only wants to tell the world to clean up its act, but the U.S. sends him on the run along with Helen and her stepson. The lad's a disagreeable little cuss played by Jaden Smith. You have sympathy for him because his father was killed in the war in Iraq. But still, he needs a timeout.LiNeBrEaKDirector Scott Derrickson provides some fun action sequences, particularly with Gort. But he doesn't achieve a pervasive sense of impending doom and the kind of dramatic tension that goes with it. The movie presents a culture gap -- part 1950s shoot-to-kill sci-fi convention, part contemporary sensibility and techno-babble. Whatever happened to the kind, wide-eyed wonder when earthlings greeted space men in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"?LiNeBrEaKWill Klaatu learn to love mankind and give the earth a chance at an amped-up Kyoto Protocol? Or will he pull the trigger? If he took a lesson from his hosts, you know what he'd do.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   Metro Edition	WHY NATURE MATTERS  	Liza Field fieldnotes@wiredog.com  	EXTRA; Field Notes; Pg. 1  	816 words  	The Universe and the Earth have a creative power and a vision. ... Our problem is that because humans have assumed that anything nonhuman is of lesser value, we have created a governance that only benefits us, rather than the larger community of life.LiNeBrEaK-- Father Thomas Berry, The Dream of the Earth LiNeBrEaKDoes matter "matter"?LiNeBrEaKI wondered that in my last column, discussing the endurance of dreams, how they outlast the people and generations who carry them.LiNeBrEaKIf a dream outlasts any particular lifetime, does it "matter" what we do to the Earth -- whether we eradicate thousands of species, dry up rivers, deplete oceans of their life?LiNeBrEaKIf "the dream of the Earth" is divine anyhow, what does it matter if we create drought and famine through deforestation? If it's all God's divine vision, can't God just whip up some rain? Make more species?LiNeBrEaKMy Christian tradition expects "a new Heaven and a new Earth." So why not continue wrecking the old versions, since we don't expect to be here much longer but, instead, raptured away, leaving our mess for the "left-behind" folks to fix?LiNeBrEaKAs a listener to "Victory FM" Christian radio, I sometimes hear this viewpoint. Recently, the station has replayed sermons by the late Jerry Falwell which explain that God doesn't care about global warming, that we ourselves can do nothing about it and are (being saved ourselves) not to worry about saving the Earth.LiNeBrEaK"For what will it profit us if we save the whole world and lose our souls?" asked a station ad aired last year, adjusting the words of Jesus to fit the case against greenhouse gas regulation.LiNeBrEaKChuck Colson, former chief counsel to President Richard Nixon, on his radio show "Break Point," likewise encourages us Christians to avoid "environmentalism," a cult -- he says -- that encourages "human sacrifice to the Earth goddess, Gaia."LiNeBrEaKLast year, Christian broadcaster John Hagee exhorted his listeners that we could blame high gasoline prices on the "eco-terrorists" who opposed oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.LiNeBrEaKWhether oil drilling is a Christian value higher than wilderness or endangered species is unclear, because Jesus didn't discuss mass extinction or fossil fuel supplies.LiNeBrEaKCatholic educator Sister Clare McBrien of Wythe County pointed out to me that "the Bible promotes wilderness and never mentions oil rigs."LiNeBrEaKSo where do these nature-doesn't-matter messages come from?LiNeBrEaKJournalists Bill Moyers and Dan Gilgoff, along with conservative authors Kevin Phillips and David Kuo, have indicated in their features, books and articles that special interests have influenced some (not all) Christian broadcasters in the process of political coalition-building.LiNeBrEaK"The sad part of this is that so much of it is legal," Moyers noted of work by Ralph Reed and lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who used Christian groups and broadcasters to promote various interests of their private clients.LiNeBrEaKReed, former head of the Christian Coalition, had left that post in 1997 to start a consulting firm whose big energy, auto, communications and gaming industry clients have benefited from his retained connections to Christian groups and broadcasters.LiNeBrEaK"Legal" as it may be, positing opposition to environmental protection as "biblical" is something many evangelicals, mainline Protestants and Catholics are now questioning.LiNeBrEaKTheologian Tony Campolo, whose colleagues have agreeably dubbed him "an evangelist out to save the whales," maintains that every creature was created to praise God in its own way -- not just humans. He reasons that even "the doxology" declares, "Praise Him all creatures here below." To eradicate God's diverse species is to mute God's praise.LiNeBrEaKCampolo also wonders what sense it makes for Christian aid groups to dump dry boxes of food in African villages -- where famine is caused by drought, climate change and deforestation -- while refusing to address and heal the environmental roots of this suffering.LiNeBrEaKRichard Cizik of the National Association of Evangelicals makes the point that any anti-abortion agenda needs to consider life beyond nine months, and include the outer ecology that both natal and postnatal life depend upon.LiNeBrEaKRichard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention has written, "I am more firmly convinced than ever that we face an ecological crisis, and that God holds us accountable for our stewardship of the creation."LiNeBrEaKTrappist monk Thomas Merton clarified the notion of Christian detachment from the world.LiNeBrEaK"To reject the 'world' is not to reject people, society or the creatures of God, but to reject the perverted standards which make men misuse and spoil a good creation, ruining their own lives into the bargain."LiNeBrEaKHere in Advent, I meanwhile wonder, aren't we focusing on the "incarnation"-- God infusing matter and us, rather than exiled away-off in a remote, ethereal heaven?LiNeBrEaKFather Thomas Berry thinks so: "If there is no spirituality in the earth, there is no spirituality in ourselves."

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Calif. agency orders heavy-duty diesel trucks to have soot traps on exhaust pipes  	By Chris Bowman, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	836 words  	SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California is snuffing out the last of the old stogies on the road.LiNeBrEaKAgainst the backdrop of recession, the state's smog-fighting Air Resources Board on Friday ordered owners of all heavy-duty diesel trucks to install soot traps on exhaust pipes of older, high-polluting rigs or take them off the road, starting in 2011.LiNeBrEaKThe 8-0 decision, together with a strategy adopted Thursday for slashing global warming emissions from all tailpipes and industry exhaust vents amount to most sweeping and costly measures in the state's 40-year history of air pollution control. LiNeBrEaKUnlike the climate-change restrictions, the diesel rules will have more immediate and palpable effects on the economy of California and the health of its 38 million residents.LiNeBrEaKAir Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols called the regulations a "giant step forward" in the state's long fight against unhealthy air. But she also acknowledged the financial burden of compliance, particularly for independent single-vehicle haulers.LiNeBrEaK"We worked very hard on these regulations to make sure we give enough time and flexibility for the smallest of operators to comply, Nichols said in a media briefing following the vote. "But the bottom line is that this is an industry that has an enormous health impact on the people of this state."LiNeBrEaKUnder the rules, the stink and smudge of diesel that fouled California's skies for more than 60 years will be virtually gone by 2023, when the rules take full effect. The vast majority of trucks will be running with 95 percent cleaner engines by 2017.LiNeBrEaKPublic health advocates celebrated the decision.LiNeBrEaK"The board just saved over 9,000 lives," said an excited Bonnie Holmes-Gen, a lobbyist for American Lung Association of California, referring to the state's estimate of deaths the diesel regulations would prevent from 2011 to 2025.LiNeBrEaKNichols has called diesel pollution a "silent killer" because the ultra-fine, windblown specks in fresh diesel exhaust can penetrate more deeply into lungs than ordinary dust and even enter the bloodstream, triggering death among people with cardiovascular troubles.LiNeBrEaKBut many in the trucking, construction and grocery industries said the costly rules couldn't come at a worse time.LiNeBrEaKThey said the recession coupled with the impending diesel restrictions already has devalued older trucks to the point that banks won't accept them as collateral. As a result, many trucks owners said they can't qualify for loans to buy more modern cleaner trucks or even the soot traps, which can cost upwards of upwards of $10,000.LiNeBrEaK"Residential construction is down 70 percent. Commercial construction is down 40 percent. Now you're asking truckers to take on debt," said Bruce Wick, spokesman for the California Professional Association of Specialty Contractors.LiNeBrEaKMany truckers said the rules would force them out of business.LiNeBrEaKIn response, air board members gave truck owners an extra year before the rules would take effect and allowed them to delay a year on bringing a truck into compliance for every dirty one they retire.LiNeBrEaK"There's no bigger health risk than losing one's job," said Dr. John Telles, a board member and physician. "The reason to do this is to improve the health of Californians, not to make it worse."LiNeBrEaKFriday's vote followed more than 15 hours of testimony from truckers hauling everything from gravel to bee colonies and dozens who suffer asthma, including high school students from the California cities of Oakland and Fremont who live and play near heavily traveled freeways.LiNeBrEaKNearly 300 people spoke during the two-day hearing at the air board's headquarters in downtown Sacramento. That is the highest participation of any hearing in the agency's history, Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKThe big-rig trucks, large delivery trucks and airport shuttle buses are the last of the diesel-powered vehicles and equipment to come under the soot-cutting knife of the air board, following similar rules for garbage trucks, municipal buses and off-road construction and farming vehicles and equipment.LiNeBrEaKBut the number of these heavy-duty vehicles, along with their heavy weight, high mileage and longevity, makes them the single-largest source of toxic air pollution in California, air board officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations will dramatically cut emissions of tiny diesel exhaust particles and smog-forming nitrogen oxides from more than 400,000 diesel vehicles registered in the state and another 500,000 out-of-state trucks that pass through California each year.LiNeBrEaKIn 1998, the board declared the particles in diesel exhaust a "toxic air contaminant" because of their potential to cause cancer and premature heart- and lung-related deaths in adults.LiNeBrEaKVisit The Sacramento Bee online at http://www.sacbee.com/	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); SMOG (90%); RECESSION (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); AIR POLLUTION (90%); AIR QUALITY (90%); TRUCK DRIVERS (89%); CONSTRUCTION (84%); LOBBYING (78%); DIESEL FUEL (77%); CONSTRUCTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); CLIMATE CHANGE (71%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (69%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (60%); BUSINESS and PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS (77%)  					SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (93%) CALIFORNIA, USA (99%) UNITED STATES (99%)  	December 14, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Sacramento Bee   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  		20081213-BC-ENV-DIESEL-EMISSIONS  	SA  	SACRAMENTO, Calif.

Now you're asking truckers to take on debt," said Bruce Wick, spokesman for the California Professional Association of Specialty Contractors.LiNeBrEaKMany truckers said the rules would force them out of business.LiNeBrEaKIn response, air board members gave truck owners an extra year before the rules would take effect and allowed them to delay a year on bringing a truck into compliance for every dirty one they retire.LiNeBrEaK"There's no bigger health risk than losing one's job," said Dr. John Telles, a board member and physician. "The reason to do this is to improve the health of Californians, not to make it worse."LiNeBrEaKFriday's vote followed more than 15 hours of testimony from truckers hauling everything from gravel to bee colonies and dozens who suffer asthma, including high school students from Oakland and Fremont who live and play near heavily traveled freeways.LiNeBrEaKNearly 300 people spoke during the two-day hearing at the air board's headquarters in downtown Sacramento. That is the highest participation of any hearing in the agency's history, Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKThe big-rig trucks, large delivery trucks and airport shuttle buses are the last of the diesel-powered vehicles and equipment to come under the soot-cutting knife of the air board, following similar rules for garbage trucks, municipal buses and off-road construction and farming vehicles and equipment.LiNeBrEaKBut the number of these heavy-duty vehicles, along with their heavy weight, high mileage and longevity, makes them the single largest source of toxic air pollution in California, air board officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations will dramatically cut emissions of tiny diesel exhaust particles and smog-forming nitrogen oxides from more than 400,000 diesel vehicles registered in the state and another 500,000 out-of-state trucks that pass through California each year.LiNeBrEaKIn 1998, the board declared the particles in diesel exhaust a "toxic air contaminant" because of their potential to cause cancer and premature heart- and lung-related deaths in adults.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Chris Bowman, (916) 321-1069.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Air board OKs nation's toughest diesel rules;  Truckers, schools fear economic toll 	Michael Gardner, U-T SACRAMENTO BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1125 words  	SACRAMENTO -- Angelo Logan says he has watched too many of his Los Angeles-area neighbors suffer from respiratory problems he blames on breathing truck-diesel soot.LiNeBrEaK"They talk about the value of jobs," Logan said as the California Air Resources Board yesterday heard hours of testimony on proposed regulations to curb diesel emissions. "What about the value of life?"LiNeBrEaKIn the end, the regulators came down on Logan's side, unanimously adopting the nation's toughest standards to gradually clear the skies of soot, despite fears that it will drive many truckers out of business. LiNeBrEaKIt was another clean-air milestone for California. On Thursday, the air board passed the nation's most comprehensive plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's a tough rule in tough economic times. But there will be tremendous societal savings with regard to public health benefits," said board member John Balms, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKDespite the unanimous vote, regulators struggled with the new truck rules, particularly because compliance will cost the industry an estimated $5. 5 billion by 2023.LiNeBrEaKBoard member Ron Roberts, a San Diego County supervisor, could have been the lone "no" vote, but he had to leave early.LiNeBrEaK"It's all being presented as somehow we can roll right through this," Roberts said during the meeting, addressing the financial effects. "I do want a rule, but I don't think we're there."LiNeBrEaKRegulators did approve concessions, including awarding a credit for every truck taken off the road or retrofitted with a soot-trapping device. The credit can be used to receive a one-year delay in bringing another truck into compliance.LiNeBrEaKBoard members also extended the compliance deadline for small-fleet owners by a year, to 2014, and pledged to revisit the regulations next year and perhaps make modifications depending on the economy.LiNeBrEaKTrucking industry representatives were not appeased.LiNeBrEaK"It is frustrating and saddening that at a time when we are bailing out Wall Street, those of us on Main Street are being hurt by overly burdensome government regulations like this one," said Robert Ramorino, president of the California Trucking Association.LiNeBrEaKThe air board may not have the final say.LiNeBrEaKRepublican lawmakers are demanding a delay in the rules as part of their economic stimulus program, which they want to see passed in exchange for votes to break the state budget deadlock to address a massive deficit. Democrats and Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger have resisted major environmental concessions, however.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this week, Schwarzenegger signaled that he opposes legislative intervention in overturning major environmental initiatives. "We talk about all the different things that the Republicans are proposing," he said. "The only thing we don't have in there are some of the environmental issues they want to address."LiNeBrEaKAir board Chairwoman Mary Nichols said she came under no pressure from the Legislature.LiNeBrEaKRegulators adopted the new standards after more than 13 hours of passionate testimony from about 250 drivers, parents, doctors, truckers, loggers and executives over two days.LiNeBrEaKDozens of truckers warned the board of the potential fallout, from shuttered delivery companies to price increases for shipped goods such as produce, clothes and electronics. Hard economic times make it even more difficult to afford $15,000 soot filters or new $100,000 rigs, they said. Credit is just too hard to come by, the truckers said, adding that their strapped customers cannot afford increases that would have to be passed along.LiNeBrEaK"We all get hammered," said Jim Ganduglia, operations manager of a freight firm in Fresno.LiNeBrEaKValley Center beekeeper Greg Pile told the board he might as well scrap his small fleet. "By a stroke of a pen, my assets, my trucks, turn toxic. I can't sell them," said Pile, of Chaparral Honey Inc.LiNeBrEaKClean-air advocates were just as adamant.LiNeBrEaK"The scientific literature is overflowing with studies documenting harm from diesel emissions to the lungs, the immune system, the heart and cardiovascular system, even the developing brain," said Dr. John Balbus, chief health scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations, which will apply to nearly 1 million trucks and buses in California, will require operators to gradually replace their older rigs or install anti-pollution devices on new ones starting in 2011.LiNeBrEaKState regulators have put together a $1 billion package of grants and loans to help the industry comply over the coming years, Nichols said. Yet that is less than 20 percent of the estimated compliance cost.LiNeBrEaKThe health rewards will be huge, regulators say. Over the next 15 years, they estimate, the new rules will prevent 9,400 premature deaths, result in 150,000 fewer asthma cases, save 950,000 work days lost because of illness and reduce public health costs by as much as $68 billion.LiNeBrEaKRegulators are under growing pressure from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to meet clean-air standards, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley. Failure could cost California $2 billion in federal transportation dollars -- half of the state's allocation.LiNeBrEaKDeborah Jordan of the EPA said that without the regulations, the state will not achieve federal standards "and will not provide Californians the clean air they deserve."LiNeBrEaKThe air board estimates that in 12 years, the regulations would cut particulate matter in the soot emitted by diesel engines by 43 percent and emissions of nitrogen oxides, a primary contributor to smog, by 23 percent.LiNeBrEaKWhile much of the focus has been on cargo-carrying trucks, many school buses must comply. School officials vehemently opposed the regulations, saying districts already are struggling to keep transportation programs afloat. The alternative will be more cars on the road, particularly in rural areas, and more children walking to classes along unsafe, busy roads, they said.LiNeBrEaKThe vote marks a milestone 10 years after diesel was declared a toxin by the air board. Regulators already had imposed restrictions on diesel fuel and off-road engines. Only now did they tackle heavy-duty truck engines.LiNeBrEaK"This was the last one done," Nichols said, "because it was the hardest."LiNeBrEaKOVERVIEWLiNeBrEaKBackground: Diesel emissions from trucks are considered an extreme health hazard, exacerbating respiratory illnesses and causing premature deaths.LiNeBrEaKWhat's changing: State regulators have moved to curb emissions by requiring truck companies to gradually begin to buy new rigs or outfit existing engines with soot traps.LiNeBrEaKThe future: Regulators say the result will be improved public health, saving up to $68 billion in medical costs by 2023. Truckers say the regulations will cost $5. 5 billion, forcing many to shut down and increasing the price of goods.

Santa Cruz Sentinel (California)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Pajaro Valley High student to explore Antarctica  	Donna Jones, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	387 words  	Dec. 13--When Sandra Lobato first saw penguins, her favorite animal, behind the glass of an aquarium at age 7, she told her father one day she'd travel to their home in the wild. That day has come. LiNeBrEaKThe 16-year-old Pajaro Valley High School junior will leave for Antarctica on Christmas Eve, and will spend two weeks with 60 international students on a ship-based educational tour of the globe's remotest continent thanks to a $12,500 scholarship through the Canada-based nonprofit Students on Ice. "I feel blessed to have the opportunity to go on this expedition," Sandra said. "It's like a dream come true."LiNeBrEaKSandra's teachers say she is a conscientious student who has earned the trip. She's been involved in several science projects at Pajaro Valley High, and is a graduate of the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Watsonville Area Teens Conserving Habitats, or WATCH program. Through the program, she helped raise awareness of a fungal disease threatening the California red-legged frog and other amphibians worldwide. She also studied global warming and environmental threats to polar regions in a summer math and science program at UC San Diego and currently shares her knowledge about local wetlands with elementary and middle school students through a Watsonville Wetlands Watch program.LiNeBrEaK"Sandra's commitment and dedication toward making a difference for the environment is truly impressive," said her science teacher, GaryLiNeBrEaKMartindale.LiNeBrEaKSandra said science was always an academic strength, but Pajaro Valley High's environmental emphasis was the catalyst that turned an interest into a passion. She plans to major in environmental studies when she gets to college.LiNeBrEaKWhen people talk about protecting the environment, they usually bring up things like recycling, she said. And that's good.LiNeBrEaK"But the more you learn, the more you are involved, you learn that's not enough," Sandra said. "We all need to do more."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   FINAL Edition	Energy-saving LED lights make holidays brighter;  Efficient bulbs fight global warming and save money in the home, workplace 	Peter Fimrite, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Home and Garden; Pg. F6  	634 words  	Energy-efficient lighting is relieving a lot of guilt for those who turn their houses into Roman candles during the holidays and then preach conservation the rest of the year.LiNeBrEaK More homeowners and businesses than ever are swapping out their old incandescent holiday lights for strings of more efficient light-emitting diode bulbs, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. officials and businesses that sell lighting.LiNeBrEaK"As the public becomes more aware of them, they are becoming more popular," said Joe Molica, spokesman for PGandE. "We are trying to raise the awareness that energy efficiency is one of the most important tools we have in the fight against global warming." LiNeBrEaK The issue is of particular importance, according to Molica, because 47 percent of the electricity produced by PGandE comes from the burning of natural gas and 1. 6 percent comes from coal, two producers of carbon dioxide. Consequently, the more electricity used, the more carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. LiNeBrEaK Light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are 90 percent more efficient than traditional incandescent Christmas lights, Molica said. They also last much longer - as long as 20,000 hours compared with about 3,000 hours - and put out less heat, reducing the risk of fire. LiNeBrEaK Molica said a string of 300 incandescent holiday lights - which is about average - costs the average Bay Area customer $70. 40 in energy during the approximately six-week holiday season. That's compared with 43 cents for the same number of LED lights.LiNeBrEaK "That means you save $70 a season if you switch out 300 incandescent lights to LED lights," Molica said. "It's a pretty dramatic savings, and it reduces your carbon footprint."LiNeBrEaK It is impossible to say how many people have switched, but for the past two years PGandE has been offering exchanges and incentives to residential customers, building owners and merchants to put up energy-efficient lights.LiNeBrEaKThe most dramatic example is at the Embarcadero Center, where more than 17,000 lights illuminate the towers and lure shoppers during the holidays. Boston Properties, which owns the buildings, put in energy-efficient cold cathode technology lights this year, thanks to a $34,000 PGandE rebate. The new lights reduce the energy output from 15 watts to only 2 watts per bulb. LiNeBrEaKIt means Boston Properties will save 80,000 kilowatt hours between November and January compared with last year, Molica said. That's a 43-ton reduction in carbon dioxide wafting into the heavens, he said. LiNeBrEaKDuring the annual lighting ceremony Nov. 21, PGandE officials handed out 500 strands of LED lights. Many San Francisco merchants jumped aboard the green-lighting bandwagon a year ago.LiNeBrEaK Fillmore Street merchants switched out their old lights last year. Virtually all the lighting on Fillmore from Geary to Jackson streets is now energy efficient. Mission District and Noe Valley merchants also switched to LED lights last year, Molica said. LiNeBrEaK More options are also available for consumers. In November, Home Depot offered $3 certificates toward LED lights for people who brought in their incandescent holiday lights. The store also doubled to 30 its selection of kinds of string lights. The store sells 138 eco-friendly yard decor items, artificial trees and other products with energy-efficient lights in them.LiNeBrEaK "In tough economic times, people still want to celebrate the holidays, so we are trying to make it more affordable to do so," said Kathryn Gallagher, the spokeswoman for Home Depot, which sold 40,000 miles of Christmas lights a year ago, enough to circle the globe 1. 5 times. "Green is the trend. We've seen the interest grow and we're expecting to sell more this year. We are trying to educate our customers that they can do simple modifications to their home and save money in the long run. And it's smart business, of course."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   FINAL Edition	Tough emissions rules worry state's truckers  	Wyatt Buchanan, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	720 words  	One million diesel-exhaust-spewing big rigs on California's roads face the nation's strictest emissions restrictions under rules adopted Friday by the state air board, a move that officials say is needed to save thousands of lives but that some truck drivers fear will put them out of business.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations, approved one day after the California Air Resources Board's landmark vote to curb greenhouse gases, require all trucks and buses, whether or not they are registered in the state, to retrofit or replace their rigs starting in 2010. LiNeBrEaKAir board officials estimate the changes will cost the trucking industry $5. 5 billion, causing some truckers to plead for financial assistance. They said they will offer truck owners $1 billion in help.LiNeBrEaKAfter hearing public comment for two days, the board voted unanimously in favor of the rule. Board Chair Mary Nichols said the decision was necessary because the trucking industry "has an enormous impact on the lives and health of the people of the state."LiNeBrEaKAir board officials estimate that the rule will save the lives of 9,400 people between 2011 and 2025. A related study by UC Berkeley and Harvard researchers concluded that truck drivers and dockworkers who breathe diesel soot on the job have higher rates of lung cancer and death than other workers.LiNeBrEaKDuring hearings Thursday and Friday, truck drivers and others concerned about their bottom line predicted dire economic consequences from the rules, while public-health advocates and air officials from around the state focused on people who suffer from asthma and other health risks associated with the pollution.LiNeBrEaK"This regulation is not something that you could do or should do - it's something you must do," said Bonnie Holmes-Gen, senior policy director for the American Lung Association of California.LiNeBrEaKBut Doug Britton, who owns a Fresno County trucking company whose 10 trucks are 10 to 20 years old, said he is worried about whether he will be able to stay in business.LiNeBrEaKThe cost of installing filters, which run about $12,000 per truck, and replacing old engines would "cause my debt to explode to 2 1/2 times the amount I've carried the last 20 years," Britton said. "That scares the heck out of me."LiNeBrEaKAbout 400,000 trucks are registered in the state, and about 500,000 from other states do business in California, according to the air board. The regulation applies to trucks that weigh more than 14,000 pounds, or those that are larger than a Ford F350 or GM 3500.LiNeBrEaKTruck owners would be required to install filters on their exhaust, and most would have to do so by 2014. Truckers also would have to replace their engines between 2012 and 2022 or buy a new truck with an engine made with 2010 specifications. If a new or used replacement is not available, truckers will not have to buy a replacement.LiNeBrEaKTruckers who do not adhere to the rules could face fines of up to $1,000 per day per violation.LiNeBrEaKAir board officials said their top priority is public health, adding that failure to meet clean air standards in the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California would put $2 billion in federal highway money at risk.LiNeBrEaKBut the board agreed to let owners of small fleets, those with three or fewer trucks, wait until 2011 to comply with the new rules. The air agency will carry out an intensive campaign in the coming year to inform those owners of the new rules. The board also decided to let fleet owners delay retrofitting one vehicle for each one that is taken off the road.LiNeBrEaKJulie Sauls, spokeswoman for California Trucking Association, said the group will take a close look at the new rules and talk to its members.LiNeBrEaKThe trucking industry offered an alternative plan, with different timelines, to ease some of the burden on truck drivers who could be saddled with vehicles they cannot legally drive or sell. But the board said the proposal did not meet the timeline for the federal requirements.LiNeBrEaKAir board members also voted to require people who drive their trucks long-distance to install more efficient tires and to outfit their rigs with aerodynamic features.LiNeBrEaKBoard member Dr. John Balmes said after the vote that while the change might cost the industry more than $5 billion, the savings in public health costs are estimated at as much as $50 billion.LiNeBrEaK"It's a tough rule in a tough time, but there will be societal savings," he said.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	No more gas hogs  	Public Forum Letter  	PUBLIC FORUM; Opinion  	160 words  	Back in the 1990s, General Motors made a plug-in electric car, which it leased to customers. Despite its popularity, GM refused to sell the cars, and eventually junked them. It focused instead on making global-warming, terrorist-supporting gas hogs like the Humvee. LiNeBrEaKNow, thanks to its lack of foresight, GM is bankrupt and wants a bailout from taxpayers. Because of all the jobs that will be lost if it goes under, GM has a gun to our collective head, so I guess we have to meet the ransom demand. But let's make any bailout conditional on binding commitments to make plug-in hybrids and give up any plans for more gas hogs.LiNeBrEaKIf GM insists on making dinosaurs, it should go extinct, and we'd be better off supporting start-up companies like Tesla that are genuinely trying to develop clean and efficient cars. They can hire the laid-off GM workers, and we'd end up with cars that would protect our national energy security and our planet.LiNeBrEaKGordon SwensonLiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City	AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (90%); AUTOMAKERS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (88%); AUTOMOTIVE WORKERS (88%); ELECTRIC VEHICLES (88%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); NATIONAL SECURITY (71%); STARTUPS (52%); AUTOMAKER BANKRUPTCIES (73%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (92%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (92%)  		GMP (PAR) (92%); GMB (BRU) (92%); GM (NYSE) (92%); MLTQ (PAR) (92%)  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (92%)  	SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (75%) UTAH, USA (85%) UNITED STATES (85%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  																
Seattle Times (Washington)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Governor favors mostly free permits for polluters  	Warren Cornwall, Seattle Times  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	640 words  	Dec. 13--Gov. Christine Gregoire is moving ahead with plans to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, but wants to dampen the effect on businesses and the economy by providing most of the pollution permits for free.LiNeBrEaKThe question of issuing free permits for emitting greenhouse gases versus charging for them is one of the biggest confronting states trying to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe permits, which would set the amount of greenhouse gases a company could release, are key to a so-called cap-and-trade system that state lawmakers are expected to consider next year as a way to reduce the emissions. LiNeBrEaKGregoire's office currently is drafting preliminary legislation that would established the program.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists generally want industries to buy the pollution permits. They argue it will help ensure the true cost of greenhouse gases is felt by the biggest polluters, and will keep companies from profiting by selling permits they got for free.LiNeBrEaKIndustry groups, meanwhile, say providing the permits for free would soften the financial blow as the economy tries to shift away from dependence on fossil fuels, the major source of man-made greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKGregoire appears to be siding more with business on this point.LiNeBrEaKForcing companies to buy more of the permits could cause them to shift production to other states, said Janice Adair, a special assistant to Ecology Department Director Jay Manning. And the governor's approach is an acknowledgment of the current economy.LiNeBrEaK"People are just kind of hanging on right now," Adair said.LiNeBrEaKThe cap-and-trade system would set an overall limit on greenhouse-gas emissions from major sources such as factories, power plants and gasoline starting in 2012. Each polluter would then get pollution permits for its share of the allowed emissions.LiNeBrEaKIf a polluter went over their allowed level, it could cut emissions or buy excess permits from another company. The overall cap would shrink each year, with a goal of getting back to 1990 emission levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThe draft version of legislation would give away 90 percent of the pollution permits needed by industries such as cement plants, paper mills and oil refineries.LiNeBrEaKElectric utilities would get all their permits free, but would have to spend profits from selling permits on efficiency, renewable energy, or helping low-income customers.LiNeBrEaKThe draft bill postpones regulation of gas and diesel until 2015. But then it would require purchase of all the permits for that sector -- which is almost sure to translate into higher gasoline prices.LiNeBrEaKAn Association of Washington Business official said his group wants virtually all of the permits to go for free. But Grant Nelson, the association's head of governmental affairs, also questions whether now is the time for new regulations.LiNeBrEaK"What we shouldn't be doing is embarking on a new program that could further harm our economy," he said.LiNeBrEaKWhile environmentalists aren't thrilled at how many permits would go for free, a leading environmental lobbyist said it was good Gregoire was tackling the issue now.

A22  	374 words  	BRUSSELS, Belgium - European nations on Friday dared the United States, Russia and China to follow their lead on global warming after agreeing on a plan to meet the so-called "20-20-20" targets: reducing greenhouse emissions by 20 percent and ensuring that 20 percent of energy comes from wind, sun and other renewable sources by 2020. LiNeBrEaKStavros Dimas, the European environment commissioner, said the package put the 27-nation European Union on a path to a low-carbon economy.LiNeBrEaK"We are the only region in the world that is reducing emissions," Dimas said on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference in Poznan, Poland, calling the bloc an example that others should follow.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists, however, said concessions made to eastern Europe and heavy industry made the plan ineffective.LiNeBrEaK"The deal is a disaster, it's disgraceful," said Stephen Singer, a climate specialist for WWF International. "If the world follows the example of the EU, it is on a trajectory to disastrous climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe plan increased the amount of emissions Europeans could offset by sponsoring green projects in developing countries. Armed with that opt-out, Singer said Europe's actual emissions reductions would be a mere 4 percent, not the 20 percent the EU claims.LiNeBrEaKThe Brussels summit meeting coincided with the end of a two-week, 190-nation U.N. conference in Poznan that worked on a global climate treaty to be adopted next year in Copenhagen, Denmark. The treaty would replace the expiring Kyoto Protocol, which required the EU and other industrial countries to cut carbon emissions by an average 5 percent by 2012.LiNeBrEaKPresident George W. Bush has refused to accept mandatory restrictions on the U.S. economy intended to cut carbon emissions, both as outlined in the Kyoto accord and those now being considered. While the United States signed the Kyoto agreement, it was never ratified by the Senate, and Bush essentially scrapped it. Since 1990, U.S. emissions have increased by 16. 7 percent.LiNeBrEaKSen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was at the Poznan conference, said he expects the U.S. to have a climate policy in place within a year.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has called for Congress to establish greenhouse gas limits that would reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   FINAL EDITION	European leaders adopt pact on climate change  	EDWARD CODY, WASHINGTON POST  	NEWS; Pg. 036  	368 words  	The leaders of Europe approved what they described as a historic pact to combat global warming yesterday and challenged President-elect Barack Obama to join in their commitment to drastically reduce greenhouse gases despite the global economic crisis. LiNeBrEaKThe 27 European Union nations also endorsed a $260 billion economic stimulus plan, equivalent to 1. 5 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product, and urged the Obama administration to prepare similarly ambitious measures and financial reforms for coordinated action at a summit of the world's 20 major economic powers scheduled April 2 in London.LiNeBrEaKThe appeals, at a two-day European Union summit in Brussels, reflected widespread expectations among European leaders that Obama and his team will be easier to work with than the Bush administration and that, to a large extent, the president-elect shares their assessment of the need for bold steps to slow global warming and revive economies that have sapped by financial turmoil.LiNeBrEaK"Our message to our global partners is, 'Yes, you can,'" said Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the union's executive commission, echoing one of Obama's campaign slogans. "Especially to our American partners," he added.LiNeBrEaKThe European leaders, particularly President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who holds the union's rotating presidency, committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Europe by 20 percent before 2020 - and by 30 percent if other countries make comparable pledges at a U.N. environment conference scheduled next year in Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaKTo reach their goals, the leaders pledged that 20 percent of their energy will come from renewable sources by 2020, leading to predictions of windmill farms across the European countryside and carpets of solar panels such as those that were recently installed atop the Vatican in Rome.LiNeBrEaKIn a measure of the expenses the pledge seemed likely to entail, only about 8. 5 percent of Europe's energy now comes from renewable sources, much of it from hydroelectric or nuclear power stations. Experts predicted that steps needed to reach the targets could raise electricity bills in Europe by as much as 15 percent for industrial users and add nearly $200 to the average household's annual bill.

Ventura County Star (California)  	December 13, 2008 Saturday 	Camarillo research foundation puts 1 million eggs in one basket  	Brett Johnson, Ventura County Star, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1506 words  	Dec. 13--To say the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology has taken wing in Camarillo is a literal and figurative compliment that barely cracks the surface of what's going on inside this particular egg.LiNeBrEaKThe private nonprofit research institution has become a nerve center in the bird world, combining science, education and art. More library-quiet oasis than raucous henhouse, the visually stunning place has been situated amid a nondescript Camarillo office park for 16 years, yet has a far-reaching pull.LiNeBrEaKIt's home to more than 1 million bird eggs -- some date back nearly 200 years -- along with some 18,000 old nests and 54,000 bird skins. The collections, among the largest in the world, draw scientists, researchers, photographers, artists, bird enthusiasts and school groups from all points. Last year, the foundation supplied data to more than 200 bird research projects around the globe.LiNeBrEaKThe foundation also does research, such as a coming count of loggerhead shrikes on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands, ongoing monitoring of eggs from a bird called the ashy storm-petrel that reflect pollution levels in the Santa Barbara Channel, and counting birds in the Guatemalan jungles. LiNeBrEaKThese are intriguing times at the foundation. Bird DNA can be extracted from egg shells and membranes; environmental contaminants can be gleaned from eggs and feathers. Isotopic analysis that matches carbon emission levels imprinted in bird feathers with those that occur naturally by latitudes can give a glimpse of where birds live, travel and what they do, said Linnea Hall, the foundation's executive director for the past six years. It's her long-term goal to have an analysis laboratory and a bird pathologist.LiNeBrEaK"The cool thing is the scientific techniques have finally gotten to the point where every specimen is now more valuable than they were 100 years ago, simply because you can get so much more data from them," Hall said.LiNeBrEaKSciences of a featherLiNeBrEaKIt's not such a happy story for the birds. She said scientists have learned that more chemicals are showing up in birds.LiNeBrEaKClimate change, Hall said, means that temperature-sensitive birds are laying eggs two weeks to a month earlier than normal, at times when insects, plant life and other cyclical food might not be available. A relative lack of cold weather is not driving birds south as early or even as often, affecting distributions. While that's beneficial for some birds, it's not for others.LiNeBrEaKScientists are also finding large amounts of trash in bird nests, another sign of what's drifting into bird habitats, said Hall, who is also a field biologist and wildlife ecologist. Plastics, for example, don't have the same insulating quality as leaves for keeping chicks warm. That is reducing chick survival rates.LiNeBrEaKBecause birds are especially sensitive to pollution and other factors, Hall said, they "will continue to be a beacon species for levels of chemicals in our environment."LiNeBrEaKIn earlier days, the foundation's egg sets were an integral part of studies documenting thinning shells because of the now-banned pesticide DDT, which still shows up in background levels locally, and other pollutants.LiNeBrEaKRene Corado picked up an example of this from atop a cabinet in the 22,000-square-foot facility. It's a set of crumbled eggs, once "so thin that the brown pelican sat on them and crushed them," he noted.LiNeBrEaKCorado is a 22-year foundation veteran and its collections manager. He's also a field biologist and oologist; the latter is zoology-speak for someone who specializes in eggs, especially bird eggs.LiNeBrEaKThe 1 million-plus eggs at the foundation, some 190,000 sets, are tucked away snug in 800 white cabinets organized in spine-straight rows.LiNeBrEaKOne of Corado's standard lines to visitors is: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket; we do that here."LiNeBrEaKJoking aside, it's an important repository, although the hollowed-out eggs no longer harbor life. The foundation, Corado said, has egg sets (as well as skins) from such extinct species as the Carolina parakeet, ivory-billed woodpecker and passenger pigeon. The pigeon eggs are among the oldest in the collection, dating back to the early 1800s.LiNeBrEaK"It's the only way," Corado said as he shuffled between the rows, "to know what the eggs were like." They can compare eggs now with old, healthy ones.LiNeBrEaKFrom lab to fieldLiNeBrEaKThe foundation houses egg collections from around the world, although the bulk of them are North American and other so-called "New World" specimens.LiNeBrEaKHall opened a drawer filled with American kestrel eggs. One sample was collected from Aliso Canyon near Santa Paula on April 30, 1916. Another drawer contained African warbler eggs that seemed almost as polished as gemstones. A nearby cabinet held small, white Allen's hummingbird eggs that looked remarkably like Tic Tac mints. Corado pulled out a set of striking brown-and-black northern jacana eggs collected in Mexico in 1896. And so on, drawer by drawer, row after row.LiNeBrEaKOne does not amass 1 million bird eggs easily, although the late Ed Harrison made it seem that way.LiNeBrEaKHarrison, a birding enthusiast who collected eggs back when it was a popular hobby, started the foundation in 1956 in back of his Westwood home.LiNeBrEaKHe poured his own money into preserving specimens and maintaining his museum. He sought out and acquired so-called "widow" and "orphan" collections: those left behind for a spouse or family that didn't want them. As the place's renown grew, Harrison also got egg collections from universities and museums that could no longer afford to keep them, Corado said. In all, the eggs come from some 400 collections.LiNeBrEaKIn 1992, the foundation moved to Camarillo for space, cost and other reasons. Harrison died in 2002; his daughter, Kathleen, is the foundation's board president.LiNeBrEaKThe collections draw scientists from Europe, Japan and around the world, typically totaling about 100 researcher visits a year, Hall said, along with 100 to 150 requests for data.LiNeBrEaKThe small staff is not stuck in what Hall playfully calls "the big cave"; staff members also get out in the field. Corado once conducted bird studies in the Amazon, dropped by helicopter "in the middle of nowhere for three months." The foundation's bird work in tropical climes stretches back to the 1960s.LiNeBrEaKIn recent years, Corado and Hall have worked in his native Guatemala, a Central American country so ravaged by civil wars that little or no scientific work went on there. They now count and band birds as well as teach Guatemalan biologists and students how to do the same.LiNeBrEaKThe situation is still a bit dicey -- they carry guns in the field -- said Corado. Hall confirmed this. "I have a machete on one side and a gun on the other," she said. "There are highway robbers and other dangers."LiNeBrEaKVisual sanctuaryLiNeBrEaKToiling for this foundation is not your average, everyday job.LiNeBrEaK"It's fun working here," Corado said.LiNeBrEaKAtop the cabinets are many of the 600 or so stuffed, life-sized specimens, including bald eagles, golden eagles, snowy owls, great horned owls, Steller's jays, belted kingfishers and ravens. There's even a mummified Egyptian hawk that dates back to 2000 B.C. One long wall is bathed in blue and white, devoted to an enormous mural of pelicans flying to the Channel Islands. Some birds are suspended from ceiling wires, frozen in simulated flight, wings flapping and feet outstretched, as if they're coming in for a landing.LiNeBrEaKIt's not a bad spot to linger. An early December visit found San Francisco photographer Sharon Beals in one nook, taking shots of barn owl and brown-footed booby nests for her book due out in spring 2010.LiNeBrEaK"Isn't this facility amazing?" she gushed. "I'm completely lucky to be here. In the scientific birding world, this is a very important place. And it's in stunningly beautiful shape."LiNeBrEaKOn the same day, a group of ecology students from CSU Channel Islands was getting a tour and bird tutorial from Hall and lecturer Angela Chapman. Chapman has brought her CSUCI classes here for five years, saying: "It's a marvelous resource, and it's great it's right on the doorstep. Most people don't even know about it, yet it has international recognition for its collections."LiNeBrEaKOddy Blanco, a junior from Oxnard studying general biology, was among the students trying to digest it.LiNeBrEaK"It's quite interesting and fascinating seeing all these birds," he said. "It's kind of overwhelming to me."LiNeBrEaKAs a nonprofit, the foundation relies on donations from members and visitors as well as the occasional research grant. Despite the harsh economy, Hall said, she has not seen a drop in donations from its more than 200 members.LiNeBrEaK"We hope this is because they value what we have here," she said.

The Washington Post 	December 13, 2008 Saturday   Regional Edition	E.U. Leaders Commit to Steps To Try to Curb Climate Change  	Edward Cody; Washington Post Foreign Service  	FOREIGN; Pg. A12  	926 words  	 European leaders adopted what they described as a historic pact to combat global warming Friday and challenged President-elect Barack Obama to join in their commitment to drastically reduce greenhouse gases despite the global economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe 27 European Union nations also endorsed a $260 billion economic stimulus plan, equivalent to 1. 5 percent of the bloc's gross domestic product, and urged the incoming Obama administration to prepare similarly ambitious measures and financial reforms for coordinated action at a summit of the world's 20 major economic powers scheduled for April 2 in London.LiNeBrEaKThe appeals, at a two-day E.U. summit in Brussels, reflected widespread expectations among European leaders that Obama and his team will be easier to work with than the Bush administration and that, to a large extent, the president-elect shares their assessment of the need for bold steps to slow global warming and to revive economies that have been sapped by financial turmoil. LiNeBrEaK"Our message to our global partners is, 'Yes, you can,' " said Jos&Atilde;&copy; Manuel Barroso, president of the union's executive commission, echoing one of Obama's campaign slogans. "Especially to our American partners," he added.LiNeBrEaKThe European leaders, particularly President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who holds the union's rotating presidency,  committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Europe by 20 percent before 2020 -- and by 30 percent if other countries make comparable pledges at a U.N. environment conference scheduled for next year in Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaKTo reach their goals, the leaders pledged that 20 percent of their energy will come from renewable sources by 2020, leading to predictions of windmill farms across the European countryside and carpets of solar panels such as those that were recently installed atop the Vatican in Rome.LiNeBrEaKIn a measure of the expenses the pledge seemed likely to entail, only about 8. 5 percent of Europe's energy now comes from renewable sources, much of it from hydroelectric or nuclear power stations. Experts predicted that the steps needed to reach the targets could raise electricity bills in Europe by as much as 15 percent for industrial users and add nearly $200 to the average household's annual bill.LiNeBrEaKEastern European countries fought to get compensation for changes that will be necessary there if the goals are to be met. Poland, for instance, gets as much as 90 percent of its electricity from Soviet-era coal-fired generators, which are a major pollutant and, under the accord, would be forced to pay heavily for the carbon dioxide they spew into the air.LiNeBrEaKUnder complicated formulas worked out in recent months, Polish and other high-pollution Eastern European industries will receive a disproportionate amount of subsidies to finance their part in a pay-to-pollute program. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told reporters he was satisfied with the outcome, despite previous reservations  and flashed a victory sign to television cameras as he got in a car at the close of the summit.LiNeBrEaKItaly's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who had threatened a veto to protect several high-pollution industries in his country, said he also backed off because he did not want to play the role of spoiler after it became clear a strong majority favored going ahead with the pact. Similarly, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany declared the agreement a victory for Europe despite earlier fears that her country's giant economy would be called on to underpin the subsidies for Eastern Europe.LiNeBrEaKIn recent weeks, Merkel has been called "Madame No" by the French media because of her hesitations over the antipollution reforms as well as the free-spending economic stimulus plan promoted by Sarkozy and Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain. But in the end, she endorsed them both.LiNeBrEaK" 'Yes' has been the motto of the day," she told reporters on leaving Brussels.LiNeBrEaKOne reason, according to environmental activists, was that fine print in the pact provided for a host of loopholes benefiting big business in Germany as well as in Eastern Europe, particularly high electricity-consuming industries such as steel. Sanjeev Kumar of the World Wildlife Fund said the accord as it finally took shape has "several gaping holes" that give pollution-causing industries an out.LiNeBrEaKSarkozy's environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said the loopholes were designed to protect European industries that might be at a competitive disadvantage if next year's Copenhagen conference fails to produce a worldwide commitment on the same level as the one undertaken Friday by Europe. His comment seemed aimed particularly at the United States and China, two nations that have been reluctant to allow steps against global warming hobble their manufacturing industries.LiNeBrEaKThe economic stimulus plan drew unanimous support, despite Germany's fears that unchecked spending and accumulation of national debts could burden economic recovery in the long term. The accord on extra spending meant European governments would be exceeding debt limits they had imposed on themselves to guarantee economic health within the bloc.LiNeBrEaKBut Sarkozy said European leaders decided the crisis was so severe that the constraints on debt had to be put aside temporarily for what he called "a short-term stimulus."LiNeBrEaKResponding to the German fears, however, the accord also stipulated that the restrictions on public debt would be respected again shortly. Extra spending, it said, would have to be carefully calculated to counter the crisis and not used as an excuse to finance other, politically popular projects.

The Anniston Star (Alabama)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: How we view our history: Dealing with the Bush legacy  	The Anniston Star, Ala.  	COMMENTARY  	544 words  	Dec. 12--The Soviet-era Kremlin had a method of dealing with inconvenient people and truths: erase the parts the Politburo would rather forget.LiNeBrEaKFor example, if a member of the communist circle fell off the wagon (or was shoved off), then the undesirable person was airbrushed out of official pictures. LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration's whitewashing of its awful missteps won't be so easily Photoshopped out of the picture.LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, the remaining cadre of loyal Bushies is trying.LiNeBrEaKPresident Bush got into the act earlier this week while speaking at the U.S. Military Academy. Speaking to the West Point cadets, he defended his policy of pre-emptive war.LiNeBrEaKIn 2002, Bush told the cadets, "To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act pre-emptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense."LiNeBrEaKSuch a policy contradicted several centuries of Western thought -- governmental, religious and civil -- that had defined a just war.LiNeBrEaKBush presented a conceit familiar throughout history. "The security environment confront-LiNeBrEaKing the United States today is radically different from what we have faced before," Bush said.LiNeBrEaKCiting this age's special case, the president launched an un-wise, deceptively sold and ill-considered pre-emptive war with Iraq, something Americans have paid for and will continue to pay for in the coming decades.LiNeBrEaKYet, the president was back at West Point on Tuesday, feebly defending the train wreck.LiNeBrEaKBush's secretary of state was on the case Wednesday. Condoleezza Rice objected to an NPR interviewer's question about harmful U.S. policies in Guantanamo, a defense that ignores world public opinion, U.S. public opinion and numerous rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKEarlier, Rice bragged of Bush's "great strategic achievement" in removing Saddam Hussein from power. Ah, but the cost, Madame Secretary, the cost in American blood, treasure and national reputation.LiNeBrEaKNone of this is a coincidence, as the Los Angeles Times discovered. It reports on a memo circulated about top Bush administration staffers. The loyal Bushies are instructed to remind audiences how the president "kept the American people safe" in a post-9/11 world.LiNeBrEaKSadly, that safety did not extend to victims of Hurricane Katrina, investors in the stock market, homeowners facing foreclosure, policymakers wishing to prepare for climate change and defenders of the U.S. Constitution, to cite a few examples.LiNeBrEaKJust as the president and his team desires, much of the world wishes it could airbrush the most unpleasant parts of the Bush administration. We'd probably start with the rash Supreme Court decision offered exactly eight years ago today that handed George W. Bush the presidency before a full counting of Florida votes was completed.LiNeBrEaKNone of this is possible, so it's better to face reality and hope for a better tomorrow.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Main Edition	IBM, Dell and Coke among green giants  	BOB KEEFE; Cox Washington Bureau  	BUSINESS; Pg. 2F  	564 words  	IBM, Dell and Coca-Cola score among the highest in a new study of climate-friendly companies, while Apple, Burger King and apparel maker Abercrombie and Fitch rank among the worst. LiNeBrEaKThe study released Thursday by the Boston-based Ceres investor advisory and advocacy group indicates that the technology industry is at the top of the list when it comes to addressing climate change, reducing greenhouse gases and using environmentally sensitive practices. The hotel industry is at the bottom.LiNeBrEaKIn its study, Ceres and RiskMetrics Group ranked 63 of the world's biggest technology and consumer-related companies on how they're addressing climate change, accounting for greenhouse gas emissions and planning for the future.LiNeBrEaK"These are companies that have a great influence over how we go about our daily lives," said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, which advises institutional investors.LiNeBrEaKMany big institutional investors care about how companies address climate change issues not just because they want to do the right thing. Under new regulations in some states and federal proposals in Washington, companies could soon be forced to limit their carbon emissions and be fined or forced to buy credits if they exceed those limits. Also, reducing corporate energy costs and planning for future potential energy shortages means reducing overall expenses --- something investors like to see.LiNeBrEaKLubber said many companies are doing a better job of making climate change part of their business strategies. But for others, she added, the issue is barely a consideration.LiNeBrEaKMore than half of the companies surveyed by Ceres scored under 50 points on a 100-point scale. The median score was 38 points.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Atlanta-based Coca-Cola is a huge user of water and energy, it ranked high, 65, because its top executives have made addressing climate change a priority, according to Ceres. Coca-Cola also got high marks for its energy-efficiency programs and its efforts to use more environmentally friendly refrigeration systems.LiNeBrEaKDell, based in Round Rock, Texas, scored a 77 on the Ceres ranking --- second only to IBM among technology companies. It got high marks for becoming the first carbon-neutral computer maker, mainly by buying electricity from renewable sources and reducing and offsetting its carbon emissions. Its 2. 1-million-square-foot headquarters north of Austin, for instance, is powered entirely by electricity produced from wind farms and landfill gases.LiNeBrEaKAt the other end of the spectrum, Ohio-based apparel maker Abercrombie and Fitch scored a zero on the Ceres rankings because the company and its executives have done virtually nothing to address climate change, according to the group.LiNeBrEaKApple, which is often lauded for its cool and hip designs but lambasted by environmentalists, scored a 28, the lowest of any technology company on the list. Apple got poor marks because top executives have done relatively little publicly to try to reduce the company's environmental impact and because it doesn't disclose its carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKOfficials from Abercrombie and Fitch and Apple did not respond to a reporter's request for comment.LiNeBrEaKAmong other companies, Atlanta-based Home Depot scored 15 of 100 in the rankings; Austin-based Whole Foods Market, 27; Starbucks, 52; and McDonald's, 26.LiNeBrEaKFor many big companies, addressing climate change is as much a business decision as it is an environmental decision.

The Boston Globe 	December 12, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Which one is greener, Apple or Wal-Mart?  	Erin Ailworth Globe Staff  	BUSINESS; Pg. B5  	619 words  	Apple Inc. and Whole Foods Market Inc., viewed by many as being environmentally friendly, ranked relatively low in a new report on how large companies are addressing climate change, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Dell Inc., and IBM Corp. fared well.LiNeBrEaKMindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, the Boston-based green investment coalition that published the report, said companies that scored the highest believe "climate change is as much an economic and financial risk as the subprime mortgage meltdown." LiNeBrEaKThe report looked at 63 large companies in the retail, pharmaceutical, apparel, and other sectors, partly by examining annual reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ratings were based on such factors as whether the companies sought ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and engaged employees in climate-control efforts, including ways to become more energy-efficient.LiNeBrEaKOf three New England companies reviewed, Staples Inc. of Framingham scored in the middle, while Boston Properties Inc. and CVS Caremark Corp. of Woonsocket, R.I., placed closer to the bottom.LiNeBrEaKStaples, the report said, has set goals for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and is installing solar power systems on some of its roofs.LiNeBrEaK"They are clearly moving in the right direction," said Anne Kelly, director of governance programs at Ceres.LiNeBrEaKMark Buckley, Staples' vice president of environmental affairs, said that in addition to about two dozen rooftop solar projects, the company has four large wind-power projects under consideration and is scheduled to complete a fuel cell project in California this month.LiNeBrEaK"From a CEO level and a board level, we obviously can't get what we've gotten accomplished without support from [CEO] Ron Sargent and our board," Buckley said.LiNeBrEaKRepresentatives of Boston Properties, which counts the Prudential Tower among its holdings, defended their company's low score - 16 out of 100. LiNeBrEaK"I don't think that score is reflective of us as a company and where we are," spokeswoman Arista Joyner said, pointing to Boston Properties' efforts to have its buildings certified as environmentally friendly by the US Green Building Council.LiNeBrEaKBrian Swett, also of Boston Properties, said the score may partly result from a lag in promoting its environmental efforts. "In general, we're focused more on action than information because it's the action that gets you environmental results," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut Jeff Seabright, a vice president at Coca-Cola Co., said transparency and corporate accountability are critical to a company's success in being considered "green." Coca-Cola scored one of the top 10 highest marks in the Ceres report. Seabright said it plans to "flatline carbon growth" by 2015 and is working to reduce emissions and expand the use of ecofriendly refrigeration.LiNeBrEaKWhole Foods, meanwhile, plans to use its modest showing as a guide for how it can improve on green initiatives already underway, said Kathy Loftus, who oversees sustainable engineering, maintenance, and energy for the Texas-based chain. Whole Foods, she said, takes a regional approach to many of its environmental projects.LiNeBrEaK"It's more about trying to engage everybody rather than having somebody at the top say, `By 2015, we will reduce emissions by X,"' Loftus said, adding that Whole Foods plans to implement a system to track energy use.LiNeBrEaK"Other companies may have scored well because they have systems and processes and numbers, but they may not have the ethos and the mission," Loftus said. "We've got all that, but we need to get better on the numbers side."LiNeBrEaKTopping the Ceres list was IBM; in last place was Abercrombie and Fitch Co.LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR:LiNeBrEaKBIG AND GREENISHLiNeBrEaKSEE PDF FOR CHART DATA	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); HEALTH FOOD STORES (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); SOFT DRINK INDUSTRY (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); HVAC SYSTEMS (77%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (74%); FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY (74%); SOLAR ENERGY (73%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); GREEN BUILDING (73%); MORTGAGE BANKING and FINANCE (73%); CREDIT CRISIS (71%); RETAIL PHARMACEUTICALS (71%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROGRAMS (71%); SUBPRIME LENDING (71%); SUBPRIME MORTGAGES (56%); WIND POWER PLANTS (50%)  	APPLE INC (95%); WAL-MART STORES INC (91%); WHOLE FOODS MARKET INC (92%); DELL INC (91%); COCA-COLA CO (80%); INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP (72%); STAPLES INC (69%); CVS CAREMARK CORP (69%); BOSTON PROPERTIES INC (69%); XIAMEN ANNE CORP LTD (55%)  		AAPL (NASDAQ) (95%); WMT (NYSE) (91%); WFMI (NASDAQ) (92%); DELL (NASDAQ) (91%); KO (NYSE) (80%); IBMC (BRU) (72%); IBM (NYSE) (72%); IBM (LSE) (72%); SPLS (NASDAQ) (69%); CVS (NYSE) (69%); BXP (NYSE) (69%); 002235 (SZSE) (55%)  	NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING (95%); SIC3571 ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS (95%); NAICS334112 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICE MANUFACTURING (95%); NAICS423430 COMPUTER and COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT and SOFTWARE MERCHANT WHOLESALERS (95%); SIC5045 COMPUTERS and COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT and SOFTWARE (95%); SIC3572 COMPUTER STORAGE DEVICES (95%); NAICS452910 WAREHOUSE CLUBS and SUPERCENTERS (93%); NAICS452112 DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORES (93%); NAICS445110 SUPERMARKETS and OTHER GROCERY (EXCEPT CONVENIENCE) STORES (92%); SIC5411 GROCERY STORES (92%); NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING (80%); SIC2086 BOTTLED and CANNED SOFT DRINKS and CARBONATED WATER (80%); NAICS334119 OTHER COMPUTER PERIPHERAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (72%); NAICS453210 OFFICE SUPPLIES and STATIONERY STORES (69%); NAICS443120 COMPUTER and SOFTWARE STORES (69%); NAICS446110 PHARMACIES and DRUG STORES (69%); SIC5912 DRUG STORES and PROPRIETARY STORES (69%); NAICS322121 PAPER (EXCEPT NEWSPRINT) MILLS (55%); SIC2621 PAPER MILLS (55%)  	BOSTON, MA, USA (95%) MASSACHUSETTS, USA (95%); RHODE ISLAND, USA (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%); NORTHEAST USA (78%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved  		RONALD L SARGENT (53%)  														
Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Despite questions over equity, countries on track for new climate treaty by end of '09  	By Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	771 words  	POZNAN, Poland _ With developing countries offering more emission cuts than anticipated and richer nations in many cases offering fewer, global climate negotiators wrapped up lackluster talks Friday that U.N. officials said nonetheless kept the world on the path toward a new treaty by next December.LiNeBrEaKIn the final day of talks, negotiators agreed on principles of financing for a fund to help the world's poorest and most vulnerable nations cope with the effects of climate change. Earlier they approved a mechanism to incorporate forest protection into efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKBut basic questions over an equitable balance of emissions cuts between richer and poorer nations for the most part remained unresolved, particularly because many richer nations balked at making firm or ambitious promises to cut emissions in the coming decade.LiNeBrEaK"We got the bare minimum of what we needed from the talks," said Jennifer Haverkamp, international climate policy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. Coming out of Poznan, "there's a lot to do and less than a year to do it."LiNeBrEaKNegotiations have been hampered by growing worries in Europe, long the world leader in pushing a climate deal, about the costs of cutting emissions as its industries come under pressure during a spreading global recession.LiNeBrEaKDespite those worries, however, Europe managed to sign its own climate agreement Friday, committing the region to a 20 percent cut in emissions by 2020 as well as a doubling of use of renewable energy and a 20 percent boost in energy efficiency over the same period.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's promise to make combating climate change a priority for his administration has produced as much frustration as enthusiasm at Poznan, simply because his negotiators are not yet at the table, which has led other countries to delay decisions on cuts until seeing a new U.S. proposal.LiNeBrEaKNegotiators "want to be sure they're not committing their economies and populations to some kind of quixotic emissions reductions regime which costs them much more than their neighbors and exports competitors," said Henry Derwent, president of the International Emissions Trading Association and a former British climate negotiator.LiNeBrEaKStill, "Poznan can't be judged by the number of decisions made here. Everybody knows without the United States a lot of decisions have to wait," said Jennifer Haverkamp, a climate policy expert with the Environmental Defense Fund.LiNeBrEaKOne of the brightest spots of the talks was a series of vows by major developing countries to cut their own greenhouse gases, in recognition of the global scope of the problem and in line with promises made at talks last December in Bali.LiNeBrEaKBrazil announced a new commitment to cut deforestation by 70 percent by 2017, a move that would effectively cut the country's greenhouse gas emissions by more than a third. South Africa has promised to cut emissions growth by 2020 and begin reductions by 2030, and Mexico has said it will cut its emissions, measured at 2002 levels, by half by 2050.LiNeBrEaKMany of those countries expressed frustration that richer countries, responsible for the majority of the emissions that have brought on climate change, have offered ambitious cuts for the most part only by 2050, with little firm promise of action in the crucial intervening decades.LiNeBrEaKCanada, Japan and Australia, worried about their economies and waiting to see the level of U.S. commitment, have all dragged their feet at Poznan, activists said.LiNeBrEaKIn a speech at the talks Friday, former Vice President Al Gore called the "synchronized" economic bailouts around the world a good sign that nations can pull together and find the needed resources to face an international crisis if they feel sufficient threat.LiNeBrEaKBut he warned that time is running short for making the dramatic emissions cuts needed to stem the worst effects of climate change, from rising sea level to increased droughts, floods, heat waves, hurricanes and other forms of severe weather.LiNeBrEaKU.N. climate scientists have urged industrialized countries to make emissions cuts of 25 to 40 percent by 2020, from 1990 levels, to minimize the effects to climate change.LiNeBrEaKClimate change will not be resolved with simply "a good try," Gore said. "We will succeed or we will fail."

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Bush administration rule changes trouble environmentalists: They say endangered species protection is weakened  	Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	675 words  	Dec. 12--WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration issued two late-term regulations on Thursday that environmentalists say weaken federal protection for endangered species but that Interior Department officials defended as blocking a "back-door" attempt to regulate emissions that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKConservation groups sued to block the new rules, reigniting a fight over so-called midnight regulation that had seemed to die down a day earlier when the administration declined to impose looser air pollution rules that environmentalists had feared. LiNeBrEaKPreviously, federal agencies were required to consult with scientists who specialized in particular species before proceeding with a project like a road or dam. The project could not go forward unless the specialist certified that no harm would come to endangered plants or wildlife. The rules announced Thursday would allow federal agencies to bypass those scientists in some cases if the agencies determined that the endangered species would not be harmed.LiNeBrEaKThe revision was finalized after four months of deliberation and over the objections of what officials said were the bulk of nearly 235,000 public comments on the change.LiNeBrEaKThe updated rules also bar agencies from stopping a project because its emissions might contribute to global warming. Opponents call the change particularly objectionable for the polar bear, which has seen its habitat shrink as Arctic ice caps melt. The government declared polar bears a threatened species this year.LiNeBrEaKInterior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne called the rule changes "narrow" and a "common-sense" approach to species protection. He stressed that agencies could still consult with species scientists if they chose, and he reiterated his belief that climate change regulation is a "wholly inappropriate use of the Endangered Species Act."LiNeBrEaKKempthorne acknowledged internal debate over the changes, but he and other administration officials said they tweaked the rule in response to public comments.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups panned them anyway.LiNeBrEaKJanette Brimmer, an attorney with Earthjustice, said the administration was "using global warming as a stalking horse to undo species protections on a broad scale."LiNeBrEaKAndrew Wetzler, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's endangered species program, was blunt: "We will see them in court."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists have tussled with the administration in its waning days over oil and gas drilling leases near national parks and oil shale development across the western U.S. They cheered Wednesday, however, when the Environmental Protection Agency said it would not revise two air pollution standards.LiNeBrEaKWhite House officials say they've worked hard to minimize the kind of end-of-term rulemaking that President Bill Clinton engaged in heavily. Many of the late rules could be difficult for President-elect Barack Obama to overturn without in a lengthy process, though a little-used law could allow Congress to void them.LiNeBrEaKThe House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming held a hearing on Thursday into Bush's late energy and environmental rulemaking. Committee Chairman Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said the rules issued Thursday showed the administration was "determined to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on our nation."LiNeBrEaKKempthorne, for his part, sounded keenly aware of timing issues in a conference call with reporters, when he noted he had 39 days left in office. Asked if that gave him pause for issuing new rules, he replied: "Do you think Eli Manning should have left the field five minutes before the end of the last Super Bowl?"LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.com	ENDANGERED SPECIES (92%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (92%); WILDLIFE (91%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (91%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); BIOLOGY (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); MAMMALS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); AIR POLLUTION (89%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); NATIONAL PARKS (78%); THREATENED and SENSITIVE SPECIES (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); AIR QUALITY (77%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (77%); LAWYERS (73%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); MINERAL LEASES (60%); OIL and GAS LEASES (60%); OIL EXTRACTION (60%); CRUDE OIL and NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (60%)  				General  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%) ILLINOIS, USA (90%); WEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%); ARCTIC (79%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	DIRK KEMPTHORNE (67%); BILL CLINTON (51%); BARACK OBAMA (50%)  	20081212-TB-Bush-administration-rule-changes-trouble-environmentalists-1212  	TB  												
Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Barack Obama's envoy at UN climate talks presses China to step up emissions cuts: Incoming administration says it will push new treaty if Beijing joins "global solution"  	Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	678 words  	Dec. 12--POZNAN, Poland -- President-elect Barack Obama's administration is prepared to embrace mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but will push through Congress a new international climate treaty only if China and other big emitters join in a "global solution," Sen. John Kerry warned at the latest round of climate talks Thursday in Poland.LiNeBrEaKKerry (D-Mass.), widely viewed as Obama's unofficial representative at the UN meeting, praised China -- which recently surpassed the United States as the world's biggest greenhouse gas producer -- for taking a variety of climate-friendly actions, including establishing auto emissions standards tougher than those in the United States and setting ambitious goals to improve energy efficiency. LiNeBrEaKBut unless China and other powerhouses in the developing world agree to quickly follow the U.S. toward large-scale emissions cuts, "there's no way for us to get from here to there" in terms of holding climate change to less than catastrophic levels, he said at a news conference.LiNeBrEaKInternational negotiators trying to craft a new global treaty to stem climate change and prepare for its consequences face extraordinary new challenges and opportunities as they draw closer to a December 2009 deadline for replacing the expiring Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKSince last year's negotiations in Bali, much of the world has plunged into a global financial crisis. That has distracted political attention from climate concerns and led some nations that once promised deep emissions cuts -- Germany, Canada and Japan among them -- to try to soften their pledges.LiNeBrEaKThe economic downturn has also sent oil prices plunging, weakening what once were powerful incentives to pursue cheaper -- and cleaner -- alternatives. And Europe, once the leader in pushing global emissions cuts, is embroiled in bitter wrangling over how the economic burden of reductions should be shared between richer and poorer members.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama's election, and his promises to make combating climate change a priority and to use an upcoming economic stimulus package to build a greener and more energy-independent U.S. economy, has re-energized negotiators long used to seeing the United States as an obstacle.LiNeBrEaKThe fact that Obama doesn't take office until January is hampering progress in Poznan as international negotiators wait to see what a new Obama administration will put on the table before making firm commitments of their own.LiNeBrEaK"I'm heartened to see the United States re-engage actively in global climate reductions," said Ban Ki Moon, UN secretary general. But pushing any new climate treaty that is agreed on through the U.S. Congress and other world legislatures could take at least a year or two, he warned.LiNeBrEaKIf a treaty is to be in place in time to replace the Kyoto Protocol, that leaves "just one year to negotiate one of the most complex multilateral treaties ever," he said.LiNeBrEaKMajor developing nations, including China, South Africa and Brazil, have stepped up with national plans to cut emissions -- an encouraging sign, particularly for richer countries that have often insisted they cannot make effective cuts alone.LiNeBrEaKBut analysts warned that the U.S. and others should not try to demand too much of developing countries. China's overall emissions now surpass those of the United States, but per capita they are only a fifth the size of those in the United States, said Antonio Hill, a climate change policy adviser with Oxfam, a charity focused on alleviating global poverty and hunger.LiNeBrEaK"If everyone in the world today emitted as much as someone in China does, we wouldn't have this problem" of climate change, he said.LiNeBrEaKlgoering@tribune.com	EMISSIONS (92%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES and AGREEMENTS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (78%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); LEGISLATORS (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (73%); OIL and GAS PRICES (73%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (73%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (69%); CREDIT CRISIS (69%); 2008 ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN (63%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (54%); PRESS CONFERENCES (52%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (78%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (69%)  		UNITED NATIONS (57%)  		Disasters  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (90%); BEIJING, CHINA (73%) MASSACHUSETTS, USA (92%); ILLINOIS, USA (90%); NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (73%) UNITED STATES (96%); CHINA (94%); POLAND (91%); JAPAN (79%); CANADA (79%); EUROPE (79%); GERMANY (68%); CENTRAL EUROPE (58%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); JOHN KERRY (91%); BAN KI-MOON (50%)  	20081212-TB-Barack-Obama-s-envoy-at-UN-climate-talks-presses-China-to-step-up-emissions-cuts-1212  	TB

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Trimming smog and soot offer immediate impact on climate change, study says  	By Douglas Fischer, Daily Climate  	BREAKING; Environment; News; Local; Business  	1153 words  	Local and state regulators have new ammunition in the fight to justify expensive air pollution rules: Cutting smog and soot has an immediate impact on climate change.LiNeBrEaKA study published this week bolsters the link between air quality and climate, finding that across-the-board cuts in air pollution can spur "substantial, simultaneous improvement" in local air quality and near-term mitigation of climate change.LiNeBrEaKTrimming smog and soot also represents an alternate and far more immediate global warming solution for regulators stymied by the complexities of other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Sciences and the lead author of the study.LiNeBrEaKTackling air pollution can buy 20 to 30 years worth of mitigation, he said - time that will be needed, if ongoing debates in Poznan, Brussells and Washington D.C. offer any indication - to cut the political and economic knots associated with carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaKThe health benefits also make a strong case for action to countries that have so far resisted climate mitigation for its own sake. These pollutants - soot, ozone, and smog-causing volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides - have well-documented effects on human health. Trimming emissions produces easily quantifiable benefits.LiNeBrEaK"This is no substitute for targeting carbon dioxide, which in the long run is the main contributor" to climate change, Shindell said. "But if you want to have any effect in the near-term, ... the short-lived pollutants can have very large impacts."LiNeBrEaKThe climate-warming effects of these short-lived pollutants have largely been ignored by scientists and regulators focusing on climate policy. Carbon dioxide, with a lifetime of many centuries, is the star of that show, and the effects on climate by these other pollutants, which endure for mere months, are less well understood.LiNeBrEaKRegulators also have no way to quantify - as they must when making public health rules - the cost and benefit of climate mitigation. It's impossible to put a cost, for instance, on averting global temperature rise by a few thousandths or even hundredths of a degree.LiNeBrEaKStill, a collective focus on limiting these pollutants could substantially affect 21st century climate. Several climate models, Shindell and his colleagues showed in a study published Monday in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, suggest that reducing air pollutants in both North America and Asia can produce an immediate cooling effect on climate - certainly far faster than any action on longer-lived emissions like carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK"It's much, much faster, as fast as it could possibly be," Shindell said.LiNeBrEaKRegulators are noticing.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's transition team on Thursday got briefed on emissions and climate and is exploring what tools federal agencies need to better mitigate impacts, said Ellen Baum, a senior scientist with Clean Air Task Force, a Boston-based non-profit that has spent years trying to link climate and urban pollution.LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday California approved the most aggressive plan in the nation to slash greenhouse gas emissions and meet state climate targets. Regulators continue that work today, voting to force 1 million big rig owners to clean up diesel exhaust. Both state rules carry climate and health benefits.LiNeBrEaK"We are now incorporating the climate change benefit, if there is one, into our environmental analysis and staff reports when we propose new regulations," said Sam Atwood, spokesman for the state's South Coast Air Quality Management District, charged with improving air quality for 17 million people in the four-county Los Angeles Basin.LiNeBrEaKThat can be "difficult and dicey," he cautioned. "There are not a lot of protocols for different kinds of climate-change gas reductions.... Every time we propose a tough regulation, we have to make a very strong case for why the benefits outweigh the costs."LiNeBrEaKTools and calculations for measuring public-health benefits are robust and well established; climate mitigation, in contrast, is in its infancy.LiNeBrEaKBut in a system structured to maximizing health goals, throwing climate in the mix could change priorities - even without quantification, many experts note.LiNeBrEaKGround-level ozone, or smog, is one example, said Baum of the Clean Air Task Force. It's a powerful greenhouse gas. But the nation's health-based rules generally focus on reducing peaks, while every-day background most affects climate.LiNeBrEaK"It's a wave versus sea-level thing," Baum said. Health officers are focused on reducing the wave - the late-afternoon summertime ozone spike - but Baum and others would like to see more effort aimed at reducing the sea-level, or background.LiNeBrEaK" Reducing background ozone isn't the best strategy for reducing ozone peaks, but if we reduce background, there will be a reduction in the peaks as well," she said. "It's a tough nut to crack, though. It's not going to be easy."LiNeBrEaKBlack carbon, or soot, is another example. A byproduct of diesel engines, soot is a tough pollutant to reduce. Regulators can often obtain the same health benefit by focusing on other easier-to-control compounds, like sulfates from power plants.LiNeBrEaKBut sulfates cool the atmosphere. Black carbon has a well-established warming effect. Add that information, and imposing limits on black carbon start to look a little more palatable, regulators and scientists say.LiNeBrEaKThe benefits extend far beyond the United States' borders.LiNeBrEaKGrowing emissions from Asia and India represent an enormous percentage of near-term climate change, Shindell and others note. Their emissions, particularly soot, have far-flung impact - from shrinking Arctic icepack to prolonged droughts in America's breadbasket.LiNeBrEaKEvidence quantifying that impact on the Arctic will be disclosed next week at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting in San Francisco. Researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found that the "Arctic haze" - a soup of aerosols, ozone, volatile organic compounds and other industrial pollutants - contributes to the shrinking icepack and changes ice flow dynamics during the spring melt.LiNeBrEaKBut what's exciting, Shindell notes, is the potential for rapid change. Carbon dioxide takes decades to mix, adjust and start to warm the planet. These short-lived pollutants start to affect the Earth's climate almost instantly; turning them off produces rapid mitigation.LiNeBrEaKThe good news, say researchers, is that the divisions between climate research and air quality and long-term versus short-term impacts are disappearing.LiNeBrEaK"You will see over the next few years that this is going to get a lot more focus," said Gabriele Pfister, a scientist studying wildfires at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. "We know now you can't look at short-term effect without looking at long-term effect."LiNeBrEaKDouglas Fischer is editor of DailyClimate.org .

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Editorial: Chu will change direction  	MediaNews editorial  	OPINION; Editorials  	389 words  	PRESIDENT-ELECT Barack Obama will demonstrate his commitment to major change on energy policy with his expected announcement of UC Berkeley Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to be the next U.S. energy secretary. LiNeBrEaKAfter eight years of Bush administration policy on global warming in which science has taken a back seat to politics, the Chu appointment signals that Obama is serious about dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and alternative energy development.LiNeBrEaKAs Obama said this week, "The time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way."LiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Berkeley lab since 2004 as well as professor of physics and molecular and cell biology, has emphasized a cross-disciplinary approach to research into finding ways to combat climate change, including development of biofuels and solar energy. He is formerly the head of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKAs director of the Berkeley lab, the oldest of the Energy Department's national laboratories, Chu oversees 4,000 employees and a $650 million budget.LiNeBrEaKHe has pushed the lab to be a world leader in alternative and renewable energy research.LiNeBrEaKHe shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1997 with two other scientists for his research into ways to cool and trap atoms using laser light. By supercooling atoms, they found the movement of atoms can be slowed to a point where they could be trapped and manipulated.LiNeBrEaKChu began focusing his work on energy and climate change after becoming concerned about the growing evidence that global warming is a significant threat.LiNeBrEaKTo be sure, Chu's responsibilities as energy secretary will extend far beyond climate change and alternative energy development. He will also be responsible for overseeing maintenance of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and modernizing the nation's electric power delivery system.LiNeBrEaKWe are confident that Chu, one of the nation's brightest scientists, is up for the task. Indeed, along with the selection of UC Berkeley economics professor Christina Romer to be chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Obama is tapping some of Berkeley's smartest people to be part of his team.

The Daily News of Los Angeles 	December 12, 2008 Friday   VALLEY EDITION	We must move toward a 'green' energy state  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A17  	559 words  	THE national and state economies are in severe distress, and cities and counties aren't in much better condition. President-elect Barack Obama and congressional leaders have spoken of developing a new energy economy that promises to create millions of jobs and rely increasingly on renewable, "green" power. LiNeBrEaKThe time to embrace this vision and create the infrastructure to handle the energy solutions of the future is now!LiNeBrEaKCalifornia has already begun embracing the vision with an energy policy and global warming initiative that promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase use of energy sources like solar, geothermal, wind and bio-fuels while utilizing fossil fuels such as natural gas and oil to effectively balance the energy portfolio as we move toward a new and better future.LiNeBrEaKCreating the necessary infrastructure to carry out the vision will require the building of new systems and the strengthening of existing ones. Citizens in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys have the opportunity to help initiate the process by endorsing San Diego Gas and Electric's Sunrise Powerlink, a proposed 120-mile electric transmission line that will connect the state's power grid to renewable energy projects planned for the Imperial County (a desert region rich in clean energy resources) and significantly strengthen our aging energy infrastructure and increase the system's reliability.LiNeBrEaKIn other words, it will help ensure that the power we expect when we turn on the lights will actually be there as our state continues its rapid growth.LiNeBrEaKIncredibly, after an arduous three-year review process, there are still some activist groups seeking to derail this very important step toward a new energy economy in our state. Citizens in our valleys need to stand up and be counted in favor of the Sunrise Powerlink.LiNeBrEaKWithout the Sunrise Powerlink, much of the solar, wind and geothermal energy we're counting on to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the state's renewable energy targets cannot be delivered to customers. This is a problem throughout the state.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, a recent California Public Utilities Commission report says 50 percent of green energy projects are at risk for failure due to a lack of transmission lines.LiNeBrEaKThankfully, the CPUC appears to be moving in the right direction, and is poised to finally decide the matter this month. Two alternative plans approving Sunrise have been proposed, and it appears that the commission may be headed into a political dogfight to determine which one will prevail.LiNeBrEaKThe alternative authored by CPUC President Michael Peevey is the preferred plan. It ensures that this vital, much need electric transmission line will be built quickly, and it proposes to use existing CPUC powers to ensure that the line will deliver a substantial amount of clean energy to California homes and businesses. Peevey's plan provides an estimated savings to ratepayers of approximately $125 million in energy costs - a welcome benefit in these tough economic times.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Department of Energy has said that Southern California's aging power grid is one of the weakest in the country. We can and must remedy this.LiNeBrEaKPlease join the Valley Industry and Commerce Association in writing to the CPUC at 505 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94102, and urge the commissioners to approve the Peevey plan.

LiNeBrEaKThe association, English said, represents about 42 million consumers who own electric cooperatives in 47 states.LiNeBrEaK"Obviously, we are very focused on two things," he said. "First, we want to be sure our members get the power they need. Second, we want to make certain that the power is affordable."LiNeBrEaKComing needsLiNeBrEaKEnglish said the U.S. Energy Department estimates the nation will need an additional 265 gigawatts of base load power during the next two decades.LiNeBrEaKThe cost to build the power plants needed to provide that additional power will be expensive because of recent building booms in China and India -- and that's even before the potential costs of carbon capturing and sequestration are factored in, English said.LiNeBrEaKEnglish said there's not much question that climate change legislation is coming.LiNeBrEaKSome of everythingLiNeBrEaK"And it's not so much whether it is right or wrong, or good or bad. The question is, how smart are we going to be in developing our approach?"LiNeBrEaKEnglish said the nation's incoming leaders need to focus on how much power the nation will need, when it will be needed, and where it will come from.LiNeBrEaK"That's contrary to the way we usually do business in this nation," he said. "But I am hopeful we can avoid that kind of crisis, and I think that is going to depend on the wisdom of our leaders to balance off all these various needs of the country."LiNeBrEaKDifficult to buildLiNeBrEaKNew coal generation, he said, will be difficult, if not impossible to build. That means natural gas and renewables come into the mix, and so does energy conservation through efficiency upgrades.LiNeBrEaK"But each of those has some issues that the government will have to address," English said.LiNeBrEaKPoorest need helpLiNeBrEaKFor natural gas, price is the issue. Renewables, such as wind, must have transmission lines to get power from the Great Plains to population centers on the East and West coasts. And when it comes to efficiency upgrades, the nation's poorest residents are the ones who need the most help.LiNeBrEaK"Tax credits don't help those folks," he said.LiNeBrEaK"We think there is a very real possibility that a sizeable segment of the nation's population will be unable to afford electricity on a regular basis," he said. "As bills go up, that puts more stress on people. It will become a real burden for them."

The Denver Post 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	The aliens are here. Can science save us?  	Lisa Kennedy Denver Post Film Critic  	Pg. D-08  	676 words  	The close encounter in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" doesn'tLiNeBrEaKexactly begin with a warm "how do you do" for the being sent toLiNeBrEaKwarn humans they are on the wrong course.When the visitor emerges from a giant sphere parked in Central Park, he's shot.LiNeBrEaKWhat happens once the wounded extraterrestrial is transported to a secure location to be operated on feels like a scene from one of those Discovery Health trauma shows: "E.T. with a GSW to the ER, stat." LiNeBrEaK"The Day the Earth Stood Still," starring Keanu Reeves as alien Klaatu, is a slight, goofy, sentimental riff on humans - our catastrophe-courting foibles, as well as our goodness.LiNeBrEaKCasting Reeves as the alien that a surgeon discovers encased in a placental goo makes sense. The actor has a gift for looking slightly new to the world. And he maintains the pose of being fresh to this planet and his human form throughout.LiNeBrEaKOscar-winner Jennifer Connelly plays astrobiologist Helen Benson. One of a number of scientists the government enlists (kidnaps is more like it), she becomes Klaatu's guide. She is also our representative of human decency.LiNeBrEaKDirector Scott Derrickson and writer David Scarpa have updated Edmund H. North's script for the 1951 sci-fi flick. In place of a Cold War allegory about an alien that comes to chide humans for their violence toward each other, they've delivered a global-warming parable.LiNeBrEaKPoor Earth. Poor humans. It's no surprise that the latter need the former more than the reverse. Not unlike last year's very earnest enviro-doc, "The 11th Hour," this cautionary flick isn't just about our sorry stewardship of the planet. It also mourns humankind's potential demise.LiNeBrEaKA melancholy ache runs through "The Day the Earth Stood Still." In a roadside diner, an alien who has lived among us for 70 years reports to Klaatu that humans are destructive. Still, he doesn't want to leave.LiNeBrEaKOur potential for kindness is embodied in the relationship between Helen and stepson Jacob (Jaden Smith of "The Pursuit of Happyness"). She loves him. Angry at the death of his father, he rebuffs her. She remains constant.LiNeBrEaKOne of the film's sweeter moments comes early, when a soldier catches Helen talking on a prohibited cellphone to Jacob. It's a scene that asserts that we are creatures of profound attachments. Some are even worthwhile.LiNeBrEaKStill, the initial lesson gleaned from "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is that humans overreact mightily to the unknown.LiNeBrEaKKathy Bates plays Regina Jackson, the secretary of defense. The prez and the veep are already hunkered in their respective bunkers. So she's the movie's muscle in a situation that could have used some soft-power diplomacy.LiNeBrEaKThere's not a lot of sophistication to the screenplay's depiction of global politics in crisis. The smarts, such as they are, are poured into the science, or at least how scientists are portrayed. They are a curious bunch, not immune to shock and awe and, sigh, hope.LiNeBrEaKMathematicians and other braniacs in the audience may get a giggle out of the equation found on the blackboard of professor Barnhardt, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Helen and Klaatu visit.LiNeBrEaKThe rest might get a kick out of the guy who plays him, John Cleese ("What is my theory? This is it. ...")LiNeBrEaKFor a too-brief moment, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" looks like it might honor its cheesier 1950s origins. In a ravaging soundstage storm, a lone explorer (also Reeves) comes across an orb that looks like a cross between a giant marble and a murky crystal ball.LiNeBrEaKWhat does it portend? Not all we'd have hoped for.LiNeBrEaK"The Day the Earth Stood Still" doesn't lack heart. It's surprisingly sincere.LiNeBrEaKNo, the human quality it could use a bit more of is humor.LiNeBrEaK---------------------------------------- ** sci-fi flickLiNeBrEaK"the day the earth stood still."

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	A conspiracy with legs;  The growing possibility of a one-world government 		EDITORIAL; Pg. A13  	681 words  	WASHINGTON -- For years I have received letters written as elegantly as ransom notes, advising me of certain worldwide conspiracies. Sometimes the writing instrument of choice has been a crayon.LiNeBrEaKThe most dangerous conspirators, said many of the scribblers, were the Jews, who allegedly were intent on dominating the world's finances and everything else, which would be remarkable, given their small number. Then it was the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission that supposedly were conspiring individually and collectively to ruin America through their secret meetings and conspiratorial plotting. I dismissed these because I know members of both and found at least those I knew to be patriotic Americans.LiNeBrEaKI consigned all the letters to the same file, File 13, which held other bogus conspiracies, from the late atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair's alleged attempts to ban religious broadcasting, to the "fluoridation is a commie plot" campaign of the '50s to GM's supposed "death car," which was said to cause the demise of whoever owned it. LiNeBrEaKRecently, though, I have been giving more serious consideration to another "conspiracy" that seems to be growing legs. It is the conspiracy of one-world government. As governments increasingly demand more power to direct and shape our future by mandating how we live (not to mention their increasing invasiveness with cameras, wiretaps and other forms of "monitoring"), those who believe in individual liberty are on the defense.LiNeBrEaKOn Dec. 8, columnist Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times (www.ft.com) wrote as if he, too, is a reluctant conspiracist, listing themes related to global concerns: a global financial crisis, "global warming" and the global war on terror. He also pointed to the obvious shrinkage of the world through communication. In this, he is of the same frame of mind as Thomas Friedman in his book "The World is Flat."LiNeBrEaKRachman quoted Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey: "For the first time in human history, world government of some sort is now possible." Blainey forecasts its establishment as some time in the next 200 years. I think it could arrive much sooner.LiNeBrEaKThe European Union might be Barack Obama's model, as could the United Nations. In nominating his top campaign aide, Susan Rice, to be America's UN ambassador, Obama also announced his intention to raise the post to cabinet rank. In his book, "The Audacity of Hope," Obama wrote, "When the world's sole superpower willingly restrains its power and abides by internationally agreed-upon standards of conduct, it sends a message that these rules are worth following."LiNeBrEaKIn fact, the message it sends is that the ideas and ideals which made America unique in the world are no longer worth following, because in a one-world government, the United States would inevitably have to compromise its beliefs, laws, faith and everything else that makes it unique. European and Third World leaders would effectively be running the show. Barack Obama was elected president of the United States, not president of a world order, or worse, one of many equals among one of many nations that are nothing special.LiNeBrEaKIt's bad enough to have the Democratic Congress dictating to Detroit and borrowing money from the Chinese to keep automakers afloat, as they make cars fewer people want. It would be something far worse to have a world body pass laws that require Americans to live by standards they would never choose for themselves.LiNeBrEaKRachman concluded on an optimistic note. Noting that even within the EU, a one-world government remains unpopular, he wrote, "The world's most pressing political problems may indeed be international in nature, but the average citizen's political identity remains stubbornly local."LiNeBrEaKMaybe, but if we get too many "global" crises happening at once, the clamor for a one-world government to bring order, even at the expense of liberty, may be too strong for some politicians to resist. So, yes, I'm starting to believe in the possibility of one-world government and it should be vigorously opposed if America, as we know it, is to be preserved.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	E.T. Go home;  'The day the earth stood still' remake all bang, no brains 		YOUR LIFE; Pg. E1  	572 words  	'If you die, the Earth survives."LiNeBrEaKThese are the words of the extraterrestrial Klaatu in "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Apparently, humans are like termites eating through load-bearing beams and must be exterminated lest the place crumble. But the analogy fails when considering our cognitive abilities, which enable us, as we learned during the recent election, to do things such as hope and change.LiNeBrEaKIt takes a while for Klaatu to understand this. He is a rigorously logical being, an alien mind, stiffly and awkwardly inhabiting the body of Keanu Reeves, perfectly cast because he often seems stiff and awkward, even when not asked to be. Klaatu talks in a kind of vague riddlespeak, all the better for him to keep his motives mysterious and explain things in the third act. Even then, the non-specific nature of his wooden speech only frustrates. LiNeBrEaKWhat, exactly, are we Earthlings doing wrong? We can only assume it's our influence on global climate change or our self-destructive nature. What stands in the way of this film's exploration of these ideas? Well, it insists upon blowing things up for our entertainment. Please, take a moment to savor the irony.LiNeBrEaKThe original "Day the Earth Stood Still" from 1951 -- an indisputable classic -- was a smart, timely product of the nuclear age. Noisy, expensive and gussied up for 21st-century cineplexes, this ill-fated remake assumes we are dumb and easily amused, bungling its chance to engage our higher functions.LiNeBrEaKThankfully, Klaatu never asks the one Earth woman he trusts, Helen (Jennifer Connelly), what this thing called "love" is, although she must engage in a cornball breakthrough with her stepson, Jacob (Jaden Smith), before he truly comprehends the complexity of the human mind. The annoyingly precocious Smith weeps. The usually credible Connelly weeps, too. And Reeves looks baffled and inexpressive, and therefore is entirely in his element.LiNeBrEaKThe plot: Helen is an astrobiologist, a kind of theoretical E.T. expert. She's rounded up by government suits due to a national security issue. A thing is zooming through the solar system. It's not an asteroid. And it's going to land in Manhattan imminently. How imminently? A digital readout: 78 minutes. Uh oh.LiNeBrEaKScientists and soldiers gather for the landing of a glowing orb in Central Park. A figure emerges and stretches its hand toward Helen. But, as humans under governmental authority tend to shoot first and ask questions later, a bullet rips through the alien's flesh, which consists of grayish gloop, eventually shed for Klaatu's emergence. The act of aggression enrages Klaatu's giant-robot bodyguard GORT, who sports a 2008 "Battlestar Galactica" Cylon/Knight Rider red eye slot; it neutralizes everything in its vicinity with a piercing sonic blast.LiNeBrEaKSo much for diplomacy. Klaatu seems to be a creature ruled by logic, so in order to help him, Helen must subvert the conspiratorial cover-upishness of U.S. Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), who insists upon maintaining the illusion of control.LiNeBrEaKDirector Scott Derrickson shows us scenes of global pre-apocalyptic panic -- you know, looting and mass-exodusing and such -- but never lends much gravity to the drama before he starts blowing things up, unleashing a torrent of unconvincing CGI and racing to a sloppy climax. And up in smoke go ideas about optimism and pessimism, benevolence and aggression, things for which this movie refuses to stand still.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Environment, energy White House priorities;  Ex-EPA chief Browner to promote Obama anti-pollution policies 		NATIONAL; Pg. A4  	417 words  	WASHINGTON -- It hit Carol Browner in the final weeks of the Clinton administration: She had been head of the Environmental Protection Agency for eight years, nearly a quarter of the agency's existence, far longer than any other administrator. LiNeBrEaKAnd they were tumultuous years. Conservative Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America, were pushing to reduce government regulations and -- as Browner said at the time -- had her agency "front and center in its cross hairs."LiNeBrEaKNow, nearly eight years later, Browner will soon return to the center of the political battles over environment and energy -- this time as a powerful voice within the White House of President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKBrowner brings a strong environmental resume to the White House, having worked as an attorney and management consultant on environmental issues from clean air regulations to climate change. She has called for a shift in the nation's environmental agenda away from that of President George W. Bush, whose tenure she described as "the worst environmental administration ever." She has blamed the Bush White House with undermining scientists, stalling and in some cases reversing clean air improvements, and refusing to address climate change.LiNeBrEaKWhile it's unclear what role Browner will play as head of Obama's White House energy and environment council, she is certain to have the ear of the new president, who has promised to make energy -- including a push toward renewable sources -- and tackling climate change priorities.LiNeBrEaKWhile at the EPA, Browner argued that environmental protection and economic development can coexist. She sought to bring in business interests to reach compromises on environmental regulations. When defending new regulations, she has argued businesses can find ways to meet tougher standards without undue costs.LiNeBrEaK"Time and time again, naysayers have warned it will cost too much, that it will impose an enormous economic burden," Browner told a congressional hearing in September. "But once we have set those standards, American ingenuity and innovation have found a solution at a far lower costs than predicted."LiNeBrEaKBefore her stint at EPA, Browner worked as legislative director for then-Sen. Al Gore of Tennessee.LiNeBrEaKWithin hours of word of her new role in the Obama administration, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., a longtime antagonist, called her " a proud liberal who has long advocated an agenda that would drive up energy costs on families and put thousands of Americans out of jobs."

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Nobel winner to steer energy policy;  Chu called advocate for alternative power 		NATIONAL; Pg. A4  	278 words  	WASHINGTON -- Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is President-elect Barack Obama's choice for Energy secretary, has been a vocal advocate for more research into alternative energy, arguing that a shift away from fossil fuels is essential to combat global warming. LiNeBrEaKChu, a Chinese-American and director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, has campaigned to bring together a cross-section of scientific disciplines to find ways to counter climate change.LiNeBrEaKIf action is not taken now to stop global warming, it may be too late, he argues.LiNeBrEaKSince 2004, Chu has been director of the Berkeley lab, the oldest of the Energy Department's national labs, with its 4,000 employees and a budget of $650 million. The laboratory under Chu, 60, has been a center of research into biofuels and solar energy technologies. He is a former head of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKBorn to Chinese parents in St. Louis, he grew up in New York City. His father, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and professor of chemical engineering, and mother came to the United States in 1943.LiNeBrEaKOne of the country's most renowned scientists, Chu in 1997 shared the Nobel Prize in physics with two other scientists for his research into ways to cool and trap atoms using laser light.LiNeBrEaKChu's scientific interests have centered on finding ways to replace fossil fuels with other energy sources such as biofuels from plants and converting energy from the sun into a fuel. He has spoken frequently about the need to link the physical and biological sciences with engineering to rally independent-thinking scientists in the fight against climate change.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   ALL S EDITION	Obama pick historic for EPA;  Jackson comes to embattled agency with extensive experience as N.J. environmental chief 		NATIONAL; Pg. A4  	421 words  	WASHINGTON -- Lisa Jackson is in line to become the first black person to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama intends to announce Jackson as EPA administrator soon, barring any unforeseen dramas, officials close to the transition say. LiNeBrEaKJackson, a chemical engineer, would take the helm at the agency at a time of record-low morale and when it is still grappling with how to respond to a 2007 Supreme Court decision that said it could regulate the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.LiNeBrEaKDuring the Bush administration, the White House has at times overruled the advice of the EPA's scientific advisers and the agency's staff on issues ranging from air pollution to global warming.LiNeBrEaKSupporters say Jackson, 46, has the experience to steer the agency down a new path.LiNeBrEaKShe spent 16 years at the EPA in Washington and in New York before being hired at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2002, an agency that has been riddled by budget cuts and personnel shortages. Jackson was named the head of the department in 2006 by Gov. Jon Corzine, overseeing environmental regulation in a state plagued by pollution problems and home to the most hazardous waste sites in the country.LiNeBrEaKIn her short tenure, Jackson has worked to pass mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases, to reform the state's cleanup of contaminated sites and to establish a scientific advisory board to review agency decisions.LiNeBrEaK"In New Jersey, you're working on contaminated sites, you're working on open space, endangered species, clean water. New Jersey is the laboratory for environmental protection. Whatever bad happens in the environment, it happens in New Jersey first. It is a good proving ground," said Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey Chapter of the Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaKWhitman, a moderate Republican, found herself occasionally at odds with the Bush White House over environmental issues and became a lightning rod for the administration's critics.LiNeBrEaKA small but vocal contingent of environmental groups came out against Jackson last week, however, asking President-elect Barack Obama to drop her as a candidate.LiNeBrEaKIn a letter to the transition team, the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that represents environmentally-minded state and federal employees, said it was "distressed" that Jackson was under consideration.LiNeBrEaKAs evidence, they cited an EPA inspector general report that found that New Jersey failed to use its authority to expedite cleanups at seven hazardous waste sites.

The Houston Chronicle 	December 12, 2008 Friday   3 STAR EDITION	California adopts strong limits on greenhouse gases;  Climate plan draws a bead on worst polluters 	SAMANTHA YOUNG, Associated Press  	A; Pg. 25  	671 words  	SACRAMENTO, CALIF. - California air regulators adopted a sweeping new climate plan Thursday that would require the state's utilities, refineries and large factories to transform their operations to cut greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe California Air Resources Board voted unanimously to adopt the nation's most comprehensive global warming plan, outlining for the first time how individuals and businesses would meet a landmark 2006 law that made the state a leader on global climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe plan would hold California's worst polluters accountable for the heat-trapping emissions they produce - transforming how people travel, how utilities generate power and how businesses use electricity. LiNeBrEaKAt the heart of the plan is the creation of a carbon-credit market designed to give the state's major polluters cheaper ways to cut the amount of their emissions. That market and the many other strategies referenced in the plan will be fleshed out and adopted over the next few years.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's plan comes at a time when governments around the world are struggling with a financial crisis that threatens to undermine efforts to fight climate change. California itself is facing a forecast budget gap of $41. 8 billion through June 2010.LiNeBrEaKRepublican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Thursday that California was providing a roadmap for the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaK"Today is the day we help unleash the full force of California's innovation and technology for a healthier planet, a stronger and more robust economy and a safer and more secure energy future," Schwarzenegger said.LiNeBrEaKIn accord with ObamaLiNeBrEaKHis sentiments echo those of President-elect Barack Obama, who also has promoted investments in energy efficiency and green technology to help spur the country out of recession.LiNeBrEaKLast month, Obama said he hoped Congress would adopt California's targets, essentially reversing eight years of U.S. policy against mandated emission cuts.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's 2006 law, called the Global Warming Solutions Act, commonly referred to as AB32, mandates the state cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThe strategy chosen by air regulators relies on 31 new rules affecting all facets of life, from the fuels Californians put in their vehicles to the air conditioners businesses install in their buildings.LiNeBrEaKDrawbacks pointed outLiNeBrEaKBut there will also be costs.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia drivers will see more expensive cars on showroom floors and should expect to pay higher power bills as utilities increase their use of renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKRepublicans, small businesses and major industries that will be forced to transform operations beginning in 2012 say jobs will be lost, companies might leave the state and energy prices will skyrocket.LiNeBrEaK"The deepening recession has affected businesses throughout the state," Amisha Patel, a policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce, told the board. "The reality of climate regulation is there will be costs."LiNeBrEaKThe air board's background work has been criticized in reviews by California's nonpartisan legislative analyst and independent scientists, with both groups saying the costs to the state could be greater than projected.LiNeBrEaKMEXICO HAS PLAN TO CAP EMISSIONSLiNeBrEaKMexico has become the first developing country to announce a cap on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping countries upbraided rich nations at U.N. climate talks Thursday in Poland, saying they were refusing to act boldly enough to stop global warming.LiNeBrEaKMexico's environment secretary, Juan Rafael Elvira, announced his country's plan to cut 2002 greenhouse gas emission levels 50 percent by 2050. Still, he said Mexico's goal of using solar power, wind and other clean technologies could only be reached with help from wealthier nations.LiNeBrEaKThe Mexican plan includes a cap-and-trade system that would set emissions limits on certain sectors, such as cement, electricity and oil refining, which account for the vast majority of its emissions.LiNeBrEaKCompanies that reduce their emissions below those limits could sell their unused allowances on the international carbon market.LiNeBrEaKASSOCIATED PRESS	EMISSIONS (91%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (89%); RECESSION (88%); ECONOMIC NEWS (88%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (79%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (78%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); AIR QUALITY (78%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); OIL and GAS PRICES (77%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (73%); LAYOFFS (73%); CARBON OFFSETS (72%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (72%); SMALL BUSINESS (71%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (70%); EMPLOYMENT (62%) nation Ecology Air Pollution  	CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (93%)  				SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (93%) CALIFORNIA, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Houston Chronicle Publishing Company All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (83%); ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (68%)  			SACRAMENTO, CALIF.   											
The Houston Chronicle 	December 12, 2008 Friday   3 STAR EDITION	SCI-FI;  Earth Stood Still new, not improved 	JOE LEYDON, FOR THE CHRONICLE  	STAR; Pg. 3  	653 words  	THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILLLiNeBrEaKRated PG-13: For some sci-fi disaster images and violenceLiNeBrEaKRunning time: 103 minutesLiNeBrEaKArguably the worst reconstitution of a '50s sci-fi classic since the ghastly Godzilla remake - that 1998 travesty made by boneheads who forgot the Original Gangsta Lizard can, like, breathe fire - The Day the Earth Stood Still is a stunningly misconceived folly that is bearable only for as long as it remains a fair-to-middling chase movie. During its final act, alas, it repeatedly sacrifices narrative logic for CGI-spawned spectacle, all the while building toward an ending that aims for the ambiguity of 2001, but misses by several light years. LiNeBrEaKFor the benefit of those who tuned in late: The original 1951 Day the Earth Stood Still was a cautionary Cold War-era fable - intelligently scripted by Edmund North, efficiently directly by Robert Wise - about a tough-loving extraterrestrial, Klaatu (played with unflappable dignity by Michael Rennie), who issues an ultimatum to earthlings hellbent on threatening each other (and, by extension, the rest of the universe) with nuclear weapons: Chill out, or get chilled. Klaatu is accompanied on his peacemaking mission by a humongous robot named Gort - a laser-armed behemoth who responds to the classic command, "Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!" - but he demonstrates his ability to obliterate humanity in a scrupulously nonviolent (yet totally convincing) fashion.LiNeBrEaKIn the new but not improved version, Keanu Reeves takes over the role of Klaatu, who's been re-imagined by director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) and scriptwriter David Scarpa as a vaguely defined alien life force that assumes human form, and doesn't seem particularly happy about it. Rennie underacted the part to the point of sporadic stasis, but Reeves makes him look in retrospect like an over-caffeinated showoff. On the other hand - and there's no way to say this without sounding snarky - Reeves has the edge when it comes to conveying the concept of a stranger in a strange land, and a strange body. The deliberateness of Reeves' gestures and the monotone of his speech, often cause for unintended laughter in other movies, are altogether appropriate here.LiNeBrEaKSo it's not really Reeves' fault that this updated remake - in which Klaatu has zero tolerance for global warming, not nuclear proliferation - is about as satisfying as a plate of lukewarm leftovers.LiNeBrEaKDerrickson lavishes expensive production values on his twice-told tale, and, to his credit, generates some modest suspense here and there.LiNeBrEaKAfter being wounded by a trigger-happy Army marksman, Klaatu escapes from a heavily-guarded government laboratory and takes flight with a sympathetic scientist (Jennifer Connelly, in the kinda-sorta equivalent of the role originally played by Patricia Neal) and her too-cute-by-half stepson (Jaden Smith).LiNeBrEaKAnd even though they're being pursued by what looks like all branches of the U.S. armed services and the combined police departments of three or four states, the fugitives have time to briefly visit another scientist (John Cleese) while making a wink-wink, nudge-nudge allusion to a key scene from the '51 film.LiNeBrEaKBut the remake jumps the tracks, and quickly plummets into frenzied incoherence, when the new film's bigger and badder version of Gort transforms itself into ? into ... well, gee, it's hard to describe. A swarm of high-tech locusts, maybe?LiNeBrEaKIn any event, what follows is a great deal of f/x excess, as various large items - a trailer truck here, a football stadium there - are arbitrarily destroyed in scenes that seem designed less to advance the plot than to jazz up TV ads and coming-attractions trailers.LiNeBrEaKThis in turn leads to an ending that reprises Klaatu's ultimate power play from the '51 movie, for no apparent purpose. After that, the remake doesn't conclude, it merely stops.LiNeBrEaKAt which point, audiences can be forgiven for shouting rude remarks at the screen.

EDITION	Endangered species to get fewer reviews  	Associated Press  	A; Pg. 9  	203 words  	WASHINGTON - The Bush administration issued revised endangered species regulations Thursday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe changes, which will go into effect in about 30 days, were completed in just four months. They will eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step developers and other federal agencies blamed for delays and cost increases.LiNeBrEaKThe rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species from a project's contribution to increased global warming.LiNeBrEaKInterior Department officials described the changes as "narrow," but admitted that the regulations were controversial. Environmentalists viewed them as eroding the protections for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKInterior officials said federal agencies could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis, and that other parts of the law will ensure species are protected.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing ... relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure species are not harmed," said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne.

It couldn't be predicted that the second engine on the jet also would fail, forcing the pilot to eject and bringing the aircraft down onto a two-story home where it killed four people, the generals said at a closed congressional briefing, according to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. In the wake of Monday's crash, some have questioned why the jet didn't divert toward a coastal air station instead of continuing over neighborhoods toward Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. A number of factors made Miramar the right call at the time, the generals said. They emphasized that double-engine failure is extraordinarily rare. "Evidence indicates the pilot followed procedures correctly up to the moment" he ejected, Hunter said.LiNeBrEaKSOUTH CAROLINALiNeBrEaKSuspicious letters go to 8 more statesLiNeBrEaKCOLUMBIA, S.C. - Eight more states have intercepted envelopes sent to government offices containing suspicious powder.

Envelopes containing suspicious powder have already been received in a dozen other state capitals, including Austin, this week. Officials in some of those states say the powder was flour, corn starch or some other harmless food substance.LiNeBrEaKJudge halts `I believe' platesLiNeBrEaKCOLUMBIA - A federal judge says South Carolina must stop marketing and making license plates with a cross and the words "I Believe."

The Hutchinson News (Kansas)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Polluted idea: Taxing the gas from cows, cattle could take air out of small farms  	The Hutchinson News, Kan.  	COMMENTARY  	424 words  	Dec. 12--In an effort to expand enforcement of the Clean Air Act, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has kicked around the idea of creating a tax on the methane released by the nation's livestock. LiNeBrEaKKansas, the third-largest beef-producing state with 6. 7 million head of cattle, likely would pay more than its fair share under such a tax -- which could be as much as $175 a dairy cow, or $87. 50 for each head of beef cattle.LiNeBrEaKWhile the EPA's proposed regulation is preliminary, and unlikely to become active any time soon, placing a tax on methane released by livestock seems to reach beyond common sense and unnecessarily would harm many Kansas ranchers and farmers.LiNeBrEaKAnd on some level, taxing the gas from cows and goats is a little mind-boggling.LiNeBrEaKIt is not cattle or ranches most people think of when they consider poor air quality. It is large industrial smokestacks from smelters and coal plants and the millions of cars and trucks careening down the nation's highways.LiNeBrEaKWhile livestock is a leading source of greenhouse gas, further regulating the industry is likely to lead to other problems that have fewer possible solutions.LiNeBrEaKStrict emission regulations or additional fees potentially could drive smaller farmers out of business -- leaving behind only large, commercial operators that can afford the fees yet collectively emit more greenhouse gases in a more concentrated area.LiNeBrEaKSuch a move also could lead to an increase in beef prices, hurting both consumers and the cattle markets, which have been suffering from sluggish demand in recent years.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA should focus its efforts on the country's largest polluters and work with them to cut down dramatically on greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKAlong those lines, federal agencies can work with private industry to develop new technologies that limit emissions, or find ways to capture gases such as methane -- a burnable fuel -- and put them to good use.LiNeBrEaKAdditional efforts on increased gas mileage in vehicles and conservation efforts by American consumers also would be a better way to clean up the country's air -- without asking small farming operations to pay an additional tax.

Because of the large number of calls we receive, we cannot publish all the comments.LiNeBrEaKBig three bailout is big wasteLiNeBrEaK*Somebody called in and asked why Shelby and Sessions were against buying out the big three. They are against it because it is wasted money. They are overpaying their workers and making cars that nobody wants or can afford, and they need to change policies before they spend my money. They're against it because it is a waste of taxpayer dollars and will prolong the recession.LiNeBrEaKWipers on, lights on LiNeBrEaK* While driving around in the rain, I couldn't help but notice how many drivers didn't have their lights on. I guess they don't know it is a law in Alabama to have your lights on when your windshield wipers are on. Please be advised, drivers.LiNeBrEaKMafia started in SicilyLiNeBrEaK*Correction: The Mafia did not start in Chicago, it started in Sicily as a reaction to the abuses of the French occupying forces. People of the South should understand the agony that people feel when they are occupied by an army.LiNeBrEaKChamber in decline?LiNeBrEaK*I would like to comment on the Christmas Fest in Bay Minette. It was the most disappointing Christmas Fest that I have ever seen. The vendors were scattered out all over town, the few that were there. What is going on with North Baldwin Chamber of Commerce? It has just disappeared and gone down hill. They are never in the paper any more. You never hear any information from them. We never get news from them in our mailbox.LiNeBrEaKGet Saban out of 'our Sound Off'LiNeBrEaK*Yeah, I don't know what this call about Saban is doing over here in the Sound Off for the Baldwin Register. He belongs in the sports section. We don't need Nick Saban in our Sound Off.LiNeBrEaKFarmer's wife appalled by taxLiNeBrEaK*I have read some of the most hilarious and ridiculous things in the Baldwin Register and the Press-Register, but I think this on the farmers having to pay a fee for their cows and hogs with the flatulence: my God what's next? Are they going to want the farmers to pay a fee on the fertilizer dropped in the barnyards? Please help, and please tell me who to call and contact to get this thing turned around, because I have been a farmer's wife. Dogs and cats also have flatulence. Cats try to cover theirs up, but they don't always do it. What are we going to be taxed with next?LiNeBrEaKEditor's note: The tax proposal is one of several put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases emitted by belching and flatulence amounts to air pollution. Farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs would be required to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog. An EPA spokesman says that agency has not taken a position on any of the proposals. Farmers have expressed outrage over the idea, both on Internet sites and in opinions sent to EPA during a public comment period that ended last week.LiNeBrEaKCustomers would foot tax billLiNeBrEaK*To the person that is all for the flatulence tax for livestock, let me remind you of one thing: The next time you go out for a steak and instead of paying $12, you pay $18. I want to hear you put your money where you mouth is and be quiet, because the farmers won't be paying that tax, you will. Mark my words, you will pay that tax.LiNeBrEaKRethink pay raisesLiNeBrEaK* These salaried employees for the county who think they are supposed to get a 2. 5 percent raise, let them be teachers. We haven't gotten a raise in two years and probably won't get another in two more years. We have to live without a pay raise, so why shouldn't they? By the way, we usually have more education than a lot of those people who are on staff that are salary and make more money than us. We educate your children. We provide for the future. Are you providing for us now? I don't think so. The County Commission needs to rethink that. Don't give a pay raise; everybody else isn't getting one. What is fair for the goose is fair for the gander.LiNeBrEaKProblems persist in Gulf ShoresLiNeBrEaK*Will somebody please give Faron Hollinger a job? Now that he has made a mess of the Gulf Shores schools, he wants to leave. I thought with our new board member we were going to move forward; instead, we are moving back to where we were a few years ago. Wake up, Gulf Shores.LiNeBrEaK'Welcome to the 21st century'LiNeBrEaK*After reading the ridiculous statements about wind and solar power in Sound Off, I would suggest research before dialing Sound Off. Windmills do not rotate fast enough to kill migrating birds, and modern solar panels use AC inverters, not batteries. Welcome to the 21st century. By the way, I am a Republican and an engineer.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   01 EDITION	California adopts    tough climate plan  	SAMANTHA YOUNG, Associated Press Writer  	A; Pg. 08  	401 words  	California adoptsLiNeBrEaKtough climate planLiNeBrEaKBy SAMANTHA YOUNGLiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKSACRAMENTO, Calif. - California on Thursday adopted the nation's most sweeping plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, issuing rules that could transform everything from the way factories operate to the appliances people buy and the fuel they put in their cars. LiNeBrEaKThe eight-member Air Resources Board unanimously approved the plan despite warnings that it will put costly new burdens on businesses at a time when the economy is in extreme crisis, with California forecasting a staggering budget gap of $41. 8 billion through mid-2010.LiNeBrEaKRepublican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he believes the regulations will spur the state's economy and serve as a model for the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaK"When you look at today's depressed economy, green tech is one of the few bright spots out there, which is yet another reason we should move forward on our environmental goals," Schwarzenegger said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKThe strategy relies on 31 new rules affecting all facets of life, including where people may build their homes and what materials they use to do it.LiNeBrEaKOne central piece is a cap-and-trade program, set to begin in 2012, under which power plants, refineries and big factories will be able to buy and sell the right to emit heat-trapping gases. The program could give plant operators a financial incentive to reduce their carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKAir regulators said the average Californian could see more fuel-efficient cars and plug-in hybrids on showroom floors, better public transportation, housing nearer to schools and businesses, and utility rebates to make their homes more energy-efficient.LiNeBrEaKBut there will also be costs: Cars could become more expensive, and Californians can expect higher electric rates.LiNeBrEaKThe rules spell out in broad terms how the state intends to carry out a landmark 2006 California law. The law - conceived when the economy was in better shape - requires the state to cut greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKHALTED IN SOUTH CAROLINALiNeBrEaKJAMES MOORE/AP, Faith in TeachingLiNeBrEaKReligious license plates, such as this one from Florida, have generated controversy in South Carolina.

But they could take Obama much longer to reverse.LiNeBrEaKThey will eliminate some of the mandatory independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases.LiNeBrEaKThe rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project's contribution to increased global warming.LiNeBrEaKInterior Department officials described the changes as "narrow," but admitted that the regulations were controversial inside the agency. Environmentalists viewed them as eroding the protections for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKInterior officials said federal agencies could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis, and that other parts of the law will ensure that species are protected.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed," said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in a conference call with reporters.LiNeBrEaKCurrent rules require biologists in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to sign off on projects even when it is determined that they are not likely to harm species. The rule finalized Thursday would do away with that requirement, reducing the number of consultations so that the government's experts can focus on cases that pose the greatest harm to wildlife, officials said.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists said that the rule changes would put decisions about endangered species into the hands of agencies with a vested interest in advancing a project and with little expertise about wildlife. Several environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco hours after the rule's announcement.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration worked diligently to get the change in place before Obama took over, corralling 15 experts in Washington in October to sort through 250,000 written comments from the public on the revisions in 32 hours.LiNeBrEaKObama has said he would work to reverse the changes.

LiNeBrEaKThis version stars a somnolent Keanu Reeves (is that redundant?) as an alien visitor and Jennifer Connelly - essentially reprising her role from "The Hulk" - as a hot scientist who helps Reeves make mankind realize the dangers of global warming.  LiNeBrEaKWhy would extraterrestrials care about global warming, anyway? In the original, the more credible threat was nuclear proliferation, and the arrival of the alien and his giant robot, Gort, was a clear metaphor for McCarthy-era paranoia. LiNeBrEaKMoving the action to the present after a pointless prologue set in 1927, the undistinguished script attributed to David Scarpa ("The Last Castle") removes the context from a story rooted in a very specific era, as well leaving out almost every memorable scene from the original. LiNeBrEaKYes, even "Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!" Were the filmmakers afraid of comparison, or worried that if the affectless Reeves were killed and brought back to life, audiences couldn't tell the difference? LiNeBrEaKThe only improvement in this edition, directed without noticeable enthusiasm by Scott Derrickson ("The Exorcism of Emily Rose"), is the new CGI Gort. He's a lot more imposing than the original, played in a robot suit by a doorman at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. LiNeBrEaKThe flying saucer in the original has been replaced by a CGI globe that lands not in Washington but an unrecognizable version of Central Park. LiNeBrEaKMuch of the movie - a patchwork of scenes from, among many other movies, "Independence Day" and "The Day After Tomorrow" - takes place in a geographically challenged New Jersey where Princeton seems to be right next to Newark. LiNeBrEaKA good part of the first 45 minutes takes place in one of the state's fictional military installations, the first of many tiresome clich&eacute;s. LiNeBrEaKWhen Reeves' alien, Klaatu, escapes with Dr. Helen (Connelly) and her annoying stepson (Jaden Smith), the first stop is McDonald's for a risible rendezvous with another extraterrestrial. LiNeBrEaKAnother is the home of a learned scientist who has won a Nobel Prize for "biological altruism."  LiNeBrEaKHe is played by John Cleese, who used to routinely make fun of stuff like this during his Monty Python days. LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Secretary of Defense Kathy Bates - complete with a Sarah Palin 'do - is barking out military assaults on Klaatu and Gort, when she isn't asking Dr. Helen, "Do you really think you can persuade him?"  LiNeBrEaKOne of the big problems here is that, despite much exposition, the nature of Klaatu's mission on Earth isn't at all clear. LiNeBrEaKAnd his powers seem to change from scene to scene: If he can paralyze military cops to escape, then why is it necessary to elude a state trooper by crushing him to death with a car, then bringing him back to life? LiNeBrEaKBy that point, "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is in serious need of resuscitation. LiNeBrEaKThe title more or less forces the filmmakers to re-create the earlier movie's riveting climax, but it's as half-heartedly rendered as their CGI version of Manhattan.

The New York Times 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Title, but Unclear Power, For a New Climate Czar  	By JOHN M. BRODER; Charlie Savage contributed reporting from Washington.  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 28  	845 words  	Much remains unknown, and perhaps undecided, about Carol M. Browner's new position as White House coordinator of energy and climate policy.LiNeBrEaK  How much real authority will Ms. Browner wield? Will her office have the same bureaucratic clout -- the ability to knock heads together at other agencies -- as the National Security Council and the National Economic Council? Will she be able to hold her own against the two powerhouses that will lead those established councils, James L. Jones, a retired Marine general, and Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary? Will she outrank the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council? Will she have office space in the West Wing? How big will her staff be?LiNeBrEaK  But this much is known. Ms. Browner's thinking on climate change, environmental regulation, energy conservation and new technology are very much in line with those of President-elect Barack Obama and the other members of his environmental team. Ms. Browner, who has close ties to Mr. Obama's transition chief, John D. Podesta, started laying the groundwork for the handover with him back in August. LiNeBrEaK  Aides said Wednesday that Mr. Obama intended in the next few days to announce the nominations of Ms. Browner, Steven Chu as secretary of energy, Lisa P. Jackson as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Nancy Sutley as head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. But the scope of Ms. Browner's job remains under discussion, the aides said.LiNeBrEaK  Her views and government record are well known.LiNeBrEaK  Long an acolyte of Al Gore, she has called climate change ''the greatest challenge ever faced'' and echoed Mr. Obama's call for a cap-and-trade system to control carbon dioxide emissions. Before leaving office in 2001, she set out to give the E.P.A. authority to regulate the carbon emissions that cause climate change, a power the Bush administration subsequently refused to use despite a Supreme Court ruling endorsing it. She supports California's ambitious global warming law, which will force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions deeper and faster than current federal law.LiNeBrEaK  After leaving the Clinton administration, Ms. Browner became a founding partner at the Albright Group, an international consulting firm. It has helped Coca-Cola and Merck with foreign operations, but a spokeswoman for the firm declined to identify other clients.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Browner's work with the Albright Group attracted attention in early 2006, during the controversy over a Dubai firm's takeover of a company that operated several American seaports. In February 2006, Ms. Browner and a lobbyist for the Dubai company met with the staff of  Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a vocal opponent of the deal. LiNeBrEaK  A spokesman for Mr. Schumer told a reporter at the time that the visitors had been ''unpersuasive.'' Neither Ms. Browner nor the Albright Group registered to lobby Congress about the deal. The firm's spokeswoman said Thursday that the meeting ''was for informational purposes only'' and that ''the Albright Group does not lobby.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Browner also sits on the board of APX, which  specializes in handling cap-and-trade emission credits, as well as several environment groups. LiNeBrEaK  Her most notable accomplishment in the Clinton years came when she pushed through tough  air quality rules over intense opposition from industry groups and from some in  the administration who viewed them as too costly. But even as she pressed ahead, her favorite slogan  was ''common sense.'' How far she will be able to go in pursuit of vastly more comprehensive and costly energy-conservation goals remains to be seen.LiNeBrEaK  The transition team is still trying to draw the increasingly complex White House organization chart, with a proliferation of top-rank positions with as-yet-undefined roles. On Thursday, Mr. Obama designated former Senator Tom Daschle as not only his secretary of health and human services but also the White House ''health czar.'' Ms. Browner is informally known within the transition and in the environmental community as the ''climate czarina,''  a title that conceals as much as it reveals.LiNeBrEaK  She showed her bureaucratic muscle in one of the critical environmental battles of the Clinton era, the drive to write tough rules for permissible levels of ozone and fine particles of air pollution. The rules, drafted at Ms. Browner's E.P.A., set strict  standards that industry groups and scores of members of Congress said would be too costly to meet.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Gore, then the vice president, was Ms. Browner's top ally in the administration, but the president's economic advisers and Office of Management and Budget officials were wary of the supposed economic and political costs of the new regulations.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Browner stood her ground and eventually persuaded President Bill Clinton to support her. The rules went into effect and survived determined challenges in the courts and in Congress. In navigating that maze, Ms. Browner stepped on many toes, and she remains unpopular with assorted industry groups and conservatives in Congress.

The New York Times 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	Rule Eases A Mandate Under a Law On Wildlife  	By FELICITY BARRINGER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 22  	825 words  	The Interior Department on Thursday announced a rule that has largely freed federal agencies from their obligation to consult independent wildlife biologists before they build dams or highways or permit construction of transmission towers, housing developments or other projects that might harm federally protected wildlife.LiNeBrEaK  The rule, quickly challenged by environmental groups, lets the Army Corps of Engineers or the Federal Highway Administration in many cases  rely on their own personnel in deciding what impact a project would have on a fish, bird, plant, animal or insect protected under the Endangered Species Act. LiNeBrEaK  In announcing the rule, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said his main intention was to ensure that the 1972 law was not used as a ''back door'' means of regulating the emission of the gases that accelerate climate change. Without this rule, Mr. Kempthorne said, his decision last summer to list the polar bear as threatened because of the loss of sea ice caused by the warming of the climate could be used to block projects far from the bear's Arctic habitat.LiNeBrEaK  ''The Endangered Species Act was never intended to be a back door opportunity for climate change policy,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Legal experts said the change seemed intended to ensure that the protection of species like the polar bear would not impede development of coal-fired power plants or other federal actions that increased emissions of heat-trapping gases. The Endangered Species Act, a complicated law with numerous procedural requirements, has long infuriated business interests and property rights advocates. But the law's broad sweep, and its impact on a range of issues like hydroelectric power and logging, has largely been supported by federal courts.LiNeBrEaK  Conservatives and business interests believed that the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species raised the specter that the law's impact would be felt far afield. A federal decision to license a coal-fired power plant in Missouri, the reasoning went, could be blocked because the plant's emissions would indirectly contribute to a reduction of the bear's icy habitat.LiNeBrEaK  But the change to the rule, one of a series of regulatory shifts by the Bush administration in its final months, goes well beyond the concerns about climate change, several legal scholars said.LiNeBrEaK  ''This goes to the heart of the most important provision of the Endangered Species Act,'' said Brian E. Gray, a professor at the Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.LiNeBrEaK  Professor Gray added that a core principle of the act was that independent wildlife and fisheries agencies had the major say in determining whether an action could be taken ''without jeopardizing the continued existence of the species.''LiNeBrEaK  ''And protecting the continued existence of the species,'' he added, ''is the overriding purpose'' of the law.LiNeBrEaK  Environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace and Defenders of Wildlife, filed suit in federal court to block the rule. And legal scholars said that, given the imminent arrival of a Democratic administration, the change was vulnerable to quick reversal. LiNeBrEaK  But the change was welcomed by property rights advocates. Citing the current recession, Rob Rivett, the president of the Pacific Legal Foundation, applauded the revision and said that ''the Endangered Species Act has been the opposite of an economic stimulus.'' Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released a statement praising the rule change as a ''common sense'' revision. Mr. Inhofe added, ''This process is a good first step'' toward reform of the Endangered Species Act. LiNeBrEaK  Pat Parenteau, a professor at the Vermont Law School, disagreed, saying, ''For all federal agencies, if this isn't a carte blanche, it's certainly a broad license to decide for yourself that you don't need to consult.''LiNeBrEaK  The new rule would take effect in 30 days, or just before President-elect Barack Obama was inaugurated. Legal experts said that among the Obama administration's options were two quick ones: suspending the rule or settling lawsuits.LiNeBrEaK  In his news conference, Mr. Kempthorne said federal agencies proposing or approving construction projects had already had some leeway to decide whether to consult biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service. And, he added, ''Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibility to ensure that a listed species is not harmed.''LiNeBrEaK  Questioned about the last-minute nature of the rule change, which  put Fish and Wildlife officials on a forced march to sort through more than 200,000 comments about the proposal, he asked, rhetorically, if Eli Manning, the New York Giants quarterback,  should be taken off the field in the last five minutes of a game. LiNeBrEaK  ''We have 39 days of work left,'' the secretary said, ''and we owe it to the public to keep working.''

The New York Times 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	U.S. Presence at Conference On Climate Raises Hopes  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8  	626 words  	Senator John Kerry arrived at the United Nations climate conference here on Thursday  and immediately reassured delegates that the United States would take strong measures to combat climate change. LiNeBrEaK  ''President Obama will be like night and day compared to President Bush,'' Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts,  said at a news conference, adding, ''Congress and the president-elect are committed to movement on mandatory goals as rapidly as possible.'' LiNeBrEaK  Although the incoming president has no official representatives here, the conference center is crawling with Congressional representatives and their staff members, a sign of the political transition in the United States.  LiNeBrEaK  Over the past two weeks, there have been staff members from more than 50 Congressional offices, representing figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a Republican foreign policy statesman; and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who will be the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.LiNeBrEaK  The staff members  were so numerous that the United States delegation here, representing the Bush administration, put a sign on its office door: ''Executive Branch Personnel Only.''LiNeBrEaK  On Wednesday, transition team officials for Mr. Obama said he would announce his top environment team next week, which so far includes Carol M. Browner, Steven Chu and Lisa P. Jackson.LiNeBrEaK  Despite elation at the new United States presence, there was widespread concern among delegates that developed nations would be less willing to make the financial investments in climate change at a time of global recession. In opening the two-day meeting of environment ministers  on Thursday morning, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said there should be ''no backsliding on our commitments.''LiNeBrEaK  In a roundtable on Thursday, dozens of environment ministers pledged to hold to previous plans for emissions reductions. Stavros Dimas, environment director general of the European Union, said, ''We are determined despite economic surprises to deal with climate change.'' The European Union has committed to reducing emissions 20 percent by 2020. LiNeBrEaK  Still, other ministers made it clear that the global recession had made good works harder. ''If we can bring our finance ministers back on board, we will be successful in Copenhagen,'' where countries hope to arrive at a climate treaty by December 2009,   said Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's environment minister, who reiterated his country's goal of cutting emissions by 25 to 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020. LiNeBrEaK  There were some bright spots at the conference, which is part of a negotiation to create  the global climate treaty. Mexico took the lead among developing countries and committed itself to emission reduction targets and caps, even though developing countries are not required to do so under the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil said it would aim to cut deforestation 70 percent in the next decade. LiNeBrEaK  But Xie Zhenhua, the head of the Chinese delegation, reiterated  that as a developing country China should not have to make such numerical commitments, but that it would ''take positive and effective mitigation and adaptation measures.'' China is the world's largest emitter.LiNeBrEaK  Also, some developing countries said promises by industrial nations to help them cope with climate change seemed to have been put off. The fate of a fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change was unclear on Thursday. LiNeBrEaK  ''We are really disappointed with the progress we are seeing in Poznan,'' said Amjad Abdulla, director general of the Ministry of Environment in the Maldives, a chain of low-lying islands that is threatened by rising sea levels. ''We are drowning, and there is this huge gap in commitment.''

Leith Anderson, president of the association, said in an interview that Mr. Cizik, above, had ''lost trust and credibility as a spokesperson to and for our constituency.'' Mr. Anderson added: ''It was a mutual agreement that he resign, but there was a reluctant mutuality. He was reluctant to resign, and I was reluctant to see him resign.'' Under Mr. Cizik's leadership, the evangelical group, which represents 50 denominations with 450,000 churches, expanded its agenda to take stands against genocide in Darfur, global warming and torture. Prominent leaders of the Christian right called for Mr. Cizik's dismissal in 2007, saying he was diluting the agenda of the evangelical movement.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	365 words  	Dec. 12--FUNNY, Chatty, Relaxed And Tanned -- OK, not quite tanned -- a very different John McCain turned up at "Late Show With David Letterman" last night. LiNeBrEaKHe and Letterman -- both briefly estranged (remember?) -- were old pals again, and when Dave said "Senator, great pleasure to see you," he pretty much meant it.LiNeBrEaKThat long, exhausting campaign that ended just a month and a couple days ago? Ancient history. Did the Senator think Hillary Rodham Clinton will make a good Secretary of State, asked Dave? "I do. I do. I've traveled with Senator Clinton to a lot of places in the world. I think she is extremely knowledgeable on the issues. I think it's a good team and I think it's a very wise choice ... when she travels around the world, instant credibility, a certain element of celebrity."LiNeBrEaKWould Caroline Kennedy be a good replacement as junior senator? "Kennedy and I have become very good friends over the years and worked together. We don't agree, but we work together. So I believe it would be a wise choice. But honestly, I don't know who else would be under consideration."LiNeBrEaKWhat about global warming (Dave is always interested in the weather) and alternate energy?

The Oregonian  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Mazama Capital assets fall 75 percent, but optimism holds steady  	Jeff Manning, The Oregonian, Portland, Ore.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1027 words  	Dec. 12--In a year of devastating investment losses, it may comfort amateur stock pickers to know that even the pros are suffering.LiNeBrEaKTake the case of Portland-based Mazama Capital Management, whose assets under management have melted away in 2008 like a Mount Hood glacier in full global-warming mode.LiNeBrEaKFrom a peak of $7. 2 billion in October 2007, Mazama cratered to $1. 8 billion in total assets under management as of Oct. 10. Market losses, client defections and asset reallocations snowballed into a 75 percent decline in assets in 12 months. LiNeBrEaKRon Sauer, Mazama co-founder and CEO, retains a bullish confidence.LiNeBrEaK"Has it been miserable at times? Yes," Sauer said. "But our company is doing fine. We have more prospects today than we've had in some time."LiNeBrEaKIndeed, as companies are folding and jobs are being cut all over the country, Mazama's leadership vows to stay the course. The firm has resolutely stuck with its specialized and volatile corner of the investment world -- small- and medium-sized high-growth stocks. It has not laid off any of its 30 employees or downsized in any other way.LiNeBrEaKAt some point, Sauer predicts, the economy will stabilize, the market will begin to turn and Mazama will be perfectly positioned to return to the heady growth of 2003-2007.LiNeBrEaKOther Portland money managers say it won't be easy.LiNeBrEaK"What they're saying is right, the best periods often follow the worst," said Bill Berg of Sigma Investment Management in Portland. "The question is, how long will they, and the rest of us, have to wait?"LiNeBrEaKAs jaw-dropping as Mazama's recent losses have been, its climb from regional obscurity to industry powerhouse over the past 10 years was just as impressive.LiNeBrEaKAfter a few crucial client wins early this decade, a torrent of investor money began to flow into Mazama. The company's assets under management grew ninefold between 2003 and 2007 -- from $800 million to $7. 2 billion.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, Pension and Investments Magazine ranked Mazama the largest domestic small-cap manager of tax-exempt money in the country.LiNeBrEaKBy rights, Mazama and Sauer should have been the next big stars of Portland money management, following in the steps of Columbia Management and Crabbe-Huson in the 1990s.LiNeBrEaKBut Mazama flew strictly under the radar. It caters only to large institutional investors like public pension funds and endowments. It never attained the popular recognition of Columbia or Crabbe-Huson, which operated families of mutual funds open to the public.LiNeBrEaKSauer said he's more comfortable with the low-profile approach. After years of dealing with the public at his former employer, local stock brokerage Black and Co., he said he prefers the relative calm of institutional investors.LiNeBrEaK"Our deal is that no one knows what Ron thinks, no one knows what Mazama thinks, other than our clients," Sauer said.LiNeBrEaKBut as the economy fell into chaos in 2008, an increasing number of institutional clients gave Mazama the heave-ho. The Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, Mass Mutual Select Funds and TransAmerica Asset Management, among others, cut ties with Mazama during the year, most of them citing poor returns.LiNeBrEaKVirtually all equity managers have suffered double-digit percentage declines this year, Mazama officials point out. But that hasn't been enough to persuade some of the firm's customers to stick around.LiNeBrEaKIn the 12 months ended Oct. 10, Mazama's client roster dwindled from 86 to 54, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.LiNeBrEaKA more generic trend away from stock pickers also hurt Mazama.LiNeBrEaKThe Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board (MassPRIM) terminated Mazama in August, costing the firm $242 million in assets under management.LiNeBrEaKMassPRIM cut loose a number of equities managers at the time, saying they all underperformed. The fund put the $1. 8 billion into index funds and other passive investments.LiNeBrEaKThe Oregon Public Employee Retirement Fund's relationship with Mazama offers another example of how disappointing returns and changing investment preferences have combined to hurt the firm.LiNeBrEaKThe Oregon Investment Council placed $248 million with Mazama in 2004. The firm posted decent returns of 6. 59 percent in 2004, 11. 16 percent in 2005 and 11. 57 percent in 2006.LiNeBrEaKBut Mazama's performance for OPERF soured in 2007 and 2008, declining 5. 98 percent in 2007 and 30. 89 percent through the first nine months of this year, according to Oregon Treasury officials.LiNeBrEaKEight months ago, the Oregon council placed Mazama on its "watch list," due to lackluster returns.LiNeBrEaK"We have concerns about (Mazama's) ability to generate excess returns in the future," said Kate Richardson, chief of staff at the Oregon Treasurer's office. "We think there are likely other managers out there we should consider."LiNeBrEaKBut it isn't just performance prompting Oregon's move away from Mazama. In September 2007, the investment council moved at least $4. 5 billion of state retirement money out of U.S. equities, partly in favor of private equity funds and other alternative investments.LiNeBrEaKThe shift cost Mazama and additional $145 million.LiNeBrEaKThrough it all, Sauer and his partners remain remarkably optimistic. The company remains one of the larger money managers in Portland with nearly $2 billion under management, enough so that the company hasn't had to make any significant cuts, he said.LiNeBrEaKSauer added that his portfolio managers have bet on a bunch of great stocks. It's just a matter of waiting until the economic uncertainty eases and the stock market stabilizes.LiNeBrEaKAnd when will that be? Sauer, wisely, refrains from pinpointing a date.LiNeBrEaK"It's not going to turn this quarter, it's not going to turn in the first quarter of next year," Sauer said. "But at least I'm confident that we're getting closer."LiNeBrEaKJeff Manning: 503-294-7606; jmanning@news.oregonian.com	LAYOFFS (90%); MUTUAL FUNDS (89%); PERSONAL FINANCE (89%); INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT (89%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (77%); MOUNTAINS (77%); PENSION FUNDS (76%); TAX EXEMPTIONS (73%); SECURITIES BROKERS (70%); PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS (60%); ENDOWMENTS (60%); GLOBAL WARMING (57%)  	BLACK and CO (60%); SIGMA INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS LTD (54%)  			Banking/Economy/Personal Finance/Stocks  	PORTLAND, OR, USA (90%) OREGON, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Oregonian   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081212-PO-MAZAMA-CAPITAL-20081212  	PO  												
The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Sunrise Edition	Lincoln City: Casino jumps into lead for clean energy  	ABBY HAIGHT, The Oregonian  	Living - How We Live  	1150 words  	Casino jumpsLiNeBrEaKinto lead forLiNeBrEaKclean energyLiNeBrEaKLincoln City crimps its carbonLiNeBrEaKABBY HAIGHTLiNeBrEaKLINCOLN CITY --Mayor Lori Hollingsworth knows that this coastal community is a tiny player in the complex drama of global climate change.LiNeBrEaKBut she is pushing to make Lincoln City the state's first to negate its greenhouse emissions, ahead of municipalities with greener profiles or more progressive personalities. From simple energy savings to a trailblazing partnership with a carbon cooperative, the town, in its own way, is taking the lead among sustainable municipalities.LiNeBrEaKThere is no widespread community support --or opposition, for that matter. Just a handful of city officials and community activists, working without a blueprint to make this town of almost 8,000 residents as kind to the environment as possible.LiNeBrEaKTheir passion is practical. LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions heighten climate change.LiNeBrEaKClimate change influences oceans.LiNeBrEaKLincoln City sits 11 feet above sea level.LiNeBrEaK"We could ignore it, let federal government deal with it," Hollingsworth says. "We're not willing to do that."LiNeBrEaKLincoln City's work has been praised by sustainability advocates, but it also illustrates the challenges such a small city faces: For example, can a town's "carbon neutrality" be effective without strong national leadership and regulations? Without established models, can efforts be organized and efficient enough to make a difference?LiNeBrEaK"It's an admirable goal," says Harold Christiansen, who owns a food cooperative in Lincoln City and is a member of the city's sustainability committee. "But there are huge, huge things that need to be done."LiNeBrEaKBeats clean power goalLiNeBrEaKIn Lincoln City, the green campaign started a decade ago with higher rates for curbside recycling and a $3 million levy that voters approved to purchase greenspace. The land --more than 217 acres so far --is left mostly wild.LiNeBrEaKNow Lincoln City is poised to offset its municipal greenhouse emissions through a creative mix of carbon credits, aggressive purchase of renewable energy and systemwide energy savings.LiNeBrEaKOfficials hope to include businesses and residents --and even the tourists who feed the local economy --by the end of March. Hollingsworth, elected mayor in 2002, and City Manager David Hawker have backed programs to cut environmental impact.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Lincoln City joined Pacific Power's Blue Sky program, setting a goal of signing up 5 percent of homes and businesses to buy the program's renewable energy. The city surpassed the goal in weeks and became the first Environmental Protection Agency "Green Power Community" on Oregon's coast.LiNeBrEaK"It helps to have a green mayor," public works director Lila Bradley says. "When you have that direction from the top, it really helps."LiNeBrEaKIt also helps that one of the town's biggest energy users turned its neon green.LiNeBrEaKChinook Winds Casino Resort, owned and operated by the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, became the Blue Sky program's biggest client after buying 750 blocks of renewable wind energy and reducing its carbon emissions by 900 tons annually. The resort, Lincoln County's largest employer, also has put in place other energy-saving programs.LiNeBrEaK"The tribe has always had a great deal of respect for the environment, for Mother Nature," says Jim Kikumoto, the resort's general manager. "That being said, of course, of all people and organizations to step up to the plate --to walk the walk, not just talk it --is the tribe itself."LiNeBrEaKAt City Hall, sustainability program manager Riki Lanegan is mapping the community's carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaKUsing data from 2006, before the city joined Blue Sky, Lanegan fed figures such as fleet mileage, computer use and electrical use into a software program from the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. The preliminary findings show city government produced 2,355 metric tons of greenhouse emissions in 2006.LiNeBrEaKShe will expand the analysis to residents and businesses.LiNeBrEaK"It's a big guesstimation," Lanegan acknowledges. "We're all trying the best we can. We know there will be some things that aren't true to life because it's all so new."LiNeBrEaKMore challenging, she says, is City Hall shrinking carbon emissions through "better planning and purchasing, greening up buildings and the fleet to make them more efficient: electric hybrids, biodiesel."LiNeBrEaKThe city may also buy into the Otis Carbon Co-op, which sets aside, conserves and restores natural areas in watersheds near Lincoln City. The co-op, founded by Duncan Berry of the Westwind Stewardship Group, works with watershed councils to identify needed projects.LiNeBrEaK"We're trying to play a role in the early, ground level of valuing nature in a way we haven't before," Berry says. "This place --it's greatest value is its natural land."LiNeBrEaK"Our vision is to transform the health of those coastal watersheds," says Bettina von Hagen, vice president of forestry programs for Ecotrust, which is working with the co-op. "Our forests, our westside forests and particularly our coastal forests, store more carbon than most areas. To manage these only for fiber is to not manage them for their true and full value."LiNeBrEaKMunicipal "laboratory"LiNeBrEaKWhile applauding conservation efforts, some activists say cities shouldn't lose sight of an immediate need: Planning for a future without petroleum resources.LiNeBrEaKDaniel Lerch, program manager of the Portland-based Post Carbon Institute, worries that city governments that strive toward a hard-to-define "carbon neutrality" could overlook issues of peak oil --the adaptations needed as oil resources begin to run out.LiNeBrEaK"We aren't going to truly have a carbon-neutral city for many years," Lerch says.LiNeBrEaKBig solutions must come from national and international leaders. Nonetheless, Lincoln City, and towns like it, are bellwethers for hands-on emissions reduction, Lerch says.LiNeBrEaK"You have 40,000 different local governments, all of which can do a lot on their own without guidance from above," he says. "So you have this incredible laboratory of people who have different solutions to the problem."LiNeBrEaKLincoln City won't buy its way to carbon neutrality, Hollingsworth says. Nor does it plan to play Big Brother, she says.LiNeBrEaKCity officials are waiting to see what other city governments do in the debate about banning plastic bags. And they have no plans to outlaw plastic water bottles --the scourge of bi-annual beach clean-ups --even though city employees voluntarily stopped using them.LiNeBrEaK"The more often something sustainable happens, the more people can learn about them," Alison Nelson, the city's assistant urban renewal director, says.LiNeBrEaKWith participation in Blue Sky now at 7. 5 percent, city officials have a new goal: 20 percent. That would be Oregon's highest.LiNeBrEaKHollingsworth is confident it will happen.LiNeBrEaK"Our efforts, to a global effort, may seem pretty small. But we're a little town, and I'm really proud of what we are doing."LiNeBrEaKAbby Haight: 503-221-8133; abbyhaight@news.oregonian.com	CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); MAYORS (89%); CITIES (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); COASTAL AREAS (89%); CARBON OFFSETS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (89%); EMISSIONS CREDITS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (77%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (76%); LAND USE PLANNING (75%); APPROVALS (69%)  					OREGON, USA (93%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   SOONER EDITION	RUMSFELD HIT ON GITMO ABUSE  		NATIONAL; NATIONAL BRIEFS; Pg. A-6  	422 words  	WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan Senate report released yesterday says former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Bush administration officials are directly responsible for abuses of detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and charges that decisions by those officials led to serious offenses against prisoners in Iraq and elsewhere. LiNeBrEaKThe Senate Armed Services Committee report accuses Mr. Rumsfeld and his deputies of being the principal architects of the plan to use harsh interrogation techniques on captured fighters and terrorism suspects, rejecting the Bush administration's contention that the policies originated lower down the command chain.LiNeBrEaK"The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of 'a few bad apples' acting on their own," the panel concludes.LiNeBrEaKThe report, released by Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and John McCain, R-Ariz., and based on a nearly two-year investigation, said both the policies and resulting controversies tarnished the reputation of the United States and undermined national security.LiNeBrEaKEndangered species regsLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON -- Just six weeks before President-elect Barack Obama takes office, the Bush administration issued revised endangered species regulations yesterday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe changes, which will go into effect in about 30 days, were completed in just four months. But they could take Mr. Obama much longer to reverse.LiNeBrEaKThey will eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases.LiNeBrEaKSuspicious letters sentLiNeBrEaKCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina and Georgia are the latest states to receive suspicious envelopes with white powder at their state capitols.LiNeBrEaKOfficials said yesterday one envelope was opened in the office of South Carolina Gov.

The Porterville Recorder (California)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Wrong plan at wrong time: ARB global warming plan costly, unnecessary  	The Porterville Recorder, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	598 words  	Dec. 12--An agency obscure to most Californians is poised to adopt one of the most costly regulatory packages ever imposed on the state's economy.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations to be fully implemented by 2012 would enforce the Global Warming Solutions Act, Assembly Bill 32, championed by Gov. Schwarzenegger, to cut back greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Government bureaucrats who stand to gain control over industries, individuals and economic decisions say their plan to vastly reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have a positive economic effect. But in recent days, a far different picture has emerged.LiNeBrEaKAssemblyman Roger Niello of Sacramento has urged the Air Resources Board to postpone adopting its costly restrictions on transportation, utilities and other economic segments. Mr. Niello says the agency's "scoping plan" also includes taxes and fees as "large as $23. 5 billion annually." LiNeBrEaKThe Air Resources Board thought otherwise, voting this week to approve the plan. But six highly regarded economic experts commissioned by the agency found its economic projections significantly underestimated costs. One reviewer said the projections give "the appearance of justifying" the regulations "rather than evaluating" them. Another criticized the rosy projections for leaving the erroneous impression of a "free lunch," when great costs are involved. The state's independent Legislative Analyst's Office also found the resource board's projections flawed by "a lack of analytical rigor."LiNeBrEaKThe scoping plan's economic projections appear carefully crafted to justify regulations rather than predict true costs. Mr. Niello properly complains that it's "simply not reasonable to believe that there would be little to no negative economic effect," and that "as both of these new studies suggest, the actual truth may be quite the opposite."LiNeBrEaKEither self-interested bureaucrats are right, or the independent critics are, which would mean potentially great damage to an already fragile economy. In the midst of a prolonged recession, when state government's $103 billion budget has fallen $15 billion in the red, it borders on incredible that the state would take such an economic gamble.LiNeBrEaKThe scoping plan smacks of the same arrogance of global warming alarmists meeting in Poland under United Nations' auspices to consider, among other Draconian proposals, imposing a 2-percent tax on developed nations to raise cash to give to developing nations as compensation for global warming.LiNeBrEaKThese economically disastrous proposals are advanced on the unreasonable fear of global warming, something that hasn't occurred for almost a decade. As Dr. David Gee, chairman of the 2008 International Geological Congress, put it: "For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming?"LiNeBrEaKNot only are these government intrusions onerous and costly, they are unlikely to have any effect on temperatures, which aren't rising even though greenhouse gas emissions are. The ARB, which can't even persuade its own hired consultants, ought at least to have gone back to the drawing board before gambling with California's economic well-being.

A08  	621 words  	SACRAMENTO, Calif. ? California adopted the nation's most sweeping plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions Thursday, issuing rules that could transform everything from the way factories operate to the appliances people buy and the fuel they put in their cars.LiNeBrEaKThe Air Resources Board unanimously approved the plan despite warnings it will put costly new burdens on businesses at a time when the economy is in extreme crisis, with California forecasting a staggering budget gap of $41. 8 billion through mid-2010. LiNeBrEaKRepublican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he believes the regulations will spur the state's economy and serve as a model for the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaK"When you look at today's depressed economy, green tech is one of the few bright spots out there, which is yet another reason we should move forward on our environmental goals," Schwarzenegger said.LiNeBrEaKThe strategy relies on 31 new rules affecting all facets of life, including where people may build their homes and what materials they use to do it.LiNeBrEaKOne central piece is a cap-and-trade program, set to begin in 2012, under which power plants, refineries and big factories will be able to buy and sell the right to emit heat-trapping gases. The program could give plant operators a financial incentive to reduce their carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKAir regulators said the average Californian could see more fuel-efficient cars and plug-in hybrids on showroom floors; better public transportation; housing nearer to schools and businesses; and utility rebates to make their homes more energy-efficient.LiNeBrEaKBut there will also be costs: Cars could become more expensive, and Californians can expect higher electricity rates as utilities increase their use of renewable energy. Homes built with energy-efficient materials could also prove more costly, as could gasoline reformulated to release less carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThe rules spell out in broad terms how the state intends to carry out a landmark 2006 California law that made the state a leader in confronting climate change. The law ? conceived when the economy was in better shape ? requires the state to cut greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. More detailed rules will be issued over the next few years.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia, the nation's most populous state, has long been in the vanguard of the environmental movement, adopting the nation's toughest restrictions on auto pollution decades ago.LiNeBrEaKBecause of its size and market clout, its decisions can have effects far beyond the state, with manufacturers around the country often adapting their products to meet California's stricter standards.LiNeBrEaKStrict requirementsLiNeBrEaKCalifornia air regulators on Thursday adopted a plan to cut the state's greenhouse gas emissions over the next 12 years. Some of the strategies in the plan:LiNeBrEaK* Impose an emissions cap on utilities, refineries and other large industrial sources of greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK* Allow those large polluters to gradually lower emissions by participating in a cap-and-trade market.LiNeBrEaKTRANSPORTATION:LiNeBrEaK* Put into effect a 2002 California law requiring automakers to produce cleaner vehicles. The Bush administration has blocked the law, but state regulators expect President-elect Barack Obama's administration will back it.LiNeBrEaK* Require fuel companies to reformulate fuels so they are a combined 10 percent less carbon-intensive by 2020.LiNeBrEaK* Give local governments incentives to curb urban sprawl and reduce how far people drive to work or school.LiNeBrEaK* Require cargo and cruise ships to turn off their engines while docked.LiNeBrEaKENERGY:LiNeBrEaK* Require utilities to generate one-third of their electricity from renewable sources such as wind, solar and geothermal by 2020.LiNeBrEaK* Strengthen energy-efficiency standards for appliances, as well as for existing and new buildings.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	State board adopts sweeping air plan  	Jim Downing and Chris Bowman, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	913 words  	Dec. 12--With a promise to look more closely at the economic impacts of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the California Air Resources Board on Thursday unanimously approved a sweeping climate-change strategy.LiNeBrEaK"This scoping plan puts California on a path to a low-carbon, sustainable, green economy," said air board Chairman Mary Nichols after the vote in Sacramento.LiNeBrEaKThe board's moves are being watched around the country -- and to some extent the world -- because they're likely to influence federal and international policies in years to come. The plan adopted Thursday creates the nation's first economy-wide trading system for greenhouse-gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKUnder the plan, the state's renewable power generation capacity will roughly triple by 2020, and there will be major increases in the energy efficiency of homes and businesses. Also called for are better vehicle fuel economy, cuts in emissions of refrigerants and other especially potent greenhouse gases, and a reduction in the carbon content of motor fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe governor-appointed Air Resources Board has a long history of environmental leadership, dating back to battles over Los Angeles smog in the 1960s that ultimately fostered nationwide controls on tailpipe emissions, such as the catalytic converter.LiNeBrEaKBut the greenhouse-gas plans are the board's most sweeping actions ever, and will touch virtually every corner of the economy. That worries many business groups.LiNeBrEaK"This is an economy-changing plan, and it's not going to be cheap, and it's not going to be easy to accomplish," said Shelly Sullivan, executive director of the AB 32 Implementation Group, a business coalition.LiNeBrEaKThe air board's economic analysis estimates the plan adopted Thursday will cost the state's economy $25 billion in the year 2020. But agency staff predict that by then it should also be delivering around $40 billion in annual benefits -- mainly through making cars and buildings more energy-efficient.LiNeBrEaKThe nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst's Office and a panel of outside economists, however, found parts of the agency's analysis overly rosy -- overstating some benefits and understating the costs of transitioning to a low-carbon economy.LiNeBrEaKSome business and industry groups, along with a few Republican lawmakers, seized on those critiques and called for the board to redo the economic analysis and delay passage of the plan.LiNeBrEaKAgency staff and some other economists have defended the ARB's conclusions. But the board offered some concessions Thursday, ordering staff to do more detailed analysis of the plan's effects, with a full economic report to be delivered by the end of 2009.LiNeBrEaKThat change, along with a promise that the plan won't disrupt the state's energy-supply networks, was enough to satisfy Catherine Reheis-Boyd, chief operating officer for the Western States Petroleum Association, whose public comment to the board Thursday was generally positive.LiNeBrEaK"If there was no acknowledgment of energy or the economy, my testimony would have been very different," she said.LiNeBrEaKThe plan approved Thursday was born more than two years ago with passage of Assembly Bill 32, a state law that committed California to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThursday's vote approved what is essentially an outline, with many details to be filled in by regulators over the next two years. Most policies will take effect in 2012 or later. The air board has 120 staff members working on the program, spokesman Stanley Young said.LiNeBrEaKBanging out the details of the emissions market -- known as a cap-and-trade system -- seems likely to be particularly divisive.LiNeBrEaKStarting in 2012, the state plans to issue annual permits to firms that emit large volumes of greenhouse gases -- power plant operators, oil refineries and so on. The total supply of permits would ratchet down over time, giving companies two options: cut their own emissions or buy permits from other firms that have made deep cuts and thus have permits to sell.LiNeBrEaKBusiness groups want the state to give away the emissions credits for free, while environmental groups want them to be auctioned. There's a similar split over the use of carbon "offsets," which would allow industry to meet greenhouse-gas targets by funding carbon-cutting projects outside of California.LiNeBrEaKA coalition of environmental-justice groups is urging the air board to junk the cap-and-trade system altogether in favor of a carbon tax, and have hinted that they may sue. They argue that emissions trading tends to concentrate pollution in low-income communities, and that a carbon trading system in place for several years in Europe has revealed fatal flaws in the approach.LiNeBrEaK"In order to make it work, you have to have 100 things line up just perfectly," said Naomi Kim, an attorney with the California Environmental Rights Alliance.LiNeBrEaKMany other environmental groups, including the Union of Concerned Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund, say that California can learn from Europe's missteps and build a workable system.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Jim Downing, (916) 321-1065.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	College officials fear too-deep cuts;  3 systems will trim enrollment, classes 	Steve Schmidt, STAFF WRITER  	LOCAL; Pg. B-3  	424 words  	California's top higher-education officials bemoaned the deepening cuts in college funding yesterday, saying they will have consequences beyond the classroom.LiNeBrEaKGathered at an education conference in downtown San Diego, the administrators said California's three-tier system of higher education is becoming less accessible at a time when it needs to open its doors wider. LiNeBrEaKThe University of California, California State University and community college systems plan to curtail enrollment or reduce classes and student services next fall to deal with midyear budget cuts tied to eroding state revenues.LiNeBrEaKCSU intends to reduce its 450,000 enrollment by 10,000. The system includes Cal State San Marcos and San Diego State University.LiNeBrEaKJack Scott, incoming chancellor-designate of the California Community Colleges system, said as many as 200,000 students may not be able to get the classes they need.LiNeBrEaK"Some may be so discouraged that they may not enroll at all," Scott said. The 109-college system offers vocational training and other programs seen as vital to the workaday economy.LiNeBrEaKCSU Chancellor Charles Reed said California needs a robust higher-education system to help dig the state out of the recession. He noted that a college degree often leads to a higher-paying job, which in turn fuels the economy.LiNeBrEaKReed said taxpayers need to ask themselves: "What kind of California do you want? What kind of economy do you want?"LiNeBrEaKUC President Mark Yudof also emphasized the role higher education could play in shoring up the economy, if funding were adequate.LiNeBrEaKHe said research conducted on UC campuses could spur the development of more efficient batteries to power energy-efficient cars, or technology to address global warming.LiNeBrEaKYudof said per-student funding within the UC system has slipped 40 percent since 1990 when adjusted for inflation and enrollment growth.LiNeBrEaKHe said places such as Saudi Arabia and Singapore want to emulate California's higher-education system -- an irony, considering the state's financial decline.LiNeBrEaK"We're beginning to eat our seed corn," Yudof said during a meeting with The San Diego Union-Tribune's editorial board, attended by editors and reporters from the newsroom. The board regularly invites newsmakers to discuss current events.LiNeBrEaKPublic colleges and universities across the nation are in a similar bind as sales tax revenues and other sources of income drop due to the collapsing economy.LiNeBrEaKMany campuses have raised tuition and fees, but students complain they have been forced to take on a disproportionate share of the financial burden.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	State board blazes trail with plan on emissions;  Rules should help, but costs expected to rise 	Michael Gardner, U-T SACRAMENTO BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1228 words  	SACRAMENTO -- In a unanimous decision watched closely worldwide, California's air-quality regulators yesterday adopted the nation's first comprehensive plan of attack to curb global warming.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, Californians eventually could be further pinched every time they shop for groceries, write a check to the power company or make a down payment on a new car.LiNeBrEaKBut they also are likely to be rewarded in the long run with cleaner air, improved gas mileage and a potential escape from the stranglehold fossil fuels have on the state.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, the state Air Resources Board contends that acting now to stall global warming will help prevent climatic catastrophes, from droughts to forest fires, as well as protect endangered wildlife from habitat loss. LiNeBrEaKBut at what price? Businesses fear looming regulations will drive up costs just as the recession seems to be deepening. And some economists warn of rosy savings projections in the future that may not balance out more immediate costs.LiNeBrEaK"The reality of climate regulation is there will be costs. ... The state cannot afford to misstep," said Amisha Patel, representing the California Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaKThe plan lays out an aggressive strategy to roll back greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming to 1990 levels by the year 2020, a 25 percent cut.LiNeBrEaKThe state's agenda includes a mix of regulations and fees, much of which will be crafted over the next few years in time for a 2012 launch. Once fully implemented, the plan could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 174 million tons cumulatively by 2020. That's the equivalent of removing nearly 35 million cars off the road during the next 11 years.LiNeBrEaKThose changes will touch most lives and businesses over time as the worst polluters begin to shift to cleaner fuels and technology, passing on the costs -- and in some cases the energy savings -- to consumers.LiNeBrEaKPrimary targets are refineries, utilities, factories and automakers, which will be forced to retool production and improve products. Local governments, water agencies, farmers and timber interests, among others, also will be affected.LiNeBrEaKSan Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts, an air board member, suggested that regulators, as they design a reduction program for local governments, look at how to work with military bases and Indian casinos that also account for emissions, particularly from cars.LiNeBrEaKYesterday's groundbreaking action positions California to influence a new national global warming strategy once President-elect Barack Obama begins crafting his environmental initiatives.LiNeBrEaK"This is an example of what can and should be done," said Mary Nichols, state air board chairwoman.LiNeBrEaKBoard member Daniel Sperling said, "Everyone across the country -- and around the world -- is looking to us to blaze this path."LiNeBrEaKNationally, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 1. 4 percent last year, the federal government reported last week. Regulators say they recognize that California alone cannot solve the problems posed by global warming, but they note that pushing tighter standards here will provide momentum for agreements nationally and internationally.LiNeBrEaKIllustrating the potential reach of regulations, the state already has set new emission standards for some routine products starting in 2010. Among those are air canisters used to blow dust off computer keyboards and cameras.LiNeBrEaKNext spring, regulators are expected to consider limits on even more household products, such as paint thinners, solvents, paint strippers and certain fabric spot removers.LiNeBrEaKThe air board's decision yesterday culminated months of intense lobbying, from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger down to small businesses who fear staggering power bills. The board received more than 43,000 written comments on the plan.LiNeBrEaK"You will have people screaming and saying this will lose jobs. As a matter of fact, when you look today at the economy and when you look at the businesses, the green technology and the green economy is actually doing really well," Schwarzenegger said the day before the vote.LiNeBrEaK"The more we are committed to those laws and the more we move forward, the more those businesses will expand and this is where the action is," he added.LiNeBrEaKRegulators overcame resistance to the broad plan from some business interests and political conservatives. Opponents had rallied behind critical reports issued by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office and some economists.LiNeBrEaKThe legislative analyst found that some of the state's economic impact figures "are inconsistent and incomplete." Moreover, the air board failed to lay out how much compliance could cost and when businesses could expect to recoup those investments -- an important consideration for companies struggling to adjust, the analysis pointed out.LiNeBrEaKUCLA economist Matthew Kahn and Harvard economist Robert Stavins sharply criticized claims of a net benefit. Parts of the air board's study are "analytically flawed and empirically misleading," Stavins wrote. Kahn said the plan is "presented as a reckless free lunch."LiNeBrEaKCritical economists warned that California cannot risk implementing a plan based on faulty economic assumptions. Failure could permanently set back the laudable goal of reducing emissions, one said.LiNeBrEaKChairwoman Nichols defended the economic review, saying it was meant to be a snapshot in time: 2020.LiNeBrEaK"It showed a modest benefit over the cost. It didn't say it was free," she said.LiNeBrEaKNichols pointed out that businesses will be able to help draft specific proposals as the state finalizes regulations for various industrial sectors.LiNeBrEaK"We're not asking anybody to fork out cash that they don't have or go to the bank and borrow money they can't get," she said.LiNeBrEaKNot all businesses are opposed. Dozens of green-technology firms urged regulators to act, saying the standards will spur investment while helping the environment.LiNeBrEaKRegulators are counting on a business-friendly program called "cap and trade" to buffer impacts.LiNeBrEaKThat program is designed to encourage investment in new technology and help struggling companies comply. It would allow companies that come in under permitted emissions levels or that invest in new technology to obtain special credits. Those credits could then be sold to heavier polluting industries, allowing them to avoid crackdowns.LiNeBrEaKBut that raises concerns in poor, industrial neighborhoods that have been lobbying for years for stricter pollution controls.LiNeBrEaKBoard members said many issues will be resolved as regulators work through the plan to design specific rules and targeted fees.LiNeBrEaK"This is not an end, but a start," board member Ron Loveridge said.LiNeBrEaKEMISSIONS PLAN HIGHLIGHTSLiNeBrEaKGreenhouse gases: Roll back emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a 25 percent cut.LiNeBrEaKEmission credits: Allow low-polluting businesses to sell credits to industries that are not.LiNeBrEaKNew fees: On water use, appliances and products known for high greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy: Require utilities to generate 33 percent of electricity from renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKAuto emissions: Push for federal approval of state tailpipe emissions standards.LiNeBrEaKIncentives: Rebates for buyers of fuel-efficient cars, fees on the purchase of gas guzzlers.LiNeBrEaKFuel companies: Require reformulated fuels so they are a combined 10 percent less carbon-intensive by 2020.LiNeBrEaKLocal governments: Incentives to curb urban sprawl and reduce how far people drive to work or school.LiNeBrEaKShips: Require them to turn off engines while docked.

San Antonio Express-News 	December 12, 2008 Friday   STATEandMETRO Edition	S.A. now in worst drought category  	Jerry Needham, STAFF  	A SECTION; Pg. 1A  	704 words  	All but the southern tip of Bexar County deteriorated to the worst category in the U.S. Drought Monitor report issued Thursday as the terribly dry conditions continue to expand across the area.LiNeBrEaKBexar and all or most of nine other counties in Texas were placed in the "exceptional" drought category, meaning residents can expect such things as widespread crop and pasture losses and shortages of water in reservoirs, streams and wells, creating water emergencies.LiNeBrEaKSeveral counties in the area this week banned the sale of aerial fireworks during the New Year's season, and a few are considering following the lead of Bexar and Kendall counties, which moved to stop the sale and use of all fireworks. LiNeBrEaKThe worsened drought classification follows 15 months of record low rainfall in San Antonio.LiNeBrEaKThe 16. 15 inches recorded at International Airport through November is less than in any similar 15-month period since rainfall recordkeeping began in 1871 - drier even than in the drought of the 1950s.LiNeBrEaKAnd neither weather forecasters nor climate scientists offer any hope of relief.LiNeBrEaKThe monthly El Ni&ntilde;o forecast issued Thursday from the U.S. Climate Prediction Center said it's equally likely for neutral conditions or a return to La Ni&ntilde;a through March 2009.LiNeBrEaKLa Ni&ntilde;a is a cyclical upwelling of cold water off the coast of South America that influences global air and moisture circulation patterns.LiNeBrEaKEven though the last La Ni&ntilde;a, as measured by sea surface temperatures, officially ended in June, scientists say the atmospheric circulation pattern typical of La Ni&ntilde;a has persisted. That pushes the jet stream and tropical moisture farther north, bypassing Texas and the southern United States.LiNeBrEaK"Several models, including the NOAA Climate Forecast System, suggest the development of La Ni&ntilde;a during December 2008-March 2009," the latest report said, noting the sea surface temperature again has dropped to the threshold for La Ni&ntilde;a conditions but that it takes three consecutive months of those temperatures before La Ni&ntilde;a is officially declared.LiNeBrEaKStream and river levels across the region are from 10 percent to 24 percent of normal, while lakes are at 60 percent to 80 percent of capacity.LiNeBrEaKThe Edwards Aquifer in San Antonio was at 669 feet above sea level Thursday, normal for December. But officials fear it could begin to drop rapidly with no rainfall to recharge it and with farmers across the region preparing to start irrigating their fields for plowing and planting spring crops.LiNeBrEaK"This could be something that goes on for quite a while," Eddie Wilcut, manager of program planning in the conservation department of the San Antonio Water System, said of the dry weather.LiNeBrEaKHe said that the utility's customers are using more water than normal, which shouldn't be happening in the dead of winter.LiNeBrEaK"Plants are dormant now and need very little water," he said, adding that projections are that Edwards pumpers will be mandated to cut back pumping by late January. "We all need to kind of cut back."LiNeBrEaKComal and Bandera counties Thursday joined Atascosa, Blanco, Frio, Guadalupe, Hays, Karnes and Wilson counties in banning the sale and use of aerial fireworks, defined as "rockets with sticks and missiles with fins," this week.LiNeBrEaKComal, Guadalupe and Wilson officials said they would consider issuing disaster declarations that would ban the sale and use of all fireworks.LiNeBrEaKIf the county judge issues such a declaration, it lasts for only 60 hours unless it's extended by the governor's office.LiNeBrEaK"Next Wednesday, I will decide about the disaster declaration," Comal County Judge Danny Scheel said. "I believe that in all fairness, the vendors should know whether to stock their booths, so I want to give them adequate notice. With the disaster we are anticipating and short of any rainfall, I feel certain the governor will support us, as he has in the past in less critical conditions than we have now."LiNeBrEaKJoe Baskin, forecaster with the National Weather Service's office in New Braunfels, said the near-term outlook for any significant rainfall is bleak.LiNeBrEaK"We're looking for a little bit of rain next week - a 20 percent chance Monday through Thursday - but it's not going to be anything significant," he said.LiNeBrEaKStaff Writer Roger Croteau contributed to this report.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	STATE WAR ON GLOBAL WARMING;  Protecting the environment;  'A model for others': Air board unanimously approves blueprint to curb emissions	Wyatt Buchanan, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	905 words  	 California's air quality board approved on Thursday the nation's most sweeping plan to reduce global warming by curbing emissions, a move that state regulators hailed as a nationwide model for President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKState leaders predicted that the blueprint, unanimously approved by the California Air Resources Board, would stimulate California's lagging economy by creating thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of commerce, while business owners said the plan would worsen the state's fiscal woes.LiNeBrEaK"Today is the day we help unleash the full force of California's innovation and technology for a healthier planet, a stronger and more robust economy and a safer and more secure energy future," Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement. LiNeBrEaKThe changes called for over the next 12 years are sure to affect the products Californians buy, the cars they drive and the places they live. They are designed to allow the state to reach its legally mandated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a reduction of about 30 percent.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is "taking on a global responsibility that can be a model for others," said air board Chairwoman Mary Nichols. "It's a sample of what we think can and should be done" by the Obama administration, she said.LiNeBrEaKThe plan spells out 31 rules, including emissions-reduction targets for a wide range of industries, creation of an elaborate cap-and-trade program to limit emissions and will require local governments to reduce sprawling development.LiNeBrEaKSpecific regulations to lower greenhouse gases will be created by the board in the coming months.LiNeBrEaKMost of the reductions will come from fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles that have been blocked by the Bush administration. Consumer appliances and new and existing buildings will be subject to higher efficiency standards. Utility companies such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. must provide 33 percent of their electricity from renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKThe cap-and-trade program, under which participants are allotted so-called carbon credits that they can trade with others who exceed their limits, would cover 85 percent of greenhouse gas-emitting sources in the state, including electricity generation, large industrial sources and residential and commercial use of natural gas.LiNeBrEaKDetails of the program were the subject of testimony during Thursday's meeting.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental organizations want participants to buy the credits in an auction, while affected businesses and organizations such as the California Taxpayers Association want them for free. The European Union, which has the largest cap-and-trade program in the world, allots some credits for free, but its leaders want to charge all participants.LiNeBrEaKThe average Californian will at first see subtle effects from Thursday's vote, such as increasing numbers of electric cars, Nichols said.LiNeBrEaK"There will still be cars, but there will be more that are able to be plugged in," she said. Also, small business owners are likely to be visited by their utility companies and asked to install meters to help monitor or regulate energy use, Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKBut some small business owners and business advocacy groups said they were worried about the economic impact of the plan, pointing to a report by the nonpartisan legislative analyst's office and an academic peer review that criticized the air board's findings that the plan would have an overall net benefit to the state.LiNeBrEaK"The reality of climate regulations is that there will be costs in the near term," said Amisha Patel of the California Chamber of Commerce.LiNeBrEaKOther groups have called for the process to be put on hold until the board conducts an economic analysis of how the plan will affect small businesses, a call echoed by Assemblyman Roger Niello, R-Fair Oaks Sacramento County.LiNeBrEaKBut Nichols lashed out at such criticism.LiNeBrEaK"Frankly, we don't think they understood what this analysis is about," she said, adding that the air board is aware of the weakened economy and will consider that as it fleshes out the plan with official regulations. The new regulations will be decided by Jan. 1, 2011, and be in full effect by Jan. 1, 2012.LiNeBrEaKBoard member Daniel Sperling said that while the plan is specifically focused on the 2020 goal, it will put the state on course to meet a larger goal of lowering greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050.LiNeBrEaK"What we're doing is breathing life into a movement," Sperling said.LiNeBrEaKSen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills Los Angeles County, who co-authored the bill that mandated the plan, said California is in a strong position.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to be in the right place at the right time as the federal government will probably use this as a model," Pavley said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's plan to cut emissions LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKHighlights of the Air Resources Board's blueprint for cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels in the next 12 years, a 30 percent reduction: LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaK-- Put 85 percent of greenhouse gas-emitting industries into a cap-and-trade program.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	ENDANGERED SPECIES: Bush's interior secretary announces major changes to protections  	Jane Kay, Chronicle Environment Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	857 words  	Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne announced major changes Thursday to the Endangered Species Act, causing environmental groups to charge that the "midnight rules" set to go into effect before President-elect Barack Obama takes office are intended to eviscerate the nation's premier wildlife-protection law.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations eliminate a requirement that federal agencies seek review by government scientists before approving logging, mining and construction projects to make sure the activities don't endanger rare animals and plants. LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the regulations say the law could not be used to protect polar bears, walrus, mountain frogs and other species vulnerable to the effects of global warming.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration is using this to go after our most imperiled wildlife and kick them when they are down," said Janette Brimmer, an attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental group. "The act is our nation's most important law for protecting wildlife like wolves, grizzlies, salmon and lynx."LiNeBrEaKReid Cherlin, a spokesman for the Obama-Biden transition team, said, "President-elect Obama will review all 11th-hour regulations and will address them once he takes office." Obama has said he does not favor changing the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne, at a news conference in Washington, said that he knew changes to the act would evoke controversy but that he is certain the new rules would clear up confusion over the law that had existed for years.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in the regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed," he said.LiNeBrEaKLaw covers 1,400 speciesLiNeBrEaKThe law protects 1,400 species. In the last eight years, there has been a slowdown in adding new plants and animals, building a backlog of hundreds of species waiting for scientific review and approval, including California's furry Pacific fisher and Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department proposed the new regulations in May and since has received nearly 300,000 comments, the vast majority opposing the changes.LiNeBrEaK Hours after Thursday's announcement, three environmental groups, Greenpeace, Defenders of Wildlife and Center for Biological Diversity, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco seeking to halt regulations that they say are inconsistent with the act.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations don't require federal agencies to seek consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service before approving projects, the lawsuit said.LiNeBrEaKIn Congress, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., called a hearing to review the regulations and said members would work to restore the act. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., said members may try to eliminate the regulations by using a special congressional act that allows the review of newly adopted administrative rules.LiNeBrEaK Part of the new regulations prohibit regulators from taking into account the effects of greenhouse gases on habitats and on species. Kempthorne said his legal advisers concluded that considering global warming a threat to the survival of the polar bear would require tracking emissions to a particular factory and determining how that would melt Arctic ice and harm the bear.LiNeBrEaK"That's completely wrong, and they're just making that up," said attorney Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity, which is suing the federal government in an attempt to protect polar bears.LiNeBrEaKFederal agencies are supposed to look at sources of greenhouse gases from projects they approve, then analyze ways to reduce those emissions, Siegel said.LiNeBrEaK"There's no requirement to trace any molecule of DDT to the thinning of bald eagle eggs just as there's no requirement to trace any molecule of carbon dioxide to the death of any particular polar bear," she said.LiNeBrEaKIn California, the requirement to consult with government biologists before construction projects is particularly crucial, said Mark Rockwell, California state representative of the Endangered Species Coalition, an alliance of 50 environmental, business, hunting and fish and religious groups in the state.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Forest Service approves logging plans that might affect coastal coho salmon and steelhead, marbled murrelets and Pacific fishers on national forests. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers give permits for filling wetlands.LiNeBrEaKWithout the requirement, there's no incentive for the agencies to seek consultation and a biological opinion, Rockwell said.LiNeBrEaKFor example, the Bureau of Reclamation was forced by the current requirement to seek biological opinions on whether the amount of water being diverted from the southern part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta would hurt the delta smelt or harm chinook salmon.LiNeBrEaKProtections found lackingLiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups challenged opinions that water flows for the fish were adequate, and won decisions agreeing that the protections were indeed lacking in the plans.LiNeBrEaK"It was the biological opinions that led to the challenges," Rockwell said. "If you don't have an opinion, you have nothing to challenge."LiNeBrEaKUnder the new regulations, the federal agencies would have the discretion of deciding whether or not to ask for a consultation and opinion, Rockwell said.LiNeBrEaKWalrus The walrus in Bristol Bay on Alaska's southwest coast are threatened by global warming and offshore oil drilling.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL Edition	Good for earth, good for business;  Companies ranked on their environmental records 	George Raine, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Business; Pg. C1  	1574 words  	A ranking of 63 large businesses on how they are confronting the challenges of climate change gives good grades to Intel, Applied Materials, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems and Safeway, but a relatively poor grade for Apple, which authors of the study said was late to the effort compared with other tech companies. LiNeBrEaKThe ranking, by Ceres, a Boston group that joins investors and environmentalists to push businesses to improve their environmental records, makes a case that going green makes good business sense.LiNeBrEaKThe study shows that some major technology and consumer companies are doing praiseworthy work in confronting the business challenges posed by climate change, while others' efforts are wanting. LiNeBrEaKThe analysis of the climate change governance practices of some of the world's largest retail, pharmaceutical, technology, apparel and other companies is intended to give those earning high marks their due and motivation to low scorers - and to inform consumers about best practices.LiNeBrEaKInternational Business Machines, Tesco, the British supermarket chain, and Dell Inc. have the top three slots in the study.LiNeBrEaKEight Bay Area businesses are included in the examination of the 63 companies. LiNeBrEaKIntel. Corp. of Santa Clara is the fourth best performer in dealing with climate change, according to the report, while good scores also went to Applied Materials, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard Co., Cisco Systems and Safeway. The scores of two others - Gap Inc. and Apple Inc. - were under the median score.LiNeBrEaKGood for bottom lineLiNeBrEaK"Investors care about how these companies stack up against each other," said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres and director of the Investor Network on Climate Risk, a coalition of 70 investors with, according to Ceres, collective assets of $7 trillion and focused on the business impacts from climate change. "Businesses know how their environmental records impact the bottom line and consumers care about the companies with products they are purchasing," Lubber said Thursday in a conference call with reporters.LiNeBrEaKThe study was conducted by the RiskMetrics Group, which provides risk management and corporate governance information.LiNeBrEaKIt looked at 48 U.S. companies and 15 non-U.S. companies in 11 sectors - apparel, beverages, big box retailers, grocery and drug retailers, personal and household goods, pharmaceuticals, real estate, restaurants, semiconductors, technology, and travel and leisure. It considered how the companies are addressing climate change through board of director oversight, management execution, public disclosure, greenhouse gas emissions accounting and strategic planning and performance.LiNeBrEaKOn a 100-point scale, more than half of the 63 companies scored under 50 points.LiNeBrEaKIBM was first with a score of 79. The company has a long track record of environmental protection, the study noted, and has already met a suite of greenhouse gas emission reduction and energy conservation targets and has another to meet through 2012. The company, in Armonk, N.Y., said that between 1990 and 2007 it saved 4. 6 billion kilowatts of electricity consumption, avoided nearly 3. 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions and saved more than $310 million through its annual energy conservation actions.LiNeBrEaK"From how we run our operations to what we provide to our clients, IBM is committed to leadership in energy efficiency and climate protection across the breadth of its business," said Wayne Balta, vice president of corporate environmental affairs and product safety at IBM.LiNeBrEaKThe authors of the study found that those companies responding to climates change primarily are setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, boosting energy efficiency efforts, expanding renewable energy purchases and integrating climate factors into product design. They are also appointing officers to manage climate issues. But the report found that many companies are still largely ignoring climate change, especially at the board and chief executive level.LiNeBrEaKThe authors could obtain no information about environmental strategy at Abercrombie and Fitch Co., which did not respond to queries, and gave the clothier a score of zero.LiNeBrEaK40-year history at IntelLiNeBrEaKIntel Corp. co-founder Gordon Moore established a culture of environmental sustainability at the beginning 40 years ago, said spokeswoman Christine Dotts. The company is the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Dotts said the culture has proved to be smart business, as Intel has invested $20 million in conservation products since 2001 and saved an estimated $40 million as a result.LiNeBrEaKApplied Materials, No. 8 on the list, is committed to reducing its carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by approximately 20 percent below 2006 levels by 2012. "Whether it is by installing one of the largest corporate solar arrays in the United States or working to reduce the power consumption of our products, Applied Materials is demonstrating our leadership through concrete action and a corporate culture to make the environment and our impact a real priority," said Bruce Klafter, head of environment and sustainability at Applied Materials.LiNeBrEaKSun's transparencyLiNeBrEaKSun Microsystems Inc., in 10th place, has a policy of transparency in publishing monthly carbon emission data on its Web site.LiNeBrEaK"Sun realizes our greatest sustainability opportunity is to limit the energy required to use our products," said Marcy Scott Lynn, director of corporate social responsibility. "This is driving our engineers to improve the energy efficiency of Sun products, while at the same time meeting the increasing feature demands of our customers." LiNeBrEaKLynn said Sun will continue to work with organizations like Ceres, which commissioned the study, "to ensure Sun reaps the economic and environmental benefits of a focused and integrated sustainability strategy."LiNeBrEaKHewlett-Packard, No. 11 in the ranking, is nearly three years ahead of schedule to reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of its products and operations to 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2010, and went on to increase its overall target to a 25 percent reduction, the study said.LiNeBrEaKMark Heintz, the sustainability executive at HP, said the company "continues to identify ways it can reduce its carbon footprint and provide energy efficiency solutions that will reduce the carbon footprint of its operations, customers and supply chain."LiNeBrEaKCisco Systems Inc., 16 in the ranking, has a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent in worldwide operations by 2012, and making "green a priority in products and solutions for customers," said Jennifer Greeson, a spokeswoman. LiNeBrEaK"Through solutions that help measure, monitor and manage energy consumption as well as radically change the way people work and entire sectors operate, Cisco believes it can embed a platform for environmental innovation in the future," she said.LiNeBrEaKSafeway, in the 26th slot, in 2007 converted its U.S. company-owned truck fleet to run on cleaner-burning biodiesel fuel, the study noted.LiNeBrEaKA spokeswoman for Safeway, Teena Massingill, said, "We have invested a large amount of effort into our greenhouse gas reduction initiative, which includes the use of solar energy and wind energy. We have clearly stated goals for all aspects of our overall sustainability initiative."LiNeBrEaKGap lacks public policyLiNeBrEaKGap Inc., in 37th place, had no comment on the study, said a spokeswoman. The company has worked with a consultant to examine environmental challenges and analyze potential impact to its business, and developed a strategy focused on energy conservation, cotton and sustainable design and output and wastes reduction. However, the study found no public policy by Gap on the subject of climate change.LiNeBrEaKApple follows in 38th place. A spokeswoman said Apple would not comment, but noted that on the company Web site CEO Steve Jobs announced there will be a measurement of the emissions produced at each stage of a product's lifecycle, from production and transportation to consumer use and eventual recycling. The information will be reported "for each new product we introduce, so our customers will better understand the progress we are making," he said.LiNeBrEaKDoug Cogan, director of climate risk management at RiskMetrics, said Apple was "later to the game than many contemporaries."LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is a business issue that has to be looked at all the time, not just done on a good day," said Lubber, who heads Ceres.LiNeBrEaKShe said that climate change is barely on the radar in the restaurant, real estate and travel and leisure sectors.LiNeBrEaKThey're missing a golden business opportunity, the study concludes.LiNeBrEaK"Green strategies that save energy and fight global warming have broad consumer appeal and political support," said Cogan. "Companies that seize the initiative can gain market share, build investor confidence and insulate themselves against future energy shocks and climate change regulations. It's simply smart business to employ these governance practices today."LiNeBrEaKThe report's recommendations include elevating climate change as a governance priority for board members and CEOs and linking the largest compensation packages of companies to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets or other climate performance measures.LiNeBrEaKThe complete study is available at www.ceres.org.LiNeBrEaK"Green strategies that save energy and fight global warming have broad consumer appeal and political support."LiNeBrEaKDoug Cogan RiskMetrics LiNeBrEaKApplied Materials is committed to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Replace lawns  	Public Forum Letter  	PUBLIC FORUM; Opinion  	135 words  	With climate change threatening to make Utah's water resources more scarce, we need to start making Salt Lake City as water-efficient as possible to ensure that everyone has an adequate water supply during future low times. LiNeBrEaKA massive misuse of water resources is the watering of vast lawns that have no place in an arid desert like ours. The state of Utah needs to set an example by replacing all grass lawns under its jurisdiction with Utah's native drought-resistant plants that require no additional watering aside from the brief, infrequent rain showers that visit the valley.LiNeBrEaKOur goal should be to have all of Utah's lawns replaced by xeriscaping within a few years. If the government leads the way, people will be much more willing to make this important change to their own yards.LiNeBrEaKNick MostertLiNeBrEaKSalt Lake City	WATER QUALITY (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); DESERTS (70%)  					SALT LAKE CITY, UT, USA (93%) UTAH, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%)  	December 13, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved  																
THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	JOBS PLAN HAS TO INCLUDE WOMEN  	LINDA R. HIRSHMAN GUEST COLUMNIST  	EDITORIAL; Pg. A23  	763 words  	Barack Obama has announced a plan to stimulate the economy by creating 2. 5 million jobs over the next two years. He intends to use the opportunity to make good on two campaign promises - to invest in road and bridge maintenance and school repair and to create jobs that reduce energy use and emissions that lead to global warming.LiNeBrEaKObama compared his infrastructure plan to the Eisenhower-era construction of the Interstate system of highways. It brings back the Eisenhower era in a less appealing way as well: There are almost no women on this road to recovery. LiNeBrEaKBack before the feminist revolution brought women into the workplace in unprecedented numbers, that would have been more understandable. But today, women constitute about 46 percent of the labor force. And as the current downturn has worsened, their traditionally lower unemployment rate actually has risen just as fast as men's. A just economic stimulus plan must include jobs in such fields as social work and teaching, where large numbers of women work.LiNeBrEaKThe bulk of the stimulus program will provide jobs for men, because building projects generate jobs in construction, where women make up only 9 percent of the work force.LiNeBrEaKIt turns out that green jobs are almost entirely male as well, especially in the alternative-energy area. A broad study by the United States Conference of Mayors found that half the projected new jobs in any green area are in engineering, a field that is only 12 percent female, or in the heavily male professions of law and consulting; the rest are in such traditional male areas as manufacturing, agriculture and forestry. And like companies that build roads, alternative-energy firms also employ construction workers and engineers.LiNeBrEaKFortunately, jobs for women can be created by concentrating on professions that build the most important infrastructure - human capital. In 2007, women were 83 percent of social workers, 94 percent of child care workers, 74 percent of education, training and library workers (including 98 percent of preschool and kindergarten teachers and 92 percent of teachers' assistants).LiNeBrEaKLibraries are closing or cutting back everywhere, while demand for their services, including their Internet connections, has risen. Philadelphia's proposal last month to close 11 branches brought people into the street to protest.LiNeBrEaKMany of the jobs women do already are included in Obama's campaign promises. Women are teachers, and the campaign promised to provide support for families with children up to the age of 5, increase Head Start financing and quadruple the money spent on Early Head Start to include a quarter-million infants and toddlers. Special education, including arts education, is heavily female as well. Obama promised to increase financing for arts education and for the National Endowment for the Arts, which supports many school programs.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama also promised that the first part of his plan to combat urban poverty would be to replicate a nonprofit organization in New York called the Harlem Children's Zone in 20 cities across the country. The group, which works to improve the quality of life for children and families in the Harlem neighborhood, employs several hundred people in full- and part-time jobs. By making good on this promise, Obama could create thousands of jobs for women in social work, teaching and child care.LiNeBrEaKUnlike the proposal to rebuild roads and bridges, the Harlem Children's Zone program is urban, and thus really green. If cities become more inviting, more people will live in them - and that means they will drive less, using less fuel. The average New Yorker's greenhouse gas footprint is only about 29 percent as large as that of the average American; the city is one of the greenest places in America.LiNeBrEaKMaybe it would be a better world if more women became engineers and construction workers, but programs encouraging women to pursue engineering have existed for decades without having much success. At the moment, teachers and child care workers still need to support themselves. Many are their families' sole support.LiNeBrEaKA public works program can provide needed economic stimulus and revive America's concern for public property. The current proposal is simply too narrow. Women represent almost half the work force - not exactly a marginal special interest group. By adding a program for jobs in libraries, schools and children's programs, the new administration can create jobs for them, too.LiNeBrEaKLinda R.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	BUSH TAKES PARTING SHOT AT ENDANGERED SPECIES LAW  	JOEL CONNELLY P-I COLUMNIST  	NEWS; Pg. A17  	865 words  	WHEN PLANNING TO widen Interstate 90 through Snoqualmie Pass, state transportation brass, federal agencies and greens wisely opted to cut down on road (and people) kill, and to give peace a chance.LiNeBrEaKThe result will be a series of wildlife overpasses and underpasses, and efforts to make Gold Creek a healthy home to the endangered bull trout.LiNeBrEaKThe unspoken trade-off: No lawsuits will hold up or raise costs on work that benefits the economy, and eases the drive to and from Eastern Washington. LiNeBrEaKBefore leaving the political stage, the Bush administration aims to kiss off this kind of modest use of intelligence. It is, said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., the Bushies' "last sour note."LiNeBrEaKUsing the Christmas season for cover, the Interior Department on Thursday issued "revised" regulations designed to shield federal projects from review under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaK"I've been waiting and holding my breath for one last awful thing (Bush) would do to be remembered by, and he has done it," said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash.LiNeBrEaKThe administration ignored comments from 300,000 citizens and adopted a policy that would allow federal agencies to ignore one of the nation's basic environmental laws.LiNeBrEaKIt would eliminate some requirements for independent review by scientists - notably from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service - as agencies plan projects involving timber sales, road construction and oil leases.LiNeBrEaKNew rules would also prohibit federal agencies from assessing how a proposed project would add to global warming or jeopardize species habitat.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed," Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne told reporters.LiNeBrEaKHuh?LiNeBrEaK"If this rule had been implemented in years past, highway builders could have done what they wanted, without talking to the Fish and Wildlife Service. We would probably not be seeing the improvements on I-90," said Rick McGuire of the Alpine Lakes Protection Society.LiNeBrEaK"The I-90 corridor has been a Berlin Wall between the northern Cascades and southern Cascades. If you don't make the means to cross a road like this, it's bad for wildlife. And it's bad for people who hit wildlife."LiNeBrEaKInslee noted the administration's recent two-step maneuver in the Chukchi Sea off the north coast of Alaska.LiNeBrEaKThe Fish and Wildlife Service formally listed the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act, due to the threat from global warming. Ignoring the listing, the feds' Minerals Management Service proceeded to sell oil leases where the bears live.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration finalized a retroactive justification on Thursday. It created a "special rule" for polar bears, allowing oil and gas drilling, as long as oil companies obey the Marine Mammal Protection Act.LiNeBrEaK"Polar bears don't need a listing. They need ice," said Inslee.LiNeBrEaKInslee noted the role of the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., who backed oil development in the Arctic and helped write the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaK"Senator Jackson and others had the foresight and intelligence to say: Let us allow the expertise of government scientists to be tapped before decisions are made," Inslee added.LiNeBrEaK"That's what the consultation process does. It has been used to good effect in our state."LiNeBrEaKCritics of the Endangered Species Act often substitute anecdote for fact.LiNeBrEaKThey've argued that consultation with government scientists means holdups and more work.LiNeBrEaKIn a filing with the Interior Department, however, the Natural Resources Defense Council noted that no evidence of delay and cost was produced to support relaxing the law.LiNeBrEaKQuite the contrary.LiNeBrEaKThe new policy nixes informal consultation between agencies intended to determine whether a project needs more formal and detailed environmental review.LiNeBrEaKThe likely result will be "erroneous findings" by agencies, argued the NRDC. What's the consequence? Project opponents will get grounds to sue.LiNeBrEaK"We will look at the final (rule) language when it is published tomorrow, but I think we will see them in court," said Andrew Welzler of the NRDC.LiNeBrEaKPutting teeth back in the Endangered Species Act, and reversing the new rule, presents a tricky, time-consuming task for the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKThe makeup of Obama's environmental team has surfaced in recent days. It is urban, and largely Eastern.LiNeBrEaKThe incoming Environmental Protection Agency boss, Lisa Jackson, has worked as New Jersey's environmental commissioner. Soon-to-be senior White House aide Carol Browner, an Al Gore prot&eacute;g&eacute;, is from Florida.LiNeBrEaKObama brass would be well advised to turn for help to the Pacific Northwest and Mountain West.LiNeBrEaKOur government leaders have dealt with tricky issues involving Endangered Species Act listings of Puget Sound salmon runs and orcas.LiNeBrEaKEast Coast environmentalists, in high government posts, proved tone-deaf and clumsy when dealing with endangered species issues in the Clinton and Carter administrations.LiNeBrEaKWhat's needed now is political savvy, plus what George W. Bush, in his 2000 campaign, described as "sound science."

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Thinking the unthinkable OUR VIEW | ENERGY  		EDITORIAL; Pg. C12  	620 words  	Consumers are enjoying the lowest retail gasoline prices in years, a welcome ray of light in an ever-darkening economic picture.LiNeBrEaKThat's good news for financially strapped American families and for the domestic auto industry, which has struggled to produce the high-mileage vehicles consumers wanted when gas prices spiked at more than $4 a gallon over the summer.LiNeBrEaKBut in the long run - as difficult as this is to accept - low gasoline prices hurt America more than they help. They encourage continued reliance on gas-powered vehicles and harm the efforts to lower carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. They discourage research into new, nonpolluting transportation energy sources - the single greatest technological challenge of the 21st century. LiNeBrEaKConsider what happened during the early 1980s, when gas prices soared to the then-unheard-of price of $1. 38 a gallon. It triggered a surge of research into alternative energy sources such as solar power and electric vehicles. But as soon as prices began to drop, as they did in 1982, so did the rush of investment and research into alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKAdjusted for inflation, that previous average high gas price of $1. 38 was the equivalent of $3. 14 a gallon. We didn't see average retail prices that high again until this year.LiNeBrEaKBut when gas prices and investment in alternative energy fell in this country in the 1980s, they didn't drop everywhere. In Europe and in Japan, high gasoline taxes kept fuel prices relatively high. That encouraged conservation and provided investors with greater confidence that the money they pumped into developing new technologies would earn an acceptable return.LiNeBrEaKThe result was that Japanese car companies were the first to market new hybrid cars, and European companies led the way in producing new, cleaner diesel vehicles. American car companies, meanwhile, kept churning out large, gas-guzzling SUVs.LiNeBrEaKAfter years of failed attempts to increase mileage requirements for new cars - efforts steadfastly opposed by American auto manufacturers and their unions, Congress finally succeeded last year. As a result, U.S. cars must average 35 miles per gallon by 2020. European cars, in contrast, averaged 38 miles per gallon in 2006.LiNeBrEaKIf increasing mileage standards has been difficult, hiking gas taxes has been unthinkable. Although the idea is floated occasionally (most incongruously by then-Rep. Dick Cheney in the 1980s, who supported a plan to tax imported oil), it never has received a serious airing. It should.LiNeBrEaKThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in 2004 that increasing the federal gasoline tax - which has been 18. 4 cents a gallon since 1993 - would reduce consumption faster and at less cost than increasing mileage standards.LiNeBrEaKObviously, it would not be painless. Consumers would be paying significantly higher prices, and the federal Energy Information Administration predicts that as the global recession abates, gasoline prices will resume their upward climb.LiNeBrEaKBut the impact of higher gas prices could be offset somewhat by reducing other taxes or through a federal income tax rebate. In the meantime, it would reduce gas consumption significantly.LiNeBrEaKThat would help undercut the financial strength of such countries as Iran and Russia that, armed with a surplus of petrodollars, have been unfriendly to American interests. And combined with other tax incentives, it would encourage U.S. investment in energy alternatives.LiNeBrEaKThe nation that succeeds in developing and deploying new, green technologies will have a major economic advantage in the decades to come. It's crucial that the United States be that nation.LiNeBrEaKCongress should raise the federal gas tax and push America toward innovation and energy independence.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	U.S. revises rules on animal species Input of independent scientists to be reduced, which critics say may hurt endangered wildlife.  	By Dina Cappiello THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. A2  	480 words  	WASHINGTON - Just six weeks before President-elect Barack Obama takes office, President George W. Bush's administration issued revised endangered species regulations Thursday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe changes, which will go into effect in about 30 days, were completed in just four months. But they could take Obama much longer to reverse.LiNeBrEaKThey will eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases.LiNeBrEaKThe rules also prohibit federal agencies from using a project's contribution to increased global warming in evaluating its effect on endangered species and the places they live.LiNeBrEaKInterior Department officials described the changes as "narrow," but environmentalists saw them as eroding the protections for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKInterior officials said federal agencies still could seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis, and that other parts of the law will ensure that species are protected.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed," said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in a conference call with reporters.LiNeBrEaKCurrent rules require biologists in the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to sign off on projects even when it is determined that they are not likely to harm species. The rule finalized Wednesday would do away with that requirement, reducing the number of consultations so that the government's experts can focus on cases that pose the greatest harm to wildlife, officials said.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists said that the rule changes would put decisions about endangered species into the hands of agencies with a vested interest in advancing a project and with little expertise about wildlife.LiNeBrEaKSeveral environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco hours after the rule's announcement.LiNeBrEaK"This new rule is essentially a changing of the guard for determining how government projects will affect endangered species," said Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Instead of expert biologists taking the first look at potential consequences, any federal agency, regardless of its expertise, will now be able to make decisions that should be determined by the best available science."LiNeBrEaKObama has said he would work to reverse the changes. But because the rule takes effect before he is sworn in, he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process. Congressional lawmakers also have vowed to take action, perhaps through a rarely used law that allows review of new federal regulations.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Belgian raids avert possible terror attack  		NEWS; Pg. 013  	313 words  	As European leaders convened here for a conference, Belgian police detained 14 Islamic extremists yesterday on suspicion one of them might have been planning an al Qaeda-style terrorist attack. LiNeBrEaKThe detentions, after a series of overnight raids on 16 locations in Brussels and the eastern city of Liege, had no known effect on plans for the European Union summit, which was scheduled to debate an economic stimulus plan and an ambitious program to protect the environment and reduce global warming in the 27 member countries.LiNeBrEaKJohan Delmulle, a federal prosecutor, told reporters in Brussels that information in the hands of police indicated one of the 14 "was possibly planning a suicide attack." But he did not specify whether the target was among the presidents and prime ministers who were gathering yesterday afternoon for the two-day summit conference.LiNeBrEaKBelgian authorities did not reveal the nationalities of those detained but said three of them had been to Afghanistan and Pakistan, along whose common border the al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding.LiNeBrEaKBelgium in recent years has become home to a large community of North African and other Muslim immigrants. Most have taken their place in the economy, in activities ranging from business to taxi driving, but some have been accused of ties to or sympathies for al Qaeda in the past.LiNeBrEaKBelgian authorities last year warned that Islamic extremists were planning to attack Christmas observances in Brussels, provoking widespread concern dampening the festivities. This time, however, they said only that there were indications some kind of an attack was planned, probably in Belgium.LiNeBrEaK"It is more than likely that an attack in Brussels has been prevented," said a government statement. An unnamed government source told the Reuters news agency that the detentions were preventive, and no formal arrests were announced.

Directed by Scott Derrickson. With Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. *LiNeBrEaKKlaatu. Barada. Nik . . .LiNeBrEaKWhoa.LiNeBrEaKFans of classic science-fiction - or even of Ringo Starr album covers - have strong memories of the image, a brushed-metal flying saucer landing in Washington to disgorge Gort, a towering robot, and Klaatu, an imperturbable alien ready to unleash violence to ensure peace.LiNeBrEaKBut now "The Day the Earth Stood Still" has been remade. And this time the strange visitor from another planet is - Keanu Reeves? LiNeBrEaKThis remake is being called a "reinvention," and it's true that there are changes beyond replacing the late Michael Rennie and giving the heroine a more active role. In the first, 1951 film, Klaatu came to warn us about nuclear armageddon. Here, it's the ecology.LiNeBrEaKThe basic idea is that we're ruining the Earth, a vital part of the galactic eco-system. So, an interplanetary council has made the only logical decision: Exterminate one species in order to save the rest. Klaatu, it seems, is the Terminix man, and we are the vermin he's been sent to wipe out.LiNeBrEaKThis isn't a bad twist, although it would be nice if the film once mentioned the words "global warming," "toxic waste" or even just "pollution." Why bring up the topic if you're afraid to address it? It's as if the script were sketched out by Al Gore, then handed off to corporate lobbyists for a rewrite.LiNeBrEaKAfter a peculiar Himalayan prologue, the movie starts in earnest with the alien's arrival. Making the metaphor part of the production design, Klaatu arrives not in a flying saucer but in a planetary globe; he wears not a space suit, but a second, soon-shed placental skin. (Gort, happily, looks much the same - only supersized.)LiNeBrEaKOnce Klaatu arrives in Central Park, though, he's immediately shot by a nervous military; escaping from their secret hospital, with the number of a sympathetic physician, he runs to Jersey, where he calls her from Newark Penn. It's rush hour, it seems, and he's feeling pained and confused. (And who can't relate to that?)LiNeBrEaKThis is where things start to fall apart, though, as the couple drives haphazardly around the state and the good doctor tries to talk him out of genocide - at one point bringing him to her own fave professor, a Nobel Prize winner in "biological altruism." But little of this makes sense.LiNeBrEaKWhy does Klaatu abandon his plan to address the U.N.? Why doesn't he just give us a safe source of clean energy? And if he'd determined to exterminate us anyway, why is he so careful not to kill his pursuers?LiNeBrEaKWhat trendy remakers don't realize is that the creative DNA of a classic movie is as complicated as that of the people who made it; change one element, and you risk ruining everything. And by substituting pollution for nuclear weapons, the filmmakers have thrown the movie off its axis.LiNeBrEaKReeves remains monotonously dazed as Klaatu, although his affectless delivery actually works here. Jennifer Connelly is, as usual, the prettiest crying woman in the movies (although I don't know if I quite buy her as a world-renowned Princeton astrobiologist). The rest of the cast is, hopefully, forgettable.LiNeBrEaKGive "The Day the Earth Stood Still" points for its clever look, and some dazzling shots of Gort. (A sequence in which a military man tries - foolishly - to take a drill to him is particularly good.) But the dialogue is often as clumsy as the product placement, and the rushed resolution is a mad embrace of Luddite panic that's opposed to everything Klaatu seems to stand for.LiNeBrEaK"The Day the Earth Stood Still" may bill itself as science fiction. But it understands neither. Rating note: The film contains violence.LiNeBrEaKStephen Whitty may be reached at swhitty@starledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Next Jerseyan will face easier EPA role Whitman predicts Jackson will get more support than she did  	CLAIRE HEININGER, STAR-LEDGER STAFF  	NEW JERSEY; Pg. 025  	741 words  	The last time a New Jerseyan was chosen to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Gov. Christie Whitman stayed for a rocky 2 years, often undercut and overruled by the White House.LiNeBrEaKBut with former Department of Environmental Protection commissioner Lisa Jackson now headed for the same role, Whitman thinks things will be different.LiNeBrEaK"First of all, the environment will be a priority - that's a big difference," Whitman said in an interview yesterday. "Getting support from the White House that hasn't been there for the agency for a while in a sense of being more proactive on these issues." LiNeBrEaKDemocratic officials say Jackson, now Gov. Jon Corzine's chief of staff, will be officially nominated as soon as next week. She declined to comment yesterday.LiNeBrEaK"She's got a lot of challenges ahead of her, and she knows it," Whitman said. "I think she will have the support of the career people at the agency - they're looking forward to a change now, and a commitment from the higher levels to the issues they face every day."LiNeBrEaKIf confirmed by the Senate, Jackson would work for Barack Obama, a president whose environmental ambitions - particularly on climate change - stretch a lot farther than George W. Bush's, environmentalists and others said.LiNeBrEaK"Ultimately, you're a reflection of the president," said Assemblyman John McKeon (D-Essex), chairman of the Environment Committee. "There were some very formidable environmental accomplishments under the Whitman (governorship). . . . She went from there to saying, 'No big deal on arsenic levels in the water.'"LiNeBrEaKThe arsenic episode - in which Whitman came under attack for delaying rules to lower arsenic levels allowed in water, then reinstated the plan after an outcry - was one of several controversies during her tenure.LiNeBrEaKShe also assured European environmental ministers in 2001 that Bush was committed to the Kyoto accord setting goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions believed to cause global warming. But Bush undercut her, reversing a campaign promise on carbon dioxide and calling the treaty "fatally flawed."LiNeBrEaKAfter the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Whitman told residents of Lower Manhattan the air around Ground Zero was safe to breathe. She has defended the information the EPA released to the public amid harsh criticism from congressional Democrats and others.LiNeBrEaKWhen Whitman, a Republican, resigned in 2003, she denied that Bush had undermined her, but friends said she was often overruled and stuck by the president out of loyalty.LiNeBrEaKShe has become more critical of the White House, in a 2005 book and a recent Newsweek piece on tensions over the distribution of power between EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality, which coordinates federal environmental efforts by working with agencies from the White House.LiNeBrEaK"There's a lot of overlap there," Whitman said yesterday. "The problem for the agency is it gets demoralizing when you don't know if it's you or someone else who's speaking for the environment."LiNeBrEaKJackson may still encounter similar tangles, said Frank Maisano, an energy industry consultant. With Carol Browner, who headed the EPA under Bill Clinton, expected to be Obama's energy and environment czar inside the White House, she will likely trump the EPA in influence, Maisano said.LiNeBrEaK"The reality is that this administration seems to be putting a lot more power in the White House on these issues, especially related to climate and energy," Maisano said. "It'll make her job more difficult."LiNeBrEaKBut Jackson, who has a master's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton and a 19-year career at the EPA before taking over the DEP in 2006, knows how to implement an administration's policy. Whitman, he said, was accustomed to calling the shots as governor and "wasn't the real policy-setter" at the EPA.LiNeBrEaKThere could be a big difference under Obama, said Eric Stiles of New Jersey Audubon: "Environmental protection is not a partisan issue, it's just that the outgoing president was a train wreck."LiNeBrEaK"I think Lisa Jackson will be a strong advocate for the environment and for science-based regulation," said Matt Elliott, an advocate for Environment New Jersey. "I think she'll really stick to that, and stick to her guns on it."LiNeBrEaKCorzine yesterday deferred to the Obama transition team on the pending nomination. But the governor said Jackson was "committed absolutely" to protecting the environment. "I think she's one of the most effective leaders I've seen in an organization," he said.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: The case for a higher federal gas tax  	St. Louis Post-Dispatch  	COMMENTARY  	692 words  	Dec. 12--Consumers are enjoying the lowest retail gasoline prices in years, a welcome ray of light in an ever-darkening economic picture.LiNeBrEaKThat's good news for financially strapped American families and for the domestic auto industry, which has struggled to produce the high-mileage vehicles consumers wanted when gas prices spiked at more than $4 a gallon over the summer.LiNeBrEaKBut in the long run -- as difficult as this is to accept -- low gasoline prices hurt America more than they help. They encourage continued reliance on gas-powered vehicles and harm the efforts to lower carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. They discourage research into new, nonpolluting transportation energy sources -- the single greatest technological challenge of the 21st century. LiNeBrEaKConsider what happened during the early 1980s, when gas prices soared to the then-unheard-of price of $1. 38 a gallon. It triggered a surge of research into alternative energy sources such as solar power and electric vehicles. But as soon as prices began to drop, as they did in 1982, so did the rush of investment and research into alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKAdjusted for inflation, that previous average high gas price of $1. 38 was the equivalent of $3. 14 a gallon. We didn't see average retail prices that high again until this year.LiNeBrEaKBut when gas prices and investment in alternative energy fell in this country in the 1980s, they didn't drop everywhere. In Europe and in Japan, high gasoline taxes kept fuel prices relatively high. That encouraged conservation and provided investors with greater confidence that the money they pumped into developing new technologies would earn an acceptable return.LiNeBrEaKThe result was that Japanese car companies were the first to market new hybrid cars, and European companies led the way in producing new, cleaner diesel vehicles. American car companies, meanwhile, kept churning out large, gas-guzzling SUVs.LiNeBrEaKAfter years of failed attempts to increase mileage requirements for new cars -- efforts steadfastly opposed by American auto manufacturers and their unions, Congress finally succeeded last year. As a result, U.S. cars must average 35 miles per gallon by 2020. European cars, in contrast, averaged 38 miles per gallon in 2006.LiNeBrEaKIf increasing mileage standards has been difficult, hiking gas taxes has been unthinkable. Although the idea is floated occasionally (most incongruously by then-Rep. Dick Cheney in the 1980s, who supported a plan to tax imported oil), it never has received a serious airing. It should.LiNeBrEaKThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported in 2004 that increasing the federal gasoline tax -- which has been 18. 4 cents a gallon since 1993 -- would reduce consumption faster and at less cost than increasing mileage standards.LiNeBrEaKObviously, it would not be painless. Consumers would be paying significantly higher prices, and the federal Energy Information Administration predicts that as the global recession abates, gasoline prices will resume their upward climb.LiNeBrEaKBut the impact of higher gas prices could be offset somewhat by reducing other taxes or through a federal income tax rebate. In the meantime, it would reduce gas consumption significantly.LiNeBrEaKThat would help undercut the financial strength of such countries as Iran and Russia that, armed with a surplus of petrodollars, have been unfriendly to American interests. And combined with other tax incentives, it would encourage U.S. investment in energy alternatives.LiNeBrEaKThe nation that succeeds in developing and deploying new, green technologies will have a major economic advantage in the decades to come. It's crucial that the United States be that nation.LiNeBrEaKCongress should raise the federal gas tax and push America toward innovation and energy independence.

With innovative thinking, gutsy legislation and a conservative governor's approval, we can, for example, put the Minnesota Department of Transportation, along with tens of thousands of miles of roadway, on the auction block.LiNeBrEaKBuyers?

If our own won't step up to the plate, there are Saudi Princes, Russian oligarchs, and Chinese entrepreneurs awash with ready cash and an eagerness to see the United States vigorously embracing free-market solutions.LiNeBrEaKAfter MnDOT, the sky is the limit: the State Patrol, the DNR, State Parks and Forest, ultimately even the Capitol Building and the Governor's Mansion.LiNeBrEaKERIK F. STORLIE, MinneapolisLiNeBrEaKMitch Pearlstein's advocacy of the idea that we privatize MSP airport and our State Lottery seems to have missed a key point.LiNeBrEaKCorporations have amassed a terrible track record lately: Financial services giants like Citi and AIG have required huge bailouts, the auto industry is days away from imploding, the airline industry has never actually collectively earned a profit, and newspapers are slashing staff amid plunging revenue.LiNeBrEaKIn this context, why on earth would the citizens consent to sell or lease our shared public assets?LiNeBrEaKConservatives like to tell us that governments are poor managers laden with bureaucracy. But with the track records of multiple sectors of the economy so dismal, it may be time for conservative think-tankers to see that the same old prescription of "the market" is an ideology that is outdated.LiNeBrEaKDuring this resurgence of the downside risks of the business cycle, privatization should be rejected by Minnesota politicians and voters.LiNeBrEaKRALPH WYMAN, MINNEAPOLISLiNeBrEaKU.S. SENATE RECOUNTLiNeBrEaKAll ballots should be handled uniformlyLiNeBrEaKI'm confused by Secretary of State Mark Ritchie's statements that since the 133 missing ballots from Minneapolis can't be found, the state will use the machine count from election night.LiNeBrEaKIf the hand recount figures do not reconcile with the machine count and the state recognizes the machine count, why bother with the time and expense of a hand recount at all? Either the hand recount should be used or the machine count should be used in all instances. We don't want a repeat of Florida in 2000 where one side, or even one judge, gets to pick which precincts are recounted and which are not. If the machine count is more accurate, use it; if the law requires a hand recount, use it.LiNeBrEaKThe law requires all ballots to be handled in a uniform manner, something Minneapolis failed to do repeatedly in this election.LiNeBrEaKPHIL VAN SCHEPEN, MAPLE GROVELiNeBrEaKAMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRYLiNeBrEaKGovernment bailout won't increase demandLiNeBrEaKThe problem with the auto industry is that no one is buying cars.

TRILL, GLENWOOD, MINN.LiNeBrEaKLONG-TERM CARELiNeBrEaKCoverage is costly for those on a fixed incomeLiNeBrEaKAs a 67- and 68-year-old retired couple, we did what your editorial "A growing price tag for long-term care" (Dec. 11) suggests. Eight years ago we purchased long-term health care for the specific reason of being personally responsible for ourselves and not being a burden on our family or society in our older years.LiNeBrEaKOn our fixed income, we pay the monthly premiums. Imagine our surprise when the insurance company raised the premium with the approval of the Minnesota Insurance Commission. Two basic reasons were given for the increase: The company hadn't estimated correctly the amount of care costs it would have to cover (in other words, people were living longer and actually using their coverage) and second, the company didn't anticipate that people would continue paying the premiums (in other words, when the insured were on fixed incomes, they would drop the coverage).LiNeBrEaKWe contacted Minnesota representatives and senators, the Minnesota Insurance Commission, AARP and the company with our concerns. No help or suggestions. In fairness to the insurance company, after we talked with people there, they did offer a one-time buyout for the amount of premiums we'd paid. At this age, and now due to a preexisting condition, securing different coverage would be cost prohibitive. We were also told that future increases could be expected.LiNeBrEaKSo we continue to pay 7 percent of our fixed income, plus $180 a month for insurance to supplement Medicare. Being responsible is very costly. Any suggestions?LiNeBrEaKJUDY ROSS, BURNSVILLELiNeBrEaKABUSE IN NURSING HOMESLiNeBrEaKHow'll she choose safe place for a loved one?LiNeBrEaKMy grandmother is at that age where she is going to need to be in a nursing home.

Charlie Crist's wedding. LiNeBrEaKThe "black tie optional'' event has got the governor's friends hauling out tuxedos and fancy dresses for the wedding at First United Methodist Church of St. Petersburg and a reception at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort.LiNeBrEaKAlthough Crist has refused to release a list of invited guests - 220 are expected - and most of them won't talk about it on the record, the Capitol grapevine is filled with news about those who have the hottest ticket in town.LiNeBrEaKThe list includes St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker, St. Petersburg Times editor, chairman and CEO Paul Tash, Rep. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg, and former Ambassador Mel Sembler and his son, Brent Sembler. The younger Sembler was finance chairman for Crist's 2006 campaign and a fraternity brother at FSU.LiNeBrEaKOther fraternity brothers reportedly attending include Tallahassee lobbyist David Rancourt and Harry Sargeant III, a Boca Raton businessman and Republican fundraiser. Other lobbyists with invitations include Brian Ballard, former chief of staff for Gov. Bob Martinez and a campaign adviser to Crist,Ronnie Book of Miami, as well as Rich Heffley, a Tallahassee lobbyist who spends a lot of time working in Republican campaigns.LiNeBrEaKAlthough rumors are flying that some big-name guests are on the list, none have been confirmed. It has been reported, for instance, that Joe Scarborough, the former Florida congressman who has a television show on MSNBC, had made the guest list. Not true.LiNeBrEaK"I have not been invited," Scarborough said in an e-mail.LiNeBrEaKSeveral members of the State Board of Education will be among the guests: Dr. Akshay Desai, head of Universal Health Care Insurance in St. Petersburg and a substantial Republican donor; Kathleen Shanahan, former chief of staff for Gov. Jeb Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney; and Roberto Martinez, former U.S. attorney from Miami. Shanahan and Martinez worked on Crist's 2006 transition team.LiNeBrEaKOther Miami lawyers with ties to Crist who will be at the wedding include Democrat Dean Colson, an adviser to the governor on higher education issues, and Manny Kadre, an old friend.LiNeBrEaKAlso on the list are Crist's current chief of staff Eric Eikenberg, former chief of staff George LeMieux, former communications director Vivian Myrtetus and current communications director Erin Isaac, and two men who served as top legal advisers to Crist: Paul Huck Jr. of Miami and Chris Kise, a Tallahassee lawyer and unpaid adviser to the governor on climate change issues.LiNeBrEaKFormer U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, Crist's former boss, is reportedly attending, as is Republican Party chairman Jim Greer, as well as GOP executive director Jim Rimes.LiNeBrEaKSteve Bousquet and Mary Ellen Klas of the Times/Herald Tallahassee Bureau contributed to this report, along with Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Final Edition	California adopts sweeping greenhouse gas rules  	AP Wire Services  	News; Pg. A5  	369 words  	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) California on Thursday adopted the nation's most sweeping plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, issuing rules that could transform everything from the way factories operate to the appliances people buy and the fuel they put in their cars. The Air Resources Board unanimously approved the plan despite warnings it will put costly new burdens on businesses at a time when the economy is in extreme crisis, with California forecasting a staggering budget gap of $41. 8 billion through mid-2010. Republican Gov.  LiNeBrEaKArnold Schwarzenegger said he believes the regulations will spur the state's economy and serve as a model for the rest of the country. "When you look at today's depressed economy, green tech is one of the few bright spots out there, which is yet another reason we should move forward on our environmental goals," Schwarzenegger said in a statement. The strategy relies on 31 new rules affecting all facets of life, including where people may build their homes and what materials they use to do it. One central piece is a cap-and-trade program, set to begin in 2012, under which power plants, refineries and big factories will be able to buy and sell the right to emit heat-trapping gases. The program could give plant operators a financial incentive to reduce their carbon emissions. Air regulators said the average Californian could see more fuel-efficient cars and plug-in hybrids on showroom floors; better public transportation; housing nearer to schools and businesses; and utility rebates to make their homes more energy-efficient. But there will also be costs: Cars could become more expensive, and Californians can expect higher electric rates as utilities increase their use of renewable energy. Homes built with energy-efficient materials could also prove more costly, as could gasoline reformulated to release less carbon dioxide. The rules spell out in broad terms how the state intends to carry out a landmark 2006 California law that made the state a leader in confronting climate change. The law conceived when the economy was in better shape requires the state to cut greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. More detailed rules will be issued over the next few years.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Final Edition	Think globally; act globally  	CAL THOMAS Tribune Media Services  	Syndicated; Pg. A23  	707 words  	For years I have received letters written as elegantly as ransom notes, advising me of certain worldwide conspiracies. Sometimes the writing instrument of choice has been a crayon. The most dangerous conspirators, said many of the scribblers, were the Jews, who allegedly were intent on dominating the world's finances and everything else, which would be remarkable, given their small number. Then it was the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission that supposedly were conspiring individually and collectively to ruin America through their secret meetings and conspiratorial plotting.  LiNeBrEaKI dismissed these because I know members of both and found at least those I knew to be patriotic Americans. To conspiracists, that either made me "one of them," or it made me a dupe. I consigned all the letters to the same file, File 13, which held other bogus conspiracies, from the late atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair's alleged attempts to ban religious broadcasting, to the "fluoridation is a commie plot" campaign of the '50s to GM's supposed "death car," which was said to cause the demise of whoever owned it, to the one about alligators in the New York City sewer system that bit women when they used public toilets. Recently, though, I have been giving more serious consideration to another "conspiracy" that seems to be growing legs. It is the conspiracy of one-world government. As governments increasingly demand more power to direct and shape our future by mandating how we live (not to mention their increasing invasiveness with cameras, wiretaps and other forms of "monitoring"), those who believe in individual liberty are on the defense. On Dec. 8, columnist Gideon Rachman of the Financial Times wrote as if he, too, is a reluctant conspiracist, listing themes related to global concerns: a global financial crisis, "global warming" and the global war on terror. He also pointed to the obvious shrinkage of the world through communication. In this, he is of the same frame of mind as Thomas Friedman in his book "The World is Flat." Rachman quoted Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey: "For the first time in human history, world government of some sort is now possible." Blainey forecasts its establishment as some time in the next 200 years. I think it could arrive much sooner. The European Union might be Barack Obama's model, as could the United Nations. In nominating his top campaign aide, Susan Rice, to be America's UN ambassador, Obama also announced his intention to raise the post to cabinet rank. In his book, "The Audacity of Hope," Obama wrote, "When the world's sole superpower willingly restrains its power and abides by internationally agreed-upon standards of conduct, it sends a message that these rules are worth following." In fact, the message it sends is that the ideas and ideals which made America unique in the world are no longer worth following, because in a one-world government, the United States would inevitably have to compromise its beliefs, laws, faith and everything else that makes it unique. European and Third World leaders would effectively be running the show. Obama was elected president of the United States, not president of a world order, or worse, one of many equals among one of many nations that are nothing special. It's bad enough to have the Democratic Congress dictating to Detroit and borrowing money from the Chinese to keep automakers afloat, as they make cars fewer people want. It would be something far worse to have a world body pass laws that require Americans to live by standards they would never choose for themselves. Rachman concluded on an optimistic note. Noting that even within the EU, a one-world government remains unpopular, he wrote, "The world's most pressing political problems may indeed be international in nature, but the average citizen's political identity remains stubbornly local." Maybe, but if we get too many "global" crises happening at once, the clamor for a one-world government to bring order, even at the expense of liberty, may be too strong for some politicians to resist. So, yes, I'm starting to believe in the possibility of one-world government and it should be vigorously opposed if America, as we know it, is to be preserved.

USA TODAY 	December 12, 2008 Friday   FINAL EDITION	Obama's 'green dream team' is warmly received;  EPA veterans to lead charge on energy mandate 	Traci Watson  	NEWS; Pg. 5A  	682 words  	WASHINGTON -- One is a Nobel Prize winner overseeing research of alternative energy. The three others all have one thing in common: experience working for the Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaKTogether, the group -- as the Associated Press has reported -- will make up President-elect Barack Obama's team to oversee energy and environment, a lineup that drew mostly praise Thursday from environmental and industry groups alike.LiNeBrEaK"This is clearly a green dream team," said Gene Karpinski, head of the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group. "These people have shown they can get the job done." LiNeBrEaKObama has mustered an "impressive team of experienced and capable leaders," said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, a group representing electric companies.LiNeBrEaKAll the same, fulfilling Obama's goals of taking action on global warming and turning the country toward more sustainable energy "is very challenging, and they ought not to underestimate how difficult this is going to be," said Eileen Claussen of the non-profit Pew Center on Global Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKThree of the four are EPA veterans. The most experienced is Carol Browner, Obama's pick for energy "czar." She would coordinate energy issues across the federal government. As head of the EPA during the Clinton administration, she won battles with other top officials to tighten air pollution limits and cut emissions from cars and trucks.LiNeBrEaKHer return, though, left some of her former adversaries concerned that the new administration will veer too far left.LiNeBrEaK"Carol Browner is a bad choice," said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. "She worked for Al Gore and shares many of his wildest opinions."LiNeBrEaKNancy Sutley, tapped as head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, was a special assistant to Browner before working as a top energy and environment official in California.  Lisa Jackson, who would be the first African-American chief of the EPA, served for a short time in the agency's headquarters during the 1980s.LiNeBrEaKOnly Steve Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist selected as secretary of Energy, has never been immersed in the rough-and-tumble of Washington politics.  Supporters say Chu, who overhauled the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy, is up to the job of leading the department.LiNeBrEaKChu is "one of the smartest people I know (and) wise," said Art Rosenfeld, a former Energy Department official now a member of the California Energy Commission. "I'm very pleased."LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press reported earlier this week that Obama has decided on Browner, Chu, Jackson and Sutley and will announce their appointments next week.LiNeBrEaKSutley led the effort to cut huge amounts of air pollution emitted by the Port of Los Angeles as the city's deputy mayor for energy and environment, said Warner Chabot, incoming head of the California League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group. He described her as soft-spoken and modest but capable.LiNeBrEaK"In California, the roadside is littered with people who underestimated the effectiveness of Nancy Sutley," he said.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who is currently New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine's chief of staff, was described by both environmental and industry leaders as a pragmatist who listened to both sides during her two years as New Jersey's top environmental official. She helped push the state to become one of the first to adopt limits on pollutants that cause global warming.LiNeBrEaK"She is a fantastic asset," said Jim Leonard of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce. "She was able to bridge the gap between the environmental community and the employer community."LiNeBrEaKThe four will need every bit of expertise and diplomatic skill they have to overcome differences of opinion in Washington, said Bryan Mignone, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.LiNeBrEaK"It is really a historic opportunity to move on those issues," Mignone said. "But that doesn't mean it's inevitable or easy. It's going to be incredibly difficult."

Ventura County Star (California)  	December 12, 2008 Friday 	State OKs cut in emissions by 15%: California Air Resources Board approves 13-year road map  	Timm Herdt, Ventura County Star, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	939 words  	Dec. 12--SACRAMENTO -- Saying the eyes of the world were upon them, members of the California Air Resources Board on Thursday unanimously approved a regulatory road map that directs how the state will cut gas emissions that cause global warming by 15 percent over the next 13 years.LiNeBrEaKThe precise details will be developed over the next two years, but board Chairwoman Mary Nichols said the plan puts California "farther ahead than anybody else" in plotting how to wean itself from fossil fuels and their climate-changing production of carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaKThe action came as two of the state's Cabinet secretaries were in Poland attending an international summit on global warming, and three weeks after President-elect Barack Obama told a national governors' conference that under his leadership the federal government will "confront this challenge once and for all."LiNeBrEaKThe air board's staff report estimates the plan will have net economic benefits through 2020, increasing both the state's economic output and the incomes of average Californians by spurring clean-technology development.LiNeBrEaKThe costs of doing nothing, it said, could be calamitous. Over time, unabated global warming would threaten the state's water supply through the virtual elimination of the Sierra snowpack and imperil coastal communities through rising sea levels.LiNeBrEaKThe plan lays out strategies designed to reduce statewide emissions of carbon dioxide by 174 million metric tons, about 15 percent less than what the state now produces and 30 percent less than what would be emitted in 2020 under a business-as-usual scenario.LiNeBrEaKThe largest amount of reductions would come through a market-based system in which the state would auction off a fixed amount of emission credits to large polluters, such as oil refineries, electrical power plants and cement plants, and allow them to buy and sell credits as a means to manage future emissions reductions.LiNeBrEaKThe plan also includes a host of regulatory controls such as new energy-efficiency standards for cars, buildings, appliances and water heaters; a requirement that a third of all electricity used in the state be generated by renewable sources; a greater reliance on alternative transportation fuels; and a directive that local governments adopt land-use policies that will reduce the number of miles Californians drive to work and shop.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a champion of the global warming cause, called the vote "a great moment for California's environment and for our economy."LiNeBrEaKVentura County Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills, co-author of the law that directed the board to act, said the plan will produce three important benefits: stimulate investment in new technologies, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases, and provide a model for the federal government and other states.LiNeBrEaKThe board's action followed a five-hour public hearing that featured very little protest. Business groups that had earlier criticized the plan's rosy economic assumptions toned down their complaints after the board resolved to continue evaluating the economic consequences.LiNeBrEaKThe two issues of greatest dispute were the plan's reliance on the cap-and-trade approach to achieve reductions from refineries and large industrial polluters, and its target for emissions reductions to be achieved through smart-growth strategies adopted by local governments.LiNeBrEaKCritics, including Julia May of the San Francisco-based Communities for a Better Environment, said a cap-and-trade system that lumps oil refineries with entities that produce far fewer emissions will not work.LiNeBrEaK"We beg you to ditch this crazy, out-of-control, super-sector pollution trading," she said. "The very largest industrial sources have zero reductions in this plan."LiNeBrEaKThat board's Environmental Justice Advisory Committee also strongly opposed the cap-and-trade approach and urged that emissions from large polluters be controlled instead through a tax on their carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKTheir arguments received some sympathy from board members, including Daniel Sperling, director of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies.LiNeBrEaKSperling said the plan must include "a price signal to mobilize market forces," and that either the cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax would work. While supporting the cap-and-trade approach, he urged the board to "keep the carbon tax idea on the table. It is a simpler, more elegant approach."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups also asked the board to more than double the targeted emission reductions that could be achieved through such smart-growth practices as concentrating new development in urban areas and encouraging greater use of mass transit.LiNeBrEaKVentura County Supervisor Linda Parks of Thousand Oaks, however, said the plan's target already presents a challenge to local governments.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking on behalf of the Southern California Association of Governments, Parks said it will be difficult for local governments to reach the goal. "It is a challenge that we are up for," she said. "If it is set higher, local governments will not be motivated to reach a target that is unattainable."LiNeBrEaKThe board kept the target at 5 million metric tons, but members said they intend to review that number in the months ahead to see if it can be increased.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	December 12, 2008 Friday   VP Zone NC Edition	BIMP's the name, beaches are the game  	CATHERINE KOZAK  	Y; Pg. Y2  	698 words  	By Catherine KozakLiNeBrEaKThe Virginian-PilotLiNeBrEaKConsidering the web of federal, state, county and municipal plans and studies that already exist, it may seem that the last thing North Carolina needs is another bureaucracy to manage its coast.LiNeBrEaKEven the acronym for the state's first Beach and Inlet Management Plan - BIMP - seems to lack the gravitas of its stated mission: development of a comprehensive regional strategy for management of 326 miles of barrier islands and 19 tidal inlets.LiNeBrEaKRather than adding to bureaucratic bloat, the plan is intended to streamline planning, speed permitting, improve coordination, promote pooling of resources and create a clearinghouse for coastal data on beaches and inlets, all on a regional scale. LiNeBrEaKIt will assess ongoing activities, provide the framework for additional work and ultimately develop a long-term approach to sustain the coast.LiNeBrEaK"What we really want to do with this effort is take what we've learned in the last 30 to 35 years and figure out what to do in the next 30 to 40 years," Steve Underwood, assistant director of the Division of Coastal Management, said at a public meeting on Thursday.LiNeBrEaKIn a later interview, Underwood said the plan may sound overly ambitious, but the goal is to stay ahead of the curve with looming climate change challenges facing the state. Also, conditions in the southern and northern regions of the coast are not the same and should not be managed the same.LiNeBrEaKFour regions and numerous subregions have been established . Management strategies will be developed for each region, incorporating ecological, economic and sociopolitical factors that could affect inlet and beach management.LiNeBrEaK"I would argue that we are right out in front in making that approach to coastal management," he said. "I think people are going to have to look at a different way of doing things."LiNeBrEaKAs it stands now, Underwood said, there is no comprehensive plan that prioritizes projects, no long-term funding plan, no sea-level rise plan, no centralized repository for masses of data.LiNeBrEaK"We also pursue coastal projects on a case-by-case, project-by-project basis without considering the regional implications of those projects on the system as a whole," he said in an e-mail. "This approach leads to a more reactive way of dealing with coastal management issues versus a more proactive approach."LiNeBrEaKPart of the early impetus for establishing the beach and inlet plan, Underwood said, was frustration with coordinating sediment management projects with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.LiNeBrEaKVarious factors - cost, sand travel, shoaling - have contributed to loss of sediment in the coastal system, an undesirable consequence when beaches are eroding and sand sources for replenishment are few.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, the Corps and Coastal Management have been working closely together in study and funding of sediment resources, he said.LiNeBrEaKCoastal Management and the state Division of Water Resources partnered to develop the initial beach and inlet management plan, which was recommended in the state Coastal Habitat Protection Plan in 2004 and mandated by legislation passed in 2000 by the General Assembly.LiNeBrEaKSo far, $1 million has been appropriated for the plan, although $250,000 of it is frozen in the fiscal year 2008- 09 state budget. The final report is to be presented to the legislature in April.LiNeBrEaKPublic input, as well as interagency and local government cooperation, is critical to the success of the plan, Underwood said.LiNeBrEaK"No one has really come to the table for an overarching plan or an idea for bringing all these groups together," he said .LiNeBrEaKThat could even translate into something as cost- and time-saving as regionwide environmental impact statements, or other management changes.LiNeBrEaK"I think we can do things a little quicker and be smoother about it because we have this information right there," he said. "There'll have to be tangible, real things."LiNeBrEaKFor more information, visit: www.ncbimp.netLiNeBrEaKCatherine Kozak, (252) 441-1711,LiNeBrEaKcate.kozak@pilotonline.comLiNeBrEaKwhat is it?LiNeBrEaKThe plan is intended to streamline planning, speed permitting, improve coordination, promote pooling of resources and create a clearinghouse for coastal data on beaches and inlets, all on a regional scale.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	December 12, 2008 Friday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Bush revises law to reduce scientific input on projects  	DINA CAPPIELLO  	FRONT; Pg. A10  	637 words  	By Dina CappielloLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTONLiNeBrEaKJust six weeks before President-elect Barack Obama takes office, the Bush administration issued revised endangered-species regulations Thursday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe changes, which will go into effect in about 30 days, were completed in just four months. However, they could take Obama much longer to reverse. LiNeBrEaKThey will eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases.LiNeBrEaKThe rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project's contribution to increased global warming.LiNeBrEaKInterior Department officials described the changes as "narrow," but environmentalists saw them as eroding the protections for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKInterior officials said federal agencies could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis and other parts of the law will ensure that species are protected.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed," said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in a conference call with reporters.LiNeBrEaKCurrent rules require biologists in the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to sign off on projects even when it is determined that they are not likely to harm species. The rule, finalized Wednesday, would do away with that requirement, reducing the number of consultations so government's experts can focus on cases that pose the greatest harm to wildlife, officials said.LiNeBrEaKHowever, environmentalists said the rule changes would put decisions about endangered species into the hands of agencies with a vested interest in advancing a project and little expertise about wildlife. Several groups planned to file lawsuits immediately.LiNeBrEaK"This new rule is essentially a changing of the guard for determining how government projects will affect endangered species," said Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Instead of expert biologists taking the first look at potential consequences, any federal agency, regardless of its expertise, will now be able to make decisions that should be determined by the best available science."LiNeBrEaKReviews and consultations completed by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service between 1998 and 2002 have helped safeguard protected species such as bald eagles, Florida panthers and whooping cranes. A federal government handbook from 1998 described the consultations as "some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species."LiNeBrEaKObama has said he would work to reverse the changes. However, because the rule takes effect before he is sworn in, he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process. Congressional lawmakers have also vowed to take action, perhaps through a rarely used law that allows review of new federal regulations.LiNeBrEaKIn a related development, the Bush administration also finalized on Wednesday a special rule for the polar bear, a species that was listed as threatened in May because of global warming. The rule would allow oil and gas exploration in areas where the bears live as long as the companies comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act.LiNeBrEaKthe changesLiNeBrEaKThe changes will eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	December 12, 2008 Friday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	California adopts landmark series of environmental policies  	SAMANTHA YOUNG  	FRONT; Pg. A14  	390 words  	By Samantha YoungLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKSACRAMENTO, Calif.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia on Thursday adopted the nation's most sweeping plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, issuing rules that could transform everything from the way factories operate to the appliances people buy and the fuel they put in their cars. LiNeBrEaKThe Air Resources Board unanimously approved the plan despite warnings it will put costly new burdens on businesses at a time when the economy is in crisis, with California forecasting a budget gap of $41. 8 billion through mid-2010.LiNeBrEaKRepublican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he believes the regulations will spur the state's economy and serve as a model for the rest of the country.LiNeBrEaK"When you look at today's depressed economy, green tech is one of the few bright spots out there, which is yet another reason we should move forward on our environmental goals," Schwarzenegger said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKThe strategy relies on 31 new rules affecting all facets of life, including where people may build their homes and what materials they use to do it.LiNeBrEaKOne central piece is a cap-and-trade program, set to begin in 2012, under which power plants, refineries and big factories will be able to buy and sell the right to emit heat-trapping gases. The program could give plant operators a financial incentive to reduce their carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKAir regulators said the average Californian could see more fuel-efficient cars and plug-in hybrids on showroom floors; better public transportation; housing nearer to schools and businesses; and utility rebates to make their homes more energy-efficient.LiNeBrEaKBut there will also be costs: Cars could become more expensive, and Californians can expect higher electric rates as utilities increase their use of renewable energy. Homes built with energy-efficient materials could also prove more costly, as could gasoline reformulated to release less carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThe rules spell out in broad terms how the state intends to carry out a landmark 2006 California law that made the state a leader in confronting climate change. The law requires the state to cut greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. More detailed rules will be issued over the next few years.LiNeBrEaKconcernsLiNeBrEaKThe Air Resources Board unanimously approved the plan despite warnings it will put costly new burdens on businesses at a time when the economy is in crisis.

The Washington Times 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Gore plans green gala to welcome 'new energy'  	By Christina Bellantoni, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A08  	321 words  	Former Vice President Al Gore will host a green inaugural ball the night before President-elect Barack Obama takes the oath of office.LiNeBrEaK"The Green Ball: Inauguration of a New Green Economy" will be Jan. 19 at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery. LiNeBrEaKA draft version of the invitation, obtained by The Washington Times, urges people to "please join" Mr. Gore to "bring together a diverse coalition of environmentally-forward organizations, entrepreneurs, scientists and advocates, celebrating a commitment to growing the New Green Economy."LiNeBrEaKMore than two dozen environmental organizations are listed on the invitation.LiNeBrEaKIt also features a green-shaded image of Mr. Obama, along with a quote from the Democrat's interview with Time Magazine from the fall.LiNeBrEaK"There is no better potential driver that pervades all aspects of our economy than a new energy economy. ... That's going to be my No 1 priority when I get into office."LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama and Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. huddled with Mr. Gore in the Chicago transition office Tuesday to discuss energy policy and ways climate change efforts can create new jobs.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect is expected to name his environmental posts soon, perhaps as early as Monday.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, a second group is planning a "green inaugural ball," calling it the first "eco-friendly" inaugural celebration. It is planned for Jan. 17 at the Andrew W. Mellon auditorium in Washington.LiNeBrEaKThe founder said the goal was to inspire the official inaugural committee to incorporate similar plans into their events.LiNeBrEaKA press release issued Wednesday notes the catering will be "100 percent organic" and that the bars will feature both local and organic beverages.LiNeBrEaKThe food waste and floral arrangements will be composted and the lighting scheme will be energy efficient. The group will also pay for wind power offsets and carbon credits to make the event carbon neutral.LiNeBrEaKIt urges guests to sport green or black ties.

The Washington Times 	December 12, 2008 Friday 	Chu admirers question powers as Energy chief  	By Audrey Hudson, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A09  	740 words  	Steve Chu escaped controversy during his tenure as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2004 and is widely respected among his peers, but some are questioning the effectiveness of President-elect Barack Obama's choice to head the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaKRichard R. Burt, former chief negotiator in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and ambassador to Germany, praised Mr. Chu as a solid pick after a meeting Thursday with reporters and editors at The Washington Times. LiNeBrEaK"By all accounts, he is an enormously knowledgeable and talented individual who understands the science as well as the politics of energy," Mr. Burt said.LiNeBrEaKBut Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said while Mr. Chu is "very well qualified," he fears the agency will continue to subsidize renewable energy alternatives such as solar panels and windmills rather than creating new technology that is competitive and sustainable on its own.LiNeBrEaK"I think [Mr. Chu] is an indication that Obama really is committed to pursing renewable energy, which the Energy Department has been subsidizing and researching for 30 years. It's a boondoggle. But these technologies are not competitive, and all of the subsidies and taxpayer government monies are really an impediment to making products competitive," Mr. Ebell said.LiNeBrEaK"He is going to be doing a lot of the wrong things as secretary, but he will be doing it because that is what his president wants him to do," Mr. Ebell said. "I fear there will be billions and billions and billions of dollars wasted on corporate welfare for special interests."LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Department's mission is to create energy security, promote technological advancement and oversea cleanups of national nuclear weapons complexes. Mr. Chu's chief job will be to promote America's energy security through reliable, clean and affordable energy but, more important, renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama is expected to announce his energy and environmental team next week, including Carol M. Browner, former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief as the key White House official on climate and energy policy; Nancy Sutley, Los Angeles deputy mayor to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality; and Lisa P. Jackson, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protections to lead the EPA.LiNeBrEaKChristie Whitman, former EPA chief, told MSNBC that she had concerns about Mr. Chu's management experience.LiNeBrEaK"He's certainly going to know how to analyze the issues," she said. "He's going to know the feasibility as he looks at them from a scientific point of view. But it's going to be the 'Can they be implemented?' part of it that will be a challenge for him.LiNeBrEaK"It's a big leap from the academic world to the administrative world," Mrs. Whitman said.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Spencer Abraham, who served as President Bush's energy secretary from 2001 to 2005, said he had the chance to observe Mr. Chu as director of the California laboratory.LiNeBrEaK"He is an outstanding leader and scientist and therefore an excellent nominee who deserves broad support from the Senate during his upcoming confirmation," Mr. Abraham said.LiNeBrEaKWhile its sister lab in Livermore, Calif., has experienced controversies concerning security gaps at the nuclear weapons complex, and workers unknowingly exposed to beryllium dust, the lab at Berkeley has received positive accolades during his tenure and Mr. Chu's efforts to develop zero-carbon energy sources.LiNeBrEaKAccording to his biography, posted on the lab's Web page, Mr. Chu was an early advocate for finding scientific solutions to climate change and he guided the lab to become a leader in alternative and renewable energy research, particularly the development of carbon-neutral sources of energy.LiNeBrEaKHe advanced the lab's existing programs for energy-efficient buildings, more powerful batteries and monitoring greenhouse gases, and worked to insure Berkeley's continued pre-eminence in fields such as cancer research, photon science, astrophysics, materials science and high-performance computing.LiNeBrEaKMr. Chu won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1997 for his collaborative work to develop methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light while working for ATandT Bell Laboratories.LiNeBrEaKMr. Chu, 59, was born in St. Louis. His wife, Jean, was trained as a physicist at Oxford University. He formerly was dean of admissions at Stanford and the university president's chief of staff. His parents emigrated from China.

The Washington Post 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	14 Detained in Suspected Terrorist Plot;  Belgium Acts as E.U. Leaders Gather in Capital 	Edward Cody; Washington Post Foreign Service  	FOREIGN; Pg. A20  	612 words  	As European leaders convened here for a summit, Belgian police detained 14 people Thursday on suspicion that one of them might have been planning an al-Qaeda-style terrorist attack, judicial authorities announced.LiNeBrEaKThe detentions, after a series of overnight raids on 16 locations in Brussels and the eastern city of Liege, had no known effect on the European Union summit,  where leaders began debating an economic stimulus plan and a  program to protect the environment and reduce global warming.LiNeBrEaKJohan Delmulle, a federal prosecutor, told reporters in Brussels that information in the hands of police indicated that one of the 14 "was possibly planning a suicide attack." But he did not specify whether the target was among the presidents and prime ministers who were gathering Thursday afternoon for the two-day conference. LiNeBrEaK"We do not know where this suicide attack was to take place," judicial authorities said in a statement. "It could have concerned an operation in Pakistan or Afghanistan. But it is not to be excluded that Belgium or Europe could have been the target."LiNeBrEaKBelgian authorities declined to reveal the nationalities of those detained but said three of them had been to Afghanistan and Pakistan, along whose common border the al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding.LiNeBrEaKBelgian authorities last year warned that  Islamist extremists were planning to attack Christmas observances in Brussels, provoking widespread concern dampening the festivities. This time, however, they said only that there were indications that some kind of an attack was planned.LiNeBrEaK"It is more than likely that an attack in Brussels has been prevented," the government said in a separate statement.LiNeBrEaKAn unnamed government source told the Reuters news agency that the detentions were preventive. No formal arrests were immediately announced. But the prosecutors' statement said one of those  detained had made a farewell video suggesting he was about to launch a suicide attack.LiNeBrEaKThe summit conference, a regular meeting of European leaders, faced what officials predicted would be long and difficult negotiations aside from whatever terrorism threat may have been underway.LiNeBrEaKThe European Commission, the  bloc's Brussels-based executive branch, has recommended a $250 billion stimulus program for the 27 member governments to offset an abrupt economic slowdown brought on by the global financial crisis. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who holds the union's rotating presidency, has enthusiastically endorsed the suggestion, as has Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain.LiNeBrEaKBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that too much stimulus spending, and the debt it implies for the years ahead, would be a dangerous deviation from rules that limit public debts in member countries to 3 percent of gross domestic product. Her finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, on the eve of the summit accused some European leaders of "tossing around billions" to fix fallout from the financial crisis, suggesting they were acting irresponsibly to protect themselves from criticism as the crisis bites into economic activity.LiNeBrEaKSimilarly, some countries have voiced concern about the costs inherent in reaching the European Union's goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 20 percent before 2020. A main tool, according to a preliminary accord reached in difficult negotiations over recent months, would be a guarantee that renewable sources of energy, such as windmills and solar power, produce 20 percent of the continent's energy by the 2020 target year. Poland in particular, which gets 85 percent of its energy from coal, has demanded increased economic support in exchange for agreeing to the plan.

The Washington Post 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	Seasoned Regulators to Lead Obama Environment Program  	David A. Fahrenthold; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A09  	1113 words  	The Obama administration has ambitions for a radical change in U.S. environmental policy. But President-elect Barack Obama did not pick radicals to lead it.LiNeBrEaKInstead, the three officials tapped for leadership posts on the environment are not activists but regulators who have spent years in the weeds of such issues as mercury emissions, brownfields and black-bear hunts.LiNeBrEaKThey will inherit the usual issues -- dirty air, dirty water, brownfields and red tides -- plus an unprecedented one. Obama has promised to cut back U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases -- a proposal that could set off an enormous political fight. LiNeBrEaKA review of their records and past statements reveals little about the exact policies they would pursue under Obama. It shows they have won over some environmental activists with an open attitude and disappointed others who felt they were not pushing hard enough.LiNeBrEaKTheir expected efforts to limit greenhouse gases would be more ambitious than changes they have sought in previous positions.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be an enormous challenge," said Felicia Marcus, the western director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "To call it 'herding cats' would be to oversimplify it. It's like herding dogs, cats, wolves and sheep."LiNeBrEaKDemocratic sources say Obama plans to name Carol M. Browner, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to a new position overseeing energy, environment and climate change policy from the White House. He will choose Lisa P. Jackson, who headed the New Jersey environment agency, as head of the EPA.LiNeBrEaKAnd, sources said, he will name Nancy Sutley, a deputy mayor in Los Angeles, to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality. The president-elect is expected to announce the appointments next week.LiNeBrEaKAlong with Steven Chu -- a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who sources say will be named secretary of energy -- the three will form the core of Obama's environmental team.LiNeBrEaKWord of their appointment was greeted enthusiastically yesterday by some environmental groups. The League of Conservation Voters called the group a "green dream team."LiNeBrEaKIndustry groups were more cautious. At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Vice President William Kovacs said the group worried that the new officials would use their power to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and impose painful new costs on energy use.LiNeBrEaK"I think that they could be aggressive, and we're hoping that they're really going to look at the circumstances" of the economic downturn, Kovacs said. "That is our biggest single concern, because literally all three of them have a regulatory bent."LiNeBrEaKVictor Flatt, a law professor at the University of Houston who has studied environmental legislation, said he saw a strategy behind the picks. In a legislative fight about the right way to cut emissions, he said, it would be valuable to have officials who've been in similar state-level battles.LiNeBrEaK"This shows a really good understanding of the negotiations that are going to go on," Flatt said. He said that Sutley and Chu, who heads the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, could bring valuable experience from that state. "California's just ahead of everybody else" on climate issues, he said.LiNeBrEaKYesterday, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, who will be the new chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called Obama's picks "outstanding people."LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be a dramatic change from what we've seen in the last eight years from the Bush administration, where even some of the agencies that were supposed to be working to protect the environment were doing all they could to undermine it," Waxman said in an interview.LiNeBrEaKAmong the three tapped to be environmental officials, Browner is the best-known. During her eight years at EPA under President Bill Clinton, she led the fight for tougher air pollution standards, which the agency eventually won after a legal fight that led to the U.S. Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, Browner was part of a group of former EPA leaders that called on the Bush administration to impose caps on greenhouse gases. Now, she will probably be called on to help Obama do that. The president-elect says he wants to reduce emissions to 1990 levels over 12 years.LiNeBrEaKEd Krenik, who worked as the EPA's liaison to Congress for two years under Bush, said he worried that Browner's new role could upset government scientists if it is seen as a deadening layer of bureaucracy.LiNeBrEaK"If there's a concern out there, it's probably concern amongst EPA staff" that their director would have a less direct line to Obama, Krenik said. Browner declined a request to comment.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who led the New Jersey environmental agency from 2006 to 2008, has impressed both activists and business groups with her open leadership style. An official at the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce recalled that Browner agreed to give businesses in Paterson, N.J., a brush-up on environmental laws before sending officials in on an enforcement sweep. The leader of Environment New Jersey remembered calling Jackson on her cellphone to warn that legislation was being introduced to try to weaken environmental laws.LiNeBrEaKJeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said employees of the agency complained that Jackson was not tough enough in pushing for cleanups of polluted "brownfields," or requiring polluters to limit greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaK"We called her a pliant technocrat, who sort of time after time did the wrong thing, but did it charmingly," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists credit her with stopping New Jersey's controversial bear hunt and urging Gov. Jon Corzine (D) to adopt an aggressive goal on climate change. The state committed to reducing emissions 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaK"I think she pushed [Corzine] as far as she could," said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey. Still, New Jersey has found it difficult to say how it will reach those goals. A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said a climate action plan is overdue but expected next week.LiNeBrEaKJackson declined to comment yesterday.LiNeBrEaKSutley, tapped to lead the council on environmental quality, had worked for California Gov. Gray Davis (D). Marcus, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, supervised Sutley in the 1990s when she was a senior policy advisor at the EPA. Marcus described her as a quick study, easily able to master the technical details of any controversy.LiNeBrEaK"She's one of those people [to whom] you give the toughest issues," Marcus said. The Obama transition team did not respond to a request to interview Sutley.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Philip Rucker and staff researcher Meg Smith contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	Evangelical Leader Quits Over Gay Union Remark  	Jacqueline L. Salmon; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A07  	413 words  	A prominent evangelical lobbyist resigned yesterday over his remarks in a National Public Radio interview, in which he said he supports permitting same-sex civil unions.LiNeBrEaKThe Rev. Richard Cizik, vice president for governmental affairs for the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), later apologized for the remark, said the Rev. Leith Anderson, president of the 30 million-member organization. LiNeBrEaKBut, Anderson said, "he lost the leadership's confidence as spokesman, and that's hard to regain."LiNeBrEaKAsked by Terry Gross in a Dec. 2 interview on NPR's Fresh Air whether he had changed his position on same-sex marriage, Cizik responded: "I'm shifting, I have to admit. In other words, I would willingly say that I believe in civil unions.  . . . We have become so absorbed in the question of gay rights and the rest that we fail to understand the challenges and threats to marriage itself -- heterosexual marriage. Maybe we need to reevaluate this and look at it a little differently."LiNeBrEaKThe remark, anathema to most evangelical Christians, who believe that the Bible permits marriage only between a man and a woman, caused an uproar in the group and in other evangelical organizations.LiNeBrEaKCizik did not return calls. Anderson said he met with Cizik on Wednesday at Anderson's Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minn. Cizik's decision to resign was "reluctantly mutual," said Anderson, "by that I mean from me as well as from him."LiNeBrEaKThis isn't the first time that Cizik has offended evangelicals, particularly conservatives. In recent years, he has taken a leadership role in the growing religious movement to curb global warming, calling it "an offense against God."LiNeBrEaKMore than two dozen evangelical leaders -- including James C. Dobson, chairman of Focus on the Family, and Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council -- complained in a letter last year to the NAE leadership that Cizik was "using the global warming controversy to shift the emphasis away from the great moral issues of our time," which they defined as abortion, homosexuality and sexual morality.LiNeBrEaKRichard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said Cizik's beliefs had diverged too far from those of the NAE membership.LiNeBrEaK"There's been some concern from the constituents that he was at least some distance from where the constituency was, but this is a whole different order of magnitude for his constituency on the gay-marriage issues -- it's a mega-issue," he said.

The Washington Post 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Regional Edition	Developing Nations Plan Emission Cuts;  Shift Seen as Crucial to New Climate Pact 	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	FOREIGN; Pg. A10  	1230 words  	Several major developing countries that had long resisted making specific commitments to combat global warming are laying out concrete plans to curb their greenhouse gas emissions at the United Nations climate conference here, a shift that could mark the most positive development in the slow-moving negotiations.LiNeBrEaKGetting the emerging economies -- such as China, Brazil and South Africa -- to limit their escalating carbon footprint has been seen as crucial to the prospects for a future global climate pact. For years these nations have argued that the industrial world must first own up to its historic responsibility and commit to binding cuts, while the United States and other developed countries have countered that they cannot afford to limit emissions until their international economic competitors do the same.LiNeBrEaKThe past two weeks, however, have seen an easing of that impasse. Brazil has pledged to cut its annual deforestation rate by 70 percent by 2017 -- which could reduce  the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30 to 45 percent over the next decade -- and Mexico has vowed to bring its carbon emissions to 50 percent below their 2002 levels by 2050. LiNeBrEaKEarlier this year, South Korea pledged to set a climate target next year, and South Africa approved a plan under which its emissions would plateau between 2020 and 2025 and begin declining between 2030 and 2035. India outlined a national plan that would boost solar power production. And Kazakhstan moved this week to join the 1997 Kyoto Protocol with a plan to bring its greenhouse gas output back to 1992 levels by 2012.LiNeBrEaKAnnie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund's climate and air program, called the pledges "the most significant development here" in Poznan. "That is countries voting with their feet, joining the carbon market, saying they're coming in regardless of what happens with the process here."LiNeBrEaKRae Kwon Chung, South Korea's climate ambassador, said he hopes his country will be "a trend-setter" by adopting a climate goal and proposing an  international climate registry that would track whether developing nations are curbing emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The current culture is of mistrust and finger-pointing. It's 'you first,'  '[no,] you first,' " Chung said. "We do not share the same historic responsibility. But we will make a contribution commensurate to our capability."LiNeBrEaKPaula Dobriansky,  undersecretary of  state for  democracy and  global  affairs, who leads the U.S. delegation, said Thursday that she had made a point of telling leaders of the emerging economies that the administration appreciates their proposals, and said, "They're noteworthy, and they provide really an important foundation on which to build."LiNeBrEaKThese overtures, coupled with an earlier proposal by China to reduce its "energy intensity" by 20 percent by 2010, are giving negotiators some hope that they can ultimately forge a new agreement aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions enough to avoid a predicted global temperature rise of 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit, which scientists say could be catastrophic. The new pact would replace the Kyoto treaty, which expires in 2012, and which the United States never accepted.LiNeBrEaK"One of the things that has constrained this process in the past is the impression that developing countries are not acting on climate change," said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which hosts the talks. "In fact, nothing could be further from the truth."LiNeBrEaKStill, the question remains whether these measures are aggressive enough to curb global warming, and whether developing nations will meet their targets, which they insist are voluntary. Moreover, several made it clear they expect industrialized nations to help fund the technology to make this transition possible.LiNeBrEaKMarthinus van Schalkwyk, South Africa's environment minister, said his country and others recognize that they need to take action in a way that is "measurable, reportable and verifiable," as outlined in the interim climate agreement reached last year in Bali. Any final deal between the industrialized and developing worlds, he added, comes down to: "At what level do they feel we are doing enough, and at what level do we feel they are doing enough?"LiNeBrEaKThe new pledges also represent a challenge to the industrialized nations. Tasso Rezende de Azevedo, director general of the Brazilian Forest Service, said his nation's plan shows that developed countries have been too timid when outlining their climate targets.LiNeBrEaK"If we can talk about decreasing [emissions] 50 percent by 2018, which is in 10 years, why can't the industrialized countries commit themselves to decreasing 80 percent by 2050, which is in 50 years?" he asked.LiNeBrEaKSome environmentalists and local activists said the major emitters in the developing world will have to do more. Fred Boltz, vice president for conservation strategies at the advocacy group Conservation International, noted that Brazil's pledge to reduce deforestation from more than 4,600 square miles a year to 1,900 square miles annually still leaves the Amazon vulnerable to ecological degradation.LiNeBrEaK"It's a great step forward, but it's not a leap, and they can leap," Boltz said, adding that Brazil has remote sensing equipment that allows it to precisely track the deforestation.  "They can make deeper cuts, and I think we can ask that of any nation."LiNeBrEaKManoel Cunha, who represents 80,000 Amazonian families as president of Brazil's National Council of Rubber Tappers, said the government would have to change its policies to achieve its climate goals. "The incentives in Brazil have always been directed at those who have destroyed the forest," he said.LiNeBrEaKFernando Tudela, Mexico's vice minister of  environment and  natural  resources, emphasized the need for financial help from richer nations. At a news conference Thursday, he said that Mexico will set "aspirational goals" but that the extent to which they would be met "will depend on the kind of support we can find in the international regime."LiNeBrEaKA study published by the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University of Colorado in the journal Climate Research suggests most developing countries are ill-equipped to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions significantly in light of the economic and technological disparities between them and industrialized nations. While poorer nations generally have smaller economies, the study found, they are responsible for about 47 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, partly because of their inefficient energy and transport systems.LiNeBrEaK"There is simply no evidence that developing countries will somehow become wealthier and be in a position to install more environmentally friendly technologies," said Patricia Romero Lankao of the atmospheric research center, the study's lead author. "We always knew that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was going to be a challenge, but now it looks like we underestimated the magnitude of this problem."LiNeBrEaKSouth Africa's van Schalkwyk said the two sides will reach a final agreement next December in Copenhagen only if it includes language on "funding, finance and technology transfer" that will help developing countries shift to  low-carbon economies.LiNeBrEaK"It will be a hard reach to get that," he said, but essential. "Otherwise the deal will have no integrity whatsoever. It will be words on paper."

The Washington Post 	December 12, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	Concern for Climate Change Defines Energy Dept. Nominee  	Steven Mufson; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A09  	1177 words  	The man tapped to be the next secretary of energy, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu, recently compared the danger of climate change to a problem with electrical wiring in a house.LiNeBrEaKSuppose, he said, you had a small electrical fire at home and a structural engineer told you there was a 50 percent chance your house would burn down in the next few years unless you spent $20,000 to fix faulty wiring.LiNeBrEaK"You can either continue to shop for additional evaluations until you find the one engineer in 1,000 who is willing to give you the answer you want -- 'your family is not in danger' -- or you can change the wiring," Chu said in a presentation in September.LiNeBrEaKBecause of the danger of climate change, he said, the United States and other countries also need to make some urgent repairs. He said governments need to "act quickly" to implement fiscal and regulatory policies to stimulate the deployment of technologies that boost energy efficiency and "minimize" carbon emissions. LiNeBrEaKChu's views on climate change would be among the most forceful ever held by a cabinet member. In an interview with The Post last year, he said that the cost of electricity was "anomalously low" in the United States, that a cap-and-trade approach to limiting greenhouse gases "is an absolutely non-partisan issue," and that scientists had come to "realize that the climate is much more sensitive than we thought."LiNeBrEaKHe said people who said they were uncertain whether climate change is being caused by humans were "reminiscent of the dialogue in the 1950s and '60s on tobacco." (At that time, many argued that there was insufficient evidence linking smoking to cancer.)LiNeBrEaKHe put aside the atomic and molecular biophysics research he had been doing as a Stanford University professor to become head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2004 and steer it toward projects aimed at slashing the country's emissions of greenhouse gases that hasten climate change. He created the Helios Project, a center that seeks to use solar energy to generate chemical fuel at a low cost.LiNeBrEaKThe laboratory's scientists, including 11 Nobel laureates, have altered yeast and bacteria into organisms that produce gasoline and diesel, improved techniques for converting switchgrass into the sugars needed to produce transportation fuel, and used nanotechnology to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic cells used in solar panels, among other projects.LiNeBrEaKChu said in remarks prepared for a recent meeting in Washington that while private companies such as DuPont and Duke Energy were investing in new technology, "most companies are reluctant to invest in research into transformational technologies that may not see commercialization for 10 years, even though such technologies could dramatically change the entire energy landscape."LiNeBrEaKChu worked from 1978 to 1987 at ATandT Bell Laboratories, where he did the work that led to his Nobel Prize in 1997. Other scientists at Bell Labs have made scientific breakthroughs leading to advances such as the invention of the transistor, Chu said. But, he added, "the great industrial research institutes such as Bell Labs are now mere shadows of their former glory." (Alcatel-Lucent, the current owner of Bell Labs, said earlier this year that it was cutting back basic science, material physics and semiconductor research.)LiNeBrEaKChu, who declined to comment yesterday for this story, said that meant government support for research at universities and the national labs was "our only hope to supply the science required to create transformative energy solutions."LiNeBrEaKChu's belief that technology and innovation can help solve energy and climate problems appeals to both environmentalists and to many people in the energy industry, though many environmentalists stress that current technology can go a long way toward slashing energy use.LiNeBrEaK"His experience seems to dovetail perfectly with the President-elect's commitment to bringing new energy technology to market in a timely fashion," said Scott Segal, a Bracewell and Giuliani partner and director of the coal and power industry-backed Electric Reliability Coordinating Council. "An understanding of the art of the possible in energy technology will be critical to the development of a cost-effective climate change policy."LiNeBrEaK"He is one of the few guys I know in academia who also has a practical and commercial side," said Terry Tamminen, an energy and environment expert and former chief policy adviser to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R). "He recognized that he could do so much more with knowledge other than teach classes."LiNeBrEaKChu's nomination, expected to be announced next week, would require Senate confirmation.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Department is an odd beast. Thirty-six percent of its $25 billion budget is related to national security, dealing with nuclear materials from such devices as decommissioned nuclear weapons and naval reactors. Another 25 percent of its budget goes to environmental management and civilian nuclear waste management.LiNeBrEaKAnother sizable chunk goes to the national laboratories, usually difficult for the central office to manage. In addition to Lawrence Berkeley, they include Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, Savannah River, Los Alamos, Argonne, Brookhaven and National Renewable Energy Laboratory.LiNeBrEaK"He's run one of these labs. He gets it," said a Democratic source familiar with the Obama transition team's thinking.LiNeBrEaKThe department could become more central to practical energy issues because of President-elect Barack Obama's interest in promoting renewable energy and carbon capture and storage for coal-fired plants. A program to promote electric cars through infrastructure spending could involve the Energy Department. The department also sets appliance standards and other energy efficiency goals.LiNeBrEaKThe son of highly educated Chinese immigrants, Chu was born in St. Louis in 1948. His father studied chemical engineering at MIT, and his mother studied economics there. Chu describes himself as the "academic black sheep" in a family full of graduate degrees and Ivy League graduates. He went to the University of Rochester. There he read a textbook by the famous physicist Richard Feynman and said he found it "mesmerizing and inspirational." He went to graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley before taking a job at Bell Labs. There he and another scientist did their prize-winning research, trapping atoms with laser cooling techniques.LiNeBrEaKChu has used his post at Lawrence Berkeley to preach the importance of climate issues. He has met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and he was co-chair of a committee that produced a report called "Lighting the Way: Toward a Sustainable Energy Future."LiNeBrEaKIn the interview with The Post last year, Chu said that he had confidence in mankind's ability to solve its energy problems. The challenge, he said, was to create things from nature that nature cannot make on its own. People figured out how to use titanium blades in jet engines, an improvement over bird wings, he said. "Maybe we can build a better photosynthesis machine," he said.

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   Final Edition	LETTERS  		EDITORIAL; Pg. A14  	545 words  	Mental health patients in state careLiNeBrEaKRe: Dec. 3 article "State school care is faulted."LiNeBrEaKAlthough the recent investigation of the Lubbock State School situation and U.S. Department of Justice report might be new, the situation definitely is not.LiNeBrEaKMy sister died of "accidental strangulation" from neglect at the Austin State School when she was 15, in the early 1970s. She was tied to the toilet by the laces at the back of her nightgown and left there. LiNeBrEaKI still remember the meeting in which the school superintendent talked to my mother, afraid she was going to file a lawsuit, which she ultimately decided not to do.LiNeBrEaKThe Texas state schools have long needed investigation and action to ensure that the residents there are given adequate and humane care. More people need to be yelling and screaming. Maybe Mom should have filed that lawsuit.LiNeBrEaKSue BumpousLiNeBrEaKAlexandria, Va.LiNeBrEaKRe: Dec. 4 editorial "Another state obligation compromised."LiNeBrEaKI strongly disagree with the tone and conclusions of the American-Statesman's editorial. It is untrue that "Texas' fiscal responsibility" is achieved on the backs of the 5,000 residents of state schools for the mentally retarded.LiNeBrEaKOur federal budget deficit is approaching $11 trillion and is a clear and present danger to future generations. Gov. Rick Perry is right to be worried, and Texas, thankfully, does not need or want a "bailout."LiNeBrEaKAs a result of the good economic policies and conditions in Texas, the Legislature has been able to increase spending for state schools by $107 million for the current biennium. Texas spends more than $125,000 per year for each state school resident.LiNeBrEaKThat said, I am committed to continuing to address the needs and the problems at our state schools during the next legislative session. To the extent that targeted funding for waivers will help alleviate them, Texas is in a great position to provide additional resources. And that is because of the state's fiscal conservatism rather than in spite of it.LiNeBrEaKState SEN. STEPHEN E.

What he really means is that by creating tougher emission standards, it would take a few bucks out of the pockets of those who already have plenty of money.LiNeBrEaKMoney is not the root of all evil, but it seems to be at the root of blind politics that places money over people's lives.LiNeBrEaKRamon C.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Nobel laureate sees risk and volatility at record levels  	Parista Yuthamanop, Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	428 words  	Dec. 11--Planning a long-term investment? Better consider carefully the risks of a volatile market, terrorism and climate change, according to Robert Engle, the 2003 Nobel laureate for economics. LiNeBrEaKProf Engle, the Michael Armellino Professor of Finance at New York University's Stern School of Business, was in Bangkok last week to give a presentation as part of the Bridges programme organised by the International Peace Foundation.LiNeBrEaKHe said market volatility had been higher than ever before, both in the equities and foreign exchange markets.LiNeBrEaK"There used to be a case when some sectors perform well and some badly in the US equities market. But now all go down together... There is no safe place to hide in the US market," he said.LiNeBrEaKEconomists expect a significant global slowdown, particularly considering the widening fiscal and current account deficits in the United States.LiNeBrEaKProf Engle said there would be a sustained period of global volatility due to volatility in growth and inflation. Investors, he said, should consider carefully both current and future risks.LiNeBrEaKLong-term investors face two major risks in war and climate change. Terrorism and war depress asset prices, affect employment and the broad economy.LiNeBrEaK"[A way to avoid war] is to build economic interdependency. Poverty can be reduced because of interdependency and education," Prof Engle said. "If there is too much political unrest, then the economy can not keep jobs. Peace permits prosperity. Without this, the economy cannot grow. If we reduce future risk of war, we will have benefit today."LiNeBrEaKHe said governments should also consider imposing a tax on activities that result in carbon emissions and greenhouse gas. This would be more efficient than subsidies on alternative fuel, which do not benefit the economy.LiNeBrEaKFunds from taxes can be used for social benefit such as pension funds or to stimulate the economy. A tax will also encourage people to become more energy efficient through the use of hybrid cars, bicycles or public transport.LiNeBrEaK"The use of a tax will prevent the buyers of hybrid cars instead of big SUVs from thinking that they have bought cars that they do not want," Prof Engle said.

Beaver County Times (Pennsylvania)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: A jolt of reality: More radioactive waste is downside to building nuclear power plants  	Beaver County Times, Pa.  	COMMENTARY  	413 words  	Dec. 11--During the presidential campaign, Republican candidate John McCain pledged to build 45 nuclear reactors by 2030 to meet the nation's energy needs.LiNeBrEaKWith just about everybody but the most ardent of global-warming deniers recognizing the negative impact that coal-fired plants are having on the environment, the proposal was appealing politically because it rolled energy independence and global warming into one package. LiNeBrEaKIt also was unrealistic.LiNeBrEaKThe United States has neither the manpower nor the materiel to construct that many nuclear power plants in that time period, and the companies that develop and design nuclear plants would face similar constraints. Clearing regulatory hurdles can take decades -- and don't forget the NIMBY factor.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the major factor for going slow on nuclear power is disposing the radioactive waste it generates.LiNeBrEaKThe United States has designated Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a proposed depository for spent fuel, but it is more than a decade away from being up and running, if it ever does at all.LiNeBrEaKIt's also important to remember that shipping spent fuel to Nevada would raise serious security and safety concerns.LiNeBrEaKIt's not just the disposal of spent fuel that presents a problem. As The Times reported on Sunday, facilities like the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station in Shippingport are having trouble disposing of low-level nuclear waste because a South Carolina landfill has stopped accepting it. (Until another disposal facility can be found, the waste is being stored on site.)LiNeBrEaKLow-level waste consists of such things as resins used to clean water at power plants and material used to power equipment at university laboratories and hospitals.

Bennington Banner (Vermont)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	EPA: Cow 'emissions' tax not in cards  	Keith Whitcomb Jr., Bennington Banner, Vt.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	729 words  	Dec. 11--HOOSICK, N.Y. -- Rensselaer County legislators are stating opposition to a possible regulation suggested by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that would place a tax on livestock "emissions."LiNeBrEaKIn July 2008, the EPA issued an advance notice of a proposed rule in response to the a ruling made by the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that greenhouse gases, such as methane, are air pollutants under the federal Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKThe period to submit comments on the advance notice ended Nov. 28, but members of the Rensselaer Democratic minority, as well as the Republican majority, have spoken out recently against a part of the rule that they feel would place a tax on methane produced in the digestive tracts of cows. LiNeBrEaKHeather Vaughan, spokesperson for the National Cattleman's Beef Association, said the EPA is not seeking to place a tax on cows. She said the EPA released the rule-making notice to highlight the implications of using the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gasses.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a statement from the EPA "The Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making does not recommend the use of any particular Clean Air Act authority to regulate any emissions, nor does it commit to specific next steps to address greenhouse gasses."According to the EPA, the advance proposal is meant to explore the challenges in using the Clean Air Act to curb greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKAccording to a statementLiNeBrEaKfrom the EPA "The Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making does not recommend the use of any particular Clean Air Act authority to regulate any emissions, nor does it commit to specific next steps to address greenhouse gasses."According to the EPA, the advance proposal is meant to explore the challenges in using the Clean Air Act to curb greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKVaughan said the issue has been blown out of proportion, and that no one should think a cow tax is on the way.LiNeBrEaKThat hasn't stopped legislators and farmers from voicing their disapproval. Wally Sheffer, owner of Sheffer's Grassland Dairy in Hoosick, began dairy farming for himself this year. A fifth generation farmer, Sheffer raised heifers on contract with other local farmers for years before raising them on his own.LiNeBrEaKSheffer said his farm milks about 100 cows but has slightly under 200 animals on his farm. He said in a bad year, one cow will earn the farm between $200 and $300.LiNeBrEaKAccording to statements released by the Rensselaer County Democratic minority, the "cow tax" as proposed would cost around $175 annually per dairy cow and $87. 50 per beef cattle.LiNeBrEaK"This ridiculous proposal could ruin farmers in Rensselaer County," said Democratic Legislator Keith Hammond, in a release.LiNeBrEaKThe sentiment is being echoed on either side of the political aisle. "My feeling about this is that it's so tough for farmers to make a living, that to tax them $175 per head might drive them out of business," Republican Legislator Lester Goodermote said.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic Legislator Kevin Harrington said he has sent letters to U.S. Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat, and Republican Paul Tonko, as well as the EPA, urging them not to go along with the proposed tax.LiNeBrEaKSheffer said that if such a tax were approved, which he said Monday wasn't likely, it would put many farms out of business. He said he is able to afford to be a dairy farmer by using a rotational pasture system, which his son Eric learned while studying in Europe. By putting the cows in a different pasture after each milking, their feed is fresher and their milk is better, he said.LiNeBrEaKSheffer said he hoped to make a profit soon, but added that dairy farming has always been risky, even before the recent economic downturn.LiNeBrEaKHe said he plans to increase his herd by 40 percent next year.LiNeBrEaKEric Sheffer said the dairy industry seems safe compared to the finance industry, adding they are able to see their investments everyday.LiNeBrEaK"I can see every penny I've got invested," Wally Sheffer said.LiNeBrEaKContact Keith Whitcomb at kwhitcomb@benningtonbanner.com	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (94%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (93%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (91%); AIR QUALITY (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); METHANE (90%); BEEF CATTLE FARMING (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); TAXES and TAXATION (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); COUNTIES (89%); MAMMALS (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE (89%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (89%); DAIRY FARMING (88%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (86%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); POLITICAL PARTIES (75%); SUPREME COURTS (71%); FAMILY FARMS (66%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%); MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT (57%)  		Crime/law  	MASSACHUSETTS, USA (92%); VERMONT, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081211-QV-EPA-Cow-emissions-tax-not-in-cards-1211  	QV  												
Bowling Green Daily News (Kentucky)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Area teams prepare for LEGO regionals  	Joanie Baker, The Daily News, Bowling Green, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	775 words  	Dec. 11--The name says LEGO, but don't think this is child's play.LiNeBrEaKOn Saturday, students from several area schools will be competing in the regional FIRST LEGO League competition at Potter-Gray Elementary School for a chance to take their customized robots and projects to the state competition in January.LiNeBrEaKThe robots are made from uniquely designed LEGO constructions capable of rolling, lifting and sensing walls or sound. LiNeBrEaKAnd other than their construction, there's nothing simple about them.LiNeBrEaKSince September, students on Potter-Gray's three LEGO teams have been meeting at least once a week to electronically program their robots to complete "missions" without any remote control.LiNeBrEaKThe process involves measuring distances and turns and then programming the electronic "brain" to move the wheels a certain number of rotations, turn at a certain degree level and then lift the arm at a certain time.LiNeBrEaKAll the measurements are entered into a computer and then students practice missions on a trial basis.LiNeBrEaK"LEGO Challenge makes people think they're just building things with toys, but in reality they're programming small robots and making it do specific tasks it needs to do to complete them," said John Atkerson, whose son, Jack, is on one of the teams.LiNeBrEaKThe robotics portion of the competition only makes up a fourth of the overall challenge.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is to teach the 9- to 14-year-olds "gracious professionalism" and students are judged not only on robot design and project completion, but on the teamwork they use to accomplish their goals.LiNeBrEaK"For most kids, they learn problem-solving and probably in a way they've never had to," said Megan Lavery, whose son, Alex, is on a team.LiNeBrEaKPart of that problem-solving comes when the teams were told to implement the theme "Climate Connections Challenge" by finding a climate-related problem in their community and coming up with a solution.LiNeBrEaKOn Saturday, one of the Potter-Gray teams will present their solution to global warming.LiNeBrEaKTen-year-old Ryan Hughes said the Panther Cyclones saw how many parents were arriving to pick up students about 40 minutes before school ended and were letting their cars idol in the meantime.LiNeBrEaKDuring his team's skit, Hughes said he will sing a "radio" commercial from a cardboard car that tells the "mother" the dangers of the exhaust from her idling.LiNeBrEaKThe team had signs made that say "no idling" and hung them around the school.LiNeBrEaK"The project taught us a lot about how we can save the environment and not hurt the environment," Hughes said. "Idling can kill a lot of things." Ryan said. "Every time we get mad at each other, we mess up so if we just work together, we do better ... once we completed a robot mission and got 50 points when we were mad. Then we worked together and got 100 points the next time."LiNeBrEaKStudents will also be taken into a room of judges and given a task to complete as a team. During a state competition last year, students were given straws and marshmallows and asked to build the highest tower they could.LiNeBrEaKWhile the project completion is important, the students are judged more on how they interact as a team.LiNeBrEaKJudges also interview the students individually to determine the teamwork used for the robot and project and also judge the robot's technical design.LiNeBrEaKThis marks Potter-Gray's first time competing in the LEGO tournament, and several of the students said they didn't know it was so technical.LiNeBrEaKRyan said one of the robot's challenges involves traveling across a map at a 35-degree angle, picking up a polar bear and dropping it off across the map at a "research area."LiNeBrEaKHe said he measured the distances between the tasks and divided it by the wheel's diameter before programming it into the brain. Without the use of remote controls, the students have to stand back and see if their adjustments and measurements work.LiNeBrEaKThen it's back to the drawing board.LiNeBrEaKEleven-year-old Jessica Zhu, a fifth-grade student on the Atomic Atmospheres, said she's learned a lot from programming the robots.LiNeBrEaK"I know I've become more patient," she said. "My job isn't easy and it takes a lot of time. You can't just click and do it ... sometimes there's a dominant person on the team, but everyone has to participate equally and I think we learn from that."

The Boston Globe 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	For Boston, the lessons from Venice  	Matthew J. Kiefer and Hubert Murray  	OP-ED; Pg. A15  	760 words  	UPON ARRIVING in Venice on assignment in the 1920s, the writer Robert Benchley cabled his editor: "Streets filled with water. Please advise." As climate change causes sea levels to rise, this lighthearted quip assumes a darker shading.LiNeBrEaKBoston and Venice are separated - or united - by an ocean. Both are seaports that reincarnated themselves when their shipping and manufacturing economies faltered. Venice has long suffered from storm surges that used to flood St. Mark's Square once every five years. More recently beset with such "acqua alta" 40 times a year, including a severe episode last week, Venice began an ambitious public works project to protect itself from rising sea levels. It may be time for Boston to follow suit. LiNeBrEaKThe global interconnectedness that has caused jobs to migrate worldwide in search of cheaper labor has forced former manufacturing cities to adapt to a post-industrial economy. Boston began this process early by converting a former rail yard into the Prudential Center in the 1960s. Since then, a new economy of tech firms has sprouted in Kendall Square. Research labs, housing, and hotels now fill derelict wharves in Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston. Several million square feet of new development are envisioned for the South Boston Seaport and for North Point, a 45-acre former rail yard straddling Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville.LiNeBrEaKEach of these former industrial areas is built on filled land created within the natural harbor. Like Venice, these areas are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Although the science linking greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and sea-level rise is now established, there is no handy calculus to convert a given level of greenhouse gas emissions to a corresponding amount of sea-level rise.LiNeBrEaKThe human variables are also daunting. How quickly will clean electric power replace fossil-fuel-fired generating plants? Will alternatives to the internal combustion engine take hold before we burn the planet's remaining oil reserves? Will greenhouse gas reductions in developed countries that built their economies on carbon be offset by increases in the developing world, whose citizens want a chance to live the way we do?LiNeBrEaKThese questions are not yet answerable, but since there is so much stored greenhouse gas in the atmosphere already, climate change and its consequences are inevitable. With a 2-foot rise in mean sea levels, within the conservative range predicted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, more frequent storm surges are likely to inundate much of Boston's "made land."LiNeBrEaKIn 1988, Boston architect Antonio DiMambro proposed an ingenious remedy: a flood-control structure from Deer Island to Long Island to close the mouth of Boston Harbor and protect Boston from storm surges and extreme high tides, while allowing navigation and normal tidal flow through a series of gates. An idea that 20 years ago seemed to float somewhere between visionary and delusional now seems prescient.LiNeBrEaKRebuilding the country's decaying roads, bridges, and flood-control structures is now the subject of urgent national debate. At a time of extraordinary economic challenges, far-sighted policymakers recognize that one thing more expensive than undertaking new public works projects is not to undertake them. Like organisms, healthy cities must adapt to changes in their environment. Just as we catch our collective breath from finishing the Big Dig, we should be addressing the need to protect the investments countless people have made in the city's future by adapting it to inevitable climate change. This could include raising grade levels, creating reefs to absorb storm surges, or building a hard storm-surge barrier like the one proposed by DiMambro.LiNeBrEaKThis adaptation effort will present unprecedented environmental, engineering, and construction challenges - but, then, so did the Big Dig. While the current worldwide economic slowdown will reduce the pace of greenhouse gas emissions, we don't have time to waste. Venice's flood-control barrier took decades of planning and controversy before construction began. New York City's mid-20th century master builder Robert Moses claimed that major public works projects typically take 40 years from conception to completion. On that timetable, if we started now, we could complete a storm-surge barrier by about 2050 - just-in-time delivery on an urban scale.LiNeBrEaKMatthew Kiefer, a land use attorney, and Hubert Murray, an architect and planner, organized the recent Mass Impact conferences on cities and climate change.

The Boston Globe 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   THIRD EDITION	Crisis hampers US trade leadership Concerns raised at global conference  	Robert Weisman Globe Staff  	BUSINESS; Pg. B9  	758 words  	The global financial crisis - rooted in a US borrowing and spending binge - is eroding America's standing as the world's economic leader, making it harder to reach international consensus on issues ranging from trade and regulation to poverty and global warming, speakers at a Boston conference warned yesterday.LiNeBrEaKChina exports, imports fall. B10 LiNeBrEaK"In the eyes of many of our friends abroad, to say nothing of those who are not so friendly toward the United States, the credit crisis is seen as an inevitable outcome of US-style cowboy capitalism," E. Gerald Corrigan, managing director of New York investment bank Goldman Sachs and Co., told the US-China-India Innovation Partnerships Conference. "That's not a pretty thought, but that's the way it is."LiNeBrEaKStronger global partnerships, including academic alliances, will be critical to driving economic recovery and solving long-term political and environmental problems, said speakers at the opening day of the conference, organized by Boston research firm Mass Insight Corp. But such alliances could be undermined by a new wave of protectionist sentiment in the United States and other countries, they cautioned.LiNeBrEaK"The political tendency will be to close our borders, and that would be catastrophic," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, a research and forecasting firm in West Chester, Pa. "That is a very clear lesson from the Great Depression." LiNeBrEaKAbout 400 business, government, and academic leaders from the United States, India, China, and Singapore attended the conference, which continues through tomorrow at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center. Many participants expressed alarm at the collapse of multinational financial institutions and the deepening global recession rippling out from Wall Street and the US housing market.LiNeBrEaKCorrigan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, summed up the view of other speakers when he said much of the crisis stemmed from "global imbalances," with the free-spending United States running a widening trade deficit, buying goods and services from China and India, which run growing surpluses.LiNeBrEaK"One casualty of the crisis, and the suggestion that its roots are largely in the United States, is that US economic and financial leadership has frankly been damaged," Corrigan suggested in remarks that were astonishingly blunt for a prominent figure in American business. "That's in a context in which US leadership on the foreign policy front has not exactly been best-in-class for some time. And what that means, of course, is that President-elect Obama has a rather full plate."LiNeBrEaKOther participants agreed with Corrigan's assessment, and expressed disappointment with American stewardship.LiNeBrEaK"You can't say nobody saw this coming," maintained Charles Yang-Sheng Liu, principal at Hao Capital Management, a Beijing investment firm. "The United States has been spending beyond its means for 25 years, borrowing more to keep the party going."LiNeBrEaK"I think America is where Britain was in the 1920s," said Hemang Dave, a Bedford investment adviser of Indian origin, who predicted that developing nations like China, India, and Brazil will vie with the United States for economic power in coming decades. "There is a risk that the US will not recover its leadership position. Every 60 to 90 years, there's a change of leadership in economic activity."LiNeBrEaKNot everyone concurred. "The United States continues to be the most dominant economy, and for the foreseeable future it will be the dominant economy," contended Samir K. Barua, director of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, India.LiNeBrEaKCarl J. Dahlman, associate professor at Georgetown University and former senior adviser to the World Bank Institute, said national governments will need to better align their regulatory standards and develop mechanisms for public and private partnerships to move forward on problems like carbon emissions. But in the near future, he warned, countries were more likely to focus on stimulating their economies, putting longer-term issues on the back burner.LiNeBrEaKHaving recently returned from business travel across the Pacific Ocean, where other economies are also winding down debt, Ronald P. O'Hanley, president and chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Management, said, "The Asian view is at least as pessimistic about the United States as we are about ourselves. There's an incredible sense of disappointment. People say, `Yeah, we did the same things you did, but we did it because you did it."'

The Boston Globe 	December 11, 2008 Thursday  Correction Appended  	Winter easing its grip on Northeast Temperatures rising .08 degrees a decade  	Carolyn Y. Johnson Globe Staff  	METRO; Pg. A1  	793 words  	THIRD EDITIONLiNeBrEaKThe quintessential New England winter - frozen ponds, frigid days, and neighborhoods blanketed in white - is quietly fading away, as the season gets warmer and less snowy, according to an exhaustive new study.LiNeBrEaKAnalyzing four decades of winter climate data, beginning in 1965, University of New Hampshire scientists found that regional temperatures are rising at a rate of 0. 8 degrees per decade. Meanwhile, the number of days with snow on the ground is decreasing at the rate of 3. 6 days per decade, the study found.LiNeBrEaKBoth trends have intensified with time and were strongest in the heart of winter - January and February. LiNeBrEaK"A lot of people who have lived in the Northeast for 30 to 40 years have witnessed a distinct change in the character of their Northeast winter," said Elizabeth Burakowski, lead author of the study and a climate researcher at UNH. "Climate has changed in the past, and it will change in the future, but what makes this period distinct is we're witnessing this change in a human lifetime."LiNeBrEaKThe study, published in October in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, covered a region that stretches from New Jersey to Maine. Researchers analyzed data from 123 monitoring stations that reported the presence of snow on the ground, 88 stations monitoring snowfall, and 138 stations monitoring temperature.LiNeBrEaKOther studies have shown that winters in the Northeast are warming faster than other seasons, but this work used a more rigorous analysis and also suggested a possible way in which changes in snow cover may amplify warming effects.LiNeBrEaKWhen the Northeast looks as it does on holiday greeting cards, covered in a pristine shell of fresh powder, it changes the way the earth absorbs heat from the sun, because white snow reflects heat away from the earth. But when there isn't snow cover, the ground absorbs the heat, which may contribute to the earth's warming.LiNeBrEaKThe authors found that climate stations in northern Maine reported less warming - and hypothesized that it might be because those northerly areas are more likely to be covered in snow.LiNeBrEaKIf so, that would explain "the enhanced warming we're seeing" with less snow on the ground in other areas, said study coauthor Cameron Wake, a UNH climatologist.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the region is experiencing something of a weather whipsaw. Yesterday was the warmest Dec. 10 ever recorded in Portland, Maine. But with that news came a warning from the Maine Emergency Management Agency about a wintry mix of weather beginning tonight.LiNeBrEaK"This whipsaw of weather from really warm days to cold days back to warm days may in fact be an indication of the weather we're going to experience in the future, in a world warmed by greenhouse gases," Wake said.LiNeBrEaKRichard Primack, a Boston University biologist, has watched winter's icy grip loosen as he's watched the ice on skating ponds grow thinner and through his academic work. Using the observations of transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau from more than a century and a half ago, Primack has found the changes in Walden Pond's thaws. Today the pond typically thaws in March, or even late February, Primack said. Thoreau didn't see it thaw until late March or April.LiNeBrEaKWhile snow is an emblem of winter in many people's minds, it is not the best way to understand warming; the issue is really about average temperature.LiNeBrEaK"We still haven't gotten to that magical point where the freezing line is breached, and it's going to be difficult to get it to snow," said David Robinson, a professor of geography at Rutgers University. "Last winter is a wonderful example. ... New England got clobbered last year, although it was not a cold winter."LiNeBrEaKThe changing weather has variable effects for traditional winter activities.LiNeBrEaKJim Batey, director for Somerset Economic Development Corporation in Maine, said that while snowmobiling and other snow-related activities are central to the businesses in his region, many are diversifying, with recreational all-terrain vehicle use growing as fast as snowmobiling did several decades ago.LiNeBrEaK"We had an abnormal winter three years ago, and it certainly brought home the point that if we don't have snow, that it's going to negatively impact a lot of businesses in this region," Batey said.LiNeBrEaKChuck Henderson of North Conway, N.H., can look back over 38 years of selling outdoor apparel and see that "gradually the trend is toward shorter winters, warmer temperatures."LiNeBrEaKWarming "is definitely something people do keep on their radar; it's something we certainly have in the forefront of our thoughts," said Jen Butson, spokeswoman for the Vermont Ski Areas Association. "A lot of the ski areas are taking measures in green initiatives and trying to do their part to be green conscious."

A26  	810 words  	Political NotebookLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama intends to nominate Steven Chu for energy secretary, Lisa Jackson for Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Carol Browner as his energy "czar," Democratic officials said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKChu, a Nobel Prize winning physicist, is a professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at the University of California-Berkeley and has been the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2004, where he has pushed aggressively for research into alternative energy as a way to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who will become the first African-American to lead the EPA, is now chief of staff to Governor Jon Corzine of New Jersey and is the state's former commissioner of environmental protection. And Browner, EPA chief for eight years under President Bill Clinton, will take a new job coordinating policy on energy, the environment, and climate change. LiNeBrEaKObama has also selected Nancy Sutley, the deputy mayor for energy and environment in Los Angeles, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, transition officials said yesterday. Sutley, an EPA official during the Clinton administration, is the first prominent member of the gay and lesbian community to earn a senior role in the new administration.LiNeBrEaKASSOCIATED PRESSLiNeBrEaKObama's inaugural themeLiNeBrEaKkeys on `renewing promise'LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama's inaugural committee yesterday announced its theme, "Renewing America's Promise," and that he and Vice President-elect Joe Biden will attend service and prayer events.LiNeBrEaK"At this moment of great challenge and great change, renewing the promise of America begins with renewing the idea that in America, we rise or fall as one nation and one people," Obama said in a statement. "That sense of unity and shared purpose is what this inauguration will reflect."LiNeBrEaKOn Jan. 19, the day before the swearing-in, Obama, Biden, and their families will take part in community service events in conjunction with Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. On Jan. 21, they are to participate in a prayer service.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, a congressional committee involved in planning the inaugural ceremonies announced that it has invited the Tuskegee Airmen, who made history during World War II as the country's first black military pilots only to return home to discrimination and exclusion from victory parades.LiNeBrEaK"I want to come hopping, skipping, and jumping!" said Spann Watson, 92, an airman from Westbury, N.Y., who flew above Pennsylvania Avenue for President Truman's inauguration. "We had a part in changing these United States."LiNeBrEaKSenator Dianne Feinstein of California sent a letter Tuesday to Tuskegee Airmen Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based group that represents 330 of the original pilots.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Big greenhouse gas producers must join in 'global solution,' Kerry says at climate talks  	By Laurie Goering, Chicago Tribune  	INTERNATIONAL NEWS  	743 words  	POZNAN, Poland _ President-elect Barack Obama's administration is prepared to embrace mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but will push through Congress a new international climate treaty only if China and other big emitters join in a "global solution," Sen. John Kerry warned at the latest round of climate talks Thursday in Poland.LiNeBrEaKKerry, widely viewed as Obama's unofficial representative at the U.N. meeting, praised China _ which recently surpassed the United States as the world's biggest greenhouse gas producer _ for taking a variety of climate-friendly actions, including establishing auto emissions standards tougher than those in the United States and setting ambitious goals to improve energy efficiency. LiNeBrEaKBut unless China and other developing world powerhouses agree to quickly follow the U.S. toward large-scale emissions cuts, "there's no way for us to get from here to there" in terms of holding climate change to less than catastrophic levels, he said at a news conference.LiNeBrEaKInternational climate negotiators trying to craft a new global treaty to both stem and prepare for the consequences of climate change face extraordinary new challenges and opportunities as they draw closer to a December 2009 deadline for replacing the expiring Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKSince last year's negotiations in Bali, much of the world has plunged into a global financial crisis that is threatening to rapidly turn into a deep global recession. That has distracted political attention from climate concerns and led some nations that once promised deep emissions cuts _ Germany, Canada and Japan among them _ to try to soften their pledges.LiNeBrEaKThe economic downturn has also sent oil prices plunging, weakening what once were powerful incentives to pursue cheaper _ and cleaner _ alternatives. And Europe, once the leader in pushing global emissions cuts, now finds itself embroiled in bitter wrangling over how the economic burden of reductions should be shared between richer and poorer members.LiNeBrEaKBut Obama's election, and his promises to make combating climate change a priority and to use a forthcoming economic stimulus package to build a greener and more energy-independent U.S. economy, have re-energized negotiators long used to seeing the United States as an obstacle.LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that Obama doesn't take office until January, an inconvenient reality that is hampering progress in Poznan as international negotiators wait to see what a new Obama administration will put on the table before making firm commitments of their own.LiNeBrEaK"I'm heartened to see the United State re-engage actively in global climate reductions," said Ban Ki-moon, secretary general of the United Nations. But pushing any new climate treaty that is agreed through the U.S. Congress and other world legislatures could take at least a year or two, he warned.LiNeBrEaKIf a new agreement is to be in place in time to replace the Kyoto Protocol, that leaves "just one year to negotiate one of the most complex multilateral treaties ever," he said.LiNeBrEaKNegotiators have made progress this week on a variety of key technical issues, including figuring out how to administer and pay for a climate adaptation fund, which would channel resources from richer countries and from big polluters to poorer nations most adversely affected by climate change.LiNeBrEaKMajor developing nations, including China, South Africa and Brazil, also have stepped up with national plans or programs to cut emissions, an encouraging sign, particularly for richer countries that have often insisted they cannot make effective cuts alone.LiNeBrEaKBut analysts warned that the U.S. and other developed nations should not try to demand too much of developing countries. China's overall emissions now surpass those of the United States, but per capita they are only a fifth the size of those in the United States, said Antonio Hill, a climate change policy adviser with Oxfam, a charity focused on alleviating global poverty and hunger.LiNeBrEaK"If everyone in the world today emitted as much as someone in China does, we wouldn't have this problem" of climate change, he said.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	New regulations may weaken endangered species protections  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	722 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Bush administration issued a pair of late-term regulations on Thursday that environmentalists say weaken federal protection for endangered species but Interior Department officials defended as blocking a "back-door" attempt to regulate global warming emissions.LiNeBrEaKConservation groups sued to block the new rules, re-igniting a fight over so-called "midnight regulation" that had appeared to die down only a day earlier when the administration declined to impose looser air pollution rules that environmentalists had feared. LiNeBrEaKPreviously, government rules required federal agencies to consult with scientists who specialized in particular species before proceeding with a project such as a road or dam. The project could not go forward unless the specialist certified that no harm would come to endangered plants or wildlife. The new rules announced Thursday would allow federal agencies to bypass those scientists in some cases and move ahead on projects if the agencies themselves determined that the endangered species would not be harmed.LiNeBrEaKThe revision was finalized after four months of deliberation and over the objections of what officials said were the bulk of nearly 235,000 public comments on the proposed change.LiNeBrEaKThe updated rules also bar agencies from stopping a project because its emissions might contribute to global warming. Opponents call the change particularly objectionable for the polar bear, which has seen its habitat shrink as Arctic ice caps melt. The government declared polar bears a threatened species earlier this year.LiNeBrEaKInterior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne called the rule changes "narrow" and a "common-sense" approach to species protection. He stressed that agencies could still consult with species scientists if they chose, and he reiterated his belief that climate change regulation is a "wholly inappropriate use of the Endangered Species Act."LiNeBrEaKKempthorne acknowledged internal debate over the changes, but he and other administration officials defended the process that produced them and said they tweaked the proposed rule in response to public comments.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups panned them anyway.LiNeBrEaKJanette Brimmer, an attorney with Earthjustice, said the administration was "using global warming as a stalking horse to undo species protections on a broad scale." Kassie Siegel, climate program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the rules "seem designed to drive the polar bear extinct."LiNeBrEaKAndrew Wetzler, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's endangered species program, was blunt: "We will see them in court."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists have tussled with the administration in its waning days over oil and gas drilling leases near national parks and oil shale development across the western U.S. They cheered on Wednesday, however, when the Environmental Protection Agency said it would not revise a pair of air pollution standards, including one concerning air quality near national parks.LiNeBrEaKWhite House officials say they've worked hard to minimize the kind of end-of-term rule- making that President Bill Clinton engaged in heavily. Many of the late rules could be difficult for President-elect Barack Obama to overturn without engaging in a lengthy process, though a little-used law could allow Congress to void them.LiNeBrEaKThe House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming held a hearing on Thursday into Bush's late energy and environmental rule-making. In a statement, committee chairman Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said the rules issued Thursday showed the administration was "determined to use every last minute in office to wreak as much havoc as possible on our nation."LiNeBrEaKKempthorne, for his part, sounded keenly aware of timing issues in a conference call with reporters, when he noted he had 39 days left in office. Asked if that gave him pause for issuing the new rules, he replied: "Do you think Eli Manning should have left the field 5 minutes before the end of the last Super Bowl?"

Chico Enterprise-Record (California)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Truck drivers oppose environmental regulations  	Laura Urseny, Chico Enterprise-Record, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	532 words  	Dec. 11--CHICO -- Local truckers and trucking companies gathered Wednesday to protest a pending air-quality decision by the state that they say could force some truckers out of business. LiNeBrEaKNorthgate Petroleum president and owner Bud Caldwell of Chico said the California Air Resources Board proposal to force heavy-duty diesel truck owners to replace or retrofit their vehicles to higher emission standards could cost jobs and put companies out of business.LiNeBrEaKTruckers can't afford such an expensive mandate with the economy struggling, he said.LiNeBrEaK"Right now, with the way the economy is, it's hard to imagine what some of them will do," Caldwell said, pointing out that while the state has mentioned financial assistance with retrofits, California's own budget problems seem to preclude that.LiNeBrEaKTruckers also pointed out the regulations will cost Californians more for products transported by truck.LiNeBrEaKCaldwell said the state's proposal is unrealistic and the state should be more aware about the financial harm the regulations could cause.LiNeBrEaK"I'm all for cleaner air, and there's an alternative that seems reasonable in attaining the same thing."LiNeBrEaKAs part of California's landmark AB32 to combat global warming and improve public health, the California ARB is proposing to strengthen vehicle emission standards, including requiring heavy duty diesel trucks to retrofit or replace their vehicles starting in 2010 and ending by 2014. Retrofitting a truck would require special filters to cleanLiNeBrEaKvehicle emissions.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, truckers would have to replace their engines between 2012 and 2022, or buy a new truck.LiNeBrEaKWhile Northgate has purchased a new truck in its nine-vehicle fleet that serves Pacific Pride and Shell gas stations, it was an expensive transaction.LiNeBrEaK"And you might as well drive the old truck off a cliff. You won't be able to sell it."LiNeBrEaKAccording to the ARB, there are about 400,000 trucks registered in the state, and about 500,000 from other states that do business in California. The latter would also be subject to the new regulations.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the ARB, the change can also save lives, considering the quality of air that truck drivers and other affiliated workers breath.LiNeBrEaKCaldwell and others support a counter proposal by an organization calling itself Driving Toward a Cleaner California. DTCC wants the state to delay its decision on those regulations. It also proposes mileage exemptions for older vehicles, incentives to purchase new technology, and requiring the state to consider the financial impact of the new regulations in establishing the implementation, among others.LiNeBrEaKIf the latter were adopted, it would produce cleaner air, as well as buffer the impact on business, Caldwell said.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Barack Obama picks environmental team: Steven Chu, Lisa Jackson, Carol Browner among appointees  	Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	648 words  	Dec. 11--WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama will tap Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as his energy secretary and former New Jersey environmental protection commissioner Lisa Jackson as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, a senior Democrat said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Carol Browner, a former EPA administrator, will serve as a high-level coordinator on energy issues, reporting to the president. LiNeBrEaKThe three incoming officials will help form the backbone of a team responsible for carrying out what Obama has repeatedly indicated will be an ambitious environmental agenda. They will be joined by Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor whom Obama plans to name as the head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and a still-to-be-named interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKThe three newly designated officials bring experience working on climate change. Chu is the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a government research lab in California that under his tenure has focused on alternative energy research and has pushed efforts to boost energy efficiency in buildings.LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light."LiNeBrEaKJackson worked 16 years at the EPA before joining New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, which she was chosen to run in 2006. She also served on the board of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade effort among Northeast states.LiNeBrEaKObama had picked her after the election to advise him on energy and natural resource issues during the transition.LiNeBrEaKBrowner headed the EPA under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, making her the agency's longest-serving director. She is a principal of the Albright Group and leads Obama's energy and environment transition team. She also sits on the boards of the National Audubon Society and Alliance for Climate Protection, among other environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists praised the choices and said they underscored Obama's commitment to fast action on renewable fuel development and carbon emissions reduction.LiNeBrEaK"These are win-win-wins, and wins for the environment," said Frances Beinecke, president of the National Resources Defense Council. She said the creation of Browner's position "clearly demonstrates that leadership is going to come from the White House" on alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKA leading oil industry group offered no criticism of the appointments.LiNeBrEaK"We look forward to working with all the Obama appointees to come up with a comprehensive, fact-based and realistic energy policy that will benefit the American people," said Karen Matusic, a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute.LiNeBrEaKThe massive economic stimulus package Obama is preparing will likely include major investments in alternative energy development.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect met with former Vice President Al Gore this week to discuss climate change and declared afterward: "The time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way. That is what I intend my administration to do."LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday, Obama will introduce former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) as his nominee for health and human services secretary, a Democratic official confirmed. At a Chicago news conference, Obama will also introduce other members of his health-care team.LiNeBrEaKjtankersley@tribune.com	ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (91%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); NOBEL PRIZES (90%); PHYSICS (90%); AWARDS and PRIZES (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (89%); ENERGY RESEARCH (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (77%); GOVERNMENT RESEARCH FUNDING (74%); PUBLIC POLICY (74%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (71%); BIOFUELS (61%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (73%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (58%); COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (56%)  		Lifestyle  	CHICAGO, IL, USA (92%); LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) NEW JERSEY, USA (93%); ILLINOIS, USA (92%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Chicago Tribune   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARACK OBAMA (95%); BILL CLINTON (53%); AL GORE (50%); LISA P JACKSON (94%); CAROL BROWNER (94%); STEVEN CHU (94%)  	20081211-TB-Barack-Obama-picks-environmental-team-1211  	TB  												
Daily News (New York) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	COOPER AT WORK IN RISKY ENVIRONMENT  	By CRISTINA KINON DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER  	TELEVISION; Pg. 85  	404 words  	THE ELECTION was exciting, but CNN's Anderson Cooper likes to exercise his reporting muscles in other areas, too.LiNeBrEaK"Planet in Peril," premiering on CNN tonight at 9, is a two-hour documentary in which Cooper, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta and National Geographic Channel host Lisa Ling examine effects of the Earth's rapidly growing population. Among other subjects, the trio investigates the spread of disease, oil and poverty in Nigeria, shark fishing and shark dive tours, African elephants and mountain gorillas. It is the second "Planet in Peril" special. LiNeBrEaK"I love the political coverage this year, I found it incredibly exciting, but it's always nice to change things up," Cooper told the Daily News. "You don't get the opportunity to go into the mountains in the Congo, then off to Rwanda every day, so it's something that I really jumped at."LiNeBrEaKCooper considers traveling to the front lines of these conflicts an essential part of the job. Often, he says, news outlets report about the climate crisis or overpopulation but don't send correspondents to see the actual life-and-death situations.LiNeBrEaKCooper also believes he's there to simply report the facts.LiNeBrEaK"I don't feel that it's appropriate for me to tell people what to think about something or what to do about it," he said.LiNeBrEaK"What we try to do is show what is actually happening and what is true and what is not, and let the viewers make up their own mind about what the best next step is."LiNeBrEaKDespite putting himself in dangerous situations, Cooper says that he rarely second-guesses his reporting choices, even when coming face to face with a childhood fear.LiNeBrEaK"Diving without a cage with great white sharks was extraordinary," said Cooper. "Sharks have always scared me, ever since seeing 'Jaws' as a little kid, so to actually go and see them up close and look into their eyes - it was a remarkable thing to see them in their natural habitat."LiNeBrEaKRecently, NBC's "Today" show started airing an environmental segment entitled "Ends of the Earth," which, much like "Planet in Peril," is aimed at bringing environmental issues to light. Cooper says he doesn't mind the competition because it's all for the good of the Earth in the end.LiNeBrEaK"I'm all for as many people as possible doing this kind of reporting," Cooper says. "There's so much happening around the world in terms of global environmental issues that we'll definitely be doing it next year."LiNeBrEaKckinon@nydailynews.com	TELEVISION INDUSTRY (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (87%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); MOUNTAINS (77%); DISEASES and DISORDERS (77%); DOCUMENTARY FILMS (72%); PRIMATES (70%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (50%) TV NEWS; ANDERSON COOPER; ENVIRONMENT  					EARTH (94%) NIGERIA (79%); RWANDA (79%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  	In "Planet in Peril," Anderson Cooper visits mountains in Congo and gorillas in his midst.

Grand Rapid Press (Michigan) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   ALL S EDITION	Former EPA chief picked for energy czar;  Nominees also include Nobel Prize-winning physicist 		NATION / WORLD; Pg. A3  	269 words  	WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama intends to round out his environmental and natural resources team with a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and three former Environmental Protection Agency officials from the Clinton administration. LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect has selected Steven Chu for energy secretary, Lisa Jackson for EPA administrator, Carol Browner as his energy "czar" and Nancy Sutley to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Democratic officials with knowledge of the decisions said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKObama plans to name the four to the posts in the coming weeks, barring unforeseen developments.LiNeBrEaKStill unclear is whom Obama will tap for interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKOfficials close to the transition said support for John Berry, the director of the National Zoo and a former assistant secretary at the Interior Department, was growing. But these officials also said Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva and California Rep. Mike Thompson were still in the running.LiNeBrEaKAmong the posts announced Wednesday, Browner's stands out because it's a new White House position.LiNeBrEaKBrowner, who served as EPA chief for eight years under Clinton, is expected to coordinate the various agencies that play a role in energy and environmental policy, especially on issues such as climate change that don't fit nicely in the silos of the federal government.LiNeBrEaKChu was one of three scientists who shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997 for work in cooling and trapping atoms with laser light.LiNeBrEaKOn Wednesday, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who has been mentioned as a possible labor secretary, was in Washington meeting with Obama's transition team.

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Obama naming his green team: Choices signal higher profile on energy policy in White House  	David Ivanovich, Houston Chronicle  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	685 words  	Dec. 11--WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama is expected to nominate Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu to become the nation's next energy secretary.LiNeBrEaKObama also is poised to select former New Jersey environmental regulator Lisa Jackson to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Carol Browner, who served as EPA administrator throughout Bill Clinton's administration, would serve in the White House as an overall energy "czar."LiNeBrEaKThe incoming administration has yet to signal who will take over as Interior secretary, another crucial appointment. LiNeBrEaKThe selection of a scientist, rather than a Washington insider, to head the Energy Department suggests that in the Obama administration energy policy will be directed out of the White House, rather than from the Energy Department's Forrestal Building headquarters.LiNeBrEaKFrank Maisano, a Washington-based energy specialist with Bracewell and Giuliani, said Obama has selected "capable, bright people" who will be "solid managers" at the EPA and the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaK"But it also underscores the high profile the White House will play in energy policy within its own walls," Maisano said.LiNeBrEaKThe 52-year-old Browner, who during her tenure as EPA head was a vocal advocate for protecting the environment and public health, is likely to bring a much different approach to energy than the pro-drilling policies of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"Her background is dominated by her interest in environmental policy issues," said Lee Fuller, vice president of government relations for the Independent Petroleum Association of America. "So there's a major shift in energy policy toward this compatibility with environmental policy."LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club's David Willett, while not commenting directly on her expected nomination, praised Browner's "profound understanding of the energy problems," who will seek solutions that are "good not just for our health and safety but for our economic stability."LiNeBrEaKChange on climateLiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, is expected to help implement Obama's call to help kickstart the nation's faltering economy by spurring development of "green" technologies.LiNeBrEaKThe Berkeley Lab's Web site describes Chu, 60, as an early advocate for finding scientific solutions to combat climate change. Chu's goal there was to make the Berkeley Lab a world leader in alternative and renewable energy research, particularly with the development of carbon-neutral energy sources.LiNeBrEaKJeff Miller, a spokesman for the Berkeley Lab, declined to comment on the prospect Chu might soon be the nation's 12th Energy secretary.LiNeBrEaKWith a budget of more than $23 billion and more than 100,000 employees and contractors, the Energy Department is an unwieldy hodgepodge, with responsibilities ranging from clean-up of the nation's nuclear weapons sites to forecasting gasoline prices.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, the credentials of the department's 11 secretaries have varied widely, from a former Navy admiral (James Watkins, appointed by former President George H.W.

The Houston Chronicle 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Obama naming green team;  Choices signal higher profile on energy policy in White House 	DAVID IVANOVICH, Washington Bureau, Staff  	A; Pg. 1  	936 words  	WASHINGTON - President-elect Barack Obama is expected to nominate Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu to become the nation's next energy secretary.LiNeBrEaKObama also is poised to select former New Jersey environmental regulator Lisa Jackson to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Carol Browner, who served as EPA administrator throughout Bill Clinton's administration, would serve in the White House as an overall energy "czar."LiNeBrEaKThe incoming administration has yet to signal who will take over as Interior secretary, another crucial appointment. LiNeBrEaKThe selection of a scientist, rather than a Washington insider, to head the Energy Department suggests that in the Obama administration energy policy will be directed out of the White House, rather than from the Energy Department's Forrestal Building headquarters.LiNeBrEaKFrank Maisano, a Washington-based energy specialist with Bracewell and Giuliani, said Obama has selected "capable, bright people" who will be "solid managers" at the EPA and the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaK"But it also underscores the high profile the White House will play in energy policy within its own walls," Maisano said.LiNeBrEaKThe 52-year-old Browner, who during her tenure as EPA head was a vocal advocate for protecting the environment and public health, is likely to bring a much different approach to energy than the pro-drilling policies of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaK"Her background is dominated by her interest in environmental policy issues," said Lee Fuller, vice president of government relations for the Independent Petroleum Association of America. "So there's a major shift in energy policy toward this compatibility with environmental policy."LiNeBrEaKThe Sierra Club's David Willett, while not commenting directly on her expected nomination, praised Browner's "profound understanding of the energy problems," who will seek solutions that are "good not just for our health and safety but for our economic stability."LiNeBrEaKChange on climateLiNeBrEaKChu, director of the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, is expected to help implement Obama's call to help kickstart the nation's faltering economy by spurring development of "green" technologies.LiNeBrEaKThe Berkeley Lab's Web site describes Chu, 60, as an early advocate for finding scientific solutions to combat climate change. Chu's goal there was to make the Berkeley Lab a world leader in alternative and renewable energy research, particularly with the development of carbon-neutral energy sources.LiNeBrEaKJeff Miller, a spokesman for the Berkeley Lab, declined to comment on the prospect Chu might soon be the nation's 12th Energy secretary.LiNeBrEaKWith a budget of more than $23 billion and more than 100,000 employees and contractors, the Energy Department is an unwieldy hodgepodge, with responsibilities ranging from clean-up of the nation's nuclear weapons sites to forecasting gasoline prices.LiNeBrEaKAs a result, the credentials of the department's 11 secretaries have varied widely, from a former Navy admiral (James Watkins, appointed by former President George H.W. Bush) to a one-time ambassador to the United Nations (New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, named by Clinton).LiNeBrEaKCurrent Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman is a chemical engineer and also served as deputy treasury secretary.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who like Bodman studied chemical engineering, is the former head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKBefore taking that post, she served for 16 years at the EPA, where she worked in the federal Superfund site remediation program and helped develop regulations for hazardous waste cleanup.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	New rule undermines endangered species protections, environmentalists say  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	905 words  	WASHINGTON _ In a move environmental groups says strikes at the heart of the Endangered Species Act, the Bush administration on Thursday announced a new rule that would let federal agencies decide on their own whether their projects harm endangered species, instead of requiring them in many cases to get a second opinion from federal wildlife experts.LiNeBrEaKOpponents said the move destroys the checks and balances that have helped the government save hundreds of species from extinction under the 1973 law. LiNeBrEaKConservation groups argued the changes were illegal and threatened to file lawsuits to get them thrown out. They also said they hoped President-elect Barack Obama would take steps after he takes office to limit the effects of the rules and start a new process to rewrite them.LiNeBrEaKInterior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said the reason for the rule change was linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne listed the polar bear as a threatened species in May but said that the Endangered Species Act could not be used to try to halt global warming. The new regulation specifies that there is no need for consultations when the harm to endangered or threatened species is a result from a global process that's too broad to measure.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne said it's impossible to pinpoint the death of any single animal from emissions from any single polluter. In fact, emissions of heat-trapping gases disperse evenly in the atmosphere around the globe and remain there for centuries. The resulting warming and melting of polar ice have put the polar bear at risk of extinction by mid-century, scientists have said.LiNeBrEaK"We made it very clear that the Endangered Species Act was never intended to be a backdoor for climate change policy," he said. "We felt it important that we make modifications to the rules so that the door isn't allowed to be opened and it's not beneficial."LiNeBrEaKThe rule changes also go further and specify that federal agencies are not required to consult with the biologists of the two agencies that enforce the act _ the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Services _ if they think a project such as a timber sale or construction of a power plant won't harm or kill a threatened or endangered species. The changes do not rule out voluntary consultations.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department on Thursday also finalized a rule implementing another section of the Endangered Species Act to clarify that it will not protect polar bears from oil and gas development or greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Endangered Species Act makes it illegal to kill or harm an animal listed by the government as threatened or endangered. The federal government issues permits for construction and other activities but must ensure that these animals or plants and their habitat would not be jeopardized.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department proposed the rules changes in August and offered a 30-day comment period, which it extended by another 30 days. It received nearly 235,000 comments, and about 200,000 of those were against the change, said Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Lyle Laverty. About 150,000 of those comments were form letters.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne said some people within the Interior Department also disagreed with his proposal.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department sent the new regulations to the Federal Register on Thursday, the last step in making them final. They will take effect before President George W. Bush leaves office.LiNeBrEaKLaverty said agencies could still voluntarily seek the experts' advice when they weren't sure if endangered species would be harmed. But, he added, "most agencies have the skills that can help make that determination."LiNeBrEaKHe also said the rule change would free up the wildlife and fisheries agencies' experts to focus on priority problems.LiNeBrEaKJamie Rappaport Clark, who headed the Fish and Wildlife Service under the Clinton administration, said the changes put more species in jeopardy.LiNeBrEaK"It's clearly allowing the fox to guard the chicken coop," she said.LiNeBrEaKAlthough other agencies employ biologists, their main mission isn't conservation, said Clark, who now heads the conservation group Defenders of Wildlife. What's more, it's not always readily apparent that an action will have a harmful effect, and agencies could make unintentional mistakes, she said.LiNeBrEaK"Wildlife and marine biologists form the pillars of scientific integrity that support the Endangered Species Act," John Kostyack of the National Wildlife Federation said in a statement. "Knocking them out of the decision-making process will erode the foundation of this bedrock law and make it significantly harder to protect endangered species."LiNeBrEaKAndrew Wetzler of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the changes were illegal.LiNeBrEaK"I think we will see them in court," he said.LiNeBrEaKDale Hall, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said there would be fewer consultations under the new rules.LiNeBrEaKHall said he told Kempthorne earlier that he worried there would not be enough time for Interior staff to look carefully at the comments and evaluate them. In the end, however, he said he was satisfied and had no problem with the final regulations themselves.

Las Vegas Review-Journal (Nevada) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Study tracks river's course  	Henry Brean  	B; Pg. 2B  	482 words  	LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNALLiNeBrEaKYou don't need a crystal ball to predict the potential impacts of climate change on the Colorado River. According to UNLV researchers, what could happen to the river is happening already. LiNeBrEaKA new study of old data reveals that increasing temperatures in the Colorado River Basin over the past 55 years have changed the timing and magnitude of the basin's streamflow.LiNeBrEaKOver that period, warmer weather resulted in more frequent rainfall and less frequent snowfall, leading to a decrease in snowpack and snowmelt in the region.LiNeBrEaK"When rain occurs in place of snow, streamflow peaks earlier in the year and can make it challenging for water managers to assess resource availability," said Tom Piechota, UNLV director of sustainability and multidisciplinary research. "Warming by itself can change water supply. It's something to be concerned about."LiNeBrEaKThe Colorado River is primarily fed by runoff from melting snow in the high mountains in the upper part of the basin.LiNeBrEaKThe Las Vegas Valley gets 90 percent of its drinking water from the river, which also supplies tens of millions of people in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.LiNeBrEaKThe UNLV study is further evidence that climate change has been affecting the river for some time.LiNeBrEaKPiechota authored it with W. Paul Miller, a UNLV graduate student who works with the federal Bureau of Reclamation in Boulder City.LiNeBrEaKUsing historical temperature, precipitation and runoff data from 1951-2005, the researchers identified a consistent increase in temperatures over the Colorado River Basin. They also noted increased river flows in the late fall and winter months and decreased river flows in the spring and summer months.LiNeBrEaKTheir findings were published in the October issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Hydrometeorology.LiNeBrEaKFuture research will seek to link the rising temperatures to an increase in rainfall and earlier snowmelt, leading to a drop in streamflow during what is now the peak runoff season of April through July.LiNeBrEaKThe UNLV study was funded by the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.LiNeBrEaKIts findings come on the heels of dire predictions for the future of the Colorado.LiNeBrEaKA study released in February by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego warned there is a 50 percent chance that Lake Mead, the river's largest reservoir, could run dry by 2021.LiNeBrEaKThat prediction has since been challenged by other studies and regional climate models, but most scientists forecast less water for the river in the future.LiNeBrEaKOf course, Mother Nature will have the final say.LiNeBrEaKPiechota was in Boulder, Colo., for a meeting on Monday, and he got out just ahead of the snow. So far, he said, it looks as if the snowpack season is "off to a pretty good start."LiNeBrEaKContact reporter Henry Brean at hbrean @reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0350.

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: 'Scoping' plan too optimistic: Air Resources Board votes today to implement state's new global warming law.  	Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	629 words  	Dec. 11--Ever since he signed California's 2006 law to reduce emissions linked to global warming, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has made the transition sound startlingly easy.LiNeBrEaKA 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020? No problem. Bring on the hydrogen-powered Hummers, the geothermal-powered Jacuzzis and the solar-powered plasma televisions.LiNeBrEaKThere is no need for sacrifice or higher energy prices in Schwarzenegger's vision of a low-carbon future. LiNeBrEaK"It's all about technology, because we all know that the guilt trip that we have put on people has not worked, to tell them that they should not use the Jacuzzi, or the big, large plasma TV," the governor said in a speech last month.LiNeBrEaKSadly, this overly optimistic view of the world has crept into the "scoping plan" that the California Air Resources Board is expected to vote on today to implement the state's global warming law.LiNeBrEaKThe plan, a mixture of regulations and market mechanisms aimed at reducing emissions to 1990 levels in a mere 12 years, underestimates the possible costs involved in transforming the state's modes of transportation, its energy sources and its industries, according to several economists who peer-reviewed the document.LiNeBrEaK"The economic analysis is terribly deficient in critical ways," wrote Robert Stavins, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.LiNeBrEaK"The net dollar cost of each of these regulations is likely to be much larger than what is reported," wrote Matthew E. Kahn, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKWe remain convinced that California must aggressively implement programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The law requires it (and requires the air board to have a scoping plan approved by 2009).LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the threat of climate change is arguably the worst long-term threat to the state's economy. If other governments see California weakening its climate crusade, it likely will undermine the growing international effort to bring emissions under control.LiNeBrEaKThat said, the California air board must be candid about the real costs of the transition it is contemplating. Energy prices will rise, and major capital investment will be needed in public transit, energy-efficient buildings and new transmission lines.LiNeBrEaKIndustries that are energy-intensive will move elsewhere. Industries that are building the green grid of the future will flock here, as they are already doing.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, the current scoping plan doesn't adequately acknowledge these realities or establish a clear funding mechanism to mitigate the possible costs. Any final plan must strongly advocate for fees on polluting vehicles and a cap-and-trade system in which allowances are auctioned, with revenues plowed back to industries and communities to ease the transition.LiNeBrEaKMajor reductions in emissions should be expected from more efficient planning of new communities. Neighborhoods burdened by toxic pollution need assurances that those problems won't worsen under a market trading system.LiNeBrEaKThis is huge undertaking for California, and while we sympathize with the tight deadlines the air board has faced, it may need to take a little more time to do the job right.LiNeBrEaKOne thing's for sure: If the air board approves a deficient plan, the courts or the Legislature could derail all progress to date. That would be truly be a climatic disaster.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   01 EDITION	Officials: Obama selects energy, EPA staff  	LIZ SIDOTI, Associated Press Writer  	A; Pg. 08  	495 words  	Officials: Obama selects energy, EPA staffLiNeBrEaKBy LIZ SIDOTILiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON - President-elect Obama intends to round out his environmental and natural resources team with a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and three former Environmental Protection Agency officials from the Clinton administration. LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect has selected Steven Chu for energy secretary, Lisa Jackson for EPA administrator, Carol Browner as his energy "czar" and Nancy Sutley to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, Democratic officials said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKThe Democratic officials who disclosed the selections spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal names that have not been made public. Obama is expected to make the announcements in the coming weeks.LiNeBrEaKObama will hold a news conference on Thursday in Chicago to name former Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle as his secretary of health and human services. That choice has been known for some time.LiNeBrEaKAs for his environment and natural resources team:LiNeBrEaK*Chu was one of three scientists who shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1997 for work in cooling and trapping atoms with laser light. He's a professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and has been the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2004, where he has pushed for research into alternative energy as a way to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaK*Jackson, who will be the first black person to lead the EPA, is a former New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection commissioner who worked at the federal agency for 16 years, including under Browner when she was Clinton's EPA chief.

The proposed plan has great potential for creating green jobs and improving energy efficiency. LiNeBrEaK  They also seem to understand that we must move swiftly to reduce carbon emissions. But all clean energy and carbon-reduction initiatives must ensure minimal impact to our nation's increasingly strained freshwater resources. LiNeBrEaK  The process for carbon capture and storage technology is both water intensive and energy intensive. The Department of Energy has said that power plants' consumption of water would nearly double by 2030 if coal-burning power generators had to install this carbon capture technology to combat global warming. LiNeBrEaK  Using less carbon-intensive solutions like solar, wind, geothermal, and small, run-of-the-river and kinetic hydropower is the logical strategy for maximum efficiency in a new low-carbon economy.LiNeBrEaK   Kyle Rabin LiNeBrEaK  DirectorLiNeBrEaK  Network for New Energy ChoicesLiNeBrEaK  New York, Dec. 5, 2008	ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); 2008 ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN (90%); LETTERS and COMMENTS (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); JOB CREATION (78%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (78%); POWER PLANTS (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); HYDROELECTRIC POWER (78%); EMISSIONS (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); WIND POWER PLANTS (75%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (74%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (73%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (73%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (70%); GLOBAL WARMING (70%); WATER QUALITY (54%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (90%)  						December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  		Letter  	Newspaper  	2008 The New York Times Company   		MICHAEL MCMAHON (91%); BARACK OBAMA (91%)  				http://www.nytimes.com  										
The New York Times 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Science Students Get a Real-Life Lesson, in Science Fiction  	By FELICITY BARRINGER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; PASADENA JOURNAL; Pg. 29  	703 words  	Of all the movie promotions in all the towns in all the world, Keanu Reeves had to walk into this one: a California Institute of Technology forum at which he was asked, ''How could an alien being grow so fast without violating standard mass- and energy-conservation laws?''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Reeves, who plays Klaatu, the alien holding mankind to account in an eco-themed remake of the science-fiction classic ''The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' stared silently at the students packed into the campus auditorium. Then he said, ''Who says I'm going to abide by your laws?'' LiNeBrEaK  He paused. ''I ate my Wheaties,'' he added.LiNeBrEaK  Appreciative laughter swept through the audience of budding scientists. They came because they were interested in seeing if the movie got the science right (mostly yes, the experts agreed), and if professed worry about climate change is influencing scripts (sort of), and if it is true that movie scientists have a higher risk of mortality than those in other celluloid professions (yes, one study says). LiNeBrEaK  The gathering, like a similar meeting this year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was generated by Warren Betts, a longtime Hollywood publicist who also represents scientific and academic organizations,  to prove that two alien cultures can reach out and touch each other.  When a student's question -- ''Do you really think that the laws of physics are translationally invariant?'' -- went not to Mr. Reeves but to a science panelist -- Sean Carroll, the Caltech astrophysicist -- relief flashed for a nanosecond on the face of the actor the audience had come to know through three ''Matrix'' movies. LiNeBrEaK  (Professor Carroll said that the question is the kind of thing physicists love to debate.)LiNeBrEaK  ''The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' which opens Friday, did have an astrobiologist, Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., as an adviser, but one must wait almost until the end of the credits  before his name scrolls by. LiNeBrEaK  Still, Dr. Shostak gives Scott Derrickson, the director, credit for trying to get it right. ''In the old days nobody did care about that,'' Dr. Shostak said in a telephone interview. ''One percent of the audience would notice that something was scientifically bonkers, but they'd already bought their ticket.'' LiNeBrEaK  ''But now there's the Web and there's blogs,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  Or, as Stewart Brand, the author and environmental theorist  said, ''verisimilitude is not bad for box office.'' LiNeBrEaK  The movie script assumes a little about audience knowledge. But not too much. Take the dialogue between Klaatu and the United States secretary of defense, setting out the reason for the alien intrusion.LiNeBrEaK  Defense Secretary: Yes, this is our planet.LiNeBrEaK  Klaatu: No, it is not.LiNeBrEaK  (In case the reference was missed, Klaatu gets  more specific, saying: This planet is dying. The human race is killing it.)LiNeBrEaK  That is about as far as the movie goes in discussing ecological sin, though the subject of redemption comes up. LiNeBrEaK  Environmental issues are also embedded in the animated picture ''Wall-E,'' which is set on a garbage-strewn planet in a machine-dominated universe. But special effects and cliffhanging twists trump, just as they do in the James Bond film ''Quantum of Solace,'' whose villain is not only a murdering megalomaniac, but also a greenwasher. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Derrickson said in an interview: ''I definitely am of the belief that you have to respect why people go to movies. Nobody goes to be given moral lessons or told how to think or how to vote or how to act.'' LiNeBrEaK  The students' ability to parse the relativity equations in the movie did not keep them from behaving like normal fans. ''I love you, Keanu,'' yelled Ekta Bhojwani, 21, a senior chemical engineering major from Dubai, as the actor arrived. But  her classmate  Anna Hiszpanski, 22,  said afterward: ''I'm disappointed they didn't pay more attention to global warming. Because Hollywood has the opportunity to inspire a new generation of scientists.'' LiNeBrEaK  As Mr. Reeves left, the students  stumbled on an even more enthusiastic crowd around a celebrity with whom they felt totally at home. ''Is that Bill Nye the Science Guy?'' asked Deepak Mishra, 21, a senior from Michigan. ''Let me have your cellphone camera!''

The New York Times 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	U.S. Transition Hampers Talks on Climate Change  	By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.  	Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 12  	1287 words  	As ministers from 189 countries gather here in the coal mining regions of Poland to hammer out a new climate treaty, progress is being sorely hampered by the transition under way in American politics, delegates and experts here said.LiNeBrEaK  No one expected a team representing President-elect Barack Obama to attend these meetings -- he has said there is but one president at a time, and the United States is still represented here by the Bush administration. But the anticipation of his presidency has left this critical meeting in a bit of limbo. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama has called climate change ''a matter of urgency,'' promising to seek legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply and to increase United States participation in global climate initiatives. But many countries are still waiting to size up Mr. Obama's actual environmental commitment before making bold moves of their own. LiNeBrEaK  ''It has affected the meeting in a fairly significant way,'' said Gus Silva-Chavez, a policy expert at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, who has been observing the closed negotiations. ''A lot of people think: 'This is not the time to put our cards on the table. Let's wait for the new administration. Why agree to anything now?' '' LiNeBrEaK  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the European Union is itself struggling to finalize its own climate package this week -- hampered by the global economic turndown -- and so its delegates have been unusually quiet here. LiNeBrEaK  ''We have a sense of urgency,  but you don't see any strong decisions'' being made here, said Elenita Dano, a member of the Philippines delegation. ''Political developments in the U.S. and the E.U. are holding us hostage, and we have no choice but to wait.''LiNeBrEaK  The current negotiations are meant to culminate in a treaty in Copenhagen in December 2009, to take effect in 2013. It will replace industrialized nations' commitments to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. The United States never ratified that agreement, and its binding terms do not apply to China, India, and other emerging powers that are projected to account for nearly all growth in emissions in the next few decades. LiNeBrEaK  So far Mr. Obama has outlined a number of broad policies but provided few specifics or a timetable for implementing his ideas.  He could propose a climate bill, but the kind of cap-and-trade system preferred by Mr. Obama for greenhouse gases would, by many estimates, take at least a year or two to hash out even with a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress. LiNeBrEaK  ''The fear is this could become a Clinton health plan, trying to do too much too soon, and ending up with nothing,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House staff member who is now with the National Commission on Energy Policy. LiNeBrEaK  On the other hand, short-term measures that would be easier to enact, like energy initiatives in an economic stimulus spending package, could be perceived by Europe and China, particularly, as insufficient evidence of meaningful change. LiNeBrEaK  Even at the highest levels, officials here are awaiting results: ''Another climate treaty without the U.S. doesn't make a lot of sense,'' said Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the meeting's sponsor.LiNeBrEaK  There are ample signs that the United States can do little of substance in these talks because of the presidential transition. In an interview several days ago, James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the Bush administration climate team was committed to keeping all options open for the incoming Obama administration -- in essence saying that the American negotiators in Poznan had little room to make commitments.LiNeBrEaK  ''We have taken ideas very extensively from many people who are currently senior advisers to the Obama team on how to think through creative future approaches,'' he said.LiNeBrEaK  Still, the conference has achieved a few important goals. The delegates have agreed on a method for essentially paying countries and communities for preserving forests, through a system of carbon credits. Twenty percent of man-made carbon-dioxide emissions are attributed to deforestation. The delegates are also nearing agreement on a fund, conceptualized a year ago, to help developing nations adapt to climate change. LiNeBrEaK  Expectations for the talks here were always muted, because Poznan was meant to be a midpoint meeting that would lead to a new climate treaty by next December. LiNeBrEaK  Negotiators may yet be on track to meet that goal. ''If the pace picks up we could get an agreement by Copenhagen,'' said Angela Anderson, director of the International Global Warming Campaign of the Pew Environment Group.LiNeBrEaK  On Thursday, government ministers arrive for two days of meetings to work out a final set of documents, to guide the process through the next year. A Congressional delegation, as always, is observing the talks, with senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, assigned to report back to Mr. Obama. LiNeBrEaK  Against the backdrop of a global recession, there were signs that delegates of industrialized nations wanted to back away from ambitious emission reduction targets that had been discussed last year, based on research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaK  Under the panel's scenarios, industrialized countries would have to reduce emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 to set the world on a track to avert disastrous warming, numbers that went in and out of the draft proposal over the course of Wednesday. Countries like Italy have suggested they might have a hard time meeting previous emissions reductions goals in the current economic climate. LiNeBrEaK  In addition, a group of developing countries called the G-77 complained that their proposals to help poor countries combat climate change generally fell on deaf ears. ''We got no support from developed countries whether in technology transfer or finances,'' said Tasneem Essop, of the World Wide Fund for Nature of South Africa. LiNeBrEaK  Such hopes and frustrations presaged great pressure on the new American administration. Said Jake Schmidt of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who participated in a panel discussion here: ''Clearly one of the major stumbling blocks has been a lack of leadership at the U.S. level, and that's about to change,'' he said. LiNeBrEaK  But the incoming Obama administration is currently weighing its options, including whether there should be a climate czar, or cabinet-level environment position, said a person who is familiar with the transition.LiNeBrEaK  Domestically, the person  said, the administration is looking toward a three-pronged approach. First there is a stimulus package that will include ''green'' initiatives like retrofitting buildings with better insulation. Then there is an energy bill that will include components like new fuel standards and tax breaks for investments in environmental technology and renewable energy. LiNeBrEaK  Finally, there is the cap-and-trade system, in which companies are assigned emissions limits and must effectively buy permits to exceed them. LiNeBrEaK  Dirk Forrister, the chairman of the White House Climate Change Task Force under the Clinton administration, said such a complicated program probably could not become operational before 2014. LiNeBrEaK  Tim Wirth, head of the United Nations Foundation, based in Washington, said that finalizing a new climate program would take time, but that the new administration should immediately start creating the ''building blocks''  -- forging agreements with countries like China to cooperate on energy efficiency. LiNeBrEaK  ''Everybody is waiting for the U.S. cavalry to come over the ridge,'' he said. ''We're a major component but not the only component.''

The New York Times 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   Late Edition - Final	Pipe Dreams And Profits  	By JAMES KANTER and JAD MOUAWAD; Jad Mouawad reported from New York and Paul Geitner from Paris.  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; THE ENERGY CHALLENGE; Pg. 1  	1968 words  	The European Union started with a high-minded ecological goal: encouraging companies to cut their greenhouse gases by making them pay for each ton of carbon dioxide they emitted into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaK  But that plan unleashed a lobbying free-for-all that led politicians to dole out favors to various industries, undermining the environmental goals. Four years later, it is becoming clear that system has so far produced little noticeable benefit to the climate -- but generated a multibillion-dollar windfall for some of the Continent's biggest polluters. LiNeBrEaK  As President-elect Barack Obama considers how to curb the gases that contribute to  global warming, Europe's struggle with the problem illustrates the momentous task ahead for the United States.LiNeBrEaK  European politicians, who acknowledge that their system got off to a rocky start, contend that after an initial experimental phase that lasted from 2005 to 2007, the system has improved. But some outside analysts doubt Europe can achieve its lofty goals.   LiNeBrEaK  The original European plan called for issuing a restricted number of permits to emit carbon dioxide, the main gas that contributes to global warming, then creating a market in which they could be freely traded. If a company produced more gas than its permits allowed, it would be penalized by having to buy more; if it managed to reduce emissions by switching to cleaner fuels or technologies, it would be able to sell its permits to polluting companies. The marketplace would set the price.LiNeBrEaK  In the United States, a similar market approach is credited with reducing acid rain, another environmental problem. The system encourages efficiency and innovation by rewarding companies that can cut the most pollution at the lowest cost.LiNeBrEaK  But global warming is a far larger, more complicated problem than acid rain, and setting up a workable market in Europe has proved to be difficult and contentious. As the incoming Obama administration contemplates creation of an American market, Washington has already seen the beginnings of the same lobbying frenzy that bedeviled Europe.LiNeBrEaK  Beseeched by giant utilities and smokestack industries that feared for their competitiveness, the European Union scrapped the idea of forcing industries to buy their permits, with the money going to public coffers. Instead, governments gave out the vast majority of the permits for nothing, in such quantity that the market nearly collapsed. The basic question of whether to sell permits, give them away or do some of both has yet to be resolved in the United States.LiNeBrEaK  ''Everybody will fight their own corner,'' said  Nicholas Stern, a British economist, who recommended that the United States charge for a substantial number of permits rather than dole them all out as the Europeans have. ''That's why it's so important to have a clear conception from the start, to start off with a clear strategy.''LiNeBrEaK  After the initial crash, Europe tightened its system and issued new permits, and they have acquired substantial value. Nearly $80 billion will change hands in 2008 on the European emissions market, making it by far the world's largest, according to estimates by Andreas Arvanitakis, an analyst at Point Carbon, a research firm.LiNeBrEaK  Much of the cost of the European system is  being paid by the public in the price of goods and services, including higher electricity bills, but whether the money is doing any good is an open question. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by plants and factories participating in the system has not fallen.  Their emissions rose 0. 4 percent in 2006 and another 0. 7 percent in 2007. LiNeBrEaK  Meanwhile, a series of disputes has erupted about the way companies are carrying out the system.LiNeBrEaK  A German ExampleLiNeBrEaK  The case of Germany, Europe's largest economy, illustrates the many problems in Europe's approach. For instance, RWE, a major German power company and Europe's largest carbon emitter, received a windfall of about $6. 4 billion in the first three years of the system, according to analyst estimates. Regulators in that country have accused utilities of charging customers for far more permits than was allowable.LiNeBrEaK  This week, leaders of the European Union are meeting in Brussels to shape the next phase of their system, and find ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. They also seek to close loopholes worth billions to various industries, while confronting the same tug of war between long-term environmental goals and short-term costs that proved so vexing the first time around. LiNeBrEaK  The European summit meeting coincides with a round of negotiations among 190 nations to establish a new global treaty limiting greenhouse emissions, a treaty the Obama administration might seek to join.LiNeBrEaK  Pressure From LobbyistsLiNeBrEaK  During long negotiations on the landmark Kyoto climate treaty more than a decade ago, the Clinton administration pushed to include emissions trading as a means of achieving the goals, favoring that approach over energy taxes or traditional regulatory limits on emissions. LiNeBrEaK  Even after the Americans backed out of ratifying Kyoto, Europe decided to set up the world's first large, mandatory carbon-trading market. ''I was eager to put it in place as soon as possible,'' said Margot Wallstrom, the European Union's environment commissioner then.LiNeBrEaK  From the start, Ms. Wallstrom, now a vice president of the European Commission, said she was lobbied heavily by governments and by companies seeking to limit the financial burden.  LiNeBrEaK  The initial idea of charging for many of the permits never got off the ground. Many politicians feared that burdening European industries with extra costs would undercut their ability to compete in a global marketplace. In the end, the decision was made to hand out virtually all the permits free.LiNeBrEaK  With European Union oversight, individual countries were charged with setting emissions levels and distributing the permits within their borders, often to companies with strong political connections. LiNeBrEaK  Jurgen Trittin, a former Green Party leader who was the German minister of environment from 1998 to 2005, recalled being lobbied by executives from power companies, and by politicians from the former East Germany seeking special treatment for lignite, a highly polluting soft brown coal common around central Europe.LiNeBrEaK  The framework of the European system put governments in the position of behaving like ''a grandfather with a large family deciding what to give his favorite grandchildren for Christmas,'' Mr. Trittin said in an interview.LiNeBrEaK  The debates on what limits to set for carbon dioxide emissions were particularly arduous. Mr. Trittin recalled a five-hour ''showdown'' in March 2004 with Wolfgang Clement, then the economy minister, in which he lost a battle to lower the overall limit. It was eventually set at 499 million tons a year, a reduction of only 2 million tons. LiNeBrEaK  In a recent e-mail message, Mr. Clement did not challenge the details of his former colleague's account, but he characterized as ''just nonsense'' Mr. Trittin's claims of undue industry influence. He said the Greens were unrealistic about what could be achieved.LiNeBrEaK  ''I reproached them -- and I'm doing this still today -- that at the end of their policy there is the de-industrialization of Germany,'' Mr. Clement said. ''That's our conflict.'' LiNeBrEaK  Eberhard Meller, the president of the Federation of German Electricity Companies, which represents companies like RWE, said, ''Good sense triumphed in the end.'' For his part, Mr. Clement eventually joined the supervisory board of RWE Power, in 2006.LiNeBrEaK  The benefits won by German industry were substantial. Under the plan that the European Union originally approved for Germany, electricity companies were supposed to receive 3 percent fewer permits than they needed to cover their total emissions between 2005 and 2007, which would have forced them to cut emissions.  LiNeBrEaK  Instead, the companies got 3 percent more than needed, according to the German Emissions Trading Authority, the regulatory agency, a windfall worth about $374 billion at the peak of the market. German lawmakers also approved exemptions and bonuses that could be combined in dozens of ways and allowed companies to gain additional permits.LiNeBrEaK  ''It was lobbying by industry, including the electricity companies, that was to blame for all these exceptional rules,'' said Hans Jurgen Nantke, the director of the German trading authority, part of the Federal Environment Agency. LiNeBrEaK  Higher Bills Draw InquiryLiNeBrEaK  After the system kicked off, in 2005, power consumers in Germany started to see their electrical bills increase by 5 percent a year. RWE, the power company, received 30 percent of all the permits given out, more than any other company in Germany.LiNeBrEaK  The company said its price increases from 2005 to 2007 predominantly reflected higher costs of coal and natural gas. But the company acknowledged charging its customers for the emission permits, saying that while it may have received them free from the government, they still had value in the marketplace.LiNeBrEaK  The German antitrust authority later investigated. In a confidential document sent to RWE lawyers in December 2006, that agency accused RWE of ''abusive pricing,'' piling on costs for industrial clients that were ''completely out of proportion'' to the company's economic burden, according to the document, which was obtained by The New York Times.LiNeBrEaK  Without admitting wrongdoing, RWE last year agreed to a settlement that should provide lower electricity rates to industrial customers in Germany from 2009 through 2012. LiNeBrEaK  Meanwhile emissions have risen at RWE's German operations since the trading system began. The company emitted nearly 158 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2007, compared with 120 million tons in 2005, according to its annual reports. LiNeBrEaK  The company said its emissions rose in part because one of its nuclear power stations, which emit no carbon dioxide, was off line for a while. LiNeBrEaK  Jurgen Frech, the chief spokesman for RWE, said that charging customers for the carbon permits was ''beyond reproach,'' and added that the company will spend more than $1 billion this year to comply with the emissions trading system. RWE also said it is investing $41 billion over the next five years in projects including renewable energy and developing cleaner ways to generate electricity from coal mined in Germany.LiNeBrEaK  For all the problems with the European system, some experts say it is simply too early to judge whether it will succeed. As the region that went first with mandatory carbon trading, Europe was bound to make some initial mistakes, they said.LiNeBrEaK  Call It ExperimentalLiNeBrEaK  ''People who don't want to do anything about carbon emissions in the United States are quick to say the European system was a failure,'' said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington. ''But they don't understand this was an experiment to learn how to get things right.''LiNeBrEaK  Supporters of carbon trading in Europe contend that significant reductions should be achieved starting this year because limits on emissions have been tightened. But negotiations on how to meet even more ambitious targets after 2012 are in danger of coming undone as the economy worsens. LiNeBrEaK  Poland -- which depends on coal-fired plants for 95 percent of its electricity -- has threatened to block the next phase of Europe's emissions plan unless a way is found to lessen the burden on its energy sector. Its fears echo the position of some American states that depend on coal for their electricity; they worry about huge cost increases should Congress pass a global warming bill.  LiNeBrEaK  France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is leading the political horse-trading on Europe's new system after 2012.LiNeBrEaK  ''Europe,'' he said on Saturday in Poland, ''must be an example for others.''

The New York Times 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   The New York Times on the Web	The Connections Between Meat and Climate Change  		Section ; Column 0; Editorial Desk; LETTERS; Pg.   	524 words  	To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Re ''From Hoof to Dinner Table, a New Bid to Cut Emissions'' (front page, Dec. 4):LiNeBrEaK  There is a solution to at least some of the beef industry's sustainability woes, and that is to raise cows in a pasture-based system.  LiNeBrEaK  Many of the beef industry's problems result from feedlots that consume tremendous amounts of grain and that pour out huge sloughs of waste. Finishing the cattle on grass is a far ''greener'' method. LiNeBrEaK  Of course, the meat is more expensive since it takes lots of real estate to freely graze a herd, and it's tougher than typical supermarket fare (Americans are used to a style of marbling that's caused by grain diets and flabby cattle, whereas grass-fed cows are trim from their daily ambles). But the leaner meat from grass-fed animals actually tastes richer and more savory.LiNeBrEaK  The other problem with meat consumption is proportion. Consumers can help the beef industry save itself by both buying less and choosing grass-fed.LiNeBrEaK  Andrew Rimas   Evan D. G. Fraser  Jamaica Plain, Mass., Dec.LiNeBrEaK  The writers are the authors of ''Beef: The Untold Story of How Milk, Meat, and Muscle Shaped the World.''LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Missing from your article was mention of deleterious environmental and health effects resulting from intensive animal farming in addition to global warming. An approach to address all of these, instead of just developing technology to control methane emissions, is vital.LiNeBrEaK  Specifically, the increasing meat-consumption trend could be reversed if consumers paid the true price for meat. For this to happen, subsidies that keep animal feed artificially low, and encourage producers to raise as many animals as possible, should end. LiNeBrEaK  In addition, allowing animal waste to be spread on fields at rates higher than can be absorbed, resulting in nutrient runoff and oceanic dead zones, needs to be stopped. LiNeBrEaK  If these policies were adopted, small-scale animal agriculture would be a more economical model, and people would eat less meat. This would result in improved human health, decreased environmental destruction and better animal welfare.LiNeBrEaK  Jillian Fry  Baltimore, Dec.LiNeBrEaK  To the Editor:LiNeBrEaK  Kudos to The New York Times for covering the much-neglected connections between meat and climate change. As you note, the lack of media coverage of the livestock sector's contribution to climate change is one reason it has escaped large-scale public outrage. LiNeBrEaK  At the yearly Meat Marketing conference this summer in Nashville, the industry representatives seemed most worried about negative press concerning animal welfare; the words ''global warming'' were never even uttered. Now, with mounting public awareness, the meat industry may soon realize that investment in sustainable practices is not just a nice idea. It is essential for the industry's survival.LiNeBrEaK  With a new administration and agriculture secretary we can also hope that our leaders will also grasp that food and farming policy is climate change policy as well, and will make bold choices to ensure a healthier planet for all of us.

The New York Times 	December 11, 2008 Thursday  Correction Appended  	OBAMA TEAM SET ON ENVIRONMENT  	By JOHN M. BRODER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1  	1145 words  	Late Edition - FinalLiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has selected his top energy and environmental advisers, including a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, presidential transition officials said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaK  Collectively, they will have the task of carrying out Mr. Obama's stated intent to curb global warming emissions drastically while fashioning a more efficient national energy system. And they will be able to work with strong allies in Congress who are interested in developing climate-change legislation, despite fierce economic headwinds that will amplify objections from manufacturers and energy producers. LiNeBrEaK  The officials said Mr. Obama would name Steven Chu, the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as his energy secretary, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, as head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Mr. Obama also appears ready to name Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator under President Bill Clinton, as the top White House official on climate and energy policy and Lisa P. Jackson, New Jersey's commissioner of environmental protection, as the head of the E.P.A.  LiNeBrEaK  Aides cautioned that while Mr. Obama appeared to favor Ms. Browner for the new White House post, there were still issues to be resolved before the appointment was formalized. Mr. Obama plans to name the environmental team next week in Chicago, aides said.LiNeBrEaK  If named to the White House climate post, Ms. Browner, an acolyte of former Vice President Al Gore, will have forceful support in the new Congress, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who will be the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who is returning as chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Opposing their efforts will be many Republicans and some Democrats, as well as manufacturers, utilities, oil companies and coal producers who will bear the brunt of the costs of any steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the main culprit in global warming.LiNeBrEaK  In the coming months, the administration will also have to devise a strategy for dealing with global talks to address climate change, which are already under way.LiNeBrEaK  In addition, both Ms. Browner and Ms. Jackson, who have strong reputations for regulating industry, will be under pressure to revisit and overturn many of the clean-air rules and other regulations imposed during the Bush administration over the objections of environmentalists. LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama has promised to spend liberally to finance infrastructure projects and support so-called green technologies that will create jobs while benefiting the environment. These officials will work with Mr. Obama's economic advisers to try to find -- and finance -- projects that accomplish these goals.LiNeBrEaK  It was not immediately clear how responsibilities for managing climate change, technological innovation and huge energy infrastructure spending will be divided among them.LiNeBrEaK  Dr. Chu will be taking on one of the most challenging jobs in government at the Department of Energy. He will be responsible for the maintenance and development of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, as well as for modernizing the nation's electrical power delivery system.LiNeBrEaK  He will also play a central role in directing the research and development of alternative energy sources needed to replace fossil fuels in a era of constrained carbon emissions. Mr. Chu shared a Nobel Prize in physics in  1997 for work on supercooled atoms.LiNeBrEaK  At the Lawrence Berkeley laboratory, he has sponsored research into biofuels and solar energy and has been a strong advocate of controlling greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaK  Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, an industry group, said he was pleased that Dr. Chu had the technical expertise to realistically assess future energy technologies.LiNeBrEaK  ''His experience seems to dovetail perfectly with the president-elect's commitment to bringing new energy technology to market in a timely fashion,'' Mr. Segal said. ''An understanding of the art of the possible in energy technology will be critical to the development of a cost-effective climate change policy.''LiNeBrEaK  Although the scope of Ms. Browner's job at the White House is still under discussion, aides said that if appointed she would coordinate administration policy across departmental lines and advocate for Mr. Obama's energy and environmental policies on Capitol Hill. It was not clear on Wednesday whether her office would carry the bureaucratic clout of the National Security Council or the National Economic Council.LiNeBrEaK  Before coming to Washington to head Mr. Clinton's E.P.A., Ms. Browner was Florida's top environmental officer. Since leaving government at the end of the Clinton administration, she has been a partner in an international consulting business with Madeleine K. Albright, Mr. Clinton's second-term secretary of state. Among her clients at the Albright Group was a Dubai-based port operator that sought a contract to manage American ports. The deal fell apart amid heated Congressional criticism.LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Browner, a lawyer, is well known in Washington and around the country as a forceful environmental advocate and experienced capital player. She is married to Tom Downey. a former New York congressman.LiNeBrEaK  ''She was a really strong administrator in really tough times,'' said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, an environmental group. LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Jackson has been the head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection since 2006, but in October, Gov. Jon S. Corzine announced that she would become his chief of staff starting this month. She has a master's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton and spent 16 years at the federal E.P.A. as a top enforcement officer in Washington and New York. LiNeBrEaK  She has led the Obama transition team at E.P.A. and knows the agency inside and out, according to associates.LiNeBrEaK  S. William Becker, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which represents state environmental bodies, said Ms. Jackson was among the most respected state environmental officials.LiNeBrEaK  ''Her state experience allows her to know what works and what doesn't work on the ground,'' said Mr. Becker, who is not related to Dan Becker. ''I also am glad to see they chose an engineer to run E.P.A. The typical choice is an attorney.''LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Sutley, who will direct the Council on Environmental Quality, is now the top environmental adviser to the mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio R. Villaraigosa. She has years of experience in managing water supplies and water quality in California and has also worked on energy-saving construction rules for the City of Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaK  She was a special assistant to Ms. Browner at the E.P.A.

Philadelphia Inquirer (Pennsylvania)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	A Bush Legacy: Fixing the EPA  	McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	COMMENTARY  	518 words  	The following editorial appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday, Dec. 10:LiNeBrEaKAmong the many things on President-elect Barack Obama's growing to-do list is overhauling the emasculated Environmental Protection Agency. LiNeBrEaKUnder the Bush administration, the EPA became overly politicized, sided with corporate polluters, and often ignored findings and recommendations by its own scientists.LiNeBrEaKA four-part series in The Philadelphia Inquirer details many of the EPA's failings during the Bush years. Although some of the EPA's troubles have been touched on before, the series connects all the dots in one compelling compendium.LiNeBrEaKSadly, a similar exercise could be done examining other government agencies that have also been blatantly politicized by the Bush administration, including the Justice Department, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Interior Department.LiNeBrEaKIn the EPA series, Inquirer reporters John Shiffman and John Sullivan show how the agency charged with safeguarding the nation's health and environment systematically eroded its mission over the years.LiNeBrEaKIn the most glaring example, the EPA backed off a finding that said climate change was a risk to public welfare. The findings would have led to the nation's first mandatory global-warming regulations. Instead, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson watered-down the final report, which delayed action to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKMore broadly, under Bush the EPA's funding was slashed, scientific findings censored, and enforcement de-emphasized.LiNeBrEaKBush's first EPA head, former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman, resigned in 2003 after several public clashes with the administration. She later said Vice President Cheney's efforts to ease air-pollution controls caused her to step down.LiNeBrEaKJohnson took over in 2005. Like too many other Bush appointees, he has been a yes man, more intent on eliminating regulations to benefit business interests than on protecting the environment. Johnson came to the EPA post with the help of a business lobbyist who was close to Bush's political chief, Karl Rove.LiNeBrEaKWhitman said Johnson, a scientist who advanced through the ranks of EPA, was handicapped even if he wanted to resist Bush, because he did not have the political clout other administrators brought to the job.LiNeBrEaKMany of the EPA's key decisions have been thrown out by federal courts. Over and over again, even Republican-appointed judges have found the EPA's legal justifications for its decisions to be a joke. In several instances, the courts cited fairy tales as the only way to justify some of the EPA's decisions.LiNeBrEaKThe legal rebukes show how far the EPA has fallen under Bush. The Inquirer series makes clear that Obama must move immediately to resurrect the agency.LiNeBrEaKVisit Philadelphia Online, the Inquirer's World Wide Web site, at http://www.philly.com	ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (91%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (89%); LOBBYING (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); AIR POLLUTION (77%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (76%); SCIENCE NEWS (76%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (76%); JUDGES (73%); AIR QUALITY (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (69%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (69%); JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS (69%); CENSORSHIP (64%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (60%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%); FOOD and DRUG ADMINISTRATION (56%)  			PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA (78%) PENNSYLVANIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Philadelphia Inquirer   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	BARACK OBAMA (92%); JOHN SULLIVAN (56%); DICK CHENEY (54%); KARL ROVE (52%)  	20081211-BC-EPA-EDITORIAL  	PH  												
The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   All Editions	Ex-environment chief Obama's pick for EPA;  Reports name Jackson, Corzine's chief of staff 	By HERB JACKSON and JEFF PILLETS, STAFF WRITERS, North Jersey Media Group  	NEWS; Pg. A04  	1032 words  	President-elect Barack Obama will name New Jersey's Lisa Jackson to be administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency next week, a Trenton source and national news organizations said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKJackson, the chief of staff to Governor Corzine and former commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Protection, has been considered a likely candidate since last week to become the first African-American to run the EPA.LiNeBrEaKJackson worked in the department before joining Corzine's administration, and as a member of Obama's transition team she has interviewed current EPA officials about issues facing the department. LiNeBrEaKA lobbyist who is closely watching the appointment said Jackson was picked several days ago, as was Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize winner and professor at the University of California at Berkeley, to lead the Department of Energy.LiNeBrEaK"DOE and EPA have been locked in for some time," said Ed Krenik, a lobbyist with Bracewell Giuliani who worked in the EPA when former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman was administrator.LiNeBrEaKCorzine's office could not confirm the nomination had been offered to Jackson, who continues to work in the governor's office. Jackson did not return a call seeking comment.LiNeBrEaKJackson is expected to leave the governor's office shortly, Democratic sources said. She is expected to be replaced as chief of staff by Ed McBride, Corzine's chief counsel, sources in Trenton said.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press and NBC News both reported the appointment as a done deal, and Jeff Tittel, executive director of the state chapter of the Sierra Club, said the announcement would be Monday.LiNeBrEaKThe AP also reported Obama would name former EPA Administrator Carol Browner as a "climate czar" who would coordinate efforts to combat global warming that will likely stretch across many federal departments.LiNeBrEaKOne congressional aide who said last week Jackson was the leading contender for the EPA said no appointment would be made until next week. That's because Obama does not want any comments at an announcement news conference to interfere with an international conference on climate control taking place in Poland.LiNeBrEaKObama has scheduled a news conference for today, but the AP said it will be to name former Sen. Tom Daschle to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.LiNeBrEaKWashington was already reacting to the news as though a formal announcement had been made. Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a group of power-generating and transportation companies, said Jackson's experience at New Jersey's DEP gave her "real-world experience dealing with areas of scenic beauty, large populations and substantial industrial development.LiNeBrEaK"We hope that means she will bring a true sense of balance to a very complicated job," Segal said.LiNeBrEaKTittel, the state's most outspoken environmentalist, praised Jackson's leadership, likeability and knowledge of issues. Negotiations with Jackson, he said, are marked by mutual respect and forthright dialogue.LiNeBrEaK"She does not play games," Tittel said. "This is someone who is very upfront, someone you can work with, someone who understands science because she has a chemical engineering background."LiNeBrEaKJackson's tenure has been marked both by passage of sweeping climate change legislation and by a stream of pro-development policies and proposals that environmentalists say undermine longstanding protections.LiNeBrEaKThese include plans to replace state inspectors with "licensed site inspectors" hired by developers; cutbacks in proposed clean stream and soil rules and delays on new measures to reduce greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKCritics say the DEP under Jackson also delayed in releasing a critical report linking chromium waste sites in rapidly developing areas of Hudson County to lung cancer.LiNeBrEaKBut most of those decisions, Tittel said, came not from Jackson but from her boss, Governor Corzine.LiNeBrEaKMany of Jackson's proposals, such as a plan to protect 900 miles of the state's cleanest streams, were scaled back once they reached the governor's office, he said. Others were tabled once they got there, he said, citing a DEP proposal requiring the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant to install cooling towers.LiNeBrEaK"It is clear that this governor has her hands tied on a lot of important issues," Tittel said.LiNeBrEaKBut others contend that Jackson is responsible for changes during her tenure, and the nation does not need another EPA administrator who will bend to the will of an anti-environment administration.LiNeBrEaKJeff Ruch, executive director of the non-profit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, said Jackson is a non-starter for the EPA job because she espoused many policies that Obama himself campaigned against.LiNeBrEaKRuch's group says that Jackson's DEP endangered public health by failing to adequately respond to crises such as the discovery of mercury contamination in a day-care center at the site of a former thermometer factory.LiNeBrEaK"While Ms. Jackson has a compelling biography, little of what occurred during her 31-month tenure commends her for promotion," Ruch said. "Under her watch, New Jersey's environment only got dirtier, incredible as that may seem."LiNeBrEaKBill Wolfe, a former DEP and PEER official who is now an activist, said Jackson's tenure has been marked by mismanagement, especially in the critical toxic site cleanup program. The federal government, he said, is now taking control of 14 highly contaminated sites that had been monitored by the state.LiNeBrEaK"Her tenure as DEP chief has left the agency adrift, suffering from three consecutive years of budget and staff cuts and handcuffed by a hiring freeze," Wolfe wrote in a recent Internet posting. "In addition, about 300 career professionals have been forced out by early retirement programs ? thus DEP has lost institutional memory. Morale is low."LiNeBrEaKA DEP spokeswoman, Elaine Makatura, said Jackson was being targeted because the environmental community was not happy with staff cuts necessitated by state budget constraints.LiNeBrEaKMakatura also defended the day-care center episode, saying DEP had not been notified when the contaminated building's owner opened the center, and since has taken steps to require such notification.LiNeBrEaKE-mail: jackson@northjersey.com and pillets@northjersey.com	ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (92%); LOBBYING (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); GOVERNORS (90%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); PRESS CONFERENCES (89%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (70%); NOBEL PRIZES (69%); AWARDS and PRIZES (69%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (68%); COSMETICS and TOILETRIES COMPANIES (63%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (54%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%) OBAMA; APPOINTMENT  	NBC UNIVERSAL INC (66%); BRACEWELL and GIULIANI LLP (56%); ASSOCIATED PRESS (54%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%); UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (56%)  		NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING (66%); SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS (66%)  	TRENTON, NJ, USA (93%); SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (79%) NEW JERSEY, USA (95%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (95%); POLAND (52%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  	PHOTOS; JACKSON CHU		Newspaper  	2008 North Jersey Media Group Inc., All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); JON CORZINE (93%); TOM DASCHLE (52%); LISA P JACKSON (94%); STEVEN CHU (56%); CAROL BROWNER (53%)

He has been the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 2004 and has pushed for research into alternative energy as a way to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaK Jackson, who would be the first African-American to lead the EPA, is a former New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection commissioner who worked at the federal agency for 16 years, including under Browner when she was Clinton's EPA chief.LiNeBrEaK Browner, who served as EPA chief for eight years under Clinton, will become Obama's agent in the White House overseeing energy issues, an area expected to include the environment and climate matters.LiNeBrEaK Sutley, the deputy mayor for energy and environment in Los Angeles and the mayor's representative on the Board of Directors for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, is the first prominent member of the gay and lesbian community to earn a senior role in Obama's administration.LiNeBrEaK She was an EPA official during the Clinton administration, including being a special assistant to the EPA administrator in Washington.LiNeBrEaK The inauguration: It will be replete with the traditional balls but also featuring service projects to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's holiday, aides said yesterday.LiNeBrEaK The preliminary schedule also includes a national prayer service the day after Obama and Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. take office Jan. 20.LiNeBrEaK The schedule plans an event on Sunday, Jan. 18, to welcome visitors to Washington. Obama and Biden are expected to perform a service project the next day, the national King holiday. Aides are not detailing what they will do.LiNeBrEaK Inauguration Day will feature many of the events of past schedules.LiNeBrEaK Special guests: The Tuskegee Airmen, who made history during World War II as the country's first black military pilots only to return home to discrimination and exclusion from victory parades, have been invited to Obama's inauguration.LiNeBrEaK "I want to come hopping, skipping and jumping!" said 92-year-old Spann Watson, an airman from Westbury, N.Y., who flew above Pennsylvania Avenue for President Harry S. Truman's inauguration. "We had a part in changing these United States."LiNeBrEaK Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sent the invitation Tuesday to Tuskegee Airmen Inc. The Arlington County, Va.-based organization represents 330 of the original pilots, whose ranks once were about 1,000.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	California air board to vote on plan to slash emissions  	Chris Bowman, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	854 words  	Dec. 11--Today and Friday are expected to be monumental in California's fight against global warming and air pollution.LiNeBrEaKThe state Air Resources Board is set to vote today on a sweeping 12-year strategy for slashing climate-altering emissions that would affect the type of cars Californians drive, the electricity they use to light their homes and even the location of future homes and jobs.LiNeBrEaKThen on Friday, the governor-appointed air board is expected to approve regulations requiring owners of nearly 1 million heavy-duty trucks to thoroughly clean up diesel exhaust, which is believed responsible for as many as 9,000 deaths a year statewide. LiNeBrEaK"It is probably the most significant board meeting we have had in decades," said Thomas Cackette, the board's deputy executive officer.LiNeBrEaKThe voting comes at a politically good time from the view of state regulators, public health advocates and others seeking to influence a national response to global warming.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has said he intends to quickly reverse the Bush administration's decision last December to deny California authority to curb heat-trapping carbon emissions from automobiles.LiNeBrEaKObama on Wednesday reportedly was ready to name two officials from California -- Steven Chu, the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment -- to top energy and environmental posts. Those appointments would add to California's growing clout in crafting federal climate change regulations.LiNeBrEaKContinuing business as usual in other states and nations would overwhelm any progress California makes in cutting global warming gases.LiNeBrEaKThe California air board's impending actions also come at an economically bad time, with heavy opposition from the trucking industry, which is struggling under the slowdown in movement of goods.LiNeBrEaKIndependent truckers and owners of small fleets are among the louder opponents.LiNeBrEaK"What gives you the authority to tell me that not only do I have to junk my truck, but that I also lose the capital investment that I already have in it?" Mark Binkley, a Southern California trucker, said in an e-mail to the board.LiNeBrEaK"If you want to purchase my truck for what I paid for it, then fine," said Binkley, who bought a 1989 Peterbilt rig two years ago for $75,000.LiNeBrEaKState air regulators point out that the requirements to install soot traps on older rigs or switch to cleaner-burning engines don't take effect until 2010 and allow up to 13 more years for compliance, depending on the model year and size of the fleet.LiNeBrEaKA coalition of truck owners, grocers and construction contractors has proposed an alternative that phases in the requirements over a longer period at less cost.LiNeBrEaKBoard Chairwoman Mary Nichols said the truckers' plan would put Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley in violation of federal clean-air standards by 2014, resulting in more heart attacks, lung disease and deaths.LiNeBrEaK"The health impacts are so staggering," Nichols said, pointing out the estimated 9,000 deaths that would occur under business as usual.LiNeBrEaK"The numbers are just hard to argue with, and nobody is arguing with them," Nichols said. "The only argument is that we shouldn't be doing this in hard economic times."LiNeBrEaKExhaust filters cost $10,000 or more, new engines several times that, and a new truck well over $100,000. Trucks built since 2005 already are equipped with the soot traps.LiNeBrEaKThe big-rig trucks, large delivery trucks and airport shuttle buses are the last of the diesel-powered vehicles and equipment to come under the soot-cutting knife of the air board, following similar rules for garbage trucks, municipal buses and off-road construction and farming vehicles and equipment.LiNeBrEaKBut the number of these heavy-duty vehicles, along with their heavy weight, high mileage and longevity, makes them the single-largest source of toxic air pollution in California, air board officials said.LiNeBrEaKThe regulations would dramatically cut emissions of tiny diesel exhaust particles and smog-forming nitrogen oxides from more than 400,000 diesel vehicles registered in the state and another 500,000 out-of-state trucks that pass through California each year.LiNeBrEaKIn 1998, the board declared the particles in diesel exhaust a "toxic air contaminant" because of their potential to cause cancer and premature heart- and lung-related deaths in adults.LiNeBrEaKThe particles are small enough to evade the lung's defenses and enter the bloodstream, raising the risk of heart disease as well as respiratory illness.LiNeBrEaKNumerous studies since then have strengthened the link between lung cancer and heart disease and diesel exhaust, particularly among truckers and dock workers.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Chris Bowman, (916) 321-1069.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: Time for candor on climate plan  	The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	630 words  	Dec. 11--Ever since he signed California's 2006 law to reduce emissions linked to global warming, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has made the transition sound startlingly easy.LiNeBrEaKA 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020? No problem. Bring on the hydrogen-powered Hummers, the geothermal-powered Jacuzzis and the solar-powered plasma televisions.LiNeBrEaKThere is no need for sacrifice or higher energy prices in Schwarzenegger's vision of a low-carbon future. LiNeBrEaK"It's all about technology, because we all know that the guilt trip that we have put on people has not worked, to tell them that they should not use the Jacuzzi, or the big, large plasma TV," the governor said in a speech last month.LiNeBrEaKSadly, this overly optimistic view of the world has crept into the "scoping plan" that the California Air Resources Board is expected to vote on today to implement the state's global warming law.LiNeBrEaKThe plan, a mixture of regulations and market mechanisms aimed at reducing emissions to 1990 levels in a mere 12 years, underestimates the possible costs involved in transforming the state's modes of transportation, its energy sources and its industries, according to several economists who peer-reviewed the document.LiNeBrEaK"The economic analysis is terribly deficient in critical ways," wrote Robert Stavins, a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.LiNeBrEaK"The net dollar cost of each of these regulations is likely to be much larger than what is reported," wrote Matthew E. Kahn, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.LiNeBrEaKWe remain convinced that California must aggressively implement programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The law requires it (and requires the air board to have a scoping plan approved by Jauary 2009).LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the threat of climate change is arguably the worst long-term threat to the state's economy. If other governments see California weakening its climate crusade, it likely will undermine the growing international effort to bring emissions under control.LiNeBrEaKThat said, the California air board must be candid about the real costs of the transition it is contemplating. Energy prices will rise, and major capital investment will be needed in public transit, energy-efficient buildings and new transmission lines. Industries that are energy-intensive will move elsewhere. Industries that are building the green grid of the future will flock here, as they are already doing.LiNeBrEaKUnfortunately, the current scoping plan doesn't adequately acknowledge these realities or establish a clear funding mechanism to mitigate the possible costs. Any final plan must strongly advocate for fees on polluting vehicles and a cap-and-trade system in which allowances are auctioned, with revenues plowed back to industries and communities to ease the transition.LiNeBrEaKMajor reductions in emissions should be expected from more efficient planning of new communities. Neighborhoods burdened by toxic pollution need assurances that those problems won't worsen under a market trading system.LiNeBrEaKThis is a huge undertaking for California, and while we sympathize with the tight deadlines the air board has faced, it may need to take a little more time to do the job right. One thing's for sure: If the air board approves a deficient plan, the courts or the Legislature could derail all progress to date. That would truly be a climatic disaster.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Sacramentans call for green behind green promises  	Robert Lewis, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	399 words  	Dec. 11--Sacramento-area leaders today called on President-Elect Barack Obama to follow through on talk of funding local programs that combat climate change.LiNeBrEaKLeaders here -- and nationwide -- hope investment in green technology can not only fight the effects of global warming, but also provide an economic stimulus for cities and counties struggling with job loss and growing budget deficits. LiNeBrEaK"This is the opportunity for the proverbial win-win," said Roger Dickinson, a Sacramento County Supervisor. "When we do good things for the environment it also creates jobs and helps the economy."LiNeBrEaKDickinson and other local leaders gathered today at the Colonia San Martin Housing Project, a solar-powered affordable housing development on Florin Mall near Highway 99. The 60-unit development opened this month. It is the only affordable housing development in the county to use solar power technology. Such technology is expected to save as much as $2,000 a month.LiNeBrEaKCities and counties, which have seen property and sales tax revenue decline, and face the prospect of more cuts from the state, are projecting sizable budget shortfalls. Officials in the City of Sacramento say they could have a $45 million to $50 million budget shortfall next year. Sacramento County officials say their budget deficit could top $100 million.LiNeBrEaKGreen technology is part of the solution.LiNeBrEaK"It's a job creation initiative not just saving money and helping the environment," Dickinson said.LiNeBrEaKFranklin Delano Roosevelt tried to help stimulate the economy after the Great Depression by investing heavily in infrastructure projects -- roads, bridges, highways, etc. Climate change programs that generate "green-collar jobs" could be the modern day equivalent, local leaders say.LiNeBrEaK"I believe there's real momentum developing locally and nationally for clean, green and smart energy solutions," said Larry Carr, president of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District board of directors.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Robert Lewis, (916) 321-1061	BUDGET (91%); HOUSING ASSISTANCE (90%); COUNTIES (90%); JOB CREATION (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (90%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (90%); URBAN DEVELOPMENT (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (90%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (90%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (90%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (89%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (78%); ECONOMIC DEPRESSION (76%); CITIES (76%); 2008 ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN (76%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (74%); SOLAR ENERGY (74%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); DISMISSALS (71%); SALES TAX (71%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (69%); INFRASTRUCTURE (66%); GREAT DEPRESSION (64%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (78%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (63%); SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT (53%)  			General  	SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (94%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Sacramento Bee   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARACK OBAMA (91%)  	20081211-SA-Sacramentans-call-for-green-behind-green-promises-1211  	SA  												
The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	We're no model;  AB 32 fiasco shows state doesn't know best 		OPINION ; Pg. B-6  	498 words  	One of the shabbiest, least satisfying public policy debates in modern California political history is expected to wrap up today in Sacramento with the California Air Resources Board adopting its "Scoping Plan" for the implementation of AB 32. That's the landmark 2006 state law requiring a sharp increase in the use of cleaner but more costly sources of energy to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global warming. LiNeBrEaKIt is inevitable that the law will have negative economic consequences, given that California businesses will have higher costs than rival firms in other states and nations without such an edict, and given that California consumers will have less disposable income.LiNeBrEaKNevertheless, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has built his entire climate change policy around the ludicrous claim that AB 32 will provide a broad boost to the economy, not drag it down. This claim is dutifully echoed both in the Air Resources Board's Scoping Plan and in the comments of board boss Mary Nichols and Democratic legislative leaders.LiNeBrEaKThankfully, in recent weeks Schwarzenegger's argument finally has faced independent scrutiny -- and has promptly been demolished. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office and six economists hired to do a peer review of the CARB's plan have chronicled its cherry-picking of data, its weak methodology and the absurdity of many of its premises.LiNeBrEaKFor one example, the CARB says that any action by a business that reduces greenhouse gas emissions is automatically "cost-effective" -- meaning going out of business is therefore cost-effective.LiNeBrEaKNo wonder one independent economist worried about AB 32's threat to 1. 5 million California manufacturing jobs. No wonder two others said the air board's report looked more like an attempt to justify AB 32 than to evaluate its economic effects. No wonder another said the air board's work was so weak it could undermine efforts to combat global warming in a responsible way -- and called it "useless for identifying a cost-effective portfolio of policies to achieve the ambitious objectives of AB 32."LiNeBrEaKIn other words, instead of California being a model for other states to emulate on climate change, it is a model to shun.LiNeBrEaKGiven this backdrop, reports that Nichols was on President-elect Barack Obama's short list to run the Environmental Protection Agency were deeply troubling. The next EPA chief will help formulate what Obama says will be an aggressive climate-change policy. It is absolutely essential that the people who formulate this policy are rigorously honest about the real-world effects of forcing America to turn away from fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKIn California, the people formulating climate-change policy have been rigorously dishonest, consistently insisting that this wrenching transition will be painless. If Obama chooses to emulate this approach, that will be a sad commentary on his judgment.LiNeBrEaKAmerica's climate policy should be not be disguised with cheerful propaganda. California does not know best.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 11, 2008 Thursday  Correction Appended	KEANU! KLAATU! KLASSY! Or maybe not: `Earth' is a not-so-subtle update of the 1951 classic  	James Hebert, STAFF WRITER  	ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. NIGHT and DAY-19  	574 words  	Finally, the ideal holiday blockbuster: a movie that depicts Earth being invaded by giant Christmas-tree ornaments.LiNeBrEaKOne of the shiny, festive orbs that descends on the planet in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" contains a blob of goo known as Keanu Reeves. More precisely, it holds an alien being named Klaatu, who uses his cosmic powers to fashion a Keanu suit so as not to freak out the earthlings with his real appearance (said to more closely resemble Jack Black).LiNeBrEaKAnd if only for the sake of harmonious names, who better to play Klaatu than Keanu? (Possible runners-up: Kaeto Kaelin and the late Klaus Kinski.) LiNeBrEaKReeves offers more than that, though; his naturally impassive, detached persona is an eerily good fit for a character not wholly conversant with human emotion.LiNeBrEaKThe movie is a remake of Robert Wise's 1951 picture about an alien who, with his robot sidekick, Gort, arrives on a mission to save mankind from itself.LiNeBrEaKDirector Scott Derrickson's effects-juiced version ostensibly updates the original's Cold War jitters to suit a world that's sweating global warming. He and screenwriter David Scarpa have Klaatu chastising mankind for treating the planet so shabbily, and some of the crystal spheres sent by his home civilization are actually arks, scarfing up sea snakes and bees so they'll survive after the Earth is wiped clean of people.LiNeBrEaKBut so much of the movie really seems to be about what the '51 version also fixated on: militarism, aggression, tanks, guns and the all-inclusive category of stuff that blows up.LiNeBrEaKAs a matter of cinematic practicality, it seems sensible: Depicting man's selfish and senseless nature through lingering shots of polar icecaps melting does not scream Big Opening Weekend.LiNeBrEaKSo, instead of Al Gore, we have an allegory -- a not-so-subtle evocation of terrorism and the reflex for revenge it can engender. When the main alien orb lands in Central Park, New Yorkers are seen running from terrifying clouds of dust and debris.LiNeBrEaKWe've seen these images before, and they certainly weren't in that slide-show spectacular "An Inconvenient Truth." (Come to think of it -- impassive, detached? Al Gore would make a pretty good Klaatu, too.)LiNeBrEaKIn this scenario, Kathy Bates -- who plays the U.S. secretary of defense -- is our Don Rumsfeld, although the way she seizes control on behalf of an absentee president feels more Al Haig.LiNeBrEaKHer rude treatment of Klaatu -- having him shackled for a Gitmo-style "interview" -- convinces the visitor that humans just aren't worth the trouble. He gives the OK for the 26-foot-tall Gort, who's like a massive, death-ray-equipped Cycladic figurine, to unleash the ultimate weapon: a plague of metallic termites. (So much for Blackwater; what the Pentagon really needed was Terminix.)LiNeBrEaKFortunately, humanity has a secret weapon: the microbiologist Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly). And she has a secret weapon, which happens to be ... humanity.LiNeBrEaKAlso, cuteness, in the form of her adopted son, the wisecracking Jacob. He's played by Jaden Smith, son of Will, who starred just a year ago in another end-of-the-world saga, "I Am Legend." (Doom is becoming a family franchise.)LiNeBrEaKTheir show of emotion over Jacob's dad -- who gave his life, naturally, in service to the Army -- plays a big part in whether Klaatu spares mankind.LiNeBrEaKWe'll spare you the spoiler. And though it has its moments, you might want to spare yourself the movie.LiNeBrEaKDETAILSLiNeBrEaK"The Day the Earth Stood Still"Rating: PG-13When: Opens tomorrow	FILM (89%); CHRISTMAS (78%); DRAMA LITERATURE (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (72%); GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (71%); TERRORISM (50%); COLD WAR (71%)  					NEW YORK, NY, USA (52%) EARTH (91%); NEW YORK, USA (85%) UNITED STATES (85%)  	December 26, 2008  	ENGLISH  	2 PICS; CAPTIONS: 1.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	EDITORIAL: End diesel truck pollution  	San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	377 words  	Dec. 11--California has a long, proud history of environmental leadership. It should extend that legacy this week, despite the worst economy in decades.LiNeBrEaKToday the state's Air Resources Board should approve a much-debated plan to reduce greenhouse gases 30 percent by 2020, as required under California's pioneering climate change law, AB 32. Then, on Friday, the board should muster the courage to clean up deadly emissions from the state's 1 million diesel trucks. LiNeBrEaKBy converting to a green economy, California will reduce its health care costs and position itself to lead the nation out of the recession. AB 32 regulations will push us toward using cleaner, more efficient fuels in vehicles and homes.LiNeBrEaKThe trucking industry is one of the last remaining major sources of air pollution that California hasn't regulated. It got a pass because for years, it was thought that if you could see pollutants, like the black smoke puffing out of diesel stacks, the particles were too big to hurt you. But newer studies show that diesel pollution causes cancer, asthma and major heart problems: Researchers at California State University-Fullerton, say it causes 3,800 premature deaths every year and costs the state economy $28 billion a year. People who live within a mile of highways are at the greatest risk. And guess what. That's half of us.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed regulations require truckers to install $15,000 filters that reduce emissions by 85 percent and, overLiNeBrEaKthe next 15 years, buy new trucks with clean engines -- something most large firms would do anyway. While low-interest loans from the state will help with the $5 billion this will cost, there's no doubt shipping bills will rise. But the ultimate savings in dollars and human misery -- thousands of lives a year -- will be worth the cost to consumers. It's time for the air board to act.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   FINAL Edition	Dirty diesels  		Op-Ed; EDITORIALS; Pg. B6  	523 words  	Rumbling down California roads is a workhorse fleet of a million diesel trucks and buses. It's a mainstay industry that hauls produce from Central Valley farms, machinery to coastal ports and commuters to work.  LiNeBrEaKBut these vehicles are also the largest unchecked source of lung-damaging soot and a key chemical that forms smog. The state clean-air board is duty-bound to enact rules to minimize the harm to the public's health and California's skies. LiNeBrEaKIt won't be pain free or simple when the board votes on Friday. The cost of the control equipment is estimated at $5. 5 billion. But consider the do-nothing option: 9,400 deaths from soot and smog over the next decade and health care costs estimated at $48 billion. Also, the state stands to lose billions more in federal highway money if its notoriously dirty air in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley isn't cleaned up. LiNeBrEaKThe trucking industry doesn't quarrel with the health impacts. It contends the extra pollution controls up to $12,000 per truck impose an unfair burden in a weak economy.LiNeBrEaKThe air board's answer is reasonable and straightforward. After working out tailpipe controls on cars, construction equipment and port trucks, it's time for heavy-duty highway diesels to do their part. The rules will be phased in beginning in 2010 and $1 billion in subsidies will be available.LiNeBrEaKThe diesel decision should also send a powerful - and reassuring - message that California isn't backing off its pledge to clean its air. "It's a test of our commitment," air board director Mary Nichols said in a meeting with The Chronicle editorial board.LiNeBrEaKThe state's long fight to reduce pollution has taken on an added dimension that the air board will also address this week: the continuing efforts to carry out a landmark global warming law that requires the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, a drop of 30 percent. LiNeBrEaKThe blueprint maps out the general strategies in a huge state with a broad economy. Power plant controls, solar panels, new green-tech savings, lower car and truck emissions, and future changes in building designs and household appliances - all these will be part of reaching the greenhouse gas reductions in 12 years. LiNeBrEaKAdded to this list is a new ingredient that is drawing fire from developers and local government: the notion of limiting sprawl and the extra driving it requires. By insisting on emission reductions from land use policies, the air board can play an important role in guiding growth and limiting the major greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, that comes from car trips in spread-out subdivisions. LiNeBrEaKThe global warming package features another debate. What will the future bill be? A staff-commissioned study suggests overall job growth and a savings of $400 per household per year by 2020. But a second report by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office said these rosy projections aren't supportable. LiNeBrEaKThe dueling studies are a warning sign that stopping global warming will be controversial. But California is right to take on the challenge and begin the hard work.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   FINAL Edition	Berkeley lab's director likely next energy chief;  THE PRESIDENCY IN TRANSITION 	Kelly Zito, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	797 words  	President-elect Barack Obama is expected to nominate Nobel-laureate physicist Steven Chu, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a renowned expert on alternative fuels and climate change, as the nation's energy secretary.LiNeBrEaKThe selection of Chu, who has led efforts to use solar energy in cars and to work with oil companies on biofuels, would signal a bold new direction in the United States' response to climate change, critics of the Bush administration said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaK"The Chu pick is exciting because he will bring scientific rigor to the new administration's energy policy," said Daniel J. Weiss, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank. "After the anti-science Bush administration, this is like going to a Mensa meeting after eight years of being trapped in the Flat Earth Society." LiNeBrEaKChu, who lives in the Bay Area with his wife and fellow physicist Jean Chu, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But sources close to the incoming administration indicated that he was the likely choice.LiNeBrEaKObama also is expected to select Lisa Jackson, former commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, as Environmental Protection Agency administrator; and Carol Browner, who was EPA administrator under President Bill Clinton, as White House energy czar.LiNeBrEaKChu, 60, would beat out two other Californians whose names had been floated for energy secretary: Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dan Reicher, a former assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration and leader of the Google.org foundation's energy and climate change efforts.LiNeBrEaKChu, who was awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics for developing methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light, is widely respected in science and energy circles. He also is considered a Washington outsider - a potential liability given that Chu would have to face off against Big Oil and be in charge of passing a mammoth energy reform bill next year.LiNeBrEaKChu has not hesitated, however, to broadcast stark data showing that climate change could create a world ravaged by wars over arable land or water, or to advocate for aggressive changes in America's energy system.LiNeBrEaKAt the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas during the summer, he said one myth of the energy crisis is that all the necessary technology exists to solve the problem and that only political will is lacking.LiNeBrEaK"I think political will is absolutely necessary, but we need new technologies to transform the landscape," he told the crowd.LiNeBrEaKAs director of the Berkeley lab since 2004, Chu has endeavored to make it the world leader in renewable energy research.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to collaborating on the Joint BioEnergy Institute and Energy Biosciences Institute - centers that join universities, businesses and the Department of Energy labs - Chu is in the midst of establishing a solar energy initiative called Helios. The center's goal is to develop ways to store sunlight as auto fuel.LiNeBrEaKWord of Chu's likely nomination came a day after Obama met with former Vice President Al Gore, also a Nobel Prize winner and one of the world's leading voices on the fight against global warming. Obama's environmental plank calls for putting more than 1 million plug-in hybrid cars on the road within seven years and for cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThose goals and Obama's embrace of high-profile supporters of alternative energy sources would seem to set up obvious clashes with the coal, oil and auto industries, which have regularly fought against tighter regulations on emissions.LiNeBrEaKChu's recent work with oil giant BP, however, may hint at a broader approach to climate-change efforts. Last year, BP entered into a $500 million partnership with UC Berkeley, the national lab and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to found the Energy Biosciences Institute, which aims to create new methods for converting plants into fuels.LiNeBrEaKScott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a group of power-generating and transportation companies, said Chu's background is key to ushering in a new era of energy technology.LiNeBrEaK"An understanding of the art of the possible in energy technology will be critical to the development of a cost-effective climate change policy," Segal said.LiNeBrEaKPrior to the Berkeley lab appointment, Chu was a professor of physics and applied physics at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKChu, a St. Louis native, received his undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at the University of Rochester and received his doctorate from UC Berkeley.LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKDirector of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, expert in climate change and alternative fuels.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Bush relaxes protections for endangered species  	By Dina Cappiello The Associated Press  	BREAKING; Top Stories; News; National; World; Local  	600 words  	Washington &raquo; Just six weeks before President-elect Barack Obama takes office, the Bush administration issued revised endangered species regulations Thursday to reduce the input of federal scientists and to block the law from being used to fight global warming. LiNeBrEaKThe changes, which will go into effect in about 30 days, were completed in just four months. But they could take Obama much longer to reverse.LiNeBrEaKThey will eliminate some of the mandatory, independent reviews that government scientists have performed for 35 years on dams, power plants, timber sales and other projects, a step that developers and other federal agencies have blamed for delays and cost increases.LiNeBrEaKThe rules also prohibit federal agencies from evaluating the effect on endangered species and the places they live from a project's contribution to increased global warming.LiNeBrEaKInterior Department officials described the changes as "narrow", but environmentalists saw them as eroding the protections for endangered species.LiNeBrEaKInterior officials said federal agencies could still seek the expertise of federal wildlife biologists on a voluntary basis, and that other parts of the law will ensure that species are protected.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing in this regulation relieves a federal agency of its responsibilities to ensure that species are not harmed," said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in a conference call with reporters.LiNeBrEaKCurrent rules require biologists in the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to sign off on projects even when it is determined that they are not likely to harm species. The rule finalized Wednesday would do away with that requirement, reducing the number of consultations so that the government's experts can focus on cases that pose the greatest harm to wildlife, officials said.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists said that the rule changes would put decisions about endangered species into the hands of agencies with a vested interest in advancing a project and with little expertise about wildlife. Several groups planned to file lawsuits immediately.LiNeBrEaK"This new rule is essentially a changing of the guard for determining how government projects will affect endangered species," said Francesca Grifo, director of the Scientific Integrity Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Instead of expert biologists taking the first look at potential consequences, any federal agency, regardless of its expertise, will now be able to make decisions that should be determined by the best available science."LiNeBrEaKBetween 1998 and 2002, the Fish and Wildlife Service conducted 300,000 consultations. The National Marine Fisheries Service, which evaluates projects affecting marine species, conducts about 1,300 reviews each year.LiNeBrEaKThe reviews have helped safeguard protected species such as bald eagles, Florida panthers and whooping cranes. A federal government handbook from 1998 described the consultations as "some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species."LiNeBrEaKObama has said he would work to reverse the changes. But because the rule takes effect before he is sworn in, he would have to restart the lengthy rulemaking process. Congressional lawmakers have also vowed to take action, perhaps through a rarely used law that allows review of new federal regulations.LiNeBrEaKIn a related development, the Bush administration also finalized on Wednesday a special rule for the polar bear, a species that was listed as threatened in May because of global warming. The rule would allow oil and gas exploration in areas where the bears live, as long as the companies comply with the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

This would allow San Jose to legally pursue the Oakland A's and a downtown ballpark, which would provide a major economic stimulus for our downtown core and city as a whole.LiNeBrEaKThe Giants, with their beautiful waterfront ballpark 50 miles north of San Jose, no longer need to hold San Jose hostage under the guise of territorial rights. They're a financial success who could further enhance their coffers with a compensation deal from the A's; thus providing a win-win for the Giants, A's and city of San Jose. LiNeBrEaKSan Jose, as a major American city, deserves a fair shot at pursuing Major League Baseball and a beautiful downtown ballpark. Freeing San Jose from the territorial rights restriction will make this possible.LiNeBrEaKAnthony DominguezLiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKHow to sustain our cultural resourcesLiNeBrEaKThe demise of American Musical Theatre should remind us all to not take for granted the cultural institutions that enrich our lives and our community. Instead, do some holiday shopping at a museum gift store, the best place to find unique, one-of-a-kind gifts. Give a gift membership and provide someone entertainment year 'round; many museums offer reciprocal benefits to others in the U.S.   a great value for travelers on your list. If you've had the misfortune to lose your job this year, or have your hours cut, keep your skills sharp by using them as a volunteer; your work will be truly valued. This holiday season, visit a gallery, tour an exhibit, see a performance and feast on the creativity of others. The food banks still need us more than ever, but remember to feed your soul as well.LiNeBrEaKSandra DuncanLiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKTurn other cheek, get slapped againLiNeBrEaKRev. Ben Daniel's views (Letters, Dec. 6) concerning harmony between religions has evoked supportive responses, which I find disturbing. His message, as I read it, was why criticize moderate Muslims for not opposing their radical coreligionists when we Christians and others have been similarly passive? Does that make it right?LiNeBrEaKI doubt that the "turn the other cheek" doctrine would be construed as anything other than terminal weakness by radical Islam. When you turn the other cheek to Jihadists, they shoot you in that one, too.LiNeBrEaKNonviolence is an admirable approach to which we all should aspire but we haven't evolved there yet. Any minority group which adopts it in the face of a violent majority is heading for extinction. History has demonstrated that ad nauseam.LiNeBrEaKDesmond TuckLiNeBrEaKSan MateoLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming can't be solved locallyLiNeBrEaKAlberto Mendoza and Nora Vargas miss some basic knowledge about climate change (Opinion, Dec. 8).LiNeBrEaKTheir call to CARB (the California Air Resources Board) to assess "which communities in California are most polluted by greenhouse gasses" painfully shows that they don't grasp that global warming can only be addressed globally.LiNeBrEaKI sincerely hope that CARB will listen to advisers who are better qualified than the average fifth-grader.LiNeBrEaKAnton BakkerLiNeBrEaKMorgan HillLiNeBrEaKWhat sacrifices are our leaders making?LiNeBrEaKConsidering the latest estimates of the financial crisis facing California, I think we should all be asking our elected officials what sacrifices they plan to make during these hard times. We the taxpayers are bracing for increases in taxes and fees, decreases in services, huge layoffs of public and private sector employees. I have yet to hear anything about cuts being considered to the compensation, pension plans, health care, car allowances, per diem, etc., that our representatives enjoy. The fact is that these so-called leaders are at the helm of this shipwreck. Ultimately, it is their responsibility to run this state in a fiscally responsible manner. They have failed miserably. We should demand that any plan to bridge this budget gap start with cuts to those who failed us.LiNeBrEaKKen KramaszLiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKPublic financing to clean up politicsLiNeBrEaKThe arrest of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich for soliciting various payoffs in exchange for political favors is troubling to say the least. But it's just an example of the pay-to-play politics which is actually illegal. What about all the legalized bribery that goes on every day at all levels of government under the guise of "campaign contributions?" Their legal status is precisely what makes such contributions much more insidious and damaging to the body politic than the obvious corruption exemplified by Blagojevich.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Energy secretary choice backs alternative sources  		NEWS; Pg. 011  	333 words  	Steven Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is President-elect Barack Obama's choice for energy secretary, has been a vocal advocate for more research into alternative energy, arguing that a shift away from fossil fuels is essential to combat global warming. LiNeBrEaKChu, a Chinese-American who currently is director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, has in recent years campaigned to bring together a cross-section of scientific disciplines to find ways to counter climate change.LiNeBrEaKIf action is not taken now to stop global warming, it may be too late, he argues.LiNeBrEaKSince 2004, Chu, 60, has been director of the Berkeley lab, the oldest of the Energy Department's national laboratories, with its 4,000 employees and a budget of $650 million. The laboratory does only unclassified work and under Chu has been a center of research into biofuels and solar energy technologies. He is a former head of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKBorn to Chinese parents in St. Louis, he grew up in the Queens borough of New York City. His father, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and professor of chemical engineering, and mother came to the United States in 1943 and two years later decided to stay because of the political turmoil in China.LiNeBrEaKOne of the country's most renowned scientists, Chu in 1997 shared the Nobel Prize in physics with two other scientists for his research into ways to cool and trap atoms using laser light. By cooling atoms to minus-273 degrees Celsius, they found the movement of atoms can be slowed to a point where they could be trapped and manipulated.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, Chu's scientific interests have centered on energy and finding ways to replace fossil fuels with other energy sources such as biofuels from plants and converting energy from the sun into a fuel. He has spoken frequently about the need to link the physical and biological sciences with engineering to rally independent-thinking scientists in the fight against climate change.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	December 11, 2008 Thursday 	Rule endangers endangered species, groups say  	By Renee Schoof McClatchy Newspapers  	NATIONAL  	388 words  	WASHINGTON -- In a move environmental groups say strikes at the heart of the Endangered Species Act, the Bush administration on Thursday announced a new rule that would let federal agencies decide on their own whether their projects harm endangered species, instead of requiring them in many cases to get a second opinion from federal wildlife experts. LiNeBrEaKOpponents said the move destroys the checks and balances that have helped the government save hundreds of species from extinction under the 1973 law.LiNeBrEaKJamie Rappaport Clark, who headed the Fish and Wildlife Service under the Clinton administration, said the changes put more species in jeopardy.LiNeBrEaK"It's clearly allowing the fox to guard the chicken coop," she said.LiNeBrEaKConservation groups argued the changes were illegal and threatened to file lawsuits to get them thrown out. They also said they hoped President-elect Barack Obama would take steps after he takes office to limit the effects of the rules and start a new process to rewrite them.LiNeBrEaKInterior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said the reason for the rule change was linked to global warming.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne listed the polar bear as a threatened species in May but said that the Endangered Species Act could not be used to try to halt global warming. The new regulation specifies that there is no need for consultations when the harm to endangered or threatened species results from a global process that's too broad to measure.LiNeBrEaKKempthorne said it's impossible to pinpoint the death of any single animal from emissions from any single polluter. In fact, emissions of heat-trapping gases disperse evenly in the atmosphere around the globe and remain there for centuries.LiNeBrEaK"We made it very clear that the Endangered Species Act was never intended to be a back door for climate change policy," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe rule changes also go further and specify that federal agencies are not required to consult with the biologists of the two agencies that enforce the act -- the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Services -- if they think a project such as a timber sale or construction of a power plant won't harm or kill a threatened or endangered species. The changes do not rule out voluntary consultations.LiNeBrEaKThe Endangered Species Act makes it illegal to kill or harm an animal listed by the government as threatened or endangered.

USA TODAY 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   FINAL EDITION	Environmental groups irked;  Money intended for 'green' efforts now goes to bailout 	Sharon Silke Carty and Chris Woodyard  	MONEY; Pg. 3B  	523 words  	Environmental groups are disappointed that money put aside to aid automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars is now going to fund their operations.LiNeBrEaKAlthough the bill promises the money for retooling plants will be replenished in the future, environmentalists are skeptical. And they're also upset the bailout doesn't ban automakers from suing states that set tougher emissions limits than federal rules. LiNeBrEaK"We know they need help retooling their factories, and we feel very strongly that if those funds are going to be diverted and not replenished, Congress is walking away from their own commitment to fuel efficiency," says Phyllis Cuttino, head of the U.S. Global Warming Campaign for the Pew Environmental Group.LiNeBrEaKThe Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 called for increasing fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. In exchange for agreeing, automakers would get $25 billion in loans to help revamp their plants. They waited over a year for Congress to allocate the money. Now, some will go to the bailout.LiNeBrEaK"The funding Congress is considering now is just a Band-Aid, and it diverts funds originally intended to help the Big Three and other companies produce more fuel-efficient vehicles," says Michelle Robinson, director of the Clean Vehicles Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Those funds should be replenished when the new Congress convenes in January."LiNeBrEaKWhat particularly irks environmentalists is that the automakers will continue on their quest to stop individual states from enacting their own emissions rules.LiNeBrEaKRoland Hwang, vehicle policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, "The White House has decided they want to hold up this entire bailout bill in order to remove this litigation provision. We're very disappointed."LiNeBrEaKStill, even though they aren't getting money to increase fuel efficiency, high gas prices have forced the automakers to revamp their lineups in favor of more fuel-efficient cars. As Congress debated the bailout bill Wednesday, Ford showed off its 2010 Ford Fusion hybrid in Marina del Rey, Calif., and said that at 39 miles per gallon, it will be the highest-mileage midsize car.LiNeBrEaK"We're going squarely after the imports with this," says Frank Davis, executive director for North American product. The goal: "not only to compete but lead." It's exactly the pitch that Detroit needs to win the hearts of a skeptical Congress and American public, and the environmental lobby. Ford has not asked for loans now. General Motors and Chrysler say they need loans to stave off bankruptcy filings.LiNeBrEaKWhile it makes a play for environmentalists, the new hybrid will also be aimed at being a commercial success for Ford. Davis says it should add up to 25,000 sales of Fusions a year. While pricing isn't set, the hybrid system is 30% less expensive than the last generation, like that in the Ford Escape hybrid SUV.LiNeBrEaKFord plans to spend $14 billion in the U.S. on advanced technologies and products to improve fuel economy in the next seven years, it told Congress in the business plan it submitted as part of the bailout consideration. It plans a pure electric sedan by 2011.

The Washington Post 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   Regional Edition	Before Summit, E.U. Debates Limits on Carbon Emissions;  Nations Weigh Economic, Climate Risks 	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A14  	1015 words  	With delegates from around the world struggling to make progress here toward a new agreement on combating global warming, the European Union is locked in its own contentious debate over whether to toughen limits on carbon emissions, even though much of the continent has fallen behind on meeting current targets.LiNeBrEaKThe Europeans' disagreements over how fast to cut emissions in order to avert dangerous climate change, which could culminate in a vote as soon as Thursday in Brussels, highlights the difficulties the industrialized world faces as it decides how aggressively it can afford to act, especially amid a severe economic downturn. LiNeBrEaKThe outcome in Europe could have major implications for the U.S. Congress, which is poised to enact limits on greenhouse gas emissions after President-elect Barack Obama takes office.LiNeBrEaKAt the Brussels meeting, E.U. leaders must decide whether to finalize plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2020, while also reducing energy use by 20 percent and obtaining 20 percent of their energy supply from renewable sources. Coal-dependent nations such as Poland want to delay further lowering of emissions limits under the European Union's nearly four-year old cap-and-trade system. Even Germany, a leader in pressing for aggressive action on global warming, wants to postpone additional auctions of pollution allowances to ease the financial burden on its heavy industry.LiNeBrEaK"It's an unfortunate backing away from the position they've taken for many years," said Jake Schmidt, international climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.LiNeBrEaK"There is still a huge gap" between what European nations have promised and what they've accomplished, said Reinhard Buetikofer, who recently stepped down as leader of Germany's Green Party. "Everyone looks much better in rhetoric than in reality."LiNeBrEaKPoland, which is hosting this week's U.N. climate talks, joined forces with Italy and threatened to veto the European Union's climate and energy package last year, arguing it could not afford to meet its requirements. Germany, some of whose companies have a financial stake in Poland's utility sector, has been a key ally.LiNeBrEaKIronically, Poland has reduced its carbon emissions by 32 percent over the last 20 years as aging Soviet-era industries shut down, far outpacing the 6 percent cut it pledged to make under the 1987 Kyoto Protocol that the Poznan talks seek to replace. But Poland still gets 94 percent of its electricity from coal, making it the second most coal-dependent nation after South Africa, according to World Coal Institute figures for 2007.LiNeBrEaKPoland and its allies are resisting the European Union's current proposal to require that energy producers buy at auction 100 percent of the available carbon pollution permits by 2013 (until now, some these "credits" were allotted for free), and just this month, Polish officials asked to push back a 2016 deadline for starting a domestic carbon trading system. Instead, they are asking the European Union to set up a "benchmarking system" in which coal-fired utilities must install the best available pollution controls or pay a penalty.LiNeBrEaKPolish environment minister Maciej Nowicki, who is presiding over the climate talks, said in an interview Tuesday that while his nation is "absolutely determined" to help meet the European Union's 2020 target, it cannot comply with a policy that could boost energy prices "up to 90 percent, which is a terrible problem from a political, social and economic point of view."LiNeBrEaK"There are not any alternatives, even short-term or near-term, to coal-generated energy production in Poland," he said. "For the time being, there are no formal proposals that would satisfy us."LiNeBrEaKEven some of the most advanced E.U. members are hoping to modify the proposal pending in Brussels. Germany is simultaneously trying to phase out nuclear power, which accounts for 22 percent of its power generation, while grappling with technical problems with its offshore wind farms and local resistance to projects such as new coal-fired and biomass power plants.LiNeBrEaKGermany's commitment of massive resources to develop renewable energy sources is embodied by the 1,000-acre Adlershof science and technology park on the outskirts of Berlin, where in less than two decades, a place once home to East Germany's state-driven scientific brain trust has been transformed into a community of scientists working on everything from advanced solar panels to bacteria that might produce fuel.LiNeBrEaKBut Adlershof's success -- ventures spawned here boast a 10 percent annual growth with a minimal bankruptcy rate -- belie the larger reality: that it is finding it hard to get to a low-carbon energy future.LiNeBrEaKEberhard Meller, general executive manager of the BDEW German Association of Energy and Water Industries, said in an interview that he is unsure if power producers in his country could meet the E.U. targets in 12 years. "The goals are very ambitious and we might achieve them, but now due to the latest developments, we have more question marks," Meller said. He argued that energy-intensive industries need an exemption from the plan to auction all pollution allowances, "otherwise chemical companies will close down in Germany and will go to Abu Dhabi or other places."LiNeBrEaKU.S. opponents of mandatory limits on greenhouse gases have seized on these arguments as ammunition: Texas Rep. Joe Barton, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said last week, "As European nations attempt to deal with the hardships of the current economic crisis, the harsh reality of energy rationing schemes is hitting home."LiNeBrEaKBut Ned Helme, president of the Center for Clean Air Policy, said opponents of a U.S. carbon cap should not take too much heart from the squabbling in the European Union.LiNeBrEaK"The key thing to watch is whether the target is changing, and the answer is no," he said. "The fight in the E.U. is over who gets the money. Nobody is eroding that target. That's what counts in this debate."LiNeBrEaKResearch editor Alice Crites contributed to this report.

The Washington Post 	December 11, 2008 Thursday   Met 2 Edition	Nobel Physicist Chosen To Be Energy Secretary;  Browner, Two Others to Get Climate Posts 	Steven Mufson and Philip Rucker; Washington Post Staff Writers  	A-SECTION; Pg. A01  	1264 words  	President-elect Barack Obama has chosen Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who heads the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to be the next energy secretary, and he has picked veteran regulators from diverse backgrounds to fill three other key jobs on his environmental and climate-change team, Democratic sources said yesterday.LiNeBrEaKObama plans to name Carol M. Browner, Environmental Protection Agency administrator for eight years under President Bill Clinton, to fill a new White House post overseeing energy, environmental and climate policies, the sources said. Browner, a member of Obama's transition team, is a principal at the Albright Group.LiNeBrEaKObama has also settled on Lisa P. Jackson, recently appointed chief of staff to New Jersey Gov. Jon S. Corzine (D) and former head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, to head the EPA. Nancy Sutley, a deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, will chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality. LiNeBrEaKThe appointments suggest that Obama plans to make a strong push for measures to combat global warming and programs to support energy innovation. "I think it's a great team," said Daniel A. Lashof, director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "On policy, it's a dramatic contrast based on what I know about the policy direction that all these folks will be bringing to these positions."LiNeBrEaKObama has not yet settled on his choice to head the Interior Department, another key environmental post, and sources close to the transition indicated that several candidates remain under consideration. Barring any last-minute glitches, Obama plans to announce the appointments next week.LiNeBrEaKChu, the son of Chinese immigrants, won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1997 for his work in the "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light." But, in an interview last year with The Washington Post, Chu said he began to turn his attention to energy and climate change several years ago. "I was following it just as a citizen and getting increasingly alarmed," he said. "Many of our best basic scientists [now] realize that this is getting down to a crisis situation."LiNeBrEaKHe sought and won the top job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2004, leaving the Stanford University faculty to focus on energy issues. Chu was in London last night and unavailable for comment, but the physicist has been, in the words of his Web site, on a "mission" to make the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory "the world leader in alternative and renewable energy research, particularly the development of carbon-neutral sources of energy."LiNeBrEaKThe national laboratories fall under the Energy Department, whose budget is devoted largely to dealing with nuclear waste and materials from deactivated nuclear weapons, nuclear submarines and other reactors. But the department is also the conduit for funds that go to innovative energy technologies, including those designed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas.LiNeBrEaKBrowner, a lawyer and native of Florida, was legislative director for then-Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) and later head of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection under then-Gov. Lawton Chiles (D). As the top administrator at the EPA under Clinton, she pushed for tough air-pollution standards that the agency defended against industry lawsuits all the way to the Supreme Court, where the EPA prevailed. In her new role, Browner will need her legislative and administrative experience in a job that will cover everything from climate change to energy policy.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration faces an unusually big agenda in this area. The president-elect is expected to tackle cap-and-trade legislation that would put a lid on and then lower greenhouse gas emissions. European governments are expecting him to do that before a crucial climate-change summit a year from now. Meanwhile, energy industries and environmental groups are lobbying on issues such as offshore drilling restrictions, permits for coal plant construction and expansion, nuclear reactor permits and loan guarantees, and tax breaks for renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, the new administration has to figure out how to wield the power given to the EPA last year by a Supreme Court ruling that said carbon dioxide emissions should be considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act. How the EPA uses that power could determine the fate of all sorts of energy-intensive projects. Yesterday, the EPA said it would not finalize rules on new electricity-generating units, disappointing industry lobbyists and punting the issue to the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKAn African American native of New Orleans, Jackson grew up in the Ninth Ward, the poor and largely black neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Jackson's mother, stepfather and godmother fled the city as the 2005 storm approached. A few months later, in her swearing-in speech as New Jersey's environmental chief, Jackson said the devastation wrought by Katrina put her environmental work in a new perspective.LiNeBrEaK"My family escaped with their lives, but everything else -- their homes and possessions, even the family Bible -- was lost," Jackson said. "We were among the lucky ones."LiNeBrEaK"The shameful failures of government that the world witnessed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina have given me a special appreciation for the importance of public service," Jackson added. "Those failures have galvanized my commitment to working tirelessly to protect the health and safety of the people of New Jersey and to enhancing our quality of life."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists in New Jersey describe Jackson as a pragmatic but consistent ally who has pushed Corzine to adopt a greener stance during his time in office. In the summer of 2007, Corzine signed the Global Warming Response Act, an ambitious climate measure that pledges to cut the state's greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaK"Lisa Jackson played a very large role ensuring passage of that legislation, and helping ensure it was a priority of Governor Corzine," said Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of Environment New Jersey. "She's capable of making the case  . . . that deep reductions are possible."LiNeBrEaKDemocrats familiar with the incoming administration's thinking say Jackson's administrative skills were considered important for an agency they see as in "disarray" because of the Bush administration's record on environmental issues. Before moving to New Jersey, Jackson worked for the EPA in Washington.LiNeBrEaKSutley, who has a long record on environmental and natural resources policy, will head a group that has a very limited regulatory role and a small staff. But from its offices on Lafayette Square near the White House, Sutley could be a player in shaping the new administration's policies on climate change and the environment.LiNeBrEaKSutley, a top aide to Browner at the EPA dealing with air-pollution issues, supported Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries. She previously served in California as an energy adviser to then-Gov. Gray Davis (D) and as a member of the State Water Resources Control Board, where she was responsible for protecting water quality and resources throughout the nation's most populous state.LiNeBrEaKSutley, whose mother is from Argentina, identifies herself as a Latina. She was a member of the California Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender steering committee of Clinton's campaign and is the first openly gay nominee for a top job in the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKStaff writer Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report.

Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	EPA Pooh-Poohs 'Cow Tax' Concerns: Livestock groups worry that report on greenhouse gases could lead to taxes on cow flatulence.  	Bruce Daniels, Albuquerque Journal, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	395 words  	Dec. 10--Livestock officials are concerned that a highly technical Environmental Protection Agency report released last week on greenhouse gases could mean the government is considering a tax on air-polluting animals, such as flatulent cows, the Clovis News Journal reported. LiNeBrEaKEPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn told the News Journal, however, that those concerns are unfounded and the report does not include a proposal to tax livestock, the News Journal said.LiNeBrEaKMilbourn acknowledged, though, that one of the report's suggestions was to impose taxes or fees as an economic incentive to reduce greenhouse emissions, the paper reported.LiNeBrEaKCow flatulence is a source of methane gas, the News Journal said.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing has been specifically proposed by EPA, but the whole purpose of the advanced notice is to get people who could be affected to focus on it and say what the impact would be, and that's what we did," said Paul Schlegel, policy director for the Farm Bureau of America, one group that raised the alarm.LiNeBrEaKSchlegel said regulating agriculture for greenhouse gases could require livestock operations to pay for EPA permits that could cripple the cattle and dairy business, the News Journal said.LiNeBrEaKMilbourn said the EPA was seeking public input on several suggestions while devising a proposal to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but told the News Journal the agency does not have the authority to impose taxes.LiNeBrEaKThe more-than-500-page report, released last week, found that the agricultural industry accounted for 6. 4 percent of greenhouse gases emitted in 2006, while electrical generation was atop the list at 33 percent, the News Journal said.LiNeBrEaKNew Mexico State University dairy specialist Robert Hagevoort told the paper that the agriculture industry is environmentally neutral and should be exempt from emissions regulations, noting that while livestock does produce methane and carbon dioxide, crops absorb and convert those gases into energy.

The Anniston Star (Alabama)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	EDITORIAL: A tax that goes way too far  	The Anniston Star, Ala.  	COMMENTARY  	425 words  	Dec. 10--Regular readers of this page know that The Star has often spoken out against hog farms and other large animal-raising operations that attract flies, stink up neighborhoods and generally make life miserable for nearby residents. LiNeBrEaKReaders also know that this page was an early and often advocate of efforts to limit greenhouse gasses, which in turn would help control global warming.LiNeBrEaKHowever, there are moments when attempts to accomplish these two worthy goals promise to do more harm than good.LiNeBrEaKThis may be one.LiNeBrEaKApparently, there are folks in the Environmental Protection Agency who are considering a fee on cows and hogs that pollute the air with their belches and flatulence. That's right, since the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that such emissions amount to air pollution, EPA officials are talking about taxing large animal operations based on the number of bovines and swine they have. Estimates suggest that the fees being discussed could cost a medium-sized farm between $30,000 and $40,000 a year.LiNeBrEaKThere are those who believe this is not a serious proposal; it's apparent why. Although the EPA would tax-by-head, who can say whether one animal is more gaseous than another? And who would want to be told to find out?LiNeBrEaKThere also is the economic side. During these hard times, do we need to burden the producer -- and ultimately the consumer -- with regulations that would drive up the price of food and cost jobs in the process? Not hardly.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, the interest groups on both sides are marking their territory. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals "support making factory farms pay their fair share," though at this stage of the discussion just what is "fair" and fair to whom is not well defined. Nor is it clear what will be done with the money from the fees.LiNeBrEaKWhile those at the Alabama Farmers Federation's beef division suggest that the plan might be part of an effort to put cattle and hog farmers out of business, apart from the people at PETA there does not seem to be much support for doing that.LiNeBrEaKHere is another example of a half-baked idea getting out before it was fully baked.LiNeBrEaKBack into the oven for this one.

The Boston Globe 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   THIRD EDITION	Kerry says talks on climate must remain on track World leaders mull new treaty  	Lisa Wangsness Globe staff  	NATIONAL; Pg. A2  	575 words  	WASHINGTON - Senator John Kerry, who leaves today for international climate talks in Poznan, Poland, says that the outgoing Bush administration and the economic crisis facing the country should not impede progress toward negotiating a new international global warming agreement in Copenhagen next year. LiNeBrEaK"We need to keep it on track, we need to make sure that the slow pace of the [Bush] administration doesn't downgrade people's sense of possibility," he said in an interview in his office on Monday, as he prepared to join a congressional delegation at the Poznan talks today.LiNeBrEaKAfter meeting with former vice president Al Gore and Vice President-elect Joe Biden in Chicago yesterday to talk about climate change, President-elect Barack Obama endorsed an aggressive approach to concerted international action on global warming.LiNeBrEaK"All three of us are in agreement that the time for delay is over," Obama said. "The time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way. That is what I intend my administration to do."LiNeBrEaKWorld leaders are gathering in Poznan this week to create a successor treaty to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, in which dozens of nations, but not the United States, agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKIn Bali last year, nations set a goal of negotiating a successor to Kyoto, which expires in 2012, in Copenhagen in 2009. Delegates in Poznan are discussing ideas and setting a work schedule leading to Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaKThe economic crisis and the timing of the talks have dampened expectations for the conference. The sour economy may discourage wealthier nations from agreeing to help fund cleaner energy in developing countries. And the United States is being represented in Poznan by the Bush administration; Obama, who has promised to take strong action on climate change, has not sent representatives. Congress, meanwhile, is nowhere near agreement on how much the US could pledge to cut its emissions.LiNeBrEaKKert Davies, research director for Greenpeace, said the discussions had gotten off to a slow start and that he hoped Kerry's arrival would send "a strong signal that US senior leadership stands ready to help the world tackle global warming."LiNeBrEaKBut Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said she believed it would be "very challenging" at this point to reach a full and final agreement in Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaK"I agree it is worth trying, but at the same time, I think it's important to figure out how you can make enough progress in Copenhagen so you could complete it soon thereafter," she said.LiNeBrEaKKerry is not going to Poznan as a negotiator but rather as incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which would eventually have to approve any international treaty.LiNeBrEaK"It is critical, absolutely essential, that the United States show its bona fides on this issue and others immediately," he added.LiNeBrEaKIn the interview, Kerry said the US must commit to mandatory emission reductions. A critical question is how much: Environmentalists are calling for reductions of 25 percent to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, which the International Panel on Climate Change has said is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 5 degrees - the tipping-point temperature change the panel said would cause significant environmental and societal destruction.

Buffalo News (New York) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   CENTRAL EDITION	Everybody's Column  		VIEWPOINTS; Pg. A7  	1044 words  	&gt;Firms receiving bailouts should use U.S. suppliersLiNeBrEaKPrinting Industries Alliance is a trade association representing the graphic communications industry in New York State, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.LiNeBrEaKPIA is a supporter of free trade and is appreciative of the challenges involved in solving our national fiscal crisis. However, we ask our federal legislators to ensure that any bailout be conditioned upon keeping contracts between the company receiving assistance and its suppliers open only to companies within the United States. Several members have lost printing contracts because some automakers have chosen to contract with foreign firms. These companies have in turn been forced to lay off their workers and reorganize to salvage their businesses.LiNeBrEaKConsumers are demanding "greener autos." We find it ironic that U.S. printing firms have shown corporate responsibility by utilizing environmental sustainability within their operations and, as a "reward," have lost work to foreign firms in countries with proven records of contributing to global warming and disregard for the health and safety of their employees. The negative impact to the environment and the contradiction of sustainability policy is not worth what can be saved by purchasing overseas.

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Coal plant emissions in question  	Ken Ward Jr., The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	706 words  	Dec. 10--ROANOKE, W.Va. -- A New York firm wants to build a $3 billion coal-to-liquids plant in Mingo County, but has not yet come up with a firm plan to control the facility's carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKTransGas Development Systems LLC unveiled the project Tuesday at a news conference led by Gov. Joe Manchin during a break in the governor's second annual West Virginia Energy Summit at the Stonewall Resort. LiNeBrEaKAdam Victor, president of TransGas, said the plant would create 200 permanent jobs turning 8,500 tons of coal into 18,000 barrels of gasoline every day. TransGas hopes to be up and running by 2013 in the facility, proposed to be built in Mingo County's new energy park near Gilbert, officials said.LiNeBrEaKVictor told reporters the plant would be a "near-zero emissions facility," that would capture sulfur, mercury and other "regulated pollutants" before they go out a stack.LiNeBrEaKTransGas also plans to capture carbon dioxide emissions, but does not have a concrete plan for disposing of the gas that is most responsible for global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Whatever the permitting process tells us to do is what we'll do," Victor said, while conceding that federal and state laws place no limits on carbon dioxide emissions to the air.LiNeBrEaKVictor said his firm hopes to persuade the federal government to grant it a right of way to send carbon dioxide emissions through interstate pipelines to the Texas coast, where it could be pumped underground to help force out more oil and gas, and to be safely sequestered.LiNeBrEaKManchin has made luring liquid coal plants to West Virginia the top priority of his energy plan. Some scientists, energy experts and environmentalists say that without carbon dioxide controls, such plants could emit twice the greenhouse emissions of gasoline, generating carbon dioxide both when coal is turned into liquid fuel and when that liquid fuel is burned.LiNeBrEaK"Coal-to-liquid technology cannot reduce C02 emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels, but it could greatly increase those emissions," said the group Union of Concerned Scientists. "It should not, therefore, have any part in our energy future."LiNeBrEaKDuring a news conference here, Victor said similar proposals by his company for co-generation and liquid coal plants were opposed in New York by public officials and residents who "hijacked" environmental permitting reviews to advance their "NIMBY agenda."LiNeBrEaKVictor said his proposal has been embraced in West Virginia by Manchin and by the state Department of Environmental Protection, where TransGas has filed at least one permit application.LiNeBrEaKSens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller and Rep. Nick Rahall, all D-W.Va., and Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., issued statements to praise the TransGas proposal.LiNeBrEaK"This is the most exciting day ever for Mingo County," said Mike Whitt, executive director of the Mingo County Redevelopment Authority.LiNeBrEaKVictor praised Mingo County elected officials and the redevelopment authority, for helping to advance the project toward Tuesday's announcement.LiNeBrEaKManchin and Victor emphasized that the state would provide the project with no subsidies through direct taxpayer investment.LiNeBrEaK"We don't believe that energy projects need any subsidies from the state, so we seek and ask for no government subsidies or tax credits," Victor told reporters.LiNeBrEaKBut later, Manchin said that the project would be eligible for state tax credits and other subsidies that are available to any new project based on investment and job creation. For a company that spends $3 billion and creates several hundred jobs, subsidies could run into hundreds of millions of dollars.LiNeBrEaKVictor said his company would accept such subsidies "as long as it doesn't slow us down."LiNeBrEaKA rundown of the possible subsidies was not immediately released by the Manchin administration.LiNeBrEaKReach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or 348-1702.

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Manchin talks alternative energy while pushing coal  	Ken Ward Jr., The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	579 words  	Dec. 10--ROANOKE -- Gov. Joe Manchin promised again Tuesday that he would start to promote alternative energy sources, but provided no details of his plan and made two key announcements that showed his continued effort to focus on backing the coal industry.LiNeBrEaKManchin told an industry conference that he opposes President-elect Barack Obama's proposal to cap greenhouse gas emissions, and announced his plans to back construction of a $3 billion coal-to-liquids plant in Mingo County. LiNeBrEaK"Coal is the cornerstone fuel of the future," Manchin said during a speech that opened his second annual Energy Summit at Stonewall Resort.LiNeBrEaKManchin said he recently told Obama that the two were "not on the same page" regarding the president-elect's plan to demand major cuts in carbon dioxide emissions through a market-based "cap-and-trade" program.LiNeBrEaKThe governor said he doesn't doubt that global warming is a problem that needs attention, but that he fears proposals that would move too fast to tighten greenhouse gas output.LiNeBrEaK"I recognize that there's a problem," Manchin said. "People talk about, 'Is it manmade?' Well, it's manmade, and now it's time to make amends and fix it. But can you do it in a balanced way?"LiNeBrEaKManchin said he is working on a major package of energy legislation to be introduced as he starts his second four-year term early next year.LiNeBrEaKOver the last few months, the governor has repeatedly said his program would include the state developing a "very aggressive renewable energy portfolio." The phrase has led some in the energy industry to believe Manchin will push for West Virginia to adopt a "renewable portfolio standard," that requires utilities to get a certain share of the energy from wind, solar or other renewable sources.LiNeBrEaKBut the governor said he hasn't decided on that yet, and is continuing to review options with his aides and various outside experts and stakeholders.LiNeBrEaK"I think we may have to have some standards, but they have to be realistic," Manchin said.LiNeBrEaKManchin said he wants to listen to a broad array of advice before finalizing his energy proposals.LiNeBrEaKBut as did last year's energy summit, scheduled speakers for Tuesday's event included only industry officials and analysts, and industry partners from academia. No leaders of state or national environmental organizations that follow the impacts of energy policies were asked to offer their views.LiNeBrEaKManchin said he did not invite the speakers, and referred questions about that to Jeff Herholdt, director of the state Division of Energy. Last year, Herholdt said the summit agenda was too crowded to include environmentalists, but then added coal and gas industry lobbyists as luncheon speakers. This year, coal association and gas industry officials were again listed as luncheon speakers. Herholdt said he would make it a point to include environmental group speakers next year.LiNeBrEaK"We're working very hard and we will continue to," the governor said. "We're bringing in all sorts of people with differing views to talk about this."LiNeBrEaKReach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or 304-348-1702.

Chicago Tribune (Illinois)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Obama assembles his environmental team  	By Jim Tankersley, Chicago Tribune  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	659 words  	WASHINGTON _ President-elect Barack Obama will tap Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu as his energy secretary and former New Jersey environmental protection commissioner Lisa Jackson as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, a senior Democrat said Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Carol Browner, a former EPA administrator, will serve as a high-level coordinator on energy issues, reporting to the president. LiNeBrEaKThe three incoming officials will help form the backbone of a team responsible for carrying out what Obama has repeatedly indicated will be an ambitious environmental agenda. They will be joined by Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor whom Obama plans to name as the head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, and a still-to-be-named interior secretary.LiNeBrEaKThe three newly designated officials bring experience working on climate change. Chu is the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a government research lab in California that under his tenure has focused on alternative energy research and has pushed efforts to boost energy efficiency in buildings.LiNeBrEaKThe son of Chinese immigrants, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for "development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light."LiNeBrEaKJackson worked 16 years at the EPA before joining New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, which she was chosen to run in 2006. She also served on the board of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade effort among Northeast states.LiNeBrEaKObama had picked her after the election to advise him on energy and natural resource issues during the transition.LiNeBrEaKBrowner headed the EPA under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, making her the agency's longest-serving director. She currently works as the consultant for the Albright Group and is leading Obama's energy and environment transition team. She also sits on the boards of the National Audubon Society and Alliance for Climate Protection, among other environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists praised the choices and said they underscored Obama's commitment to fast action on renewable fuel development and carbon emissions reduction.LiNeBrEaK"These are win-win-wins, and wins for the environment," said Frances Beinecke, president of the National Resources Defense Council. She said the creation of a Browner's position "clearly demonstrates that leadership is going to come from the White House" on alternative energy.LiNeBrEaKA leading oil industry group offered no criticism of the appointments.LiNeBrEaK"We look forward to working with all the Obama appointees to come up with a comprehensive, fact-based and realistic energy policy that will benefit the American people," said Karen Matusic, a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute.LiNeBrEaKThe massive economic stimulus package Obama is preparing will likely include major investments in alternative energy development.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect met with former Vice President Al Gore this week to discuss climate change and declared afterward: "The time for denial is over. We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way. That is what I intend my administration to do."LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday, Obama will formally introduce former Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., as his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, a Democratic official confirmed. At a Chicago news conference, the president-elect will also introduce other members of his health-care team.

Clovis News Journal (New Mexico)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Official: "Cow tax" reports unfounded  	Gabriel Monte, Clovis News Journal, N.M.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	608 words  	Dec. 10--Livestock officials are concerned the federal government is considering charging fees for air-polluting animals.LiNeBrEaKThey contend the "cow tax" is a possible consequence of a highly technical Environmental Protection Agency report released last week on greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKEPA Spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn said the concerns are unfounded and the report does not include a proposal to tax livestock. However, one of the suggestions was to impose taxes or fees as an economic incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKCow flatulence is a source of methane gas.LiNeBrEaK"Nothing has been specifically proposed by EPA," said Paul Schlegel, policy director for the Farm Bureau of America, "but the whole purpose of the advanced notice is to get people who could be affected to focus on it and say what the impact would be, and that's what we did."LiNeBrEaKSchlegel said regulating the agricultural industry for greenhouse gases could require livestock operations to pay for EPA permits that could cripple the cattle and dairy industries.LiNeBrEaKUsing figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Farm Bureau of America estimated a livestock emission tax based on costs from other businesses that create greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe results are estimated charges of $175 per milk cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and upward of $20 for each hog.LiNeBrEaKSchlegel said concerned famers should pay close attention to future discussions regarding the policy.LiNeBrEaKCurry County dairy farmer Albin Smith said he hasn't heard much of the cow tax issue, but thinks what he has heard is ridiculous.LiNeBrEaK"If they're going to tax us on something, I want it to be based on sound science," he said. "There's no science to this whatsoever."LiNeBrEaKTasked with devising a proposal to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, the EPA sought public input on several suggestions in advance notice of the proposed rulemaking document, according to Milbourn. A 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling deemed greenhouse gases pollutants. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and methane.LiNeBrEaKMilbourn said the EPA does not have the authority to impose taxes.LiNeBrEaKThe more than 500-page EPA document released last week mentions the agricultural industry accounted for 6. 4 percent of the total greenhouse gases in the country in 2006. Electricity generation was tops at 33 percent.LiNeBrEaKNew Mexico State University dairy specialist Robert Hagevoort said he doesn't think the EPA is proposing a cow tax, but understands how the interpretation could be made.LiNeBrEaKHagevoort said the agriculture industry is environmentally neutral and should be exempt from emissions regulations. While livestock does produce methane and carbon dioxide, crops absorb and convert those gases into energy.LiNeBrEaK"It's nature at its best," he said.LiNeBrEaKThere are about 250 dairy farms in the eastern New Mexico and West Texas area, which have an economic impact of about $30 million a month in Curry and Roosevelt counties, according to Walter Bradley, business and government director of Dairy Farmers of America. An average dairy farm contains about 2,000 head of cattle, he said.LiNeBrEaKMilbourn said the agency is still at the starting point of coming up with a proposal and a time frame for the next steps is not set.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Berkeley labs chief nominated as energy secretary  	By Suzanne Bohan Contra Costa Times  	NEWS; Local  	633 words  	President-elect Barack Obama intends to nominate Nobel laureate Steve Chu, the visionary director of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, as his energy secretary, Democratic officials reported Wednesday.LiNeBrEaKThere's been buzz for weeks among employees at the national laboratory, perched in the hills above UC Berkeley, that their chief was on the short list of candidates for the post.LiNeBrEaKSince taking over as director of the laboratory in August 2004, Chu has pushed the lab to focus on developing new carbon-neutral sources of energy and on climate change, said Robert Birgeneau, chancellor of UC Berkeley. LiNeBrEaK"He has been relentless about addressing the technical challenges of renewable energy in a deep way," said Birgeneau, who has known Chu since the two men both worked at Bell Laboratories three decades ago.LiNeBrEaK"We will now have an energy policy that can mean the U.S. will have a chance of obtaining energy self-sufficiency through new technology," Birgeneau said.LiNeBrEaKChu played a leading role in Berkeley being selected by BP PLC as the home of a $500 million research program to develop a new generation of renewable fuels. That program wasn't without controversy, however; some faculty, students and community groups expressed alarm that such a corporate presence could taint academic freedom on campus.LiNeBrEaKObama is expected to name his main energy and environmental candidates this week or next, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement. Cabinet selections are subject to confirmation by the Senate.LiNeBrEaKLab spokesman Paul Preuss said Chu is well-suited to meet the energy policy goals established by Obama   that of shedding dependence on foreign oil and investing $150 billion in 10 years to promote alternative and renewable energy sources to improve national security, reduce the threat of global warming, and create millions of green energy jobs.LiNeBrEaKThe Berkeley lab's programs for developing energy-efficient buildings and more powerful batteries got a boost under Chu's direction, said Preuss. Chu is also pushing ahead with the lab's work in other disciplines, including cancer research, photon science, astrophysics and high-performance computing.LiNeBrEaKIn 1997, Chu shared the Nobel Prize in physics, for work he conducted while at Bell Laboratories. He's also former chairman of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKObama's pending nomination of Chu to head the energy department reflects the president-elect's campaign pledge to put a greater emphasis on science when crafting policies to shift the U.S. economy into one fueled by many more low-carbon energy sources.LiNeBrEaKIn the Obama administration, Chu will have to work closely with a new White House council that will coordinate energy and climate policy among the various federal agencies.LiNeBrEaKFormer Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner is the leading contender to head that panel, according to a source close to the Obama transition team.

Chu wasn't immediately available for comment; he out of the country on travel.LiNeBrEaK"We don't really have anything official to say until we hear from the president-elect and his team," said the spokesman, Paul Preuss.LiNeBrEaKBut Preuss noted that Chu is well-suited to meet the energy policy goals established by Obama -- that of shedding dependence on foreign oil and investing billions in alternative and renewable energy sources to improve national security, reduce the threat of global warming, and create millions of green energy jobs.LiNeBrEaKSince his arrival at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2004, Preuss said Chu has jump-started numerous clean energy research initiatives.LiNeBrEaK"When he came here in 2004, one of the first things he announced is that he was bringing scientists from a number of different divisions and disciplines to focus their energy on creating clean fuels," Preuss said.LiNeBrEaKIn the years since, he's spearheaded numerous programs which have,LiNeBrEaKat their essence, the goal of establishing the Berkeley lab as a leader in alternative and renewable energy research, touts the lab's Web site.LiNeBrEaKChu shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics and is also a former chairman of the physics department at Stanford University.LiNeBrEaKIn the Obama administration, Chu will have to work closely with a new White House council that would coordinate energy and climate policy among the various federal agencies.LiNeBrEaKFormer Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner is the leading contender to head that panel, according to a source close to the Obama transition team.LiNeBrEaKWire services contributed to this report.

The Denver Post 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	Timing is everything  	Al Knight Denver Post Columnist  	Pg. B-11  	567 words  	President-elect Barack Obama has demonstrated a phenomenal skill in political stagecraft, but he picked a bad time to discuss global warming with Al Gore, a prominent hysteric on the subject.LiNeBrEaKYesterday's meeting was scheduled in Chicago just hours after federal agents arrested Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, on corruption charges.LiNeBrEaKAuthorities made available the contents of wiretaps that show the governor and his assistant talking about ways to enrich themselves through a variety of public acts, including the appointment of Obama's successor in the U.S. Senate. LiNeBrEaKIt is fair to say the contents of the wiretaps rival in profanity and greed anything ever recorded during the reign of Richard Nixon.LiNeBrEaKThe indictment is a stark reminder that politics in Illinois isn't entirely about hope or change. Behind every political alliance, there may be opportunity for corruption and the misuse of public office.LiNeBrEaKIf there is a blessing in the timing of these events, it is that the public might be spared additional alarms from Gore about the imminent demise of the planet.LiNeBrEaKObama has said quite recently that even though the U.S. economy is in bad shape, he intends to stand by his earlier statements that global warming is a major threat that demands a response.LiNeBrEaKOne can only hope that this is one policy area where Obama will prove to be as flexible as he has in, say, the timetable to end the war in Iraq. Now is a terrible time to be fretting about global warming.LiNeBrEaKFirst, there is an ongoing dispute over how much it is warming and why. It is a fiction that the fuels that provide 85 percent of America's energy needs - oil, coal and natural gas - can be quickly replaced with alternative energy. It would therefore be insane to foreclose domestic oil drilling and resist either coal-fired or nuclear power plants while wishing for something else.LiNeBrEaKFew people question the need to develop alternative forms of energy, but the search for new sources need not begin with the abandonment of those forms that currently fuel the U.S. economy.LiNeBrEaKIn a related matter, there is something almost poetic about the fact that the very people who have been beating up on the nation's auto companies for a couple of decades now want to save them.LiNeBrEaKThe nation's airways are littered with special interest commercials decrying the burning of coal and gasoline and declaring carbon emissions to be the enemy of the Earth. And yet the nation's Big 3 automakers are said to be deserving of a rescue?LiNeBrEaKThe Democrats in Congress would have the public believe that the automakers should be saved at public expense so that they can, under federal direction, make "cleaner" and "greener" cars. Face it: The Democrats don't care about the auto companies. They certainly don't care about the executives, the stockholders or the bondholders. What they care about is paying back a group of supporters who helped produce election victories.LiNeBrEaKThey empathically don't want to start a new administration in Washington, one that is supposed to usher in a new era for organized labor, with the very public layoffs of thousands of United Auto Workers in the Midwest. That is why heaven and Earth will be moved to forestall that event. The war on carbon will just have to wait.LiNeBrEaKAl Knight of Buena Vista (alknight@mindspring.com) is a former member of The Post's editorial-page staff. His column appears twice a month.

Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	It's lights out for this tradition  	Terry Dickson  	Terry Dickson; Pg. B-1  	495 words  	TOWNSEND, Ga. - Georgia will be a little dimmer this Christmas because the lights aren't on in one little corner.LiNeBrEaKFor the first time in years, many Townsend residents aren't decorating their homes, trees and any immobile object with Christmas lights. LiNeBrEaKIt wasn't the economy, global warming or those other things that lead the newscasts. It's just that some people got sick or old, lost loved ones or just needed a rest.LiNeBrEaKOnce a year, the neighbors were amazing overachievers, turning this McIntosh County community into a mini-version of Las Vegas without the underlayer of crud.LiNeBrEaKBy day, the sun shone on a collection of modest dwellings, mobile homes, sheds and dog pens, the kind of place hard-working people live. But on nights between Thanksgiving and New Year's, the place lit up like, well, a Christmas tree. The residents strung lights everywhere, promoting anything with limbs - from an oak to a rose bush - to a Christmas tree. Lights dripped from eaves, twink-led from mailboxes, twined around porch posts. If a pickup truck wouldn't crank, it could at least glow.LiNeBrEaKOn a foggy night, the sky above the little side road that carried traffic through the community glowed like the Eulonia Borealis. Those who couldn't drive at night could in Townsend. You wonder if astronauts looked down from the space shuttle and said, "What the ... ?''LiNeBrEaKNobody said it was time to stop, but Glenda Davis said dark gaps began developing. She doesn't light her own house and yard, but decorates for her father and mother, Harlis and Iona Ryals, since her dad had knee surgery.LiNeBrEaKBecause, like her mother always said, "It's not Christmas without them.''LiNeBrEaKThe Ryals family, one of Townsend's linchpin clans, weren't the only ones to decorate. Everyone did. Now you wonder who was the first to blink.LiNeBrEaKWith no play on words intended, Nellie Ryals said, "I think everybody was getting kind of burned out.''LiNeBrEaKPerhaps because of gas prices, traffic thinned in recent years and Nellie Ryals wondered if it was worth all the work if people weren't coming. So maybe it was time for a break.LiNeBrEaKThat break will put a few hundred bucks back in some pockets this Christmas. She figures her power bill jumped about $225 a month during lighting season. Maybe that's why some folks call it the light bill.LiNeBrEaKAnd some lights have gone out in Nellie Ryals' life. She lost her husband, J.L. Ryals, and her father, J.F. Willis.LiNeBrEaKLike most husbands, hers grumbled throughout the whole process. Then he'd back off bathed in the glow of his and Thomas Edison's work. A lot of people enjoyed that view, inching down the road bumper-to-bumper in this little place 10 miles and two left turns from nowhere with a backseat full of open-mouthed, wide-eyed kids.LiNeBrEaKThat's what made it worth the dozens of trips up the ladder, the light bills and the gridlock.LiNeBrEaK"The biggest joy," she said, "was standing out in your yard and hear young and old alike just gasp and others say, 'Thank you.'

The Houston Chronicle (Texas)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Nobel physicist Steven Chu in line for energy post  	David Ivanovich, Houston Chronicle  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	340 words  	Dec. 10--WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama is expected to nominate Nobel Prize-winning physicist Steven Chu to become the nation's next energy secretary. LiNeBrEaKObama also is poised to select Lisa Jackson to head the Environmental Protection Agency, while one-time EPA administrator Carol Browner would serve in the White House as an overall energy "czar." Jackson worked at the EPA during Browner's tenure, and is former administrator of  the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.LiNeBrEaKThe selection of a scientist rather than a Washington insider as energy secretary suggests that in the Obama administration, energy policy will be directed out of the White House rather than the Energy Department.LiNeBrEaKFrank Maisano, a Washington-based energy specialist with Bracewell and Giuliani, said Obama has selected "capable, bright people" who will be "solid managers at EPA and the the Department of Energy."LiNeBrEaK"But it also underscores the high profile the White House will play in energy policy within its own walls," Maisano said.LiNeBrEaKChu has served for the last four years as director of the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.LiNeBrEaKHe was an early advocate of finding scientific solutions to combat climate change, according to the Berkeley Lab Web site. And during his tenure there, he has worked to make the Berkeley facility a world leader in alternative and renewable energy research, particularly with the development of carbon-neutral energy sources.LiNeBrEaKIn 1997, Chu shared the Nobel Prize in physics for his work to develop methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light.LiNeBrEaKdavid.ivanovich@chron.com	ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (92%); NOBEL PRIZES (91%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (91%); ENERGY REGULATION (90%); AWARDS and PRIZES (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); PHYSICS (89%); US PRESIDENTS (78%); ENERGY RESEARCH (77%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (77%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (77%); RESEARCH (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE (72%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (72%); TEST LABORATORIES (71%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (62%); BRACEWELL and GIULIANI LLP (55%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%)  		Lifestyle  	CALIFORNIA, USA (79%); NEW JERSEY, USA (71%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Houston Chronicle   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARACK OBAMA (95%)  	20081210-HO-Nobel-physicist-Steven-Chu-in-line-for-energy-post-1210  	HO  												
The Houston Chronicle 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	Airports landing more protests;  Officials say anti-terror efforts at risk as activists enjoy publicity 	RAPHAEL SATTER, Associated Press  	A; Pg. 19  	520 words  	LONDON - Protesters stormed the tarmac at one of Britain's busiest airports, shut down two airports in Thailand and invaded a runway in Athens - and some experts see a worrisome pattern. LiNeBrEaKIn the post-9/11 era, protests at sensitive international airports have become an effective way to rattle nerves and publicize causes.LiNeBrEaKPhilip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, said there was an "increasing trend for demonstrators to shut down airports."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental action group Plane Stupid targeted Stansted Airport, northeast of London, in the most recent protest, cutting through its perimeter fence Monday.LiNeBrEaKPolice said Tuesday they had charged 49 people with aggravated trespass, which carries a three-month sentence.LiNeBrEaKLast month, a massive group of Thai anti-government protesters invaded Bangkok's two main airports, stranding more than 300,000 travelers and paralyzing the tourism industry. For the protesters, the siege ended in triumph: A Thai court last week ordered the dissolution of the ruling People's Power Party for electoral fraud.LiNeBrEaKThe Stansted demonstrators - speaking to British media during the protests - said they had Heathrow, Europe's biggest airport by passenger volume, in their sights.LiNeBrEaKWide variety of motivesLiNeBrEaK"There is a lot of drama at airports," said Philip Butterworth-Hayes, founding editor of Jane's Airport Review, explaining that their visibility and vulnerability make them ideal places to push a political agenda.LiNeBrEaKIn Greece, Olympic Airlines employees upset over plans to privatize the state-owned carrier repeatedly walked onto the runway at Athens International Airport earlier this year.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, climate change protesters have targeted the airline industry, which they claim contributes disproportionately to carbon emissions and global warming.LiNeBrEaKIn September 2006 Plane Stupid activists blocked the runway at East Midlands Airport in central England for several hours; in October 2007 they handcuffed themselves to check-in desks in Manchester.LiNeBrEaKEarlier this year five Greenpeace activists clambered onto a plane at Heathrow.LiNeBrEaKIn Britain, stunts like a protest camp outside Heathrow in 2007 have helped push the issue of jet pollution to the top of the government agenda, said Tim Johnson, director of the activist group Aviation Environment Federation.LiNeBrEaKHe said it made sense for climate protesters to target airports.LiNeBrEaKBut he acknowledged that direct action like the one at Stansted - videos of which were posted online by Plane Stupid almost immediately - might inspire copycat tactics from other groups with very different agendas.LiNeBrEaKSecurity costs escalateLiNeBrEaKProtests undermine safety by distracting security workers from the more serious threat of terrorism and by forcing airlines to pour more money into perimeter defense, said Butterworth-Hayes.LiNeBrEaK"The amount of time and money you'd have to put into perimeter security is enormous," he said. "Some airports are spending 40 percent of their entire budget on security, and that number is going to go up."LiNeBrEaKThe additional cost would "undoubtedly" be paid for by the traveling public, said Norman Shanks, a U.K.-based aviation security consultant.

The Houston Chronicle 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   3 STAR R.O. EDITION	U.S. students' progress in science stagnates;  But survey finds notable increases in math scores 	Washington Post  	A; Pg. 4  	461 words  	U.S. students are doing no better on an international science exam than they were a decade ago, a plateau in performance that leaves educators and policymakers worried about how schools are preparing students to compete in an increasingly global economy. LiNeBrEaKResults of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, released Tuesday, show how fourth- and eighth-graders in the U.S. measure up to peers in dozens of countries. U.S. students showed gains in math at both grades. But average science performance, although still stronger than in many countries, has stagnated since 1995.LiNeBrEaKStudents in Singapore, China and Japan outperformed U.S. fourth-graders in science. So did students in the Chinese region of Hong Kong. The U.S. students had an average score of 539 out of 1,000, higher than peers in 25 countries.LiNeBrEaKIn eighth grade, students in nine countries earned higher average scores than their U.S. counterparts. Singapore topped the list with an average score of 567, with China, Japan, South Korea, England, Hungary and Russia among the countries where students earned higher marks. The average score in the United States was 520.LiNeBrEaK"We need to pay attention to the results. We're just static, and other countries are improving," said Francis Eberle, executive director of the Arlington-based National Science Teachers Association. "Whether it's global warming, energy production or conservation or homeland security, people need to be able to understand enough to make decisions as a citizen."LiNeBrEaKThe TIMSS tests, administered every four years since 1995, were taken last year by a sampling of students in the United States and more than 50 other countries. In the United States, more than 20,000 students in nearly 500 public and private schools participated.LiNeBrEaKToday's scores renewed the call to bolster science and math classes in the nation's schools by increasing the ranks of well-prepared teachers and providing other supports.LiNeBrEaK"While it's good news that fourth-graders have made significant gains in math, it's troubling that our students are still behind their international peers in both math and science - fields that are key to our country's economic vitality," said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.LiNeBrEaKHIGHER MATHLiNeBrEaKU.S. strides in mathematics were significant.LiNeBrEaK11-point hop: The average score among fourth-graders has jumped 11 points since 1995, to 529. But students in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Japan, Russia and England were among those posting a higher average. Hong Kong topped the list with an average score of 607.LiNeBrEaKBetter than 37: Eighth-graders earned a higher score than in '95 and bested peers in 37 countries.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Auto bailout deals blow to California air-quality efforts  	By Rob Hotakainen, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	519 words  	WASHINGTON _ Jobs took priority over the environment Wednesday on Capitol Hill.LiNeBrEaKAfter getting ensnared with an effort to give a $15 billion bailout to the automobile industry, California's air-quality standards took yet another blow when congressional Democrats tried to sidestep a fight with the White House. LiNeBrEaKDemocrats abandoned a plan that would have barred car companies from pursuing lawsuits against California and other states that want to implement tougher tailpipe emission standards.LiNeBrEaKBackers of California's efforts wanted to attach the plan to the bailout bill, but opponents said it would further hurt the profitability of car manufacturers. The White House threatened to veto the bill if Democrats wouldn't yield.LiNeBrEaKUnder the Federal Clean Air Act, California has the right to set its own vehicle-emissions standards but needs a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency to do so. The White House consistently has opposed the waiver, angering environmentalists and California lawmakers.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Senate's committee on the environment, said car manufacturers "should embrace the waiver" instead of fighting California, but she's expecting President-elect Barack Obama to sign it and does not want Congress to address it now.LiNeBrEaK"My own view is at a time like this, with _ with unemployment wreaking havoc in our country, this is not the time to jeopardize 3 million jobs," she told reporters Monday at a news conference. "By the way, those of you who are from California, 200,000 jobs are directly related to the Big Three."LiNeBrEaKThe language prohibiting lawsuits against California was included in the bailout bill as of late Tuesday night. A high-ranking Democratic aide who is close to the negotiations between Congress and the White House, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the aide wasn't authorized to talk about the bill publicly, said it was removed when it became clear the president wouldn't sign the bill.LiNeBrEaKThe aide said Democrats ultimately decided the matter was largely symbolic because Obama is backing the California waiver and is likely to approve it early next year.LiNeBrEaKDemocratic Rep. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, said the proposed auto bailout offered an opportunity to get California's waiver approved. And he said that auto companies need to stop litigating against states that want to improve air quality.LiNeBrEaKMarkey said that recovery for the automobile industry should require "a change of culture, a culture that answers challenges with innovation rather than lobbying and litigation." Markey authored legislation that resulted in the current fuel economy standards of at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	White House backs down on easing air-pollution rules  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	908 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Bush administration on Wednesday abandoned efforts to relax pollution controls on coal-fired power plants and industries it started with Vice President Dick Cheney's energy plan in 2001, bringing to a sudden end a long White House fight with environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKHowever, the Environmental Protection Agency also finalized a third rule that would allow for more polluted dust from mines, animal farms and other sources. LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental and health groups and state and local air quality officials opposed the two rules that the administration dropped. One of them would have permitted coal-fired power plants and industries to increase their emissions without adding pollution controls. The other would've made it easier to build power plants and factories near national parks and other pristine protected areas.LiNeBrEaKUtilities had argued for the changes for years, saying that they needed to be able to increase their efficiency at the lowest possible cost.LiNeBrEaKThe EPA didn't issue a news release to explain the decision, but spokesman Jonathan Shradar confirmed it. He said there wasn't enough time to complete the action on relaxing the rules before the Bush administration ended.LiNeBrEaKJohn Walke, a former EPA attorney who's now with the Natural Resources Defense Council and who'd argued that the two rules would have been unlawful and destructive, said in a statement that he was glad they were dropped.LiNeBrEaK"We can look forward as a civilized society to tackling the critical problems of global warming, smog and soot pollution that continues to damage our health, and toxic mercury that contaminates our waters," Walke said.LiNeBrEaKThe rule that the EPA announced that it would finalize was "nasty," but not as destructive as the other two, Walke said. It was designed so that what the EPA calls "fugitive emissions" _ those that don't flow through smokestacks _ could be excluded from consideration in decisions about whether a facility is big enough to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, he said. "It's designed to exempt mines and factory farms, by and large, from Clean Air permitting programs."LiNeBrEaKIt was the two rules, however, that were dropped that were among some of the most significant changes the administration had been seeking of environmental regulations. Some EPA officials had argued privately within the agency against them. Environmental, public health and state and local air quality officials had sent comments to the EPA urging it to drop them. Even so, lawmakers and nonprofit groups who opposed them didn't expect they'd be suddenly abandoned.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, welcomed the decision. "Our children and families can breathe easier now that the EPA has abandoned two controversial plans to undermine clean air protections through midnight regulations," she said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKOne of the abandoned rules would have changed the way pollution is measured from annually to hourly. The Clean Air Act requires older plants that have their lives extended with new equipment to install pollution-control technology if their emissions increase.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists said the rule change would have allowed plants to run for more hours without triggering the requirement for additional pollution controls.LiNeBrEaKJeffrey Holmstead, who headed the EPA's air program from 2001 to 2005, said it wasn't true that overall pollution would have increased if the rules had gone into effect because an existing regulation sets a declining cap.LiNeBrEaK"I think it's disappointing that they didn't go forward with these rules, and unfortunately it really means that there is going to be continued uncertainty. What it really means as a practical matter is that power plants, rather than just having engineers who are trying to figure out how to make them as efficient as possible, they're going to continue to have teams of lawyers look at every project to make sure they don't run afoul of the EPA's regulations," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe power industry would shut down some smaller plants because they're not used enough to justify an investment in new equipment, Holmstead said.LiNeBrEaKFrank O'Donnell, head of the watchdog group Clean Air Watch, which opposed the rule changes the administration and utilities were seeking, said the news was mixed.LiNeBrEaK"The Bush administration saw the handwriting on the wall _ realizing the Obama administration would throw those two high-profile rules into the regulatory trash can. But they still put out a rule that will mean more dirty air."LiNeBrEaKMark Wenzler of the National Parks Conservation Association said citizens, members of Congress, the National Park Service and EPA scientists all were "expressing outrage" about the rule change that would have eased the way for power plants near national parks and wilderness areas.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	EPA won't loosen air-pollution standards for coal plants  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	396 words  	WASHINGTON _ The Bush administration Wednesday abandoned two rule changes that would have weakened controls on pollution from coal-fired power plants and industry, but it finalized a third to allow for more polluted dust from mines, animal farms and other sources. LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental and health groups and state and local air-quality officials opposed the two rules that the administration dropped. One of them would have permitted coal-fired power plants and industries to increase their emissions without adding pollution controls. The other would have made it easier to build power plants and factories near national parks and other pristine protected areas.LiNeBrEaKUtilities had argued for the changes for years, saying that they needed to be able to increase their efficiency at the lowest possible cost.LiNeBrEaKEPA officials said they opted not to loosen the regulations because they didn't have sufficient time to complete the action before the Bush administration ended.LiNeBrEaKJohn Walke, a former EPA attorney who's now with the Natural Resources Defense Council and who'd argued that the two rules would have been unlawful and destructive, said he was encouraged that the administration wasn't going to push them through at the end of President George W. Bush's term.LiNeBrEaK"With the barbarians at the gate having pulled up their tents and headed for the hills, we can look forward as a civilized society to tackling the critical problems of global warming, smog and soot pollution that continues to damage our health, and toxic mercury that contaminates our waters," Walke said in a statement.LiNeBrEaKThe rule the EPA announced that it would finalize was "nasty" but not as destructive as the other two, Walke said. It was designed so that what the EPA calls "fugitive emissions" _ those that don't flow through smokestacks _ could be excluded from consideration in decisions about whether a facility is big enough to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, he said. "It's designed to exempt mines and factory farms, by and large, from Clean Air permitting programs."

Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	EMBARGOED FOR MIDNIGHT  	Andy Mead, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	699 words  	Dec. 10--Americans could be getting 15 percent of their transportation fuel from coal by 2030, but making that happen will require a kick-start by the federal government, a new study says.LiNeBrEaKThe study, released Wednesday by Rand Corp., is being greeted with skepticism by two people who often disagree on coal issues: Tom FitzGerald, executive director of the Kentucky Resources Council; and Bill Caylor, president of the Kentucky Coal Association.LiNeBrEaKBoth said a better way to wean the nation from dependence of foreign oil is placing more emphasis on batteries for plug-in hybrid vehicles that recharge at night, when demand for coal-produced electricity is low. LiNeBrEaKThe Rand Corp. is a non-profit research organization that often studies energy issues. The main author of the report is James Bartis, a senior policy analyst who testified before the Kentucky General Assembly last year.LiNeBrEaKThe 200-page study said that the technology already exists to make liquid fuel from coal, but an industry has been slow starting in this country because of financial and environmental uncertainties.LiNeBrEaK"The prospects for developing an economically viable CTL industry in the United States is promising," the report says.LiNeBrEaKThe financial uncertainties include the cost of building plants to convert coal to liquid fuel, and the future course of world crude oil prices.LiNeBrEaKA major environmental concern is whether and how greenhouse gases will be controlled.LiNeBrEaKWithout "effective measures," to capture emissions from liquid coal, a coal-to-liquid industry could double the amount of carbon being put into the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKThe only practical way currently available to capture carbon is to pump it into oil fields to increase oil production.LiNeBrEaKThe study says, however, that carbon sequestration technology, storing carbon deep underground, is advancing.LiNeBrEaKOf potential note in Kentucky, a coal-producing state, is an increase in mining to produce liquid fuels. That increase could range from "minimal" to 50 percent by 2030, the study said.LiNeBrEaKThe study said that the ecological effects of mining are mitigated in part by federal and state laws and regulations, but is said that "residual impacts of mining activities can still adversely change the landscape, the local ecology and water quality."LiNeBrEaKThat's only one of the things that Doug Doerrfeld, a board member for the environmental group Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, find wrong with using coal to make transportation fuel.LiNeBrEaKHe also pointed out that, after the oil embargoes of the 1970s, the federal government put billions of dollars into developing a synthetic fuels industry that never got off the ground.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see anything new here at all," Doerrfeld said Tuesday. "They want billions of dollars of tax money to be put in this scheme because private capital won't do it."LiNeBrEaKDoerrfeld also questioned whether there are enough coal reserves to meet the nation's future energy needs. The study says there are.LiNeBrEaKThe federal government could take a hands-off approach to the coal-to-liquid energy, or can invest heavily, the study says.LiNeBrEaKIt recommends a middle approach, called an "insurance policy."LiNeBrEaKThat would include sharing the costs of a few site-specific studies of new plants to assess the risk, using federal incentives to get production started, and conducting multiple large-scale demonstrations of ways to deal with carbon. If the price of crude oil went very high, the federal government would get some of its money back.LiNeBrEaKA plant that would produce 40,000 barrels of fuel a day would cost between $4 billion and $5 billion, the report said. For the fuel it produces to be competitive, the price of a barrel of crude oil would have to be $55 to $70.LiNeBrEaKThe price of crude was well under that on Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKReach Andy Mead at (859) 231-3319 or 1-800-950-6397, Ext. 3319.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   01 EDITION	AIRPORT PROTEST   Analysts see    worrying trend  	RAPHAEL SATTER, Associated Press Writer  	A; Pg. 10  	454 words  	AIRPORT PROTESTLiNeBrEaKAnalysts seeLiNeBrEaKworrying trendLiNeBrEaKBy RAPHAEL SATTERLiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKLONDON - Protesters stormed the tarmac at one of Britain's busiest airports, shut down two airports in Thailand and invaded a runway in Athens - and some experts see a worrisome pattern. LiNeBrEaKIn the post 9/11 era, protests at sensitive international airports have become an effective way to rattle nerves and publicize causes.LiNeBrEaKPhilip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, said there was an "increasing trend for demonstrators to shut down airports."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental action group Plane Stupid targeted Stansted Airport, northeast of London, in the most recent protest, cutting through its perimeter fence Monday and briefly knocking out Britain's third-busiest airport.LiNeBrEaKPolice said Tuesday they had charged 49 people with aggravated trespass - which, at worst, carries a three-month sentence.LiNeBrEaKLast month, a massive group of Thai anti-government protesters invaded Bangkok's two main airports, leaving more than 300,000 travelers stranded and paralyzing the nation's tourism industry.LiNeBrEaKFor the protesters, the airport siege ended in triumph: A Thai court last week ordered the dissolution of the ruling People's Power Party for electoral fraud.LiNeBrEaKIt was too early to tell whether the Thai protest would inspire others elsewhere, but, in Britain at least, activists vowed to keep up the pressure on the country's airports.LiNeBrEaKThe Stansted demonstrators - speaking to British media during the protests - said they had Heathrow, Europe's biggest airport by passenger volume, in their sights.LiNeBrEaKOne industry-watcher said that was no idle threat.LiNeBrEaK"This is not the last we'll see of them," said David Learmount, of industry journal Flight International.LiNeBrEaKHe didn't seen any direct danger from the early morning raid, but said the media attention drawn by an airport incursion was hard to resist.LiNeBrEaKIn Greece, Olympic Airlines employees upset over plans to privatize the state-owned carrier repeatedly walked onto the runway at Athens International Airport earlier this year, disrupting flights.LiNeBrEaKTerrorists have long seen airports as a target of choice - underlined by the attempt to ram a blazing, fuel-laden car into the terminal at Glasgow Airport in Scotland last year.LiNeBrEaKMore recently, climate change protesters have targeted the airline industry, which they claim contributes disproportionately to carbon emissions and global warming.LiNeBrEaKMAX NASH/Associated PressLiNeBrEaKPassengers wait at Stansted Airport, about 40 miles from central London, on Monday. Environmental activists broke into a secure area of the airport Monday, barricading themselves behind fencing near the taxi area, where planes travel between takeoff and landing, in a protest against air-traffic pollution.

Monterey County Herald (California)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Panel looks at ramifications of Arctic meltdown  	Kevin Howe, The Monterey County Herald, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	955 words  	Dec. 10--It isn't just about drowning polar bears or inundated beaches.LiNeBrEaKThe melting Arctic ice cap threatens to unleash global geopolitical conflicts over resources, boundaries, self-government, rights of passage by sea and air, and naval and military presences, said speakers at the "On Thin Ice" conference in Monterey held Monday and Tuesday at the Portola Hotel and Spa at Monterey Bay.LiNeBrEaKOrganized by the Naval Postgraduate School's Center for Stabilization and Reconstruction Studies and the nonprofit Global Majority, based in Monterey, the conference drew 180 participants to discuss issues raised by the meltdown. LiNeBrEaKThe Arctic Ocean, a theater of operations during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, is still being patrolled by British, American and Russian submarines, as well as ships from those navies and from Denmark, Norway and Canada, said Rob Huebert, associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.LiNeBrEaKThere was even an opera bouffe affair in recent years, Huebert said. It involved occupation of a barren rock in the Arctic Ocean known as Hans Island that was "front-page news in Canada and Denmark," when troops landed from a Danish warship set up an observation station on the 3-kilometer by 1-kilometer landmass.LiNeBrEaKBut the fact that Danes, Canadians and Norwegians are building ice-capable frigates and deploying them is a harbinger of escalating military activity in the region, he said.LiNeBrEaKArctic military forces -- ice-capableLiNeBrEaKwarships, icebreakers, tankers and cargo vessels -- as well as air forces are being prepared. Russia has resumed flights of turboprop TU-95 Bear bombers and conduct surface ship operations, Huebert said. He said the Russian navy has a goal of building five or six carrier battle groups in its northern fleet.LiNeBrEaKChina operates a research ship in the Arctic Ocean, and South Korea has become a world leader in building ice-capable tankers and merchant ships meant to ply the iceberg-laden ocean between Asia and Europe opened by climate change.LiNeBrEaKRussia, Canada and Denmark have pending territorial claims to the continental shelf of the Arctic Ocean that await ratification of the United Nations' Law of the Sea, which, Huebert said, the United States has been resisting.LiNeBrEaKThe melting ice has made natural gas, oil and gas hydrates, a potential new source of energy, accessible and -- while oil was priced at $130 a barrel -- potentially profitable, he said. Plummeting oil prices to $40 a barrel may have put oil exploration and exploitation in the region on hold, but it will likely be back. The Japanese, Huebert said, have provided the bulk of funding for research into gas hydrates as a fuel source.LiNeBrEaKAn ice-free Arctic Ocean "won't be an ocean like any other," he said, and will be ice-bound in winter.LiNeBrEaKThe Arctic could be ice-free in the summer as soon as 2013, said Wieslaw Maslowski, research associate professor in the Navy school's Department of Oceanography.LiNeBrEaKMaslowski and researcher Jaclyn Clement Kinney have been modeling and monitoring the ice melt by analyzing data provided by submarines and satellites, scientific studies and records in the past several decades. They foresee a sudden meltdown in the near future.LiNeBrEaKDuring the summer 2007, the ice cap lost 30 percent to 40 percent of its ice as its area shrank from the normal 2. 7 million square miles to 1. 6 million square miles, Maslowski said.LiNeBrEaKLast summer, the ice cover was more widespread, but the ice sheet appeared thinner, he said, indicating that the total volume of ice could be at a record low.LiNeBrEaKThe state of the art for monitoring the polar cap is still not sufficient to make precise predictions of melt, he said. Satellites give an overview of the area covered by ice, and submarines with upward-looking sonar can record the ice depth, but that's about as far as it goes. Currents and winds will affect the ice cap, causing buildups in one part of the arctic and melting in another.LiNeBrEaKIce-free Arctic coasts, opening the Northwest Passage, and the accelerated rate of ice melt in the Danish-owned island of Greenland are factors to be considered, Maslowski said.LiNeBrEaK"We need to improve our skills in measuring changes in the Arctic," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe indigenous people of the region, the Inuit in Greenland, Alaska and Canada, are seeking self-government, said Barry Zellen, research director for the Arctic Security Project at NPS, and "the institutions of a modern state are becoming stronger with each generation."LiNeBrEaKThe scramble for resources will open economic opportunities while raising issues of natural resource development, preservation of native culture and wildlife, and establishing new political boundaries, he said.LiNeBrEaKMultiple factors are taking place simultaneously to affect the Arctic, said Tatsushi Arai, member of Global Majority's international advisory board and assistant professor of conflict transformation at the School for International Training in Vermont.LiNeBrEaKEven if all non-natural carbon emission were halted, he said, it would be "decades" before cooling effects were felt.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, he said, the nations of the world face choices in how to deal with the changes: a power-based approach, decisions made on the basis of interests or needs, or those based on rights and responsibilities.

The New York Times 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   Late Edition - Final	A Power Meeting  	By JOHN M. BRODER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; THE CAUCUS; Pg. 30  	228 words  	President-elect Barack Obama met with former Vice President Al Gore for about 45 minutes on Tuesday to discuss global warming and energy policy. Neither shared much about their talks, but Mr. Obama said he fully agreed with Mr. Gore on both the science of climate change and the need to take aggressive action to combat it. LiNeBrEaK  He repeated his declaration that the United States can no longer afford delay or denial in confronting the climate challenge. ''We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That is what I intend my administration to do.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama also adopted a term popularized by Mr. Gore, saying that it was necessary to ''repower'' the country, by shifting quickly to renewable sources of energy and creating a modern electrical grid to move power efficiently from one part of the country to another. Last summer, Mr. Gore issued a challenge to the United States to produce 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, a project he calls the Repower America Initiative. Mr. Obama has not explicitly endorsed that goal, but he has said that he intends to devote billions of dollars to so-called green energy projects that will create jobs and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   Sunrise Edition	Illinois' shame  		Editorial; Pg. B04  	551 words  	SUMMARY: The state that gave us Lincoln and Obama now gives us BlagojevichLiNeBrEaKIllinois' shameLiNeBrEaKN ever let it be said that Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich doesn't have an eye for value. LiNeBrEaKIn one of many of the Democratic governor's private conversations with associates recorded by the FBI, Blagojevich said that a seat in the U.S. Senate is a "valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing."LiNeBrEaKThat's just one small snippet from the scandal out of Springfield, Ill., that is breathtakingly broad, crude and overt. The Tuesday morning takedown of a sitting governor and his chief of staff revealed a pattern of alleged kickbacks, bribes and fundraising favors that touched highway contractors, the owners of the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago Tribune and even candidates for the Senate seat that will be vacated by President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKOne man's venality, even though that man is governor, might not be a subject for huge concern outside the state of Illinois, except for the troubling associations it suggests between the president-elect and the political structure of the state from which he emerged.LiNeBrEaKObama himself on Tuesday said he was unaware of the negotiations between the governor and applicants for his seat. Yet the recorded conversations show that Blagojevich harbored hopes of getting favors from the incoming president, even an appointment to a Cabinet post.LiNeBrEaK"I want to make money," he told advisers in a conference call on Nov. 7, three days after Obama's election.LiNeBrEaKFurther, the name of Antoin "Tony" Rezko popped up again Tuesday. The convicted political insider, who contributed money to Obama's Senate campaign and later sold a piece of property to the Obamas, apparently acted as a go-between between Blagojevich and Ali Ata, a businessman who sought a government appointment in exchange for a contribution to the governor's campaign.LiNeBrEaKAnother unfortunate coincidence occurred Tuesday when Obama appeared with former Vice President Al Gore for a conversation about global warming. It turns out that Gore's finance chairman for his 2000 presidential campaign was another associate of Blagojevich, a fundraiser named Joseph Cari. Prosecutors said Tuesday that Cari was involved in a scheme to extort money from a real estate firm.LiNeBrEaKFrom Obama's perspective, about the best thing that came out of Tuesday's takedown are the transcripts of Blagojevich's profane denunciations of the president-elect. Obama and his team, Blagojevich said, are "not willing to give me anything except appreciation."LiNeBrEaKObviously, Blagojevich needed Obama more than Obama needed Blagojevich. But considering that the president-elect has evoked comparisons with Abraham Lincoln, Blagojevich's stunning fall was a reminder of Illinois' long and seamy history of corruption and strong-arm politics. The governor who preceded Blagojevich, Republican George Ryan, was convicted of racketeering two years ago.LiNeBrEaKYet Blagojevich has written the most colorful chapter in Illinois' --and, possibly, America's --history of political scandals. Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald called it a "crime spree" that revolted even veteran FBI agents.LiNeBrEaKWhile Blagojevich is presumed innocent until tried and convicted, he should resign immediately. The people of Illinois, and the people who elected an Illinoisan to the presidency, deserve nothing less.

Patriot News (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL EDITION	It's been a good run // Advocating for causes has been a most rewarding career  		OP-ED; Pg. A17  	655 words  	I'm one week away from my last day at The Patriot-News and this is my final column.LiNeBrEaKStarting out as a young man I planned to be a wildlife biologist, while doing some writing on the side. Life's twists and turns have brought me to the culmination of a 40-year career in journalism, more than 31 of them spent at The Patriot-News.LiNeBrEaKIn my time here I've written well over 10,000 editorials and more than 500 bylined columns and articles. I'm proud of our advocacy in behalf of the environment, including wilderness preservation and addressing global warming; establishing Harrisburg University; health-care reform; streamlined, open and fiscally responsible government; regional planning, including sound land use and creation of a local commuter rail system; investing in alternative energy technologies, particularly solar; and development of maglev trains, among many other issues I've written about. LiNeBrEaKMuch that we sought to influence remains unfinished work. But there were successes, large and small, tangible and intangible. Giving voice to the community's outrage at the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident stands, to my mind, as one of the most important services this newspaper's editorial pages rendered in my tenure here.LiNeBrEaKThe nature of the position of an editorial writer on a medium-sized daily newspaper, such as this, is that it affords little time to feel good about something you've written because you're already working on your next editorial. But still, a few editorials I've written stand out. The one individual editorial that I'm most proud of had nothing to do with the issues I regularly wrote about and had everything to do with a subject on which I consider myself to be decidedly "neutral" -- religion.LiNeBrEaKThe headline of the 1997 editorial pretty much explains it: "PERSECUTED -- Court denies religious freedom of couple who believed God would heal children." The Nixons, members of a church that believes in faith healing, were sentenced to prison by a Blair County judge for failing to seek conventional medical treatment for their 16-year-old daughter's diabetes, instead relying on the power of prayer. The daughter died, as had an 8-year-old son from an ear infection some years earlier.LiNeBrEaKThe editorial, which took an unpopular stand, noted that sick people treated by conventional medicine also die sometimes, but when they are children their parents are not subject to criminal charges. The editorial went on to say: "It is a sad and sorry state we have come to in Pennsylvania when a commonwealth founded to escape religious persecution has become an instrument of religious persecution. Must the Nixons now flee to another state or another country to continue to practice their religion, as more than three centuries ago those whose religious beliefs did not comport with the officialdom of the time once fled here?"LiNeBrEaKI have no doubt the view expressed here is as controversial today as it was then, but raising such issues in a respected forum is what has made this job so special. Indeed, it has been my great privilege over these past 31 years to be in a position to give voice to the underdog, the oppressed and the forgotten, to point out abuses and to call for a world more in harmony with itself. And hopefully do it with sufficient humility to convey that we who offer such advice are imperfect human beings, as well.LiNeBrEaKONE OF THE great things about this job is that if you are of a mind to, you never stop learning.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   SOONER EDITION	LAID-OFF WORKERS WIN BIG ROUND   		NATIONAL; NATIONAL BRIEFS; Pg. A-6  	548 words  	CHICAGO -- The creditor of a Chicago plant where laid-off employees are conducting a sit-in to demand severance pay said yesterday it would extend limited loans to the factory so it could resolve the dispute, but the workers declared their protest unfinished. LiNeBrEaKThe Republic Windows and Doors factory closed last week after Bank of America canceled its financing. About 200 laid-off workers responded by staging a sit-in at the plant, vowing to stay until getting assurances they would receive severance and accrued vacation pay.LiNeBrEaKA resolution appeared closer when the bank announced that it had sent a letter to Republic offering to "provide a limited amount of additional loans" to resolve the employee claims.LiNeBrEaKCrucial union voteLiNeBrEaKTAR HEEL, N.C. -- A 16-year confrontation over union representation at the world's largest pork slaughterhouse in the country's least-unionized state comes down to a two-day vote this week.LiNeBrEaKAbout 4,600 workers at the Smithfield Packing Co. slaughterhouse and packing plant in Tar Heel, about 80 miles south of Raleigh, will vote today and tomorrow on whether the United Food and Commercial Workers should negotiate for them with the plant's owners, Smithfield, Va.-based Smithfield Foods Inc.LiNeBrEaKThe plant, which employs about 5,000 people, is the size of a major shopping mall at nearly 1 million square feet and draws its labor force from across rural southeast North Carolina.LiNeBrEaKObama, Gore meetLiNeBrEaKCHICAGO -- President-elect Barack Obama yesterday praised former Vice President Al Gore's ideas on the environment as one part of helping the nation's struggling economy recover.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama, Mr. Gore and Vice President-elect Joe Biden met privately at Mr. Obama's transition headquarters here for almost two hours. Mr. Obama said they discussed so-called green jobs as a way to boost employment across the country, improve national security by reducing reliance on foreign oil, and reduce energy costs.LiNeBrEaKMr. Gore sought the presidency in 2000 but lost to then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in a disputed election that was settled by the Supreme Court. He then became a leader in the movement to draw attention to climate change and global warming. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.LiNeBrEaKSimpson's ex-palsLiNeBrEaKLAS VEGAS -- Four former O.J.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition; East Edition	Wall Street inspires graphic dresses  	Marylou Luther, Special to the Plain Dealer  	STYLE; Pg. E4  	530 words  	CLOTHESLINESLiNeBrEaKDear Marylou: You have written about how fashion reflects the times. Can you give an example that applies to today's economic miseries? Are sackcloth and ashes in style? - N.M.B., Cleveland.LiNeBrEaKDear N.M.B.: The graphics on the Kenth Andersson dress illustrated here were inspired by Wall Street. "Not so much the Wall Street of frenzied buying and selling of stocks, but of its printed products," says the Swedish-born, New York designer, specifying "the bar graphs, seismic lines and electronic reports."LiNeBrEaKViewed through what he calls the altered prism of fashion, Andersson's graphics are, indeed, an illustration of fashion as social commentator. And the good news is that all of the design's bar graphs are headed up. For more of his stock market graphics, go to his Web site: www.kenthny.com. LiNeBrEaKDear Marylou: How about eco-friendly jewelry? Does it exist? -M.V., Hogansville, Ga.LiNeBrEaKDear M.V.: In addition to the fake golds that turn green when you wear them, "green" jewelry does exist. For example, sustainable materials such as woods, mother of pearl, sea shells, bamboo and silver all are being used now in more and more costume jewelry.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, a Los Angeles brother-and-sister team has just introduced eco-friendly bracelets called "I'm Tired" - as in bracelets made from recycled tires and metals. Half of the purchase price of each $10 bracelet is being donated to charities supporting one of 10 causes, from world hunger and global warming to cancer and AIDS.LiNeBrEaK"Each bracelet represents a cause," says Dan Hoffman, explaining that the recycled tire band bracelet with a bead made from recycled metal is emblazoned with the charity name - I'm Tired of Cancer, for example, or I'm Tired of Alzheimer's, autism, animal cruelty, etc. You can buy the bracelets online at www.ImTiredOnline.com.LiNeBrEaKDear Marylou: I just bought a new bodysuit and am concerned about how to care for it. The manufacturer's label says wash by hand, line-dry, do not iron, do not bleach. Won't the bodysuit "grow" if I hang it while wet? - F.F., St. Louis.LiNeBrEaKDear F.F.: If it does, you can get your money back because you followed the manufacturer's care instructions. To be safe, why not place your wet bodysuit over a plastic hanger with the waistlineLiNeBrEaKat the bar of the hanger. That way the weight of your suit will be distributed almost equally and should not cause problems. Once it's dry, lay it on tissue paper, then roll it up and place in your dresser drawer.LiNeBrEaKDear Marylou: I note that several designers are making clothes with strategically-placed cutouts, aka peekaboos. Who started this trend? - A.C. Detroit.LiNeBrEaKDear A.C.: The late Andre Courreges is the Paris designer first known to cut out large circles on the sides or center, back and front, of dresses and tunics in the early 1960s. His spatial discs and spheres were signatures of his space-age designs. Courreges is also the first Paris designer to recognize the beauty of black models, using them almost exclusively in his shows.LiNeBrEaKLuther welcomes questions for use in this column but regrets she cannot answer mail personally.

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   Final Edition; All Editions	Small project moves ahead as bigger ones stall  	Steven Litt, Plain Dealer Architecture Critic  	ARTS and LIFE; Pg. E6  	924 words  	ARCHITECTURELiNeBrEaKA popular scientific theory holds that a huge asteroid smashed into the Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago and ruined the weather for big dinosaurs. Small, warmblooded creatures survived the change in climate and evolved into big mammals that eventually dominated the food chain.LiNeBrEaKNot to stretch the point, but something similar could be happening in Cleveland residential development. LiNeBrEaKThe economic crisis that hit the nation in September has stymied big real estate projects in Cleveland, including the $522 million Flats East Bank development and the proposed $200 million renovation of the downtown Ameritrust complex.LiNeBrEaKOn a much smaller scale, however, developer Donald Gest is cruising ahead with plans for two buildings containing eight apartment flats in University Circle. The $1. 2 million project, called Wade Park Flats, features strong contemporary styling and a fundamental design inspired by a housing type most commonly found in the developer's hometown of San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKGest is confident that he'll break ground in the spring. He believes that small private banks in the region - which have maintained liquidity because they avoided making risky subprime loans- will be happy to finance his project.LiNeBrEaK"We have a number of small banks that are very bullish on University Circle and want to be a part of it," Gest said. "The sky is not falling."LiNeBrEaKWhen asked for names of lenders, he said: "I'm not giving away my trade secrets."LiNeBrEaKIf Gest goes ahead, his project would add to the resilience of University Circle, Cleveland's hub for education, medicine and the arts.LiNeBrEaKDespite the downturn in the economy, major projects are advancing in the area, located four miles east of downtown. They include the $350 million expansion and renovation of the Cleveland Museum of Art and the construction of a $232 million cancer hospital by University Hospitals.LiNeBrEaKPlanners expect that institutions in the district will create 10,000 jobs over the next decade, which also means the market for new housing could be substantial. A major goal of the district, managed by the nonprofit University Circle Inc., is to rebuild surrounding neighborhoods, which were damaged when big institutions expanded over the past half-century. That means opportunity for developers such as Gest.LiNeBrEaK"We so strongly believe in University Circle," Gest said. "University Circle offers the same urban, walkable experience that San Francisco does."LiNeBrEaKGest's enthusiasm is part of a national pattern. The New Urban News, a national online newsletter for planners and developers, reported Tuesday that new housing projects in traditional urban neighborhoods are faring better in the recession than large-scale suburban developments.LiNeBrEaKGest's project, designed by the Cleveland architecture firm of Studio Techne, will feature two separate, four-unit condominium buildings on long, narrow lots on the east side of East 118th Street, opposite a new park and a large parking garage that marks the eastern edge of the Case Western Reserve University campus.LiNeBrEaKThe two buildings will be inserted on lots Gest bought from CWRU, amid existing single-family houses and five townhouses the developer finished earlier this year.LiNeBrEaKEach of the new buildings will rise four stories, with the ground floor devoted to a 28-foot-wide, six-car garage wide enough so that a car could do a broken U-turn inside.LiNeBrEaKOn the two floors above the garage, each building will have two apartments in front, facing the street, and two in the back. All apartments will have living-room balconies. The upper-floor units will each have a penthouse loft, accounting for the fourth level. Prices will range from $300,000 to $400,000.LiNeBrEaKWhat makes the project unique for Cleveland, Gest said, is that the apartments will be two rooms wide, not one room, which is traditional for most townhouses. Gest said he borrowed the concept from San Francisco, where the so-called "double bow-front" apartment is a neighborhood staple.LiNeBrEaKArchitecturally speaking, the buildings should accomplish exactly what Gest wants them to do, which is to distinguish themselves with a mildly contemporary look, while fitting into a traditional Cleveland neighborhood. In architectural parlance, they'll be "background" or "fabric" buildings.LiNeBrEaKArchitect Marc Cicarelli, a principal of Studio Techne, has designed the Wade Park Flats as large, generally rectangular forms enclosed within panels of cement designed to resemble traditional clapboard siding. Balconies and other details will be trimmed in ipe (pronounced E-pay), a type of rugged hardwood harvested sustainably in Brazil.LiNeBrEaKAt ground level, facing the sidewalk, the first-story facade of the two buildings will be dominated by a garage door. Cicarelli said he'll make the door a positive feature by having it built in translucent glass and backlighted at night.LiNeBrEaK"It'll be a lantern," he said.LiNeBrEaKGest, 44, sees the Wade Park Flats as the next step in his career, after having earned a business degree at CWRU's Weatherhead School of Management and having worked for Fairmount Properties and developer Gordon Priemer in Cleveland.LiNeBrEaKEventually, he'd like to expand his Doan Brook Co. to build larger housing, commercial and medical projects. But first, he wants to start small.LiNeBrEaK"If I can't build four units well, how could I build 40?" he said. "How could I possibly build 40,000 square feet of retail?"LiNeBrEaKIf he gets a nod from lenders in the next few months, Gest will have a chance to answer his rhetorical question, and add to University Circle's allure.LiNeBrEaKTo reach Steven Litt: slitt@plaind.com, 216-999-4136	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); BUILDING RENOVATION (89%); CITY LIFE (89%); RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (89%); ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES (79%); RECESSION (76%); ECONOMIC NEWS (76%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (76%); CONDOMINIUMS (76%); RESIDENTIAL CO-OWNERSHIP (76%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (76%); BANKING and FINANCE (75%); CITIES (75%); ART and ARTISTS (73%); MAMMALS (73%); JOB CREATION (71%); SUBPRIME LENDING (66%); CANCER HOSPITALS (62%); SUBURBS (60%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (76%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (69%)  	CIRCLE INC (63%)  				CLEVELAND, OH, USA (94%); SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (92%) OHIO, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  	STUDIO TECHNE A computer rendering shows how one of a pair of new condominium buildings designed for Cleveland's University Circle district will bring a mildly contemporary air to a street lined with traditional wood-frame houses.

B-9  	728 words  	 Virginia's state treasurer is retiring at the end of the year, and Gov. Timothy M. Kaine will fill the post with one of his most trusted fiscal advisers.LiNeBrEaK Treasurer Braxton Powell leaves the post he assumed when Kaine took office in January 2006. He had been deputy state treasurer for six years and worked with the Treasury Department for 25 years.LiNeBrEaK Manju Ganeriwala, the deputy secretary of finance under Kaine, takes over the treasurer's job of overseeing investments and debt management for the state on Jan. 1. LiNeBrEaK She is a 23-year state employee who holds a degree in commerce from the University of Bombay in Mumbai, India, and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Texas. LiNeBrEaKVa. Tech coal research center to direct projectLiNeBrEaK BLACKSBURG - The Virginia Center for Coal and Energy Research at Virginia Tech is directing a $2. 4 million project to design a large-scale test of carbon sequestration in a central Appalachian coal seam.LiNeBrEaK Margaret Radcliffe, the center's assistant director, says the project is an extension of testing under way by the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership.LiNeBrEaK The partnership is one of seven created by the U.S. Department of Energy to help determine the best ways to capture greenhouse gases to reduce global warming.LiNeBrEaK Initial tests in Southwest Virginia and west-central Alabama involved injecting 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide into unmineable coal seams. Radcliffe says the larger test would call for injection of at least 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaKTHE NATIONLiNeBrEaKReport accuses FCC chair of abusing powerLiNeBrEaK WASHINGTON - In a scathing report released yesterday, congressional investigators outlined a pattern of mismanagement, dysfunction and abuse of power at the Federal Communications Commission under the agency's Republican chairman, Kevin Martin.LiNeBrEaK The report - the result of a nearly yearlong, bipartisan investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee - accuses Martin of manipulating data and suppressing information to influence telecommunications policy debates at the agency and on Capitol Hill.LiNeBrEaK The report charges that the commission has become politicized and failed to carry out some important responsibilities under Martin's leadership. It also blames him for undermining an open and transparent regulatory process.LiNeBrEaK In addition, Martin is accused of micromanaging commission affairs, demoting agency staffers who did not agree with him and withholding information from his fellow commissioners.LiNeBrEaK A spokesman for Martin said the committee did not find any violations of rules, laws or procedures. LiNeBrEaKDelta signs card deal with American ExpressLiNeBrEaK Delta Air Lines Inc., the world's biggest carrier, signed a credit-card accord that boosts cash by $1. 05 billion and said it cut $100 million from the cost of meshing operations with newly acquired Northwest Airlines.LiNeBrEaK Delta will be solidly profitable in 2009 even with an industrywide revenue decline of as much as 12 percent as the recession saps travel demand, President Ed Bastian said yesterday.LiNeBrEaK The airline gained $1. 05 billion from American Express Co.'s advance purchase of frequent-flier miles.LiNeBrEaK American Express will run co-branded credit cards for the combined carrier and provide $1 billion more in added revenue through 2010. LiNeBrEaKElsewhereLiNeBrEaK * Hurricane Ike battered Kroger Co.'s third-quarter profits, and the grocery chain offered a cautious forecast yesterday. Kroger expects lower holiday spending to hurt fourth-quarter results, and projects slower same-store sales growth for next year.LiNeBrEaK * Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said yesterday that the Federal Trade Commission's pursuit of antitrust claims in his company's acquisition of Colorado-based Wild Oats Markets is "almost a vendetta" and is wasting time and money. Whole Foods Market Inc. filed a lawsuit late Monday against the regulator, claiming it has violated Whole Foods' due process rights in continuing proceedings about the deal.LiNeBrEaK * Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that it is temporarily suspending its stock-repurchase program, citing the economic environment and instability in the credit markets. Analysts said the world's largest retailer likely wants to preserve cash in a tight credit market and the buyback program was no longer effective. Wal-Mart's stock has risen 19 percent this year as the company has benefited from frugal shoppers as the economy worsened.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	The Sacramento Bee, Calif., Dan Walters column: Dan Walters: Greenhouse gas plan has big shortcomings  	Dan Walters, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	570 words  	Dec. 10--Arnold Schwarzenegger is a proponent of the all-gain-and-no-pain school of public policy, especially when he peddles the notion that California can radically reduce its greenhouse gases while reaping immense economic benefits.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger's Air Resources Board, or CARB, is poised this week to implement his vision by adopting far-reaching policies aimed at reducing the state's emissions of carbon dioxide. LiNeBrEaKIt amounts to a huge wager, involving countless billions of public and private dollars, on an outcome that will only become apparent many years after Schwarzenegger has left the Capitol. And it's coming amid what may be the worst economic recession since the Great Depression.LiNeBrEaKSimply put, Schwarzenegger wants to bet that by embracing greenhouse gas reduction, California will be ensuring its economic future. But if he's wrong, he could be saddling the state's residents and businesses with enormous costs that would make it an economic wasteland, incapable of attracting investment capital.LiNeBrEaKCARB appears bent on acting even though some very credible analyses -- including those by distinguished economists whose input was solicited by the state -- are finding serious fault with CARB's "scoping plan" to reduce California's carbon output to 1990 levels under Assembly Bill 32.LiNeBrEaKThe Legislative Analyst's Office, in a report prepared for Republican Assemblyman Roger Niello, declares that "the plan's evaluation of the costs and savings of some recommended measures is inconsistent and incomplete." And economists recruited for a "peer review" come to similar conclusions.LiNeBrEaK"While I support the Governor's broad AB 32 goals, I am troubled by the economic modeling analysis that I have been asked to read," UCLA professor Matthew Kahn, one of the sharpest critics, wrote. "AB 32 is presented as a riskless 'free lunch' for Californians. These economic models predict that this regulation will offer us a 'win-win' of much lower greenhouse gas emissions and increased economic growth."LiNeBrEaKKahn continues: "I would like to believe this claim but after reading through the economic analysis and the five appendices there are too many uncertainties and open microeconomic questions for me to believe this."LiNeBrEaKKahn's critique that the plan tends to puff up benefits and minimize costs is echoed by another peer reviewer, Harvard University's Robert Stavins, to wit:LiNeBrEaK"I have come to the inescapable conclusion that the economic analysis is terribly deficient in critical ways and should not be used by the state government or the public for the purpose of assessing the likely costs of CARB's plans. I say this with some sadness, because I was hopeful that CARB would produce sensible policy proposals analyzed with sound scientific and economic analysis."LiNeBrEaKThese are devastating critiques, and one would think that the questions they raise would be answered before CARB engraves into law the shaky assumptions of the scoping plan.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Dan Walters, (916) 321-1195.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Obama naming Nobel Prize winner as energy secretary  	Mary Anne Ostrom, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	322 words  	Dec. 10--Steven Chu, director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, will be Barack Obama's energy secretary, according to several media reports.LiNeBrEaKThe Nobel Prize winning physicist and former chair of Stanford University's physics department, is a major supporter of developing alternative fuels and solar research and backs government mandated steps to control greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKHis selection signals that Obama plans to move ahead with his agenda of promoting environmentally friendly energy sources. And by putting a university scientist at the helm of the energy department, instead of an industry leader or political leader with no science background as had been speculated, it indicates that Obama plans to commit to a government-industry partnership to develop green energy initiatives.LiNeBrEaK"It is wonderful to see another distinguished Californian be mentioned for a Cabinet level position," Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a statement. "Dr. Chu would bring extraordinary scientific accomplishments to the job of Energy Secretary at a time when science is telling us we must act to avert the ravages of global warming."LiNeBrEaKChu, 60, of Oakland, has led the Berkeley national lab since 2004 and is a member of the board of the Hewlett Foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press, citing Democratic officials, said Obama has also selected Lisa Jackson for environmental protection agency administrator and Carol Browner as his energy "czar."LiNeBrEaKContact Mary Anne Ostrom at mostrom@mercurynews.com or (415) 477-3794.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Obama and Gore in sync on climate;  THE PRESIDENCY IN TRANSITION;  Meeting highlights new focus on environment, clean energy	Kelly Zito, Chronicle Staff Writer  	Main News; Pg. A1  	675 words  	President-elect Barack Obama, meeting Tuesday with former Vice President Al Gore, declared "the time for denial is over" on global warming and pledged to retool the U.S. energy grid using new technologies. LiNeBrEaKWhile few details emerged from the closed-door meeting, it appears clear that Gore - a politician who once stood virtually alone on the dangers of a warming planet and who later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his activism on the subject - will have the incoming president's ear.LiNeBrEaK"Throughout the campaign, the president-elect and our founder discussed climate change as a key issue, and the conversation continued today," said Cathy Zoi, chief executive of the Alliance for Climate Protection in Palo Alto, which seeks to persuade Americans of the urgent need to slow the use of fossil fuels. LiNeBrEaK"They each reaffirmed their commitment to solving the climate crisis as a top priority," she added.LiNeBrEaKThe 45-minute session in Chicago, which Vice President-elect Joe Biden also attended, underscored the incoming administration's focus on the environment and clean energy and on their potential to shore up the faltering economy.LiNeBrEaK"We have the opportunity now to create jobs all across this country in all 50 states to repower America," Obama said at a news conference after the meeting. "To redesign how we use energy and think about how we are increasing efficiency to make our economy stronger, make us more safe, reduce our dependence on foreign oil."LiNeBrEaKIn the coming days, Obama is expected to name his Cabinet picks for environment and energy. Although Gore, one of the world's most recognizable environmentalists, has been floated as a candidate, his camp stressed that he is not seeking a role in Obama's administration.LiNeBrEaKThe former vice president, whose global warming film "An Inconvenient Truth" won two Academy Awards, "feels that his calling is to serve the public in a different capacity, to educate the public about the climate crisis," Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider said Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKObama said his "aggressive" efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions, invest in clean energy alternatives and boost green-collar jobs will include a wide range of stakeholders, from Gore and Washington Republicans to consumers and industry.LiNeBrEaKBusiness leaders, especially those who hope to play a key role in the rise of solar, wind, biofuel and other new energy systems, hope Obama, Gore and others spur a new kind of technology revolution.LiNeBrEaK"Silicon Valley continues to lead on green technology, just as the valley continues to renew and redevelop itself to take advantage of new opportunities," said Mike Mielke, director of environmental programs and policy at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. "What we need is the policy to set the stage and allow that innovation to flourish."LiNeBrEaKCalifornia took the boldest step in the nation with the passage in 2006 of AB32, landmark legislation that mandates the state cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKOn a nationwide level, Obama supports putting 1 million plug-in hybrid cars on U.S. roads in the next seven years, cutting emissions 80 percent by 2050 and setting up a cap-and-trade system. Such programs aim to make burning fossil fuels pricey and reward investment in renewable energy. In general, the system sets limits on carbon dioxide emissions and allows companies to trade carbon credits based on the amount of production.LiNeBrEaKA recent report by the federal National Intelligence Council threw some doubt on the prospects for alternatives, saying, "All current technologies are inadequate for replacing the traditional energy architecture on the scale needed, and new energy technologies probably will not be commercially viable and widespread by 2025."LiNeBrEaKBut Zoi hopes Gore's Palo Alto group will prompt the administration to make inroads as quickly as possible.LiNeBrEaK"Early action on all fronts is essential," she said. "The message to Obama and others is: We need to do this because the scientific imperatives are getting more and more urgent. But we also need this to stimulate the economy at the same time."

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Board to decide on pioneering climate policy;  CALIFORNIA 	Wyatt Buchanan, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau  	Metro; Pg. B1  	1038 words  	 California will decide this week whether to adopt the nation's most comprehensive plan to combat global warming and to impose the most restrictive regulations on heavy-duty diesel trucks, a move that would impact nearly 1 million big rigs on the state's roads.LiNeBrEaKThe California Air Resources Board will consider the landmark policies, each of which has generated significant controversy, at its meeting Thursday and Friday in Sacramento. Each of the plans would take more than a decade to be fully implemented. LiNeBrEaK"This is an important landmark in California's plan to address global warming," said Bill Magavern, director of Sierra Club California, of the "scoping plan" for AB32, the law that mandates California's greenhouse gas emissions be cut to 1990 levels by 2020, a reduction of about 30 percent.LiNeBrEaKThe plan does not include specific regulations for reducing carbon, but it outlines the state's goal for cutting greenhouse emissions into specific areas.LiNeBrEaKA regulation to strengthen vehicle emissions standards, which has been blocked by the Bush administration, would produce the largest single reduction. The plan also includes the state's initiative to put solar panels on 1 million roofs and still-undefined regulations on building codes and more-efficient appliances.LiNeBrEaKCritics of the plan say estimates released by the air board - that the average household in the state would save $500 per year and the changes would have "an overall positive effect on the economy" - are faulty.LiNeBrEaKA report from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office was critical of the estimate, stating that the evaluation of costs and benefits of some measures is "inconsistent and incomplete."LiNeBrEaK"We believe the air board underestimates the costs this plan is going to impose on California citizens and businesses and that it's going to have a negative effect on the economy," said Shelly Sullivan, executive director of the AB32 Implementation Group, a coalition of businesses and business advocacy organizations that want to postpone the process.LiNeBrEaKRepublican lawmakers also have called for delaying this week's vote until the issues raised in the legislative analyst's report and a separate peer review are addressed.LiNeBrEaKMary Nichols, chairwoman of the air board, acknowledged Tuesday that other studies on the cost of the plan show a slight economic loss.LiNeBrEaK"But it's amazing that we are planning to cut carbon by 30 percent in the coming years without a noticeable effect" on the state's economy, she said in a meeting with The Chronicle's editorial board.LiNeBrEaKGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said the state's fight on global warming will not be abandoned even in a sagging economy.LiNeBrEaK"I want you all to know that the strong consensus at our climate summit in Los Angeles last month was very clear - that we have no intention of backing away from our historic commitment to the fight against global warming" Schwarzenegger said this week in a videotaped message to the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Poland.LiNeBrEaKMoney also is at the crux of the debate over the new diesel regulations for trucks and buses.LiNeBrEaKIf approved, the rules would require every owner of a heavy-duty diesel truck operating in the state to retrofit or replace the vehicles starting in 2010, even if they are registered in another state or country.LiNeBrEaKThere are about 400,000 trucks registered in the state and about 500,000 from outside the state that do business in California, according to the air board.LiNeBrEaKOwners of the trucks would be required to install filters on their exhaust, with most having to do so by 2014. Truckers also would have to replace their engines between 2o12 and 2022 or buy a new truck with an engine made with 2010 specifications. LiNeBrEaKAir board officials say their top priority is public health, and failure to meet clean air standards would put at risk billions of dollars in federal highway money.LiNeBrEaKAir board officials estimate that the rule will save the lives of 9,400 people between 2011 and 2025. A related study by UC Berkeley and Harvard researchers concluded that truck drivers and dockworkers who breathe diesel soot on the job have higher rates of lung cancer and death than other workers.LiNeBrEaKThe trucking industry has offered an alternative plan, with different timelines, that it believes would ease some of the burden on truck drivers who could be saddled with vehicles they cannot legally drive nor sell.LiNeBrEaKNichols said Tuesday that the state aims to provide $1 billion in assistance to small trucking businesses to help pay for the upgrades.LiNeBrEaK"We don't want to push truckers into hardship," she said, "which is why we hope to come up with additional funding."LiNeBrEaKBut trucking industry officials are skeptical.LiNeBrEaK"I know in many cases it sounds like, 'Oh, the sky is falling.' But this is for real," said Julie Sauls of the California Trucking Association. "The only people who don't seem to recognize the economic downturn are the air board staff."LiNeBrEaKLance Pirerovich, who owns Mid-Coast Transportation in Livermore, has two trucks and a yard of trailers that other truck drivers rent to haul equipment to construction sites. He said business has dropped to a quarter of what it was two years ago.LiNeBrEaKIf the rule goes through, he is sure his shop will go under.LiNeBrEaK"I have no doubt it's going to wipe out all of us smaller-business people," he said. LiNeBrEaKBut many scientists and economists are urging quick and decisive action. More than 1,700 of them have signed a letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists calling on the nation's leaders to tackle global warming. The organization is looking at California as a leader on the issue.LiNeBrEaK"Both of these rules are extremely important from a scientific standpoint," said Erin Rogers, a climate campaign manager with the group, who added that the scoping plan "is probably the most expansive climate policy in the U.S., if not the world."LiNeBrEaKKey meetings of air board LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKThe California Air Resources Board meets this week to decide on a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 30 percent by 2020, and regulations to reduce emissions from nearly 1 million diesel trucks in the state.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   FINAL Edition	Californians in line for top Cabinet posts;  Several on short list for Interior, EPA and Transportation 	Zachary Coile, Chronicle Washington Bureau  	Main News; Pg. A15  	929 words  	 As President-elect Barack Obama finishes rounding out his Cabinet, a number of Californians are still in contention for top jobs.LiNeBrEaKObama is expected to name his energy and environment team as early as late this week, and two Northern California officials are candidates for key posts: Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, is being considered for interior secretary, while California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols is on Obama's short list to be Environmental Protection Agency administrator.LiNeBrEaKTwo Bay Area residents are being eyed by Obama for Energy secretary: Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics who heads the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Dan Reicher, a former assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration who now directs the Google.org foundation's energy and climate change initiatives.  LiNeBrEaKRep. Xavier Becerra, a Los Angeles Democrat, met with Obama in Chicago last week to discuss the U.S. trade representative job. After Commerce Secretary-designate Bill Richardson, Becerra could be the highest-profile Latino named to Obama's Cabinet. He's seen as so likely to get the job that there's already a scramble in the House over who may replace him as vice chairman of the Democratic caucus.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia officials also believe that Rep. Jane Harman, D-Venice Los Angeles County, a former chairwoman of the House Intelligence Committee, has a good chance of capturing a top intelligence job in the new administration, possibly as CIA director.LiNeBrEaKNichols, an appointee of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger who is helping lead California's efforts to fight climate change, is now seen as one of Obama's top two choices to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. An EPA veteran, she served as assistant administrator for the air and radiation program under President Bill Clinton.LiNeBrEaKAt an editorial board meeting at The Chronicle on Tuesday, Nichols would not disclose whom she has talked with about a possible appointment and emphasized that she did not have any direct knowledge of her status. LiNeBrEaK"My name has been proposed and I am being considered on the short list for top-level positions in the climate area. EPA administrator is one of those positions," Nichols acknowledged. Asked whether she would accept an appointment, she responded, "I would be honored to work in the Obama administration in an area where I could be helpful to the president."LiNeBrEaKBut Nichols faces competition for the EPA job, and congressional sources said Obama might be leaning toward Lisa Jackson, the former commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. Jackson, a chemical engineer who spent 16 years working for the EPA in Washington and at the agency's New York regional office, would be the first African American to head the agency.LiNeBrEaKObama's transition team is also looking at Steve Heminger, who oversees transportation policy for the nine-county Bay Area as executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, as a potential choice for transportation secretary. Heminger, reached by e-mail Tuesday, refused to comment on whether he is being vetted for the job.LiNeBrEaKHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, named Heminger to serve on a key national transportation task force and is a leading advocate for a regional approach to transportation issues. Other leading candidates to run the agency include Jane Garvey, the former Federal Aviation Administration chief, and Mortimer Downey, a deputy transportation secretary under Clinton.LiNeBrEaKSilicon Valley will be closely watching whom Obama will name as his "tech czar" - a new position of chief technology officer that he pledged to create during the campaign. Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said he is not interested, but another fixture of the Bay Area tech scene, Vint Cerf, a Google vice president who has been dubbed the "father of the Internet," is seen as a top contender.LiNeBrEaKThompson, a six-term lawmaker who represents the North Coast and Napa Valley, has been pushed hard for the Interior post by his Bay Area colleagues, including Reps. George Miller, Anna Eshoo and Pelosi, a close ally. Sportsmen's groups have backed Thompson, who fishes and hunts. Obama told Field and Stream magazine this fall that having an interior secretary "who doesn't understand hunting and fishing would be a problem."LiNeBrEaKThompson has a strong conservation record, having led the drive for one of California's largest wilderness protection bills in 2006, but he has faced pushback from some environmental and animal rights groups who view him as too moderate. More than 100 conservation groups sent a letter urging Obama to pick Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, a vocal opponent of drilling and uranium mining in the West.LiNeBrEaKOther Bay Area residents who have been mentioned for top jobs include Maria Echaveste, a former Clinton White House adviser and lecturer at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, for labor secretary; and Linda Darling-Hammond, an education professor at Stanford University, for education secretary.LiNeBrEaKOne Californian who said last summer he would be open to serving in an Obama administration has been tamping down speculation in recent weeks. Schwarzenegger had been seen as dark horse candidate for energy secretary, but he is insisting that he will finish his term, which ends in January 2011.LiNeBrEaK"He does, however, look forward to working with President-elect Obama to make the country stronger," Schwarzenegger's spokesman, Aaron McLear, said Tuesday. The two politicians met at the National Governors Association meeting last week and talked about the need to boost infrastructure spending, McLear said.LiNeBrEaKMary Nichols LiNeBrEaKSteven Chu LiNeBrEaKSteve Heminger 	AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); APPOINTMENTS (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); ENERGY DEPARTMENTS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); TALKS and MEETINGS (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); AIR QUALITY (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (77%); CAUCUSES (77%); AWARDS and PRIZES (76%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (76%); PHYSICS (75%); PUBLIC POLICY (74%); US PRESIDENTS (89%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (72%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (70%); NOBEL PRIZES (70%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (68%) POLITICS; APPOINTMENTS; CABINET; PRESIDENT  	CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD (57%); GOOGLE INC (56%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%)  	GOOG (NASDAQ) (56%)  	NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING and BROADCASTING and WEB SEARCH PORTALS (56%)  	SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (92%); LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%); NEW JERSEY, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 10, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Mike Thompson 		Newspaper  	2008 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); MIKE THOMPSON (91%); XAVIER BECERRA (70%); BILL RICHARDSON (56%); JANE HARMAN (55%); ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER (54%); BILL CLINTON (53%); STEVEN CHU (91%); LISA P JACKSON (51%) Barack Obama; Mike Thompson; Mary Nichols; Steven Chu; Dan Reicher  			Washington   											
San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Editorial: End diesel truck pollution  	Mercury News Editorial  	NEWS; Opinion; Editorials  	304 words  	California has a long, proud history of environmental leadership. It should extend that legacy this week, despite the worst economy in decades.LiNeBrEaKToday the state's Air Resources Board should approve a much-debated plan to reduce greenhouse gases 30 percent by 2020, as required under California's pioneering climate change law, AB 32. Then, on Friday, the board should muster the courage to clean up deadly emissions from the state's 1 million diesel trucks. LiNeBrEaKBy converting to a green economy, California will reduce its health care costs and position itself to lead the nation out of the recession. AB 32 regulations will push us toward using cleaner, more efficient fuels in vehicles and homes. LiNeBrEaKThe trucking industry is one of the last remaining major sources of air pollution that California hasn't regulated. It got a pass because for years, it was thought that if you could see pollutants, like the black smoke puffing out of diesel stacks, the particles were too big to hurt you. But newer studies show that diesel pollution causes cancer, asthma and major heart problems: Researchers at California State University-Fullerton, say it causes 3,800 premature deaths every year and costs the state economy $28 billion a year. People who live within a mile of highways are at the greatest risk. And guess what. That's half of us.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed regulations require truckers to install $15,000 filters that reduce emissions by 85 percent and, over the next 15 years, buy new trucks with clean engines   something most large firms would do anyway. While low-interest loans from the state will help with the $5 billion this will cost, there's no doubt shipping bills will rise. But the ultimate savings in dollars and human misery   thousands of lives a year   will be worth the cost to consumers. It's time for the air board to act.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Obama naming Nobel Prize winner from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as energy secretary  	By Mary Anne Ostrom Mercury News  	POLITICS; Special Reports; Education; News; National; State  	792 words  	Steven Chu, one of the nation's top physicists and director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is Barack Obama's choice for energy secretary, a clear signal that science and not politics will guide the new administration in its effort to develop environmentally friendly energy sources.LiNeBrEaKThe announcement will be made today in Chicago, according to several media reports. LiNeBrEaKThe Nobel Prize-winning physicist and former chair of Stanford University's physics department is described as a hard-core scientist who understands the urgency of global warming. At Stanford and now as head of the Energy Department's Berkeley research lab, Chu has been a major supporter of developing alternative fuels and renewable energy research, helping turn the lab into a world-recognized leader in the field of biofuels and solar energy.LiNeBrEaKChu's selection signals that Obama plans to move ahead quickly with his ambitious agenda of promoting renewable energy sources at a time when the public is focused on climate change and fear of dependence on foreign oil.LiNeBrEaKBy putting a university scientist at the helm of the Energy Department, instead of an industry leader or political leader with no science background, Obama will demonstrate his commitment to a government-industry partnership to develop green energy initiatives, say energy experts and environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKThe Associated Press, citing Democratic officials, said Obama has also selected Lisa Jackson, a former head of New Jersey's environmental protection agency, to head the federal Environmental Protection Agency. It appears that Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and a veteran leader in the charge to reduce greenhouse emissions, has been passed over for the EPA post. One of her possible conflicts is that her husband has represented Exxon Mobil in the Exxon-Valdez oil spill.LiNeBrEaKCarol Browner, who was EPA chief during the Clinton administration, has reportedly been selected as Obama's "energy czar," a post in which she will coordinate energy and environmental initiatives.LiNeBrEaKAnother Californian selected for Obama's energy and environment team is Nancy Sutley, a deputy Los Angeles mayor on green energy issues and former California Environmental Protection Agency deputy secretary. She will serve as chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he won the Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work cooling atoms with lasers, Chu had an early interest in seeking scientific solutions to combat climate change.LiNeBrEaKAt a clean-energy summit last summer he stressed that solving the world's climate problems will require not just the will but new means. "I think political will is absolutely necessary. But we need new technologies."LiNeBrEaKChu, 60, lives in Oakland and has led the Berkeley national lab since 2004. He is a member of the board of the Hewlett Foundation. Chu was in London earlier this week and through a spokesman at the Berkeley lab had no comment on the media reports.LiNeBrEaKThe Department of Energy is considered the most science-intensive of all federal agencies. Yet, since the department's creation in 1977, it has been led by just one other working scientist. The current secretary, Samuel Bodman, is a chemical engineer.LiNeBrEaKChu, the son of Chinese immigrants, becomes the second Asian-American selected for an Obama Cabinet position. Earlier this week, Obama named Eric Shinseki, a Japanese-American, as his secretary of veterans affairs.LiNeBrEaK"The secretary of energy is one of the most challenging jobs in the U.S. government," said Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate strategy for the Center for American Progress, the think tank headed by John Podesta, Obama's transition chief.LiNeBrEaKChu has no Washington experience, however, in a job that will go way beyond science and require deft handling of the powerful energy and automobile industries.LiNeBrEaKBut environmentalists and valley clean-tech investors said they are impressed by the selection.LiNeBrEaK"It's really nice to have an energy secretary who is being selected because he knows a lot about energy," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.LiNeBrEaK"The naming of Steve Chu is a great step for clean tech," said Will Coleman, a partner with Mohr Davidow Venture, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park. "He has always had a clear view of the magnitude of the climate change challenges we face and how important it will be to focus on innovations that can have a real impact. His ties to the Bay Area will be a huge value."LiNeBrEaK"I think he'll elevate the role of science and technology again at a time when it is critical to invest in immediate solutions as well as long-term research."LiNeBrEaKMercury News Staff Writers Frank Davies and Matt Nauman contributed to this report.LiNeBrEaKContact Mary Anne Ostrom at mostrom@mercurynews.com or (415) 477-3794.

"He has always had a clear view of the magnitude of the climate change challenges we face and how important it will be to focus on innovations that can have a real impact. His ties to the Bay Area will be a huge value.LiNeBrEaK"I think he'll elevate the role of science and technology again at a time when it is critical to invest in immediate solutions as well as long-term research."LiNeBrEaKMercury News Staff Writers Frank Davies and Matt Nauman contributed to this report.LiNeBrEaKContact Mary Anne Ostrom at mostrom@mercurynews.com or (415) 477-3794.

Savannah Morning News (Georgia)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Savannah, Ga.'s alternative-fuel fleet flexes its fat  	Mary Landers, Savannah Morning News, Ga.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	502 words  	Dec. 10--The power of fat went on display Tuesday as the first hybrid streetcar in North America led a parade of the city's alternative-fuel fleet, some of it running on biodiesel made with grease collected from Savannah restaurants. LiNeBrEaKCity officials did a ceremonial pumping of biodiesel into the streetcar as it sat on its tracks at the east end of River Street.LiNeBrEaK"It smells like chicken fingers to me," said Alderman Larry Stuber.LiNeBrEaKFollowing behind the streetcar were six other vehicles running on biodiesel, ranging from a pumper truck from the water and sewer department to an SUV from the public information department. They run on a mix of 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel, although the goal is to reach all biodiesel eventually.LiNeBrEaKRefuel Savannah supplies the fuel. The company collects about 1,000 gallons of waste vegetable oil a week from restaurants on River Street, plus about 20 other eateries around town. The oil is cleaned, filtered and blended with petroleum diesel.LiNeBrEaK"It's better for the environment because it is made from renewable resources and has lower emissions compared to petroleum diesel," said Jake Hodesh, who, along with his wife, Miriam Hodesh, and their business partner, Brad Baugh, owns Refuel Savannah.LiNeBrEaKThe event, which included several city-owned bicycles and an electric bike, was part of National Climate Action Week, an event put on by Climate Communities and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives to encourage federal support for local climate-change-related projects.LiNeBrEaKSavannah belongs to both national organizations and is aiming to reduce by 15 percent its carbon footprint -- a measure of the planet-warming greenhouse gases the city government emits in the course of doing business -- by 2020.LiNeBrEaKPedestrians waved to the green and yellow streetcar as it hummed along its rails. The vehicle is expected to go into daily service beginning in early January.LiNeBrEaK"We want to run it through every conceivable test," said Sean Brandon, the city's director of mobility and parking services.LiNeBrEaKThe refurbished 1930s-era trolley car, originally used in Melbourne, Australia, will offer free rides to its first 40,000 passengers. Then it'll be 50 cents to ride to one end of River Street and back, Brandon said.LiNeBrEaKThe parade ended behind City Hall, where some tourists grumbled about having waited more than an hour for their not-so-green free shuttle, which was delayed by the eco-celebration.LiNeBrEaKBut Thunderbolt resident Walter Magnuson was pleased to see the new streetcar in action.LiNeBrEaK"I just wish it ran all the way to Thunderbolt," he said.

Spokesman-Review (Washington)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Pests, climate change put whitebark pine at risk: Conservationists urge federal protection  	Becky Kramer, The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	559 words  	Dec. 10--Ravaged by an introduced pest and facing threats from climate change, stands of whitebark pine are disappearing so quickly from the Western landscape that the species needs federal protection, conservation groups say.LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, the Natural Resources Defense Council petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to add whitebark pines to the Endangered Species List.LiNeBrEaKThe trees grow at high elevations, where their seeds provide high-calorie meals for grizzly bears. In Yellowstone National Park, fewer bear-human conflicts are reported during years of abundant seed crops. LiNeBrEaK"The whitebark pine is central to many of North America's mountain ecosystems, and its loss would be devastating to our most iconic landscapes," said Sylvia Fallon, lead author of the council's petition.LiNeBrEaKWhitebark pine habitat is scattered throughout the West, including parts of the Selkirk and Cascade ranges. Scientists call it a "keystone" species for its role colonizing inhospitable sites, said John Schwandt, the U.S. Forest Service's whitebark pine program coordinator, who is based in Coeur d'Alene.LiNeBrEaKThe pine's fat-laden seeds are favorites of grizzlies, squirrels and a jay-like bird called Clark's nutcracker, which stores the seeds in caches raided by other animals. Whitebark pine trees don't start producing seeds until they're 50 years old.LiNeBrEaK"Because they grow in such harsh conditions, they're slow all the way," Schwandt said. After five decades, a tree might reach 3 feet in height. Seeds take two years to sprout. Once established, however, whitebark pines can live to 1,200 years.LiNeBrEaKA European blister rust has knocked the hardiness out of the species. The fungus weakens the trees, leaving them susceptible to attacks by native mountain pine beetles. The trees also face threats from warmer temperatures, which have expanded the pine beetle's range into higher elevations, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council's petition.LiNeBrEaKSchwandt examined two dozen whitebark pine stands from Yellowstone to the Selkirks last summer. Beetles had killed 75 percent to 90 percent of the mature, cone-bearing trees. In North Idaho, scattered whitebark pine stands once covered 200,000 acres. Only 4,000 acres remain.LiNeBrEaKSchwandt isn't sure how great a role climate change plays. "These trees have managed climate change over the past 1,000 years and seem to manage," he said. But the warmer temperatures do favor competitor trees, which are moving higher in elevation, Schwandt said.LiNeBrEaKTwo years ago, the Bonners Ferry Ranger District burned 1,000 acres of ridgetops to clear the ground for whitebark regeneration. The Forest Service Nursery in Coeur d'Alene also grows blister rust-resistant strains of the trees.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to their role in the natural ecosystem, whitebark pines define the high-country experience for many hikers, Schwandt said.LiNeBrEaK"When you see whitebark pine, you really know that you're at the top of the world," he said.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	2 rules on coal-fired plants to stand, White House says  	By Renee Schoof McClatchy Newspapers  	NATIONAL  	375 words  	WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration on Wednesday abandoned efforts to relax pollution controls on coal-fired power plants and industries that it started with Vice President Dick Cheney's energy plan in 2001, bringing to an end a long White House fight with environmental groups. LiNeBrEaKHowever, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a third rule that would allow for more polluted dust from mines, animal farms and other sources.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental and health groups and state and local air quality officials opposed the two rules that the administration dropped. One would have permitted coal-fired power plants and industries to increase their emissions without adding pollution controls. The other would have made it easier to build power plants and factories near parks and other protected areas.LiNeBrEaKUtilities have said they need to be able to increase their efficiency at the lowest possible cost.LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar confirmed the decision.LiNeBrEaKJohn Walke, a former EPA attorney who's now with the Natural Resources Defense Council and who had argued the two rules would have been unlawful and destructive, said in a statement he was glad they were dropped.LiNeBrEaK"We can look forward as a civilized society to tackling the critical problems of global warming, smog and soot pollution that continues to damage our health, and toxic mercury that contaminates our waters," Walke said.LiNeBrEaKThe rule the EPA announced it would finalize was "nasty," but not as destructive as the other two, Walke said. It was designed so that what the EPA calls "fugitive emissions" -- those that don't flow through smokestacks -- could be excluded from consideration in decisions about whether a site is big enough to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, he said. "It's designed to exempt mines and factory farms, by and large, from Clean Air permitting programs."LiNeBrEaKIt was the two rules, however, that were dropped that were among some of the most significant changes the administration had been seeking.LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, was pleased. "Our children and families can breathe easier now that the EPA has abandoned two controversial plans to undermine clean air protections through midnight regulations," she said.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Farmers: No gas tax for cows: Dairy operators oppose possible EPA assessment for methane emissions  	Leigh Hornbeck, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	509 words  	Dec. 10--Cows produce milk. They also produce methane, a gas that contributes to global warming. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering making farmers pay for cows' flatulence. LiNeBrEaKFarmers who own 25 dairy cows or 50 beef cattle would need to purchase permits for each ton of methane their animals release annually, according to a proposal under consideration by EPA officials.LiNeBrEaKThe American Farm Bureau Federation, using a price of about $45 per ton, calculated farmers would be forced to pay $175 per dairy cow or $87. 50 per beef cow -- a "cow tax" that would cost New York farmers an estimated $120 million a year.LiNeBrEaKFarmers say the proposal for the tax is ridiculous and unjust and spoke out against the proposal during the EPA's public comment period.LiNeBrEaK"It's crazy," said Northumberland Supervisor Bill Peck, a dairy farmer. "It would mean a mass exodus from the field. I am mystified by the conflict between policies that, on the one hand, we want open space preservation and on the other we have this, which would ruin farmers."LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has not proposed a tax and hasn't said it will target farmers as it decides how to enforce the Clean Air Act after a Supreme Court decision handed down last year ruled greenhouse gas, which includes methane, is air pollution, said Catherine Milbourn, an agency spokeswoman.LiNeBrEaKPeter Gregg, a spokesman for the state Farm Bureau, said he hopes the EPA will concentrate on factories, cars and other polluters and leave agriculture out of it. But if not, Gregg said farmers will turn to their legislators for help.LiNeBrEaKSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a conference call with reporters Tuesday that as long as the cow tax is on the table, he will be speaking out against it.LiNeBrEaK"Pay to play is designed to reduce emissions where behavior can be changed," Schumer said, referring to emissions controls at factories. "In this case, the behavior can't be changed."LiNeBrEaKU.S. Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-Greenport, said she is satisfied with the EPA's answer that the agency doesn't intend to impose a tax. But she is worried emissions restrictions that have slowed farm expansion in California will affect New York.LiNeBrEaK"It's very important for farms to stay viable because when they go under, we lose open space and stewards of the environment. We have to be concerned about putting farms out of business as an unintended consequence," Gillibrand said.LiNeBrEaKState Assembly Republicans also derided the idea: "If ever there was need for a crystal clear example of a federal agency completely out of touch with reality, the EPA just filled that bill," Assembly Minority Leader James Tedisco of Schenectady said in a release.

Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Washington)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Lawmaker gives ag group budget lowdown  	Ingrid Stegemoeller, Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	426 words  	Dec. 10--KENNEWICK -- The severity of the state's impending $5. 1 billion deficit was put into context Tuesday for more than 350 people in the agriculture industry. LiNeBrEaK"We have some very difficult and expensive decisions to make for the next biennium," state Sen. Mark Schoesler, R-Ritzville said to the group gathered at Three Rivers Convention Center in Kennewick for a Far West Agribusiness Association winter conference.LiNeBrEaKSchoesler gave out several numbers to help listeners understand the gravity of the budget problems.LiNeBrEaKFor example, adding sales tax to food would raise $1. 5 billion, adding taxes to business services would bring in $1. 4 billion and cutting funding for four-year state schools would save $1. 7 billion, he said.LiNeBrEaKThese are not Schoesler's proposals, but rather illustrations of the value of $5. 1 billion, he said.LiNeBrEaK"The first step to recovery is admitting you have a spending problem," Schoesler said.LiNeBrEaKHe compared running the government to running a farm and posed the question, "Can we afford to do business as usual?LiNeBrEaK"Doing business the way we've done it ... probably needs to change if we're going to continue."LiNeBrEaKSchoesler also talked about some of his concerns for the upcoming session, one of which is a proposed bill that would mandate reporting agricultural chemical applications.LiNeBrEaKAs the law stands, growers have to keep records of each time they treat their crops in case they need to be reviewed by the state, he said.LiNeBrEaKThe proposed law would require growers to send in their records.LiNeBrEaK"It's another regulatory burden for the producer and another layer of bureaucracy to store data," Schoesler said. Plus it costs money, he added.LiNeBrEaKClimate change initiatives are another area of concern.LiNeBrEaKSchoesler said he thinks hydroelectric power should be considered renewable and that a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions is a "dangerous game."LiNeBrEaKJim Fitzgerald, executive director of the Spokane-based Far West Agribusiness Association, said he thinks a cap-and-trade system should be approached with care.LiNeBrEaK"I'm hoping no one anywhere jumps the gun and makes a decision for political reasons," he said. "It's brand new territory."

Ventura County Star (California)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	OPINION: Detroit shifts into reverse  	Timm Herdt, Ventura County Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	789 words  	Dec. 10--American automakers told Congress this week pretty much what the California Air Resources Board told the auto industry back in 2005: They have the technology to make cars with greater fuel efficiency that will do less harm to air quality and global warming, and they ought to start doing so.LiNeBrEaKBack in 2002, when California enacted the nation's first law to reduce the emissions of global warming gasses from automobile tailpipes, the auto industry squawked that the only ways to accomplish that goal would be to ban SUVs, tax motorists for driving too many miles and perhaps force commuters to drive only on odd- or even-numbered days. LiNeBrEaKBut by the time the Air Board adopted the rules to implement the law, its suggestions were considerably more modest.LiNeBrEaKThe ARB staff said it found several "near-term or off-the-shelf technology packages" that carmakers could employ to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 20 percent.LiNeBrEaK"Several technologies stood out as providing significant reductions in emissions at favorable costs," the staff reported. Among the technologies cited was "turbo-charging with engine downsizing."LiNeBrEaKPlaced in the embarrassing position of having to beg Congress to underwrite its survival, General Motors executives came to the same conclusion. The business plan they submitted to Congress last Friday included a promise to begin marketing more fuel-efficient vehicles.LiNeBrEaKThe company can do so, the plan said, while continuing to market SUVs and trucks.LiNeBrEaK"While remaining a full-line manufacturer, GM will substantially change its product mix over the next four years, and launch predominantly high-mileage, energy-efficient cars and crossovers," the plan says.LiNeBrEaKIn the process, it says, the company will increase the average fuel-efficiency of its car fleet to 37. 3 miles per gallon and of its truck fleet to 27. 5 mpg by 2012.LiNeBrEaKHow will it do that? One approach, the plan says, is "more extensive use of turbo-charging enabling the shift to smaller displacement engines."LiNeBrEaKIn other words, GM is now promising in its business plan to increase fuel-efficiency and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by using off-the-shelf technologies.LiNeBrEaKJust like California regulators told them they could do.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia politicians are encouraged by the automakers' promises to make more environmentally friendly products, but they are not exactly amused. They want assurances -- and appear to be about to get them -- that if U.S. taxpayers provide automakers with the loans they need to stay in business that none of the money will be spent to try to thwart California's greenhouse gas emission standards.LiNeBrEaKAutomakers have spent tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of dollars over the last three years fighting California's law in courts, in the halls of Congress and in the executive offices of the Bush administration.LiNeBrEaKThey achieved at least a temporary victory late last year when the federal EPA refused to issue California a waiver it needs in order to enforce its law. California is fighting that ruling in court, and President-elect Barack Obama has said he intends to make certain that waiver is granted.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia's law has become a de-facto national standard. Each state has a choice to either abide by federal Clean Air Act regulations or any tougher standards California might adopt. A dozen have already approved legislation to adopt California's greenhouse gas emissions law, and several others are poised to follow suit.LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her colleague from Florida, Bill Nelson, wrote a letter asking congressional leaders to require automakers to drop their opposition to California's law as a condition of approving the industry's bailout loans.LiNeBrEaK"We recommend language in the pending automakers' bailout bill that would prohibit the industry from using any funds for litigation or advocacy against states' efforts to either adopt or enforce California's greenhouse gas emission standards," the letter says.LiNeBrEaKIt further appears that for Ford and GM, that would make good business sense. If they follow the business plans they presented to Congress, they would voluntarily put their fleets into compliance with the law that they once argued would cause the sky to fall.LiNeBrEaK-- Timm Herdt is chief of The Star state bureau.

The Washington Times 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Global warming freeze?  	By David Deming, SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	COMMENTARY; A16  	783 words  	President-elect Barack Obama recently declared his intention to mitigate global warming by enacting a cap-and-trade policy that would reduce carbon emissions 80 percent by the year 2050.LiNeBrEaKBut the last two years of global cooling have nearly erased 30 years of temperature increases. To the extent that global warming ever existed, it is now officially over.LiNeBrEaKThis year began with a severe spell of winter weather in China. Observers characterized it as the largest natural disaster to hit China in decades. By the end of January, blizzards and cold temperatures had killed 60 people and caused millions to lose electric service. Nearly a million buildings were damaged and airports had to close. Hong Kong had the second-longest cold spell since 1885. A temperature of 33. 6 degrees Fahrenheit was barely higher than the record low of 32 degrees F set in 1893. LiNeBrEaKOther countries in Asia also experienced record cold. In February, cold in the northern half of Vietnam wiped out 40 percent of the rice crop and killed 33,000 head of livestock. In India, the city of Mumbai recorded the lowest temperatures of the last 40 years. Across India, there was more frost damage to crops than at any other time in the last 30 years.LiNeBrEaKIn the United States, the weather also was frigid. The city of International Falls, Minn,, whose official nickname is the "icebox of the nation," set a new record low temperature of minus 40 degrees F, breaking the old record of minus 37 F established in 1967.LiNeBrEaKAlaska experienced an unusually cold and wet summer. For the first time since the 18th century, Alaskan glaciers grew instead of retreating. In Fairbanks, October was the fourth coldest in 104 years of record. Last month in Reading, Pa., the temperature stayed below 40 degrees F for six consecutive days - the longest November cold spell there since 1903.LiNeBrEaKThese cold weather events were not abnormal or isolated incidents. Global measures of climatic conditions indicate significant cooling.LiNeBrEaKA preliminary estimate by the British Met Office says 2008 will be the coldest year of the last 10. The extent of global sea ice is at the same level it was in 1980. The mean planetary temperature, as monitored by satellite, also is the same as in 1980.LiNeBrEaKLast March, NASA reported the oceans have been cooling for the last five years. Sea level has stopped rising, and Northern Hemisphere cyclone and hurricane activity is at a 24-year low.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental extremists and global warming alarmists are in denial and running for cover. Their rationale for continuing a lost cause is that weather events in the short term are not necessarily related to long-term climatic trends. But these are the same people who screamed at us each year that ordinary weather events such as high temperatures or hurricanes were undeniable evidence of imminent doom.LiNeBrEaKNow that global warming is over, politicians are finally ready to enact dubious solutions to a non-existent problem. In Britain, Parliament is intrepidly forging ahead with a bold new plan to cool the climate, even as London experienced its first October snowfall since 1934 and Ireland went through the coldest October in the last 70 years.LiNeBrEaKThis is an absurd spectacle. Our advanced civilization is being systematically mismanaged by technologically illiterate lawyers responding to political pressures from irrational fanatics. Would someone please tell these people it is impossible to overturn the laws of thermodynamics?LiNeBrEaKWe cannot improve our economy by artificially forcing people to use expensive, unreliable and inefficient energy sources.LiNeBrEaKLet the politicians take note. People will not like what you have in mind. California is arguably the most liberal state. Yet last month they defeated, by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, a law that would have forced California utilities to obtain half their electric power from renewable sources. What the Obama administration proposes is much more radical. Their cap-and-trade proposal will dramatically increase the energy costs of the average consumer and likely drive our crippled economy into a severe depression.LiNeBrEaKTo the extent global warming was ever valid, it is now officially over. It is time to file this theory in the dustbin of history, next to Aristotelean physics, Neptunism, the geocentric universe, phlogiston, and a plethora of other incorrect scientific theories, all of which had vocal and dogmatic supporters who cited incontrovertible evidence.LiNeBrEaKWeather and climate change are natural processes beyond human control. To argue otherwise is to deny the factual evidence.LiNeBrEaKDavid Deming is a geophysicist, an adjunct scholar with the National Center for Policy Analysis and an associate professor of arts and sciences at the University of Oklahoma.

Watertown Daily Times (New York)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Methane threat: Senator says idea to impose fees for cows 'absurd'  	Marc Heller, Watertown Daily Times, N.Y.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	386 words  	Dec. 10--WASHINGTON -- Forget smokestacks. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may target a far more common sight in Northern New York -- cows -- in the effort to clean the nation's air. LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has not let go of the notion that belching cattle are a major source of methane pollution that perhaps ought to be regulated as the government tackles greenhouse gases and related clean air issues.LiNeBrEaKSen. Charles E. Schumer called on the EPA Tuesday to drop the idea, which calls for farmers to buy emission permits, based on a per-animal fee. He said the annual fee could be $175 per cow, enough to put a dent in most dairy operations.LiNeBrEaK"The idea's absurd," said Mr. Schumer, who added that he generally supports clean air regulations. "There are a lot greater threats than this."LiNeBrEaKThe EPA has not exactly proposed the fee; it is part of a range of ideas the agency outlined in an advance public notice of regulations that might come later. But Mr. Schumer said in a conference call with New York reporters that he would rather squelch the idea before it goes any farther, and he wrote to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson requesting so.LiNeBrEaKThe senator's office estimated that such a measure could cost New York dairy farms a total of $120 million, nearly $27 million of which would come from the north country and its 146,600 dairy cattle.LiNeBrEaKAn EPA spokesman did not return messages Tuesday seeking comments on the agency's position.LiNeBrEaKCattles' contribution to air pollution is not a mystery; scientists have been researching how to adjust cattles' diets so they produce less methane.LiNeBrEaKMr. Schumer said he supports clean air regulations but that making farmers pay for their cows' normal behavior should not be part of the solution.LiNeBrEaK"This effectively amounts to a tax on cows when they belch. That's what we're talking about, if you can believe it," Mr. Schumer said. "Cows can't change their behavior."

The Washington Post 	December 10, 2008 Wednesday   Suburban Edition	Scores on Science Test Causing Concern in U.S.  	Maria Glod; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A10  	744 words  	U.S. students are doing no better on an international science exam than they were in the mid-1990s, a performance plateau that leaves educators and policymakers worried about how schools are preparing students to compete in an increasingly global economy.LiNeBrEaKResults of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), released yesterday, show how fourth- and eighth-graders in the United States measure up to peers around the world. U.S. students showed gains in math in both grades. But average science performance, although still stronger than in many countries, has stagnated since 1995. LiNeBrEaKStudents in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong outperformed U.S. fourth-graders in science. The U.S. students had an average score of 539 on a 1,000-point scale, higher than their peers in 25 countries.LiNeBrEaKIn eighth grade, Singapore topped the list, with an average score of 567. Students in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, England, Hungary and Russia were among those earning higher marks than their U.S. counterparts. The average score in the United States was 520.LiNeBrEaK"We need to pay attention to the results. We're just static, and other countries are improving," said Francis Eberle, executive director of the Arlington County-based National Science Teachers Association. "Whether it's global warming, energy production or conservation or homeland security, people need to be able to understand enough to make decisions as a citizen."LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has promised to make math and science education a national priority. He said the federal government would work with states to improve science education, beginning in preschool, and he plans to establish a teaching scholarship program to recruit graduates with backgrounds in math and science.LiNeBrEaKThe TIMSS tests, administered every four years since 1995, were taken last year by a sampling of students in the United States and more than 50 other countries. In the United States, more than 20,000 students in nearly 500 public and private schools participated.LiNeBrEaKU.S.  students made notable strides in math. Since 1995, the average score among fourth-graders has jumped 11 points, to 529. But students in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Russia and England were among those  with a higher average. Hong Kong topped the list with an average score of 607.LiNeBrEaKEighth-graders also  had a higher average score than in 1995 and bested counterparts in 37 countries. But they lagged behind peers in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, among other places.LiNeBrEaKSome educators and officials attribute the gains to a renewed focus on math education in recent years. The 2002 federal No Child Left Behind law requires schools to administer annual math tests, with the goal of steadily improving performance. In 2006, President Bush appointed a panel to recommend ways to ensure that students are prepared for algebra.LiNeBrEaKSecretary of Education Margaret Spellings said the scores "reconfirm what we have long known: If we set high expectations, our children will rise to the challenge." She added that "flat science scores . . . remind us that we can't afford to be complacent."LiNeBrEaKThe benefits of tough standards  and a focus on foundational skills were reflected in test score gains in Minnesota, according to William Schmidt, a Michigan State University professor who worked with Minnesota education officials.LiNeBrEaKIn 1995, before the state implemented math standards based on international benchmarks, Minnesota fourth-graders trailed peers across the country. But in the 2007 TIMSS testing, Minnesota outpaced the nation and trailed only Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan. "It says, 'America you can do it, and the way to do it is to have coherent, focused and rigorous standards,' " Schmidt said.LiNeBrEaKThe scores led to renewed calls to bolster science and math in the nation's schools by increasing the ranks of well-prepared teachers and providing other support.LiNeBrEaK"While it's good news that fourth-graders have made significant gains in math, it's troubling that our students are still behind their international peers in both math and science -- fields that are key to our country's economic vitality and competitiveness," said Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. "It's increasingly clear that building a world-class education system that provides students with a strong foundation in math and science must be part of any meaningful long-term economic recovery strategy."

A10  	681 words  	 NO SIGN OF AN OFFICIAL ROLE LiNeBrEaKGore Talks Climate Change With Obama and Biden LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama met with former vice president Al Gore in Chicago on Tuesday to discuss climate change, declaring after the meeting, "The time for denial is over."LiNeBrEaKThe meeting, also attended by Vice President-elect Joe Biden, came as Obama prepares to nominate his administration's top environmental officials -- decisions that could come as soon as this week.LiNeBrEaK"All three of us are in agreement that the time for delay is over," Obama told reporters as he sat between Gore and Biden at the transition headquarters after the meeting. LiNeBrEaK"We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now," Obama said, "that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way. That is what I intend my administration to do."LiNeBrEaKGore has advised Obama on environmental issues, and Obama on Tuesday praised Gore's work on climate change as "extraordinary."LiNeBrEaKNonetheless, Democratic sources maintain there is no indication that Gore is interested in a job in the new administration.LiNeBrEaK --  Philip Rucker LiNeBrEaK'TRANSITIONING TO HIMSELF' LiNeBrEaKAt Pentagon, Gates Has Different Changeover Needs LiNeBrEaKDefense Secretary Robert M. Gates is "recalibrating" the Obama transition team's efforts at the Pentagon in light of the fact that he will be "transitioning to himself," Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said Tuesday.LiNeBrEaK"This is no longer transitioning to a to-be-determined secretary of defense. This is transitioning to himself. And there are certain things he needs," said Morrell, who said he will stay on as Gates's press secretary for "the foreseeable future."LiNeBrEaKGates "needs greater insight into the national security agenda of President-elect Obama" as he seeks to restock the department's array of top positions and build "an Obama-Gates Defense Department," Morrell said.LiNeBrEaK"The last thing I think we want is a situation where you have Secretary Gates at the helm and no one around to assist him during this transition phase," he noted.LiNeBrEaKGates met Monday with Vice President-elect Joe Biden to offer the incoming veep insights into running the national security operations, and he held a working lunch Tuesday with the Obama transition team.LiNeBrEaKGates is playing "a key role" in identifying and interviewing candidates for top jobs in the department -- and is hoping to have them in place soon, Morrell said.LiNeBrEaK --  Ann Scott Tyson LiNeBrEaKCLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE LiNeBrEaKBill Clinton Discloses Sponsors of Recent Meeting LiNeBrEaKFormer president Bill Clinton, who agreed to make his charitable activities more transparent in an accord with President-elect Barack Obama that paved the way for his wife to become Obama's secretary of state, disclosed Tuesday the sponsors of a meeting that his nonprofit Clinton Global Initiative held last week in Hong Kong.LiNeBrEaKAbout a dozen corporations, foundations and individuals underwrote the Dec. 2-3 philanthropic gathering, according to a list of sponsors released by Clinton's office. Among them is Citigroup, one of the nation's largest banks, which last month was granted a multibillion-dollar bailout by the federal government.LiNeBrEaKVictor Pinchuk, who runs a leading Ukrainian steel company and is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Eastern Europe, was listed as a convening partner. Datuk Vinod Sekhar, a Malaysian businessman and philanthropist, was named the major underwriter of the initiative's Hong Kong meeting. Sekhar is chairman of the Sekhar Foundation in Kuala Lumpur and is president of the Petra Group, a rubber-technology company.LiNeBrEaKOther sponsors include CLSA, a large Hong Kong-based investment bank; Laureate, an education firm; the Robertson Foundation, established by Tiger Management founder Julian H.

Winston-Salem Journal (North Carolina)  	December 10, 2008 Wednesday 	Shirt-sleeve December days? Maybe: Temperature records might be broken before official start of winter  	Lisa O'Donnell, Winston-Salem Journal, N.C.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	339 words  	Dec. 10--Old Man Winter might be sweating when he arrives on Dec. 21.LiNeBrEaKCold weather, which jibes so well with a season filled with images of sleigh bells, Jack Frost nipping at your nose and bundled carolers, is going to give way to warmer weather. LiNeBrEaKBeginning Monday, the temperature will inch upward, said Andrew Ulrich, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. The high that day is expected to be 56, which is about four degrees higher than average, he said. Highs will stay in the mid-50s on Tuesday and next Wednesday, drop to 50 on Dec. 18, then spike to an expected high of 63 on Dec. 19.LiNeBrEaK"By the end of the week, it will start to really go up," Ulrich said.LiNeBrEaKHe said he expects about three days of higher than average temperatures.LiNeBrEaKPhillip Badgett, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Raleigh, said that chances are good that the high temperatures will break records. The record high for Dec. 18 is 66 degrees.LiNeBrEaK"We're probably in that neighborhood," Badgett said.LiNeBrEaKHe said that the warmer weather could last until just before Christmas.LiNeBrEaKThe weather has remained unusually cold for the past month because of a low-pressure system that hasn't budged, Badgett said. Typically, low- and high-pressure systems will replace one another in the course of a week or so, which causes temperatures to fluctuate a lot more than they have been, he said.LiNeBrEaKNext week, however, a high-pressure system is going to move in, resulting in warmer weather.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be an abrupt change," Badgett said. "It's going to be something people really notice."

The Berkshire Eagle (Pittsfield, Massachusetts)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Smart energy savers  	Jenn Smith, The Berkshire Eagle, Pittsfield, Mass.  	LIFESTYLE  	519 words  	Dec. 9--LANESBOROUGHLiNeBrEaKLanesborough Elementary School is all charged up about becoming a more energy-efficient building.LiNeBrEaKSixth-graders spent the first part of the year studying green issues such as climate change and energy conservation. LiNeBrEaKNow armed with watt-hour meters, wall charts and some Arctic critter plush toys, the students will audit how much energy is being used -- or overused -- in the school.LiNeBrEaK"We'll be patrolling," sixth-grade student Nick Vlahopoulos said at last week's launch of the Lanesborough Elementary Energy Efficiency Patrol.LiNeBrEaKThe 39 sixth-graders paired off to give presentations to all of the school's classes to explain the mission of the energy-saving campaign.LiNeBrEaKThroughout the week, the older students will measure energy use in everything from the school's televisions to computer labs to classroom lights.LiNeBrEaKA maximum of 50 bulbs can be used to light a classroom, but the circuit they're on can reduce use from 50 to 27 to nine bulbs.LiNeBrEaKAt minimum, the classroom lights use 288 watts, at maximum, it jumps to 1,600 watts. "If we see a class using less light, we'll put a star on their chart," Vlahopoulos said.LiNeBrEaKIf the class forgets to turn off lights or computers, the Grade 6 patrol will leave a small plush polar bear or penguin in the classroom as a friendly reminder to do so. But the classroom who saves the most energy at the end of the week will get toLiNeBrEaKkeep a big plush polar bear with their class as a trophy.LiNeBrEaKWhen sixth-grader Andrew Whitaker asked a first-grade class, "Who wants a polar bear?" every youngster's hand shot up.LiNeBrEaK"This can help the world and save the school money," said the boy's presentation partner, Sara Rudd.LiNeBrEaKAnd the latter is fine by the school.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Superintendent Rose Ellis, the school has a motion-detection light system in its gymnasium and head custodian Ed Ahern recently installed a similar system in a student bathroom to see if it can result in power savings.LiNeBrEaKAt a preliminary projection, it could result in at least $1,000 in cost savings.LiNeBrEaKLanesborough Elementary is labeled as a BEST (Berkshire Environmental School Teams), which receives support from the Center for Ecological Technology and funding for green learning initiatives through the Berkshire Bank Foundation.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is to tie the initiatives into science, math and language arts curriculum through hands-on learning and proactive campaigns and projects.LiNeBrEaKThere are six BEST schools: Lanesborough, Muddy Brook, Egremont and Undermountain elementary schools and Nessacus Regional and Conte middle schools. Both Conte and Nessacus will be starting energy conservation programs and all of the elementary schools have waste reduction and recycling initiatives in place.

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	$3 billion coal-to-liquids coal plant planned for Mingo  	Ken Ward Jr., The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	554 words  	Dec. 9--ROANOKE, W.Va. -- A New York firm announced plans Tuesday to build a $3 billion plant in Mingo County to turn coal into gasoline. TransGas Development Systems LLC said the project would create 200 permanent jobs turning 8,500 tons of coal into 18,000 barrels of gasoline every day. LiNeBrEaKDetails of the project were still emerging after an announcement made by company officials and Gov. Joe Manchin during the governor's energy summit at Stonewall Resort. Adam Victor, president of TransGas, said the project would be a "near-zero emissions facility," but that his company so far has no concrete plan to control its greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaK"Whatever the permitting process tells us to do is what we'll do," Victor said, while conceding that federal and state laws currently place no limits on carbon dioxide emissions.LiNeBrEaKVictor said his firm hopes to convince Congress to grant it a right-of-way to send carbon dioxide emissions through interstate pipelines to the Texas coast, where it could be pumped underground to help force out more oil and gas, to be safely sequestered.LiNeBrEaKManchin has made luring liquid coal plants to West Virginia the top priority of his energy plan. But scientists, energy experts and environmentalists worry about such proposals. Without carbon dioxide controls, such plants could emit twice the greenhouse emissions of gasoline, generating carbon dioxide both when coal is turned into liquid fuel and when that liquid fuel is burned.LiNeBrEaKDuring a news conference here, Victor said similar proposals by his company for cogeneration and liquid coal plants were opposed in New York by public officials and residents who "hijacked" environmental permitting reviews to advance their "NIMBY agenda."But Victor said his proposal has been embraced in West Virginia by Manchin and by the state Department of Environmental Protection, where TransGas apparently filed permit applications on Monday.LiNeBrEaKVictor also praised Mingo County electied officials and the Mingo County Redevelopment Authority for helping to advance the project toward Tuesday's announcement. The plant would be built at the Mingo Hybrid Energy Park located on the King Coal Highway. Manchin and Victor emphasized that the state would provide the project with no subsidies through direct taxpayer investment.LiNeBrEaK"We don't believe that energy projects need any subsidies from the state, so we seek and ask for no government subsidies or tax credits," Victor told reporters.LiNeBrEaKBut later, Manchin said that the project would be eligible for state tax credits and other subsidies that are available to any new project based on investment and job creation. For a company that spends $3 billion and creates several hundred jobs, such subsidies could easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars.LiNeBrEaKVictor said his company would accept such subsidies "as long as it doesn't slow us down."LiNeBrEaKReach Ken Ward Jr. at kward@wvgazette.com or 348-1702.

The Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	BRIEF: Manchin: Coal remains energy 'cornerstone'  	Ken Ward Jr., The Charleston Gazette, W.Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	252 words  	Dec. 9--ROANOKE, W. Va. -- Gov. Joe Manchin said Tuesday that he opposes President-elect Barack Obama's plan to cap greenhouse gas emissions to try to curb global warming. LiNeBrEaKManchin said he told Obama recently that he's "on a different page" regarding Obama's proposal for a carbon dioxide emission "cap-and-trade" program. The governor said he's concerned the federal government will impose such emissions on coal-fired power plants before utilities come up with workable plans to control those emissions.LiNeBrEaKManchin spoke during the opening session of his second annual Energy Summit, a gathering of industry officials and boosters at Stonewall Resort. The governor repeated his pledge to next year introduce legislation to encourage more alternative energy production in West Virginia. But he did not provide details of his plans, and said that alternative fuels will not replace the nation's reliance on coal.LiNeBrEaK"Coal is the cornerstone fuel of the future," Manchin said. "Every economist and expert I talk to says we're going to use it, but in a different form."LiNeBrEaKRead more in Wednesday's Gazette.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Obama gains support to think big, act boldly on clean energy  	By Frank Davies Mercury News Washington Bureau  	NEWS; National  	917 words  	Memo to President-elect Barack Obama on ways to revamp the nation's energy policy and boost the economy: Think big. Act boldly.LiNeBrEaKThat's the emerging consensus of policy experts, Bay Area clean-tech leaders and even hardened pols who know the obstacles. They are urging the Obama to seize a rare opportunity and dramatically accelerate the nation toward a clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaK"We can't lose this moment   we have to do things in a big way," said Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania at a forum last week. LiNeBrEaKSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid told an energy conference at Google's Washington office to expect a large spending package when Congress convenes in January.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not concerned about spending money," he said. "It's the only way to get out of the hole that's been dug for us, and that applies to energy."LiNeBrEaKObama and congressional leaders are about to make key decisions that will show just how bold they want to be on the energy front:LiNeBrEaKObama's energy and environment team could be unveiled as early as this week. Those appointments will give clues on how aggressively Obama wants to move.LiNeBrEaKWith the recession getting worse and unemployment on the rise, pressure is building for a large stimulus plan, costing $500 billion or more, next month. Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and John Podesta, chief of the transition team, favor a large "green recovery" component of that package, including more spending on alternative fuels.LiNeBrEaKCiting the threat of climate change, Obama has said he wants to push for strict limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, with utilities and manufacturers buying and trading pollution permits. But is setting up a complex cap-and-trade system achievable in 2009, with fears that it could boost energy prices in the short term?LiNeBrEaKObama enters the White House with lots of political capital, an expanded Democratic majority in Congress, and a raft of specific proposals from his own team and allies in the center-left think tanks of Washington. Podesta, former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, heads one of those groups, the Center for American Progress.LiNeBrEaKHe became Obama's transition chief in August, three months before the election, and quietly began planning a fast start for the Obama presidency.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's center in September issued a $100 billion "green recovery" plan of tax credits, direct spending and loan guarantees to spur clean technology and energy efficiency and create 2 million jobs   a major Obama goal.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's group even forecast the impact on each state.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia would receive $12. 7 billion, creating 235,000 jobs, under the plan.LiNeBrEaKThat could include federal funding for high-speed rail, backed by state voters in November.LiNeBrEaK"The investment described here is doable in the early days of a new administration," Podesta wrote three months ago.LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus package in January will include at least $15 billion for clean tech and energy efficiency, an Obama adviser has said.LiNeBrEaKThat would include money to weatherize homes and grants for mass transit.LiNeBrEaKReid and Obama have used similar language that the economic crisis is "an opportunity" to build a clean-tech infrastructure for the future while boosting jobs and growth in the short term.LiNeBrEaKJeff Anderson of San Francisco, who chaired Clean Tech for Obama during the campaign, said the Obama team "wants as many green elements as they can get" in the stimulus bill.LiNeBrEaK"What's important for a recovery is getting an immediate bang for your buck, and energy efficiency is easier stuff that you can do quickly," said Anderson.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the stimulus plan, the long-range effort to combat global warming will be a priority, Obama has promised.LiNeBrEaKBut complex cap-and-trade legislation raises big questions about costs, as long as the U.S. economy relies on oil and coal. Depending on how pollution permits are sold, utilities could face higher costs in the short term that they would pass on to consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental groups and many businesses say a cap-and-trade system is the only way to set a price on carbon and shift market forces in favor of renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe overarching question Obama faces is whether he can press for two complicated domestic initiatives   health care reform and tackling climate change   while focusing on the biggest priority, an economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKHistorian Matt Dallek of UC Berkeley said the Obama team "is weighing how far and how fast they can move on all these things."LiNeBrEaK"It may help them to do health care and energy early, even if you don't get everything you want," Dallek said.LiNeBrEaK"The election has given Obama a clear mandate and more space to act than presidents usually have, and they want to take advantage of that."NAME GAME FOR ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKBarack Obama has moved quickly to name his Cabinet, and speculation is building about who will fill key energy and environment jobs.

LiNeBrEaKWe commend this.LiNeBrEaKThe most important step a community can make to reduce greenhouse gases is the reduction of sprawl and the creation of transit-oriented development.LiNeBrEaKThe Bay Area is a fertile classroom in the study of how short-sighted decisions, made by elected officials and affected by developers, can both create massive sprawl and eliminate transit options.LiNeBrEaKFive decades ago, BART was envisioned to surround the Bay.LiNeBrEaKBut in 1957, Santa Clara County supervisors said "no" to the transit system, preferring to build expressways.LiNeBrEaKIn 1961, San Mateo County supervisors voted to also leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. Real estate agent David Bohannon influenced the supervisors to drop out, fearing it would affect planned development along I-280 (according to a Mercury News article on Jan. 8, 2005).LiNeBrEaKIt is easy to look back at these two decisions in disbelief.LiNeBrEaKAny of us who live in the Tri-City area and work in other cities pay for these two mistakes every day.LiNeBrEaKWe have no option but to get in our cars, pollute our air and crawl to work paying whatever price per gallon the oil companies wish to charge us. This is the legacy that our forefathers left us.LiNeBrEaKBut we are all at risk of repeating these mistakes.LiNeBrEaKOver these next critical months, developers continue to come forward with proposals that put houses on the outer fringes of our cities and place huge developments in areas away from rapid transit.LiNeBrEaKA Notice of Preparation has been announced for the "Oakland A's Ballpark Village" plan. Many, including Wasserman, are infatuated by the thought of the "Oakland A's of Fremont." But it creates sprawl with no real transportation options.LiNeBrEaKWhile owner Lou Wolff has delayed the housing portion of the plan until times get better, I'll bet you a foam finger we will see the previously planned 3,150 houses cemented in place under a 15-year development agreement.LiNeBrEaKThis development alone will add more than 40,000 car trips a day, not counting traffic created on game days   and there has been no real solution to moving fans to and from games.LiNeBrEaKAdditional car trips will be created by the development of more than 1,000 houses on and around the Patterson Ranch in Northern Fremont.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Newark's Smith is enthusiastically promoting the addition of 1,200 "executive" houses in Area 3 on Cherry Street and Area 4 west of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and 2,100 houses in Area 2, the old chemical plant ally off Enterprise Drive.LiNeBrEaKThese four developments would add more than 80,000 car trips a day to our already congested roadways and freeways.LiNeBrEaKWasserman and Smith each have pledged to support anti-sprawl land-use policies. This support cannot wait until after their pet developments have been constructed.LiNeBrEaKTo quote Tom Cochran, executive director of U.S. Conference of Mayors: "The emerging threat of global climate change, due largely to widespread fossil fuel use, has made it clear that business as usual, as far as energy use is concerned, is not sustainable."LiNeBrEaKThe mayors have talked the talk. Now is the time for them and our council members to walk the walk. Keep their promise, their legacies.LiNeBrEaKOur children's future depends on it.LiNeBrEaKDan Ondrasek has been a member of the Friends of Coyote Hills since 2001.

But it creates sprawl with no real transportation options.LiNeBrEaKWhile owner Lou Wolff has delayed the housing portion of the plan until times get better, I'll bet you a foam finger we will see the previously planned 3,150 houses cemented in place under a 15-year development agreement.LiNeBrEaKThis development alone will add more than 40,000 car trips a day, not counting traffic created on game days   and there has been no real solution to moving fans to and from games.LiNeBrEaKAdditional car trips will be created by the development of more than 1,000 houses on and around the Patterson Ranch in Northern Fremont.LiNeBrEaKIn addition, Newark's Smith is enthusiastically promoting the addition of 1,200 "executive" houses in Area 3 on Cherry Street and Area 4 west of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks and 2,100 houses in Area 2, the old chemical plant ally off Enterprise Drive.LiNeBrEaKThese four developments would add more than 80,000 car trips a day to our already congested roadways and freeways.LiNeBrEaKWasserman and Smith each have pledged to support anti-sprawl land-use policies. This support cannot wait until after their pet developments have been constructed.LiNeBrEaKTo quote Tom Cochran, executive director of U.S. Conference of Mayors: "The emerging threat of global climate change, due largely to widespread fossil fuel use, has made it clear that business as usual, as far as energy use is concerned, is not sustainable."LiNeBrEaKThe mayors have talked the talk. Now is the time for them and our council members to walk the walk. Keep their promise, their legacies.LiNeBrEaKOur children's future depends on it.LiNeBrEaKDan Ondrasek has been a member of the Friends of Coyote Hills since 2001. A 10-year resident of the Tri-City area, Ondrasek lives in Newark with his wife and two children.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Home Final Edition	Climate change challenged ancient cultures, too  	Bradley T. Lepper, For The Columbus Dispatch  	NEWS - SCIENCE; ARCHAEOLOGY; Pg. 05B  	352 words  	A team of researchers, led by Pingzhong Zhang of Lanzhou University in China, studied a record of climate change preserved in a stalagmite from a cave in northern China. They observed a strong correlation between precipitation and the rise and fall of civilizations. LiNeBrEaKThree great dynasties fell after decades of weak monsoons resulting in less rainfall, crop failures and social unrest. The results, published in the Nov. 7 issue of the journal Science, provide convincing evidence of a powerful link between climate and culture change.LiNeBrEaKGregory Springer, a geologist at Ohio University in Athens, led a team that included one of the researchers who worked on the Chinese study in an analysis of a stalagmite from a cave in West Virginia.LiNeBrEaKThe results, published this year in Geophysical Research Letters, indicate broadly similar patterns of climate change. This got me wondering whether the American Indian cultures of the Ohio Valley experienced similar ups and downs because of periodic severe droughts.LiNeBrEaKKenneth Tankersley, a University of Cincinnati archaeologist, conducted a study of so-called hill forts in southern Ohio that was presented at the October meeting of the Midwest Archaeological Conference. He thinks some of the earthworks might have been massive facilities to channel spring water into reservoirs. LiNeBrEaKHe argues that such earthworks were built by the Hopewell culture between 100 B.C. and A.D. 400, as well as by the Fort Ancient culture between A.D. 900 and 1600.LiNeBrEaKThese dates generally correspond to dry periods in the climate records of both West Virginia and China, but neither culture experienced a collapse during the worst droughts.LiNeBrEaKPeter deMenocal, a marine geologist at Columbia University in New York, argued in a 2001 article in Science that such studies help show how complex civilizations are vulnerable to climate change and how resilient they can be in responding.LiNeBrEaKHe suggests the results "may prove instructive for assessing modern societal preparedness for a changing and uncertain future."LiNeBrEaKBradley T.

Daily News (New York) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   SPORTS FINAL EDITION	HIL PAYS STATE VISIT FOLLOWED BY RICE DINNER  	BY MICHAEL McAULIFF DAILY NEWS WASHINGTON BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. 10  	291 words  	WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton dipped her toes into the State Department yesterday, getting briefings on her future job before dining with the current occupant of the office, Secretary of State Rice. LiNeBrEaKNot so long ago, Clinton and Rice were regarded by many as a marquee matchup for the White House.LiNeBrEaKNow Rice will get to act as tutor for the incoming secretary of state, who, Rice predicted over the weekend, will be a hit as the nation's top diplomat.LiNeBrEaK"I think she is going to be terrific," Rice said on ABC's "This Week," recalling how she met Clinton when the then-First Lady brought daughter Chelsea to visit Stanford University.LiNeBrEaK"Hillary Clinton is somebody of intelligence, and she'll do a great job," Rice said. "She also has what's most important to being secretary of state, and that is that you love this country and you represent it from a basis of faith in its values."LiNeBrEaKBesides those kind words, Rice's foreign policy initiatives over the past year or two have been shifting closer to those called for by Clinton and President-elect Barack Obama, who favor more talks with antagonistic foreign leaders.LiNeBrEaKA source familiar with the transition confirmed the pair was to dine at Rice's Watergate apartment, but declined to elaborate on the agenda.LiNeBrEaKAnother source confirmed Clinton's daytime visit to the State Department.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden were planning to meet with another high-profile Democrat today: Al Gore.LiNeBrEaKThe former vice president, whose crusade against global warming won him the Nobel Peace Prize last year, will chat with Obama and Biden about "energy and climate change and how policies in this area can stimulate the economy and create jobs," said transition spokesman Nick Shapiro. mmcauliff@nydailynews.com	US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (91%); STATE DEPARTMENTS and FOREIGN SERVICES (91%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (79%); FOREIGN POLICY (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (77%); JOB CREATION (73%); NOBEL PRIZES (68%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (68%); GLOBAL WARMING (63%); AWARDS and PRIZES (63%) STATE DEPT; MEETING; HILLARY CLINTON; CONDOLEEZZA RICE  		STANFORD UNIVERSITY (56%)  			UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 9, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Daily News, L.P.

Daily Press (Newport, Virginia)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	HU leader seeks to save NASA Langley's funding: Harvey will hold a Dec. 11 luncheon to build support for the Hampton research center.  	Jon Cawley, Daily Press, Newport News, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	384 words  	Dec. 9--HAMPTON -- Hampton University President William R. Harvey is spearheading an effort to rev up support for NASA Langley Research Center.LiNeBrEaKHarvey was not forthcoming with details when asked about the effort, but university spokeswoman Yuri Rodgers Milligan confirmed that Harvey planned to host a meeting on campus "with community leaders, politicians and business people to talk about the future of NASA Langley." LiNeBrEaKAnna McNider, a volunteer lobbyist with Hampton-based NASA Aeronautics Support Team -- a group that has been working since 1998 to preserve the center's funding -- said the Dec. 11 luncheon is not to be an attempt to establish a new advocacy group. Instead, Harvey is trying to get the community's leadership re-engaged in the process to head off any potential budget cuts, she said.LiNeBrEaK"We've been fighting this for years. We've been successful every year. ..," she said. "Overall, the budget continues to get cut. NASA is going to continue to have budget pressure."LiNeBrEaKMcNider said that with NASA's involvement with the International Space Station concluded, and no currently operating space shuttle, the center's available workload is going to continue to decline.LiNeBrEaK"The state of NASA today is as bad as it's been in the last 10 to 15 years," she said.LiNeBrEaKGiven those developments, NASA's salvation might lie closer to Earth.LiNeBrEaK"The push has been the need to take care of things at home -- atmospheric science (climate change research) and aeronautics," McNider said.LiNeBrEaKSeveral years ago, Hampton University launched its Center for Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and has since worked to grow that department's prominence.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, Hampton University became the first historically black college or university to have complete mission control over a NASA operation when it launched a research satellite into orbit to study noctilucent, or "night shining," clouds 50 miles above the earth.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Detroit Free Press Tom Walsh column: Give Wagoner more credit  	Tom Walsh, Detroit Free Press  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	611 words  	Dec. 9--These are somber, serious economic times -- but it's still hard to hang up from a 10-minute phone chat with Bob Lutz without chuckling.LiNeBrEaK"If Congress wants a sacrifice, it should be me," Lutz declared Monday afternoon as he defended his boss, General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner.LiNeBrEaK"I'm older," Lutz said. "And I've made politically incorrect remarks about global warming, so it should be me." LiNeBrEaKWe were talking, ironically, just as one of the greenest of green Democrats, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was announcing a new bill that would quickly send $15 billion in loans to Detroit's neediest auto companies, GM and Chrysler LLC.LiNeBrEaKThere would be strings attached, there would be shared sacrifice and strict oversight to ensure that Detroit gets lean and green and viable. But no sacrificial Detroit auto executives' heads on platters, at least not yet, despite chatter about Wagoner's ouster possibly being a condition for GM to get aid.LiNeBrEaKIt's probably best that Lutz, 76, GM's vice chairman and head of global product development, didn't do too much public chirping this past month while GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co. were pleading for federal loans to keep their companies afloat.LiNeBrEaKLike many in Detroit, Lutz has difficulty suppressing his disdain for the comments certain senators and TV talking heads made about the self-inflicted problems of the domestic auto industry.LiNeBrEaK"It just infuriates to hear supposedly intelligent people describe the GM of the 1980s as if it was today," Lutz told me.LiNeBrEaKAs I said, it's probably good that Lutz wasn't testifying before the House and Senate committees. Wagoner and his fellow Detroit CEOs weren't the world's most persuasive orators, but they did do the abject begging necessary in Washington to get Congress to provide the rescue funds.LiNeBrEaKLutz, who earlier this year called global warming "a crock of" well, you know what, might not have been so meek.LiNeBrEaKHe has worked for GM, Chrysler, Ford and BMW in his storied career, and he can be highly critical of all four if you get him going. "You could argue," he said Monday, "that some past GM chairmen were merely building occupiers, not builders." But Wagoner, GM's chairman since 2003 and CEO since 2000, has done an amazing job of changing the industrial giant.LiNeBrEaK"GM used to have 22 different purchasing organizations," he said. "It's now down to one."LiNeBrEaKEven the possible phaseout of GM's Saturn division, he said, was in the works well before Congress demanded that GM produce a so-called viability plan by Dec. 2 to show it can become self-sufficient and pay back its loans. Saturn has its best-reviewed product lineup in years, including the Aura sedan. But GM management made a proactive move to look at phasing out the brand because its sales didn't match the critical acclaim. "We had to reassess. There's simply not enough money to support all the brands," Lutz said.LiNeBrEaKHis point: GM in general and Wagoner in particular are gutsier than they've been given credit for.LiNeBrEaK"Against the advice of a lot of people," Lutz pointed out, "Rick made an unconventional and bold move to hire me, at age 70, to come in a run product development. You talk about bold moves -- that certainly was one."LiNeBrEaKContact TOM WALSH at 313-223-4430 or twalsh@freepress.com	AUTOMAKERS (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); RURAL DEVELOPMENT (75%); PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (51%)  	GENERAL MOTORS CORP (94%); MOTORS LIQUIDATION CO (94%)  		GMP (PAR) (94%); GMB (BRU) (94%); GM (NYSE) (94%) NYSE:GM, NYSE:F, XETRA:BMW, RTS:STRN  	NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK and UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (94%); NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING (94%) General  	DETROIT, MI, USA (94%) MICHIGAN, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 9, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Detroit Free Press   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	RICK WAGONER (94%); NANCY PELOSI (57%)  	20081209-DE-Detroit-Free-Press-Tom-Walsh-column-1209  	DE  												
Duluth News-Tribune (Minnesota)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	State tries to save north-woods icon  	John Myers, Duluth News Tribune, Minn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	520 words  	Dec. 9--Wildlife experts from across North America were in Duluth Monday to help jump-start an effort to save Minnesota's moose.LiNeBrEaKHit hard by parasites and warmer weather, Minnesota's moose population is shrinking, and experts fear the state may lose the big, beloved animal for good. LiNeBrEaK"We're going to figure this out. We're going to set a course that's proactive,'' said Laurie Martinson, deputy director of the state's Department of Natural Resources, which held its first-ever moose summit at the Inn on Lake Superior.LiNeBrEaK"There's nothing that makes your heart beat faster [than seeing a moose], and we want to make sure we save that for future generations,'' she said.LiNeBrEaKThe agency announced a seven-month moose advisory committee that will decide what research is needed to understand moose issues and to develop a species survival plan. The 24-member committee is to report next summer on what should be done and will look at habitat, disease, parasites, hunting and climate, among other issues.LiNeBrEaKBut a warming climate may be too much for moose to overcome, said Rolf Peterson, a world-renowned moose expert from Michigan Technological University.LiNeBrEaK"I don't know that we can do it,'' Peterson said of preserving the species in Minnesota. "The changes we've set in motion in terms of climate change are already there, are already in motion.''LiNeBrEaKShorter winters, hotter summer days and more extreme climate are combining against moose on the southern edge of their natural range, Peterson said.LiNeBrEaK"Things are just changing too fast for moose to hang on in all of their former range," he said. "It will be a challenge to hang onto a species [so affected] by summertime heat,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKPeterson said moose are hit hard by even moderately warmer days because of their black coat, thick hair and inability to perspire. Moose can lose heat only by breathing faster, he noted. When they're overheated, they don't eat, preventing them from gaining enough weight during summer to survive the winter. It's believed some elderly and diseased moose even perish from heatstroke.LiNeBrEaKOther factors include a brain worm carried by deer that is harmless to whitetails but often fatal to moose. In areas of even modest deer densities -- about 10 deer per square mile -- the parasite becomes prevalent, and moose die out.LiNeBrEaKWarmer weather also leads to infestations of winter ticks, which bother moose so much they rub off their insulating hair, leaving them vulnerable to death by exposure.LiNeBrEaKIn contrast to Minnesota, North Dakota's prairie is seeing its moose population expand slowly. There, liver flukes, ticks and brain worms are almost nonexistent despite warmer weather, said Bill Jensen of the North Dakota Department of Game and Fish.

El Paso Times (Texas)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	$15 million collaborative to help city save energy  	Diana Washington Valdez, El Paso Times, Texas  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	381 words  	Dec. 9--EL PASO -- The city of El Paso has a head start on the green revolution President-elect Barack Obama envisions will save energy and create new clean jobs, Mayor John Cook says. LiNeBrEaKOn Monday, Cook and other dignitaries stood next to the Armijo Aquatic Center in South El Paso to announce a $15 million collaboration between Johnson Controls and El Paso Electric Co. intended to reduce the city's energy use and save taxpayers $1. 7 million each year.LiNeBrEaKThe project includes installing a solar energy system to heat the Armijo pool and seven other pools in El Paso, and investing in retrofits for street lights and for heating, cooling and lighting at city facilities.LiNeBrEaK"(Armijo) is but a snapshot of the city's sustainability efforts at 53 facilities and at more than 600 intersections," said Marty Howell, the city's sustainability manager.LiNeBrEaKCook said the project will help reduce the city's energy consumption by 18 million kilowatt hours per year, plus "create 110 new jobs and eliminate 11,300 tons of air pollutants (annually), which is equivalent to removing 1,950 cars from the road each year."LiNeBrEaKOn Tuesday, the city will consider a resolution asking Obama and the incoming Congress to invest stimulus money in local energy-conservation programs as a quick way to create jobs, revitalize the economy and promote energy independence.LiNeBrEaKCook said El Paso's project provides a blueprint for a green economy led by local governments.LiNeBrEaKRoger Dickinson, co-chairman of Climate Communities andLiNeBrEaKSacramento County, Calif., supervisor, said "Climate Communities and ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) USA are organizing city and county leaders from across America to make sure federal decision makers understand the essential role of local governments in reducing energy use and addressing climate change."LiNeBrEaKDiana Washington Valdez may be reached at dvaldez@elpasotimes.com; 546-6140.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Final Edition	Waste morphs into energy &lt;|&gt; More methane could reduce costs  	DON BEHM, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	B News; Pg. 3  	838 words  	Sun seekers and swimmers put off by slimy, foul-smelling cladophora algae covering Lake Michigan beaches and rocky shorelines in summer have a pair of new allies in the ongoing battle with the nuisance plant: Daniel Zitomer and hungry microbes.LiNeBrEaK Where some see a putrid eyesore, Zitomer sees a sweet opportunity to make energy. LiNeBrEaK Allow bacteria and other microbes known as archaea to digest the stringy algae in enclosed tanks and the end product is methane, said Zitomer, an associate professor of engineering and director of the Water Quality Center at Marquette University.LiNeBrEaK The same goes for animal droppings at the Milwaukee County Zoo, as well as waste from food processing, candy making or even distilling liquor. Each is rich in organic carbon compounds, and they, too, could yield methane if digested by a diverse set of microbes.LiNeBrEaK Then, Zitomer says, burn the methane to generate electricity to lessen demand for energy from coal or natural-gas-fired power plants and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases from the power plants that could contribute to global warming and climate change.LiNeBrEaK The tanks and microbes he wants to fill with cladophora and organic wastes from the community are at the South Shore Wastewater Treatment Plant in Oak Creek.LiNeBrEaK The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District uses bacteria and archaea to digest human feces and other sewage solids removed during the beginning of the treatment process at the Jones Island and South Shore plants. The blend is mixed and heated in four separate tanks with capacities of 3 million gallons each and two smaller tanks with half that capacity at South Shore.LiNeBrEaK Nearly a decade ago, Zitomer identified a seasonal waste - aircraft de-icing fluids from Mitchell International Airport - that could be poured into the digesters to boost methane production.LiNeBrEaK Christmas will come early again this year for billions of bacteria and other microbes in the below-ground tanks at the South Shore plant. The winter's first tanker full of de-icing waste - propylene glycol and water - arrived last week.LiNeBrEaK The addition of glycol to the tanks has the same effect as tossing sugar-loaded candy to children: It sets off a feeding frenzy among bacteria and archaea, Zitomer said.LiNeBrEaK Glycol molecules are broken apart by bacteria, then quickly fermented into acids, which are converted to methane by the archaea. Both groups of microbes working in the tanks thrive in warm, oxygen-free environments.LiNeBrEaK Since 2000, the airport has shipped between 250,000 and 300,000 gallons of the waste each winter to the South Shore plant. Tankers arrived more frequently last winter, however, and the treatment plant received a record 500,000 gallons.LiNeBrEaK In October, a separate partnership between InSinkErator, the Racine-based maker of food waste grinders, and Outpost Natural Foods on S. Kinnickinnic Ave. started sending small volumes of ground vegetables to the digesters at South Shore.LiNeBrEaK In 2007, the total energy value of methane produced in the digesters was estimated at $1. 9 million, MMSD chemical engineer Jeff Schilling said. That dollar figure equals the money MMSD saved by reducing energy purchases for the plant. No estimate was available on the value of methane provided by adding the de-icing waste, he said.LiNeBrEaK The district still needed to buy $1 million worth of electricity for its South Shore plant last year, Schilling said. Electricity primarily operates pumps in the treatment system and lighting at the plant.LiNeBrEaK MMSD also bought nearly $675,000 worth of natural gas for South Shore in 2007. Natural gas is used to heat buildings there and is burned in engines that run large air compressors for one step in the sewage treatment process.LiNeBrEaK Methane created in the digesters is burned to run some of the air compressors and to generate electricity.LiNeBrEaK Creating more methane would further reduce MMSD energy costs in future years, according to Peter Topczewski, MMSD's water quality protection manager.LiNeBrEaK "There is plenty of capacity in our digesters for more waste to make more methane," Topczewski said.LiNeBrEaK The district's commission has agreed to spend up to $150,000 for Zitomer's next search for wastes that can further boost methane yields in the tanks.LiNeBrEaK We Energies has contributed $157,894 to the project along with $28,000 from Veolia Water Services, the private company hired to operate MMSD treatment plants, deep tunnels, the Milorganite factory and regional collector sewers. Marquette has committed $30,000.LiNeBrEaK Beginning in January, Zitomer  will identify as many as 15 types of waste to be tested for potential yields of methane and for contaminants that might harm South Shore's microbes. The four top options will be fed to digester microbes in small, laboratory-size containers to confirm the earlier methane analysis before any of the wastes are poured into the tanks at South Shore for testing.

Because of the large number of calls we receive, we cannot publish all the comments. LiNeBrEaKOil companies should foot billLiNeBrEaK*The oil companies should bail out the automakers. Gas-guzzlers made the oil companies rich. At the very least, Exxon Mobile should donate the billion dollars they saved thanks to the Republicans on the Alabama Supreme Court.LiNeBrEaKSupports 'flatulence tax'LiNeBrEaK*I believe the flatulence tax on farm animals is a good idea. All animals are flatulent, which contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gases. Even some humans are flatulent. It would do us all good to cut back on our eating. It would be good for the air as well as our waistlines.LiNeBrEaKEditor's note: The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed charging fees for air-polluting animals. The law was considered after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases emitted by cows and hogs through belching and flatulence amounts to air pollution. The proposed law would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog. The EPA is reviewing public comments and doesn't have a timetable for the next steps, an EPA official said.LiNeBrEaKOfficials back to bickeringLiNeBrEaK*This is to all the Fairhope voters who voted for Mayor Tim Kant and the incumbents on the City Council. Thank you so very much for four more years of bickering between the council and the mayor's office. Folks, you got what you deserved.LiNeBrEaKRetrain current employeesLiNeBrEaK*I read the article about the $2. 4 million recreation center in Fairhope and no money to staff the facility. I believe that we have enough employees working for the city of Fairhope. Eliminate a few positions at the city facility at the south end of Section Street, the maintenance building, and put them to work at the new recreation center. Guess what? No cost to the taxpayer. What we don't need is another bridge loan. With a little training we will have a city employee smart enough to run a recreation center. That is how we got our current mayor.LiNeBrEaKVeto right thing to doLiNeBrEaK*I certainly applaud Mayor Kant's veto of the variance for the building height. The Planning and Zoning Commission can't help us at all if the City Council constantly grants variances.

Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration. LiNeBrEaK  Name: Raul M. GrijalvaLiNeBrEaK  Being considered for: Interior secretaryLiNeBrEaK  Would bring to the job: Strong support from southwestern environmental groups garnered during his tenure as a member of the House Committee on Natural Resources and his time as chairman of that group's subcommittee on national parks, forests and public lands. Has shown activist impulses during a three-term Congressional career representing the  Seventh District in Arizona, and has been particularly visible on public lands issues, fire prevention and water-allocation questions in his native Arizona and around the interior West.LiNeBrEaK  Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Hispanics and environmental groups who were important members of Mr. Obama's campaign coalition and who strongly support Mr. Grijalva.LiNeBrEaK  In his own words:''Across the West, a stealth movement is building for certain special interests to gain control of public lands. Special favors are being granted for oil and gas leasing, uncontrolled recreation, road building and other development in places that were previously set aside because of local citizen plans and land-use designations. It is happening here in Arizona. If you value public lands and believe strongly that management decisions should be conservative and cautious, you'll join me in opposition to the Bush administration's outdated land-management policies.'' (Tucson Citizen, op-ed article, Nov. 12, 2003)LiNeBrEaK  Used to work as: A member of the Tucson Unified School District Governing Board. He ran for the seat in 1974 to increase Latino representation on the board. He became a Pima County supervisor in 1989 and remained on the board for 13 years. Mr. Grijalva was elected to Congress in 2002 to the seat once held by Morris Udall, a longtime Congressional champion of protecting large swaths of federal land from industrial activity.LiNeBrEaK  Also known for: Trying to have federal agencies, including the Interior Department, consider the impact on climate change when making decisions on land-use planning and on what kinds of activities to permit on public lands. Mr. Grijalva also earned early credit for his role in creating the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, which brought together business interests, landowners and environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK  Carries as baggage: Little experience managing organizations, and the Interior Department is one of the most managerially challenged and hydra-headed departments in government.LiNeBrEaK  Biography: Born in 1948, three years after his Mexican father immigrated to the United States as a bracero, a laborer brought in by the United States government to replace American ranch hands who had gone to war. ... bachelor's degree in sociology from the University of Arizona in 1987; he started college, dropped out, married and had children, then went back to earn his degree. ... wife, Ramona, and daughters are experts in library science (he has three daughters and one granddaughter). ... likes to hike. ... enthusiastically roots for University of Arizona basketball teams.

The New York Times 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	In New Era, Timber's Struggles Stir Broad Concern and Support  	By KIRK JOHNSON  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 20  	1172 words  	A scramble is under way here in Montana to save the historically important, culturally resonant timber industry -- once a pillar of the state's identity, now under siege as demand for housing and wood products has plummeted in the national economic downturn.LiNeBrEaK  But what makes this debate different from those about saving automobile makers or banks and whoever else is in line for a bailout are the multiple layers of connection to things that might seem to have nothing to do with two-by-fours, plywood or even jobs.LiNeBrEaK  Climate change, for example -- how to manage state and federal forest lands as new diseases and insects threaten them in a warmer future -- and the soaring costs of fighting wildfires in the West have both become part of the discussion. If the state loses its base of roughly 200 interconnected sawmills, pulp buyers and family-owned tree-cutting contractors, advocates say, who will be left to work in the woods to make them usable, beautiful and safe, and at what cost?LiNeBrEaK  ''Our fear is that we could lose our infrastructure -- the base of knowledge and experience of working in the forest,'' said Mary Sexton, the director of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. ''Once it's gone, it's gone.'' LiNeBrEaK  Ms. Sexton is part of a team of state officials, business leaders and environmentalists combing through lists of ideas to reduce costs to sawmills or help them find new sources of revenue to raise their chances of getting by and getting through. Elected officials in Washington are concentrating on speaking up for timber in the next stimulus package that the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama is putting together.LiNeBrEaK  For logging and sawmill operators, the coalition has inspired hope. The difference is stark, they say, between the environment they face today, however bleak, and the  erosion of their industry in recent years. In the early 1980s, by contrast, when a bad recession wiped out much of the industry, the timber wars were still in high and florid passion, and many environmentalists were more likely to dance on a lumber company's grave than work to save it. Almost 20 percent of the state's lumber-mill jobs have disappeared since 2005, according to state figures. LiNeBrEaK  ''The difference today is that we have built a lot of long-term relationships, partners in the conservation community who make things happen on the ground,'' said Gordy Sanders, resource manager at Pyramid Mountain Lumber, a family-owned sawmill in this small town northeast of Missoula. ''In the early '80s that wasn't there.''LiNeBrEaK  Groups like the Wilderness Society, which is working on contracts to expand lower-cost wood supplies to mills like Pyramid, say that working forests with controlled harvests of trees are healthier, safer and more likely to be preserved, and that small towns like Seeley Lake with an anchoring employer are less prone to real estate speculation and development.LiNeBrEaK  But the organization's regional director, Robert Ekey, conceded that such a strategy was easier now because the industry is only a shadow of its former might. Mr. Ekey said, the lumber industry is no longer a threat to the landscape; it is a necessity. Montana is the nation's fourth-largest state, with about 26,000 square miles of national forest.LiNeBrEaK  ''Timber cutting is one-seventh what it was on Forest Service lands 20 or 25 years ago at its height,'' Mr. Ekey said. ''Then, the environmental movement rightly had to be about, 'no,' and how to stop it.'' Now, he added: ''We're at the level where we can really have a good rational discussion -- what does success look like? What does successful forest management look like?'' LiNeBrEaK  The years of experience as the industry faded around much of the West -- mainly as a result of reduced timber sales in the national forests -- has also given people here in Montana a glimpse of what can happen when an industry does go away. In Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, for example, once-formidable forest industries have all but disappeared over the last decade, leading to higher costs for forest management and fire protection; a recent study at the University of Montana said that forest costs to taxpayers and landowners could quadruple in Montana in coming years if the industry is lost.  LiNeBrEaK  But the economic downswing is revealing how interconnected everything is, and how the smallest and most innocuous of things can loom large in a crisis.LiNeBrEaK  Think wood chips.LiNeBrEaK  Wood chips, the humble left over bark-and-end-piece crumbs of the logging business, have emerged this fall as an Achilles' heel in Montana.LiNeBrEaK  The chain of logic looks like this: Sawmills make beams and boards and logs for housing and are struggling with an inventory that mostly cannot be sold because of the record decline in housing starts. So they have been making ends meet by selling the pieces of bark and scrap to a mill near Missoula owned by Smurfit-Stone,  which makes chips into packaging material -- a corner of the consumer economy that until this fall was not suffering.LiNeBrEaK  But in just the last two months, consumers have retrenched and are buying fewer items that come in boxes made by the Smurfit-Stone mill, which has suddenly needed to buy fewer truckloads of chips from the sawmills. That has forced chip buyers and sellers into a scramble of prices, which have fallen by 15 percent since mid-September.LiNeBrEaK  ''They're doing everything they can to reduce payment for chips, which compounds the problems for the sawmills,'' said Hakan Ekstrom, the president of Wood Resources International, a company in Bothell, Wash., that tracks wood commodity prices.LiNeBrEaK  At Pyramid Mountain, managers told the company's 135 employees (25 of whom were laid off in early November) that the operation would close Thanksgiving week because the pulp mill was not buying chips. A last-minute sale to another mill, at a sharply reduced price, kept Pyramid running for the week, said the company's president, Roger Johnson, whose father, Fred, helped found the mill in 1949.LiNeBrEaK  But the crisis of timber is also a window, many people involved in the discussions say, into what things might look like in the future.LiNeBrEaK  Some people see a greater role in electricity production for mill operators, if federal incentives toward renewable energy make things like biomass or cogeneration -- using wood fiber to generate both electricity and heat -- more attractive or viable. Others see a reduced industry that finally gives up competing with more efficient mass market loggers in Canada and Asia and turns toward niche products with higher profit margins.LiNeBrEaK  In any case, many people say, the old arrogance that once typified timber's political swagger in Montana will be gone forever.LiNeBrEaK  ''Things will be more collaborative,'' said Roy Houseman Jr., the president of the United Steelworkers local that represents workers at the Smurfit-Stone mill. ''That will mean more amicable relations between industry and environmentalists,'' said Mr. Houseman, who was laid off in early November with 51 other workers at the plant.

The New York Times 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final	Where Are the New Jobs for Women?  	By LINDA HIRSHMAN. 	Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR; Pg. 35  	753 words  	Linda R. Hirshman is the author of ''Get to Work: A Manifesto for Women of the World.''LiNeBrEaK  BARACK OBAMA has announced a plan to stimulate the economy by creating 2. 5 million jobs over the next two years. He intends to use the opportunity to make good on two campaign promises -- to invest in road and bridge maintenance and school repair and to create jobs that reduce energy use and emissions that lead to global warming.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama compared his infrastructure plan to the Eisenhower-era construction of the Interstate System of highways. It brings back the Eisenhower era in a less appealing way as well: there are almost no women on this road to recovery.  LiNeBrEaK  Back before the feminist revolution brought women into the workplace in unprecedented numbers, this would have been more understandable. But today, women constitute about 46 percent of the labor force. And as the current downturn has worsened, their traditionally lower unemployment rate has actually risen just as fast as men's. A just economic stimulus plan must include jobs in fields like social work and teaching, where large numbers of women work. LiNeBrEaK  The bulk  of the stimulus program will provide jobs for men, because building projects generate jobs in construction, where women make up only 9 percent of the work force. LiNeBrEaK  It turns out that green jobs are almost entirely male as well, especially in the alternative energy area. A broad study by the United States Conference of Mayors found that half the projected new jobs in any green area are in engineering, a field that is only 12 percent female, or in the heavily male professions of law and consulting; the rest are in such traditional male areas as manufacturing, agriculture and forestry. And like companies that build  roads, alternative energy firms also employ construction workers and engineers.LiNeBrEaK  Fortunately, jobs for women can be created by concentrating on professions that build the most important infrastructure -- human capital. In 2007, women were 83 percent of social workers, 94 percent of child care workers, 74 percent of education, training and library workers (including 98 percent of preschool and kindergarten teachers and 92 percent of teachers' assistants). LiNeBrEaK  Libraries are closing or cutting back everywhere, while demand for their services, including their  Internet connections, has risen. Philadelphia's proposal last month to close 11 branches  brought people into the street to protest. LiNeBrEaK  Many of the jobs women do are already included in Mr.  Obama's campaign promises. Women are teachers, and the campaign promised to provide support for families with children up to the age of 5, increase Head Start financing and quadruple the money spent on Early Head Start to include a quarter-million  infants and toddlers. Special education, including arts education, is heavily female as well. Mr. Obama promised to increase financing for arts education and for the National Endowment for the Arts, which supports many school programs. LiNeBrEaK  During the campaign, Mr. Obama also promised that the first part of his plan to combat urban poverty would be to replicate a nonprofit organization in New York called the Harlem Children's Zone in 20 cities across the country. The group, which  works to improve the quality of life for children and families in the Harlem neighborhood, employs several hundred people in full- and part-time jobs. By making good on this promise, Mr. Obama could create thousands of  jobs for women in social work, teaching and child care.LiNeBrEaK  Unlike the proposal to rebuild roads and bridges, the Harlem Children's Zone program is urban, and thus  really green. If cities become more inviting, more people will live in them -- and that means they will drive less, using less fuel. The average New Yorker's greenhouse gas footprint is only about 29 percent as large as that of the average American; the city is one of the greenest places in America. LiNeBrEaK  Maybe it would be a better world if more women became engineers and construction workers, but programs encouraging women to pursue engineering have existed for decades without having much success. At the moment, teachers and child care workers still need to support themselves. Many are their families' sole support. LiNeBrEaK  A public works program can provide needed economic stimulus and revive America's concern for public property. The current proposal is simply too narrow. Women represent almost half the work force -- not exactly a marginal special interest group. By adding a program for jobs in libraries, schools and children's programs, the new administration can create jobs for them, too.

The New York Times 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Late Edition - Final		From John Tierney's blog, nytimes.com/tierneylab.	Section D; Column 0; Science Desk; POSTINGS RECENT ENTRIES FROM OUR BLOGS; Pg. 8  	518 words  	Dot EarthLiNeBrEaK  From Andrew C. Revkin's blog, nytimes.com/dotearth.LiNeBrEaK  I recently asked whether the world was poised to enter a ''trance'' on climate policy, given the focus on economic turmoil and the plunge in oil prices. Now Maxwell Boykoff of Oxford has looked at climate coverage over the last four years in 50 newspapers in 20 countries (along with a colleague, Maria Mansfield) and finds that the news media may have entered it already. LiNeBrEaK  ''It does seem like stagnation or decreasing coverage,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''I'm curious about links between that and possible interpretations by negotiators of decreased public pressure to put forward a strong agreement leading into Copenhagen,'' where the United Nations Climate Change Conference is to start next November.LiNeBrEaK  Of course, the burst of coverage in 2007, surrounding the release of the fourth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, could be seen as the journalistic equivalent of a global heat wave propelled by El Nino warming -- creating a peak that distorts a trend. LiNeBrEaK  TierneyLabLiNeBrEaK  Some researchers in substance-abuse treatment are alarmed at reports that Representative Jim Ramstad, Republican of Minnesota, may be the White House's next drug czar -- the director of the office of National Drug Control Policy.LiNeBrEaK  In a joint letter to President-elect Barack Obama, they write: ''This country needs a drug czar who supports evidence-based policies and one who will make decisions based on science, not politics or ideology.'' These critics fault Mr. Ramstad for opposing syringe-exchange programs, as well as efforts to stop the arrest of patients who use medical marijuana.LiNeBrEaK  Those positions put Mr. Ramstad at odds with campaign pledges made by Mr. Obama, as noted in another joint letter to him from the Drug Policy Alliance and more than three dozen other organizations. They urge him to reject Mr. Ramstad and instead nominate a drug czar with a public-health background ''who is able to show strong leadership on the issues you believe in.''LiNeBrEaK  WellLiNeBrEaK  From Tara Parker-Pope's blog, nytimes.com/well.LiNeBrEaK  Seventy is the new 57.LiNeBrEaK  Researchers from the University of Michigan and the Max-Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin surveyed 516 people ages 70 to 104, asking such questions as how old they typically feel compared with the age on their birth certificate. Individual responses varied, but the average gap between chronological age and subjective age was 13 years. Among participants who were particularly healthy and active, the gap was even wider.LiNeBrEaK  Researchers say the data are important because cultural expectations of people during their older years often are at odds with how seniors perceive themselves.LiNeBrEaK  As children, we typically feel slightly older than we really are, but around age 25 to 30 we begin to think of ourselves as younger. Other studies have shown that people between 40 and 70 feel about 20 percent younger than they really are.LiNeBrEaK  From Wesley: There's really only one bad thing about getting older: the older I get, the faster time passes.

The News and Advance (Lynchburg, Virginia)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	EDITORIAL: A Good Step in Caring for the Environment  	The News and Advance, Lynchburg, Va.  	COMMENTARY  	631 words  	Dec. 9--With the population increasing and the use of energy rising along with it, time will not stand still in the race against global climate change. That's why Gov. Timothy M. Kaine says he will not let the $2. 5 billion budget shortfall stand in the way of some proposals advanced last week by the Virginia Commission on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKThe governor has taken a prudent position that could help the state -- and ultimately the nation -- reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. He has also staked out a position that says the battle against global warming is important and that not even a recession should daunt efforts to reverse its effects. LiNeBrEaKSpeaking to the 30-member commission, Kaine said he intends to carry out as many of the panel's recommendations "as we reasonably can." He said that environmental and energy issues are going to be a top priority for him in 2009, the last year of his term. (The panel, by the way, was chaired by Secretary of Natural Resources Preston Bryant, Lynchburg's former representative in the House of Delegates.)LiNeBrEaKThe governor is keenly aware of the budget deficit that could go higher, but he said he intends to increase spending on environmental programs in 2009 by cutting programs elsewhere in the budget.LiNeBrEaKAs the wire services reported, Kaine expressed hope that the administration of President-elect Barack Obama, as part of a national stimulus package, will provide federal money for infrastructure projects in Virginia such as new rail lines and more public transit.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to creating jobs and minimizing traffic congestion, Kaine said the projects also would reduce air pollution and emissions of carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKAmong the goals set forth by the commission, which has been meeting for about a year, is one that Virginia reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels and by more than 80 percent by 2050. That initial goal is higher than the 30 percent cut the governor had asked by 2025. "Going further," he said, "makes a lot of sense."LiNeBrEaKThe commission also suggested that the state offer incentives for utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal, by 2025. It would be a voluntary target, however, something that environmental groups thought should be mandatory.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately, in the absence of a mandatory standard for renewable energy production, it will remain difficult for Virginia to reach the greenhouse gas emission reductions the commission recognizes are needed," said J.R. Tolbert, field organizer for Environment Virginia, an advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKThe commission also expressed support for developing more nuclear power in Virginia.LiNeBrEaKAnother recommendation -- one focusing on conservation -- urges the state to require energy efficiencies so Virginians use 19 percent less electricity in 2025 than they did in 2006.LiNeBrEaKEnergy conservation and the use of renewable resources are keys to sustaining programs that in the end will reverse the effects of greenhouse gases and global warming. The efforts of Virginia alone will not make a significant difference, but those efforts combined with programs in other states -- and other countries -- will make a difference by 2025 and beyond. That's the goal that Gov. Kaine has kept in view for the General Assembly and for all Virginians.

The Observer (La Grande, Oregon)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	High-level Legos - Students' software-controlled robots tackle climate change at tourney  	Dick Mason, The Observer, La Grande, Ore.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1344 words  	Dec. 9--The late Danish toy maker Ole Christiansen would have been stunned had he been at EOU Saturday.LiNeBrEaKChristiansen, who invented LEGOs in the 1930s, would have watched youths do once-unimaginable things with his toy building bricks -- make them come to life seemingly with artificial intelligence.LiNeBrEaKThe youths, ages 9 to 14, did so while competing at the annual regional FIRST LEGO League robotics tournament at EOU.LiNeBrEaKAbout 120 students from the Cove, Elgin, Union, John Day, Monument and Umatilla school districts participated. Students maneuvered, via computer programs, robots in the spacious open central area of the EOU Science Center before judges and anxious teammates, coaches and parents. LiNeBrEaKFew events in the science center generate such excitement each year. Indeed, there was so much cheering at times it almost seemed as if a sporting event was taking place.LiNeBrEaK"It was elevated. It was an electric atmosphere,'' said Greg Poor, a Union High School science teacher who is the coordinator of the Union School District's involvement in the FIRST LEGO League program.LiNeBrEaKThe atmosphere Poor and others spoke of lacked a "winning is the only thing'' feeling.LiNeBrEaK"A little girl said, 'We're not going to win. The other said, 'Who cares? We're having fun,'' said EOU computer science professor Frederick Pratter, who helped put on the tournament.LiNeBrEaKClimate change was the theme of this year's tournament. Students programmed their robots to complete 21 climate change-related tasks on an open table. Teams received points when their robots completed simulated tasks such as delivering a polar bear to an ice flow, placing insulation into a house, taking an ice core sample, making a levy higher and 17 other tasks.LiNeBrEaKMonths before the competition students began creating computer programs that directed their robots to complete a portion of the 21 challenges. Each team's objective was to get their robot to complete as many of the tasks as possible in 2 1/2 minutes. Teams ran their robots through three 2 1/2-minute rounds. Only their highest scoring round counted toward their final score.LiNeBrEaKAfter each of the first two rounds, students adjusted their computer programs to get their robots to operate more efficiently. Those changes were critical since once a robot started a run on the course students had no control of it. Each robot was completely reliant on the computer program created for it. No adjustments could be made once a robot started a 2 1/2-minute round.LiNeBrEaK"It was not like operating a radio-controlled airplane,'' Pratter said.LiNeBrEaKSome students programmed showmanship into their robots. The John Day Techno Team's robot was perhaps the biggest ham. Its team members, all from Canyon City, programmed their robot to wave an arm after it was finished. It waved between rounds but never during actual competition because of a programming glitch.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately it ran into a wall (which prevented it from waving in the last round),'' said Rachel Bentz, a member of the John Day School District Techno Team.LiNeBrEaKEOU computer science professor Richard Croft, the tournament's director, saw their robot wave outside the competition and said he was impressed.LiNeBrEaKTeams did not receive extra points for programming showmanship into their robots. What they did receive additional points for was how they fared in three other areas, all of which carried significant weight:LiNeBrEaK--a presentation of a climate-related research project they conducted.LiNeBrEaK--providing quality answers in an interview with EOU professors and others about how the teams had programmed and engineered their robots.LiNeBrEaK--how they fared on a teamwork challenge. Teams were presented with a challenge they had no knowledge of before hand. Each team then had to respond to it in a limited amount of time.LiNeBrEaKThe overall winner of the tournament was the Computadora Ella-bots team from Union High School. All six students on the team will qualify for a scholarship from EOU if they choose to attend Eastern and are admitted after graduating from high school. Each scholarship will provide a student $500 a year at EOU for four years.LiNeBrEaKThe students on the winning Computadora Ella-bots team, all ninth-graders, are Emma Stockhoff, Stephanie Warren, Kathryn Hepler, Casi Sipp, Jordin Lineback and Elizabeth Sheehy.LiNeBrEaKA team from the Union School District has won the tournament four of the past five years. Poor said this reflects the efforts of the many district teachers and staff members who help prepare students for the tournament.LiNeBrEaKPoor is struck by the enthusiasm students show in preparing for the competition each year. He can think of few other academic programs that generate such excitement.LiNeBrEaK"I've had students stay on their own in my classroom until 6 p.m. (preparing for the tournament),'' Poor said.LiNeBrEaKUnion's Computadora Ella-bots team was among seven at Saturday's regional competition that qualified for the state FIRST LEGO League Tournament Jan. 17-18 in Hillsboro.LiNeBrEaKSaturday's regional FIRST LEGO League qualifying tournament was the largest, in terms of participation, in the state, Croft said. Poor said that the tourney's success is a credit to excellent work done by EOU each year in putting it on.LiNeBrEaKUnion School District had 13 of the 22 teams present at Saturday's tournament.LiNeBrEaKCove had four teams, Elgin had two and Umatilla, Monument and John Day had one each.LiNeBrEaKElgin's teams had been preparing for the tournament since August. Colt Silver, an Elgin eighth-grader, said that preparing for it created a closer bond between him and his buddies on the team.LiNeBrEaK"We're better friends now,'' the Stella Mayfield School student said.LiNeBrEaKStudents in the Cove School District began getting ready for the tournament in early September. They worked 50 minutes a day four days a week in preparation, said Cameron McCowan, a Cove eighth-grader.LiNeBrEaKHe said that the preparation and competition is exciting but also stressful.LiNeBrEaK"It is nerve wracking,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKIt was also an experience that strengthened bonds of friendship.LiNeBrEaK"You end up understanding your real buddies a lot better,'' the Cove student said.LiNeBrEaKCove Superintendent Jeff Clark, who accompanied his students to Saturday's competition, was impressed with the problem-solving skills they displayed and the enthusiasm they showed in the weeks leading up to the event.LiNeBrEaK"It is a great thing to see how excited they are and how they are talking about it,'' Clark said.LiNeBrEaKThe FIRST LEGO League robotics program is now part of Cove's eighth-grade curriculum and will be added to its seventh-grade curriculum this spring. Clark said Cove is following the lead of the Union School District, which has made the FIRST LEGO League robotics program part of its curriculum for several years.LiNeBrEaK"We were inspired by Union,'' Clark said.LiNeBrEaKThe Cove superintendent is impressed with the problem-solving skills students develop through their involvement in the program.LiNeBrEaK"You see a lot kids really grow,'' Clark said.LiNeBrEaKThe superintendent also likes the way students in the robotics program have to actually create something from an idea.LiNeBrEaK"It is one thing to have an idea (for a product). It is another to build it.''LiNeBrEaKChampions Award: 1, Computadora Ella-bots, Union High School.LiNeBrEaKRunners up for Champions Award: Ace of Spades, Cove School District; Windowbots, Union High School; 4 e 8, Union High School; Climate Crime Stoppers, Union High School; and Cold Robots, Union High School.LiNeBrEaKYoung Team Award: Husky Bots, Elgin School District.LiNeBrEaKRookie Team Award: Old Folks, Union High School.LiNeBrEaKRobot Performance Award: Sons of Anarchy (and Nikoa), Cove School District.LiNeBrEaKRobot Design: Charlie's Fallen Angels, Cove School District.LiNeBrEaKResearch Project: Global Robotics, Union High School.LiNeBrEaKTeamwork: Elgin Huskies, Elgin High School.

Mortgage interest relief should also be an integral part of this new program.LiNeBrEaKIf the homeowner chooses to move and sell the home, the amount would be added to the sales price of the home which would be limited to no higher than the current appraised value.LiNeBrEaKLenders would be allowed to carry the total dollars in the program as a separate nonperforming asset class.LiNeBrEaKAs confidence flows back into the real estate market, home values could rise swiftly, erasing the amount shelved in the new program.LiNeBrEaKKEN MARTINLiNeBrEaKThe Dalles	COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); WIND ENERGY (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (84%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (73%); EMISSIONS (73%); CLIMATOLOGY (72%); EVIDENCE (71%); TEACHING and TEACHERS (67%); TERRORISM (67%); GLOBAL WARMING (66%); PARTICULATE MATTER (65%); MUSLIMS and ISLAM (63%); RELIGION (63%); SINGLE PARENTS (57%)  					PORTLAND, OR, USA (88%); SALEM, OR, USA (71%) OREGON, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 10, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  		GEORGE W BUSH (54%)

Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Final Edition; All Editions	Biofuels to power Continental plane;  Commercial flight to be a U.S. first 	Alison Grant, Plain Dealer Reporter  	BUSINESS; Pg. C1  	612 words  	Late in the morning on Jan. 7, a Continental Airlines jet is scheduled to lift off powered in part by algae from Hawaii and a tough shrub from Africa called jatropha.LiNeBrEaKThe historic flight, from Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, will mark the first time a commercial aircraft of a U.S. carrier has flown on biodiesel fuel. Airlines hope biofuels can reduce their dependence on jet fuel and lower global carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Boeing 737-800 will take off with two test pilots and an engineer, but no passengers, returning after two hours aloft. LiNeBrEaKJust one of the engines will be powered with biofuels. It will have a combination of 50 percent traditional jet fuel and 50 percent biofuel from derivatives of algae and jatropha.LiNeBrEaKThe crew will perform a variety of flight maneuvers expected to show that the biofuel blend can be substituted for regular fuel without diminishing performance or safety.LiNeBrEaKAirlines are captive to crude oil price swings and are eager to find alternative fuel sources. Crude has retreated to about $40 a barrel after spiking to nearly $150 a barrel last summer. But the relief is expected to be short-lived.LiNeBrEaKContinental burns 18 gallons of jet fuel to fly one passenger 1,000 miles on a mainline jet. The carrier has been retiring older, less fuel-efficient planes and retrofitting others with fuel-conserving "winglets." The moves have cut Continental's greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption by 35 percent since 1997.LiNeBrEaKStill, the Federal Aviation Administration expects carbon dioxide and other gases in the contrails of domestic jets to increase by 60 percent by 2025.LiNeBrEaKIt's too early to tell whether biofuels will get better mileage than jet fuels, spokesmen from Continental and Boeing said Monday.LiNeBrEaKBut the companies said biofuels are certain to be more environmentally friendly. Although they will generate about as much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases when they are burned in jet engines, they will remove CO2 from the atmosphere on the front end, when they are growing plants.LiNeBrEaKBoeing spokesman Terrance Scott said biofuels eventually will compete with the price of petroleum fuels, selling for $70 to $90 a barrel once they are fully commercialized.LiNeBrEaKIt could be three to five years before biofuels that are the most advanced in development - including jatropha, but not algae - are available to airlines. Even then, they probably will be a regional alternative, not worth the expense and environmental cost of shipping to distant markets.LiNeBrEaKThe algae used in Continental's test flight was cultivated in ponds of seawater in the Hawaiian paradise of Kona.LiNeBrEaKThe jatropha comes from farms in the equatorial African nations of Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique, as well as India. The woody plant, used for live fencing to keep cattle from crops, grows in marginal, arid soil. That makes it a hero to the sustainability movement because it doesn't divert food sources such as corn or soybeans to fuel, use up water or contribute to deforestation.LiNeBrEaKContinental is partnering on the Houston flight with Boeing; CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Snecma; refining technology developer UOP, a Honeywell company; and oil providers Sapphire Energy (algae) and Terrasol (jatropha). They have been collaborating for more than nine months on research, production and testing of the biofuel.LiNeBrEaKA Virgin Atlantic flight in February from London's Heathrow Airport to Amsterdam was the first time worldwide that a commercial aircraft flew on biofuel. Besides Continental, Air New Zealand and Japan Airlines plan biofuel test flights on commercial jets in coming months.LiNeBrEaKTo reach this Plain Dealer reporter: agrant@plaind.com, 216-999-4758	BIOFUELS (95%); COMMERCIAL and GENERAL AVIATION AIRCRAFT (90%); AIRLINES (90%); BIOMASS (90%); JET FUEL (90%); OIL and GAS PRICES (89%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (89%); SEAWEED and ALGAE (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); CIVIL AVIATION (78%); AIRPORTS (78%); PASSENGER and CARGO AIRCRAFT (78%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (78%); AIRCRAFT ENGINES (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (76%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (76%); CRUDE OIL MARKETS (73%); CRUDE OIL PRICES (73%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (73%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (67%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (62%)  	BOEING CO (92%); CONTINENTAL AIRLINES INC (92%)  		BOE (LSE) (92%); BAB (BRU) (92%); BA (NYSE) (92%); CAL (NYSE) (92%)  	NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE and SPACE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE and ENGINE PARTS MANUFACTURING (92%); NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING (92%); SIC3761 GUIDED MISSILES and SPACE VEHICLES (92%); NAICS481112 SCHEDULED FREIGHT AIR TRANSPORTATION (92%); NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION (92%); SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED (92%)  	HOUSTON, TX, USA (92%) HAWAII, USA (92%); TEXAS, USA (92%) AFRICA (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); MOZAMBIQUE (79%); MALAWI (78%); TANZANIA (73%)  	December 10, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Plain Dealer Publishing Co.   																
Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	On the Waterfront: 'Green Flag' program reduces shippers' need for speed  	Kris Hanson, Press-Telegram, Long Beach, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	638 words  	Dec. 9--Port authorities have agreed to more than double a multimillion-dollar program that slashes dockage fees for shippers who slow down when entering and leaving the harbor, furthering an effort to alleviate smog-forming pollution from freight ships serving Southern California.LiNeBrEaKSince its inception in 2005, the "Green Flag" program has removed more than 75,000 tons of global-warming gases from local skies by offering 15percent rate cuts for carriers who slow to 12knots within 20 nautical miles of the harbor. The expanded program would provide a 25percent discount -- estimated at an additional $2. 3million -- for shippers who slow down within 40 nautical miles. LiNeBrEaKTo be eligible, a shipper must reduce speeds in at least 90percent of its port visits in a calendar year.LiNeBrEaKDon Snyder, the port's director of trade relations, estimates the port could spend up to $3. 95million next year if all carriers complied with the 40 nautical mile agreement. This year, the port spent about $1. 5million on rebates, with about 93percent of shippers participating.LiNeBrEaKIn 2007, air quality regulators estimate the program removed more than 680 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides and 26,700 tons of carbon dioxide gas, a global warming contributor, from local skies. Sulfur oxides and diesel particulate matter were reduced, by 453 tons and 60 tons, respectively.LiNeBrEaKLarge ocean vessels burn some of the world's dirtiest fuel -- a blend known as bunker fuel -- which regulatorsLiNeBrEaKestimate contains sulfur content as high as 27,000partspermillion. By comparison, diesel fuel sold for cars and trucks contains sulfur content no higher than 15partspermillion.LiNeBrEaKCompliance with the "Green Flag" program is handled by the Southern California Marine Exchange, a San Pedro agency that tracks incoming ship speeds with overhead satellite technology. Compliance has grown from 68percent of carriers in 2005 to 89percent in 2007, with 93percent expected this year.LiNeBrEaKMore alt-fuel trucks rolling in harborLiNeBrEaKCalifornia Cartage Company, one of Los Angeles' oldest and largest trucking firms, has purchased 132 natural gas trucks as it continues a massive turnover of its trucking fleet to comply with emission-reduction efforts in the nation's largest seaport.LiNeBrEaKThe company unveiled the new rigs Monday, which it purchased with financial assistance from the federal, state and regional air quality regulators and port authorities.LiNeBrEaKThe purchase, estimated to have cost more than $2. 4million, comes two months after the ports launched their "Clean Trucks" program, which banned all rigs built before 1989 from entering waterfront marine terminals.LiNeBrEaKThe measure continues through 2012, when only trucks meeting federal 2007 emission standards will be granted access.LiNeBrEaKAbout 16,000 rigs serve the harbor, which regulators list as the largest fixed source of air pollution in a region with the nation's poorest air quality. Trucks are estimated to account for about 20percent of port pollution, with locomotives, ships and dockside equipment contributing the rest.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia Cartage, owned by Bob Curry, whose father founded the firm in 1944, is one of the harbor's largest transportation companies, with offices in Carson, Wilmington, Long Beach and Los Angeles. The company contracts with more than 1,000 drivers, and also employs a stable of several hundred drivers, forklift operators and dispatchers.LiNeBrEaKkristopher.hanson@presstelegram.com, 562-499-1466	HARBORS and PORTS (90%); AIR POLLUTION (90%); HARBOR and PORT OPERATIONS (90%); SMOG (90%); AIR QUALITY (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (89%); PORT AUTHORITIES (89%); TRUCKING (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); SPECIAL FREIGHT TRUCKING (86%); MARINE CARGO HANDLING (78%); PARTICULATE MATTER (77%); DIESEL FUEL (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (72%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (71%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (70%); MOTOR VEHICLES (63%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (60%); SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY (50%)  	CALIFORNIA CARTAGE CO (63%)  			General  	LOS ANGELES, CA, USA (79%) CALIFORNIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 9, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Press-Telegram   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081209-LB-On-the-Waterfront-Green-Flag-program-reduces-shippers-need-for-speed-1209  	LB  												
The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   All Editions	Putting friendly face on menace  	By SIDNEY GOODMAN, Wire Services  	OPINION; Pg. A11  	849 words  	THOSE WHO don't want to look closely at nuclear power have underplayed the poisoning of our planet by radioactivity. Many have a sinister conflict of interest.LiNeBrEaKThe risk to humans from nuclear plant radiation is well-documented. The Radiation and Public Health Project demonstrated that when seven nuclear power plants closed, the health status of children improved in the areas surrounding the plants. "Nonsense" say nuclear promoters; that is junk science ? a term of opprobrium used first to ridicule claims that smoking tobacco is dangerous, now applied to findings about global warming and other environmental effects.LiNeBrEaKEvery honest investigation of radioactive contamination by highly qualified scientists has been labeled junk science. Here are some examples: LiNeBrEaK* In the 1950s, Alice Stewart was persecuted when she proved that there is no such thing as an absolutely safe dose of radiation from X-rays. Further proof resulted in reducing exposure in newer machines and introducing precautions.LiNeBrEaK* John W. Gofman was forced to resign from his position of associate drector of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory when he found that the rules for allowed exposure from nuclear plants were damaging. This is a man who was a nuclear pioneer with several discoveries, and who won a top award for medical research. His books on the medical effects of radiation on human health are classics.LiNeBrEaK* Radiologist Ernest Sternglass invented devices for the early development of nuclear energy. When he discovered that official reports of exposure were false and biased, he was smeared. Warehouse copies of his book "Secret Fallout," documenting real junk science by the nuclear industry were destroyed.LiNeBrEaK* A superb study of the effect of exposure to workers at Hanford by Thomas Mancuso was shelved because nuclear advocates did not like the results. Mancuso pioneered the science of health physics. To prevent more unwelcome findings, he was forced to take early retirement.LiNeBrEaK* Karl Z. Morgan, director of health physics at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was muzzled and forbidden to present his findings at a conference.LiNeBrEaK* Gordon MacLeod, director of the Pennsylvania Department of Health was fired when he protested the falsification of health data from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant accident.LiNeBrEaK* Independent readings by radiation chemist Chauncey Kepford found extremely high radioactivity readings 25 miles downwind of the Three Mile Island plant. There were no official meters to take readings downwind of the plant. Officials don't know and don't want to know that much more was released from that partial meltdown than they will ever admit. Kepford was fired from his teaching position at Pennsylvania State College.LiNeBrEaK* Robert Rowen was fired from the Humboldt nuclear plant for protesting the fixing of radiation meters. I met another man, who was inspector at the Millstone plant. He was fired when he refused to falsify emission data. Millstone leaked so badly that it produced a level of fallout like fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. There was a 58 percent increase in cancer downwind of Millstone over a five-year period. This consequence is "junk science" of course.LiNeBrEaKHigh-stakes gameLiNeBrEaKThe horror of nuclear weapons programs by nuclear nations has made it imperative to put a friendly face on nuclear technology. With multibillion dollar subsidies up for grabs, anyone who has threatened boondoggles has been censored or persecuted.LiNeBrEaKThere are many more people, than those mentioned, who have been repressed.LiNeBrEaKBefore he resigned from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Peter Bradford said, "The first casualty of nuclear power was the truth." He said, "The history of nuclear power is a history of silenced concerned, rigged studies and suppressed scientists."LiNeBrEaKPeople who howl the term junk science whenever honest investigations expose the truth are the same ones who have discovered a new law of physics: When you have a nuclear accident, the wind stops blowing. They are satisfied with a mere 10-mile evacuation zone around a nuclear plant.LiNeBrEaKThey claim it is good science to store radioactive wastes in highly earthquake prone regions where there is sometimes the presence of a volcano. They want to deregulate low level ? but very deadly low-level ? radioactive waste in ordinary garbage dumps. They want to ship radioactive waste through the most densely populated areas if they can save a few hundred dollars by selecting such routing.LiNeBrEaKThey refuse to accept full responsibility for the potential harm they foist on everyone else in the event of a nuclear accident. They need the Price Anderson Act that protects their property rights at the expense of everyone else. No other energy source requires such a federal law.LiNeBrEaKTheir claims violate the most elementary principles of physics, engineering, common sense and decency.LiNeBrEaKTheir actions are not "junk science." They aren't science at all. Science is supposed to be an error-correcting process. They corrupt this process when their subsidies are threatened.LiNeBrEaKSidney Goodman, an engineer, is a Mahwah resident and author of "Asleep at the Geiger Counter."

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Feds sign 'revolutionary' conservation deal  	By Susan Montoya Bryan Associated Press Writer  	NEWS; National; World  	751 words  	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management have signed agreements with an oil and gas company and a rancher to help protect two rare species in southeastern New Mexico, and federal officials hope the agreements will pave the way for cooperative conservation efforts across the country.LiNeBrEaKInterior Deputy Secretary Lynn Scarlett calls the agreements "significant," saying that until now federal wildlife managers had no framework to partner on conservation efforts with ranchers who have federal grazing permits or energy development companies that lease public land. LiNeBrEaK"I cannot tell those gathered here how significant this is, that we find a way through these tools to collaborate across boundaries public and private. Nature itself knows no boundaries," Scarlett said Monday during a signing ceremony at the Rio Grande Nature Center. "We need the tools that allow us to transcend those boundaries. The signing of this agreement is one such creative tool that helps us on our way."LiNeBrEaKThe agreements are aimed at helping the lesser prairie chicken and the sand dune lizard, both candidates for possible protection under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaKLesser prairie chickens are round, stocky ground-dwelling birds famous for their courtship displays. Conservationists say the species -- which has been a candidate for federal protection for more than a decade -- has declined by 90 percent over the past century and is facing threats that include energy development, climate change and the loss of their native prairie habitat.LiNeBrEaKThe sand dune lizard, which lives among sand dunes and shinnery oak in the southeast corner of the state, has been a candidate for endangered species protection since 2002. The lizard faces many of the same threats as the chicken.LiNeBrEaKUnder the conservation agreements, Lea County rancher Chris Brininstool and Marbob Energy Corp. of Artesia will take certain actions to protect the species and their habitat, including modifying fences to reduce collision by prairie chickens and relocating well sites to limit habitat disturbance.LiNeBrEaKIn return, Brininstool and Marbob have assurances they will be able to continue using the land regardless of whether the species ever comes under ESA protection.LiNeBrEaKFederal officials said they are in the process of getting more landowners and businesses to participate.LiNeBrEaK"No agency or group can accomplish this alone," said Benjamin Tuggle, regional director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. "Working together puts us in a stronger position to ensure conservation objectives are fulfilled."LiNeBrEaKScarlett said the goal of the agreements is to take steps with landowners and leasees who are willing to cooperate now rather than having to list the species and force regulatory changes.LiNeBrEaK"When you think about it, listing in some respects is a signal that we haven't done our jobs, that we've let these species decline," Scarlett said. "This is a tool to do our jobs and ensure that species flourish while they still are in numbers sufficient to carry forward. I think it absolutely is a key part to 21st century conservation."LiNeBrEaKScarlett said she hopes the agreements will serve as a model for other regions in the country that have species at risk on public lands.LiNeBrEaKBut some conservation groups say the federal government is being irresponsible by trying to avoid listing the prairie chicken and lizard under the Endangered Species Act.LiNeBrEaK"We believe it makes absolutely no sense for the Fish and Wildlife Service to be talking about avoiding listing either of these species," said Nicole Rosmarino of WildEarth Guardians.LiNeBrEaKThe group submitted comments to the agency earlier this year, saying that conservation agreements are voluntary and speculative and cannot replace the protections provided under the act. The group also argued that the agreements would not remove or reduce all of the threats facing the species, such climate change, drought and disease.LiNeBrEaK"The conservation measures are simply menus of possible tools that may be used.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Obama gains support to think big, act boldly on clean energy  	By Frank Davies Mercury News Washington Bureau  	BREAKING; Politics; News; National; Business; Lifestyle  	938 words  	WASHINGTON   Memo to Barack Obama on ways to revamp the nation's energy policy and boost the economy: Think big. Act boldly.LiNeBrEaKThat's the emerging consensus of policy experts, Bay Area clean-tech leaders and even hardened pols who know the obstacles. They are urging the president-elect to seize a rare opportunity and dramatically accelerate the nation toward a clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaK"We can't lose this moment   we have to do things in a big way," said Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania at a forum last week. LiNeBrEaKSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid told an energy conference at Google's Washington office to expect a large spending package when Congress convenes in January.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not concerned about spending money," he said. "It's the only way to get out of the hole that's been dug for us, and that applies to energy."LiNeBrEaKObama and congressional leaders are about to make key decisions that will show just how bold they want to be on the energy front:LiNeBrEaK* Obama's energy and environment team could be unveiled as early as this week. Those appointments will give clues on how aggressively Obama wants to move.LiNeBrEaK* With the recession getting worse and unemployment on the rise, pressure is building for a large stimulus plan, costing $500 billion or more, next month. Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and John Podesta, chief of the transition team, favor a large "green recovery" component of that package, including more spending on alternative fuels.LiNeBrEaK* Citing the threat of climate change, Obama has said he wants to push for strict limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, with utilities and manufacturers buying and trading pollution permits. But is setting up a complex cap-and-trade system achievable in 2009, with fears that it could boost energy prices in the short term?LiNeBrEaKObama enters the White House with lots of political capital, an expanded Democratic majority in Congress, and a raft of specific proposals from his own team and allies in the center-left think tanks of Washington.LiNeBrEaKPodesta, former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, heads one of those groups, the Center for American Progress. He became Obama's transition chief in August, three months before the election, and quietly began planning a fast start for the Obama presidency.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's center in September issued a $100 billion "green recovery" plan of tax credits, direct spending and loan guarantees to spur clean technology and energy efficiency and create 2 million jobs   a major Obama goal.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's group even forecast the impact on each state. California would receive $12. 7 billion, creating 235,000 jobs, under the plan. That could include federal funding for high-speed rail, backed by state voters in November.LiNeBrEaK"The investment described here is doable in the early days of a new administration," Podesta wrote three months ago.LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus package in January will include at least $15 billion for clean tech and energy efficiency, an Obama adviser told the New York Times. That would include money to weatherize homes and grants for mass transit.LiNeBrEaKReid and Obama have used similar language that the economic crisis is "an opportunity" to build a clean-tech infrastructure for the future while boosting jobs and growth in the short term.LiNeBrEaKJeff Anderson of San Francisco, who chaired Clean Tech for Obama during the campaign, said the Obama team "wants as many green elements as they can get" in the stimulus bill.LiNeBrEaK"What's important for a recovery is getting an immediate bang for your buck, and energy efficiency is easier stuff that you can do quickly," said Anderson.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the stimulus plan, the long-range effort to combat global warming will be a priority, Obama has promised.LiNeBrEaKBut complex cap-and-trade legislation raises big questions about costs, as long as the U.S. economy relies on oil and coal. Depending on how pollution permits are sold, utilities could face higher costs in the short term that they would pass on to consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental groups and many businesses say a cap-and-trade system is the only way to set a price on carbon and shift market forces in favor of renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe overarching question Obama faces is whether he can press for two complicated domestic initiatives   health care reform and tackling climate change   while focusing on the biggest priority, an economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKHistorian Matt Dallek of the University of California at Berkeley said the Obama team "is weighing how far and how fast they can move on all these things."LiNeBrEaK"It may help them to do health care and energy early, even if you don't get everything you want," Dallek said. "The election has given Obama a clear mandate and more space to act than presidents usually have, and they want to take advantage of that."LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.LiNeBrEaKNAME GAME FOR ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKBarack Obama has moved quickly to name his Cabinet, and speculation is building over who will fill key energy and environment jobs. Several Californians are in the running, according to media reports:LiNeBrEaKEnergy secretary: Dan Reicher, former Energy Department official and Google executive; John Bryson, retired California utility executive; Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, D-Kan.; FedEx chairman Fred Smith; Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash.; Ex-Rep.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Opinion: Why AB32 is a powerful economic stimulus  	By Margaret Bruce and Bruce S. Klafter Special to the Mercury News  	NEWS; Opinion  	686 words  	California is at a historic crossroads. We face three interrelated crises of global proportions: economic recession, energy insecurity and climate change. Because of economic uncertainty, some believe we cannot take risks or do anything differently. We know that doing more of what we have done will get us more of what we have gotten: recession, energy insecurity and climate change. From field to factory, laboratory to living room, Californians know now is the time for action. We need bold and comprehensive action that moves us from a 20th century fossil fuel-based economy to a new clean, secure, efficient and prosperous economy.LiNeBrEaKImplementing AB 32, California's Global Warming Solutions Act, will be a large stride down the path toward a sustainable economy. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) will vote Thursday on the Scoping Plan, a package of policies that implement California's landmark climate law mandating the reduction of global warming emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. We, and other like-minded business owners, community leaders, citizens, managers, entrepreneurs and investors urge the ARB to give the Scoping Plan a full-throated endorsement. LiNeBrEaKGiven the economic crisis, it is vital, now, more than ever, that California enact policies like those contained in the AB 32 Scoping Plan, which will act as powerful economic drivers to jump-start our economy. Analysis by the University of California-Berkeley provides hard evidence that over the last 35 years, California's ambitious energy policies designed to decrease consumption and increase cleaner sources have saved consumers $56 billion, generated 1. 5 million full-time jobs and $45 billion in payroll. California's history proves that clean energy policy is a powerful economic stimulus.LiNeBrEaKIf the state hadn't moved forcefully to decrease energy demand, we would be in a world of hurt right now   far more reliant on volatile energy prices, with more of our savings spent on dirty energy. Energy efficiency has helped Californians reduce their dependence on energy imports and direct more spending to job-creating goods and services inside our state. As a result of proactive energy policies, California has decreased its per capita carbon footprint to one of the lowest in the country while growing one of the most powerful economies in the world.LiNeBrEaKThe financial crisis is an example of what happens when we ignore clear and repeated signals of an impending emergency. Likewise, we now hear the repeated warnings about the impacts of global warming. If global warming emissions are not stabilized, we will experience a host of very expensive impacts, leaving no industry and no community untouched. Those who say now is not the time to act fail to consider the costs of inaction. UC-Berkeley recently estimated the price tag of global warming impacts as high as $46 billion a year, with trillions of dollars of assets at risk.LiNeBrEaKWhile California alone can't solve global warming, it can catalyze worldwide change by developing and marketing the innovative technologies it will take to solve this problem. In so doing, we can gain a leading edge in what is fast becoming a multibillion-dollar global clean-technology market.LiNeBrEaKWe are at a critical moment. The world's economy is in turmoil, and global warming emissions are rising faster than in the worst-case scenarios. We will not solve these problems with the same thinking that created them. Instead, California can unleash its powers of invention, and turn adversity into opportunity. Powerful public policy, like the AB 32 Scoping Plan, is the bold action required. We must adopt the AB 32 Scoping Plan, and begin the earnest work of implementation without delay   our economy and our environment demand swift and decisive action.LiNeBrEaKMargaret Bruce is the Western Regional Director for the Climate Group, an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to advancing business and government leadership on climate change. Bruce S. Klafter is the senior director and head of corporate responsibility and sustainability for Applied Materials. They wrote this article for the Mercury News.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Dec. 10 Readers' letters: U.S. might as well appoint a kommissar  	From Mercury News readers  	LETTERS; News; Opinion  	725 words  	Wake up, people: We're being takenLiNeBrEaKSo now the government is going to appoint a "czar of cars" (Page 1A, Dec. 9)   way to go, Nancy Pelosi. But why stop there, why not go all the way in nationalizing an industry and use the more appropriate Soviet era title of kommissar? People, wake up. Your government is about to give $15 billion in loans to a company like GM, which you could buy for $3 billion ($2. 93 billion market cap). That is like giving a $1 million mortgage on a house worth only $500,000. Will anyone learn?LiNeBrEaKGreg McMorrow LiNeBrEaKSan JoseLiNeBrEaKHow about Iacocca for car czar?LiNeBrEaKOne name jumped out at me after reading the Mercury News article (Page 1A, Dec. 9) about the "bailout" of the auto industry and comments about a car czar being appointed to track progress of this concept, and that name is Lee Iacocca. To my thinking, Iacocca is the guy who has been there, done that, has lots of common sense and says what he thinks. He knows the auto industry inside out.LiNeBrEaKChuck RobertsLiNeBrEaKSanta ClaraLiNeBrEaKBig 3: Go green or go without our greenLiNeBrEaKThe "Big Three" CEOs disgust me for two reasons: First, we have an abundance of gas-wasting, polluting, extravagant vehicles that people can neither afford nor want. Second, during the congressional hearing, all three executives cited that their companies had simply responded to American demands for luxuries   implying it is the American citizens' fault that these companies made poor business decisions. LiNeBrEaKIf the automakers are finally ready to make fuel-efficient, alternatively powered, economic vehicles, then we should not begrudge them money. However, if the money will be spent to preserve the status quo, it should instead be put to a better use: developing a "green" transportation industry without them.LiNeBrEaKAmanda GrunwaldLiNeBrEaKCampbellLiNeBrEaKAddress global warming globallyLiNeBrEaKAlberto Mendoza and Nora Vargas miss some basic knowledge about climate change (Opinion, Dec. 8).LiNeBrEaKTheir call to CARB (the California Air Resources Board) to assess "which communities in California are most polluted by greenhouse gases," painfully shows that they don't grasp that global warming can only be addressed globally.LiNeBrEaKI sincerely hope that CARB will listen to advisers who are better qualified than the average fifth-grader.LiNeBrEaKAnton BakkerLiNeBrEaKMorgan HillLiNeBrEaKPut Bush library at Guant&aacute;namo BayLiNeBrEaKWe've learned that the George W. Bush Library is to be located at Southern Methodist University in Dallas has an estimated cost of between $200 million and $500 million. Since most of the material is classified, deleted or redacted, it will be of little value for any research and at best, a minor tourist attraction. Better it be placed at Guant&aacute;namo (after the prison closes) as a symbol of the Bush legacy.LiNeBrEaKBob HughesLiNeBrEaKSanta ClaraLiNeBrEaKFrom one 'road warrior' to anotherLiNeBrEaKRegarding Donna Frankel's letter (Letters, Dec. 8), I'd suggest this community college part-timer take a critical thinking or problem solving class. She claims that it takes her and her students "10-20 minutes before every class finding a janitor to let us in." Here are a few other ideas: 1. Ask your department chair for a door key   and don't forget the executive washroom key. 2. Get the "janitor's" cell phone number and then take him or her out to lunch   write it off your taxes. 3. Take your students on a "field trip" to the library   Google "stress management." 4. If all else fails, call a locksmith and bill Gov. Schwarzenegger!LiNeBrEaKJerry SheahanLiNeBrEaK"Road Warrior Teacher" San JoseLiNeBrEaKRenew Integral Fast Reactor programLiNeBrEaKI don't get it. With the incessant debate about global warming and the need for dramatically increased, domestically supplied, non-carbon-emitting energy sources, why wasn't the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) option brought to the public's attention? Something is amiss when this serious worldwide debate takes place and a significant potential solution is invisible. Thanks to Steve Kirsch (Opinion, Dec. 7) and super-sleuth James Hansen for bringing the IFR to our attention. Renewal of this program should be on President-elect Obama's green project list.LiNeBrEaKBruce EulerLiNeBrEaKSaratogaLiNeBrEaKSetting the record straightLiNeBrEaKA letter to the editor on Tuesday's Opinion page incorrectly stated that the Mercury News had no mention of Pearl Harbor Day in the Dec. 7 newspaper.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Scientists pose ideas on climate impact  	Arthur Max, The Associated Press  	NEWS  	566 words  	POZNAN, Poland - Scientists studying the changing nature of the Earth's climate say they have completed one crucial task - proving beyond a doubt that global warming is real. LiNeBrEaKNow they have to figure out just what to do about it.LiNeBrEaK"It is critical for us to get a much better understanding of the impact of climate change in some parts of the world," Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKScientific warnings of potential catastrophe have been the backdrop for talks among more than 10,000 delegates and environmentalists negotiating a treaty to control the emission of greenhouse gases, which have grown by 70 percent since 1970. The treaty, due to be completed in one year, would replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.LiNeBrEaKPachauri said he was concerned that negotiators were sparring and probing - and leaving key decisions for the last moment.LiNeBrEaK"My concern is that if we leave everything to the end, we might end up with a weak agreement that doesn't really address the problem," he said.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Pachauri's IPCC, which collected the work of more than 2,000 scientists, said climate change is "unequivocal, is already happening, and is caused by human activity."LiNeBrEaKIt listed likely effects of global warming: arid regions will grow dryer, rising seas will flood coastal areas, melting glaciers will flood communities downstream and then dry up the source of future water supplies, and up to 30 percent of all plant and animal species may become extinct.LiNeBrEaKSince then, new evidence has emerged showing that ice caps in the Arctic and Antarctic are melting, which threatens to dramatically raise the level of the oceans and flood coastal cities and low-lying islands.LiNeBrEaK"Small island states are living in a state of fear," he said. LiNeBrEaKBut Pachauri said there was no conclusive evidence the world is in imminent danger.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think we should jump to conclusions if we get material that is based on the last one or two years," the Indian scientist said. The IPCC issues its reports every five or six years.LiNeBrEaKThe 2007 report cited a scientific consensus that global warming should be limited to 2 degrees Centigrade (3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit) to avoid the worst scenarios. To contain global warming to that target, carbon emissions must peak by 2015, then begin a rapid decline.LiNeBrEaKPachauri now says governments should reconsider whether even that goal goes far enough, since it would still raise sea levels from betweenLiNeBrEaK15 inches to 4. 6 feet.LiNeBrEaKDozens of scientists were among the delegations or nongovernment groups attending the Poznan conference, exhibiting some of the latest technologies and scientific studies.LiNeBrEaK"The skeptics are doing a good job because they are making us present ironclad proof," said Lawrence E. Buja, a climate change researcher for the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.LiNeBrEaKBut since that battle is over, he said scientists need to move on and look at the detailed impact of climate change.LiNeBrEaKBuja, who contributed to the IPCC report, said scientists are looking at futuristic solutions to halt global warming, such as imitating the cooling effects of a massive volcanic eruption by spreading sulfur in the atmosphere, or scattering billions of tiny refractors high in the air to dim the sun and lower the temperature. LiNeBrEaKBut he said such radical solutions involve risks.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Obama: Gore ideas helpful on economy  	Philip Elliott, The Associated Press  	NEWS  	298 words  	President-elect Barack Obama on Tuesday praised former Vice President Al Gore's ideas on the environment as one part of helping the nation's struggling economy recovery. LiNeBrEaKObama, Gore and Vice President-elect Joe Biden met privately at Obama's transition headquarters here for almost two hours. Obama said they discussed so-called green jobs as a way to boost employment across the country, improve national security by reducing reliance on foreign oil, and reduce energy costs.LiNeBrEaKObama said global warming is "not only a problem, but it's also an opportunity."LiNeBrEaK"We all believe what the scientists have been telling us for years now, that this is a matter of urgency and national security, and it has to be dealt with in a serious way," Obama told reporters and photographers at the end of the closed-door meeting.LiNeBrEaK"We have the opportunity now to make jobs all across this country, in all 50 states, to repower America. ... We are not going to miss this opportunity," Obama said.LiNeBrEaKThe president-elect's comments closely resembled Gore's plan for an environmental economy, outlined in a speech in July, and he echoed the title of Gore's effort, Repower America.LiNeBrEaKGore sought the presidency in 2000 but lost to then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in a disputed election that was settled by the Supreme Court. He then became a leader in the movement to draw attention to climate change and global warming. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, and his documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" won an Academy Award the same year.LiNeBrEaKHe lends Obama instant credibility among environmental activists. Aides also said Obama didn't plan to recruit Gore to become a formal part of his administration.LiNeBrEaKObama has pledged to use part of his proposed economic stimulus package to develop alternative energies and green technologies.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Asthma patients criticize new inhalers' price and strength of spray: New model is deemed better for environment, but price, strength of spray criticized  	Bob Lamendola, Sun Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	804 words  	Dec. 9--The new year will ring in a new era of green and efficient asthma inhalers, but some lung patients are mourning the end of the low-cost, trusty puffers they have used for years.LiNeBrEaKAs of Jan. 1, federal health officials are banning emergency-use inhalers with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellant that harm the Earth's ozone layer, raising the risk of skin damage and global warming. In their place come inhalers using ozone-friendlier hydrofluoroalkane (HFA).LiNeBrEaKLung experts call the new inhalers superior, delivering an identical dose of albuterol medicine in a finer mist that can penetrate deeper into the lungs to better ease the inflammation and mucus in an asthma attack. LiNeBrEaK"It's a better product in many ways," said Dr. Morton Schwartzman, a lung specialist at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood. "My patients have shown no resistance. They're getting used to it."LiNeBrEaKNot Leonard Eisenberg. Like some lung patients nationally, the Boca Raton Click here for restaurant inspection reports asthmatic, 78, complains the new inhalers don't relieve symptoms fully and that the price is much higher. He gave up on the new models and now buys old ones online from overseas.LiNeBrEaK"It doesn't work very well," Eisenberg said. "It's a very weak spray. I got my two tubes [400 puffs] for November, and they were gone way before the end of the month."LiNeBrEaKHealth officials said they hope asthmatics do not cut back, risking more attacks and complications, because of the cost or dissatisfaction with the new devices.LiNeBrEaKThe inhaler changeover has been an issue for the 250,000 asthmatics in South Florida and 20 million nationally since it was announced in 2005. Federal officials said more than two-thirds have switched, but doctors said holdouts include chronic lung patients and seniors who rely heavily on the puffers.LiNeBrEaKAsthmatics use albuterol inhalers in emergencies to open their clogged airways during acute attacks of breathlessness. Ideally, longer-acting drugs control the disease so patients need inhalers only once a day or so. But those with chronic lung problems often need a puff every few hours.LiNeBrEaKThe old CFC inhalers have worked well for decades, and because they sell as generic drugs, patients usually get them for free or a $5 co-payment.LiNeBrEaKThe Food and Drug Administration banned CFC inhalers after the United States signed an international treaty to remove it from most products.LiNeBrEaKThe new HFA inhalers relieved patients equally well in studies and are well-accepted since coming out in 1996, said Dr. Norman Edelman, medical officer of the American Lung Association.LiNeBrEaKBut some asthma patients say the new puffers do not fully halt asthma attacks, sending a few of them to emergency rooms. Lung experts said the problem most likely is one of perception or incorrect usage.LiNeBrEaKThe new units have a lighter heft and a softer spray that may not feel satisfactory to a panicky asthmatic struggling for breath, said Andrew Cuddihy, lung association program director in South Florida.LiNeBrEaK"They don't get that visceral feeling, 'I just got my medicine and now I'll feel better,'" said Cuddihy, who uses and likes the new inhalers.LiNeBrEaKHe and other experts agreed that if not used correctly, HFA inhalers may deliver too little medicine. The new units are more prone to clog, which reduces the spray, and must be rinsed often. They must be primed before use. And, the liquid is thinner and runnier.LiNeBrEaKOne solution: Attaching a plastic "spacer" chamber to the inhaler. Instead of spraying directly into the mouth, the spray forms a cloud in the chamber that the patient can inhale more fully. Schwartzman said studies show 60 percent of a puff reaches the lung with a spacer, 40 percent without one.LiNeBrEaKBut "the biggest problem for HFA" is the cost, Schwartzman said.LiNeBrEaKEisenberg said his HMO charged no co-pay for generic CFC inhalers, but the new ones cost him $60 a month.LiNeBrEaKFDA officials said even though new units contain the same drug, they are considered brand-name drugs with higher cost because the formula was tweaked to work with HFA.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday   Metro Edition	Minnesota without moose? It could happen;  A dramatic decrease in the numbers of the iconic symbol points to one major cause. 	LARRY OAKES, STAFF WRITER  	NEWS; Pg. 1A  	815 words  	DULUTH - Is climate change killing off Minnesota's moose?LiNeBrEaKThat appears to be the case, according to scientists and wildlife managers meeting here to talk about the dramatic decline in the state's moose population in recent decades. State wildlife biologists estimate the population has dropped 25 to 50 percent in 20 years, with a near-collapse in northwest Minnesota, now estimated to have fewer than 100 moose, down from 4,000 in the mid-1980s.LiNeBrEaKThey said that while disease, parasites, predation and other factors all contribute to moose mortality in northern Minnesota -- on the extreme southern fringe of this historic moose range -- heat stress from a documented rise in temperatures appears to be the root cause of the decline. LiNeBrEaKAt stake, beyond the animals themselves, is their iconic status as a northern Minnesota symbol and tourist attraction. One needed only cross the street from the hotel hosting the Minnesota Moose Summit Monday to see it: In the Duluth Pack store with its patented symbol -- a bull moose. Or the moose carved from a tree trunk Outside Deco Bay Clothing. Or the sign in the window of the Animal Factory, beckoning Christmas shoppers to "stuff" a moose to take home.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, at the summit, which also served as the second meeting of the Minnesota Moose Advisory Committee -- a group directed by the Legislature to come up with possible responses to the decline -- there was talk of the possibility of a Minnesota without moose by 2050, if present trends continue.LiNeBrEaKHeat-sensitive animalLiNeBrEaK"Moose are very heat-sensitive," said Prof. Rolf Peterson of Michigan Technological University, chair of the 17-member advisory committee, which plans to recommend to the DNR in June how the decline might be slowed and what new research might be needed.LiNeBrEaK"They're a 1,000-pound animal, and they're almost black," continued Peterson, who has studied the isolated moose population on Lake Superior's Isle Royale. "They don't sweat like a horse. They have no terribly effective way of getting rid of heat except by breathing faster."LiNeBrEaKThe state's moose population has dropped from as many as 14,000 in the mid-1980s to an estimated 7,700 today, said Dave Schad, the DNR's division of Fish and Wildlife director. The population in northeast Minnesota has declined an estimated average 6 percent per year since 2002, according to DNR estimates based on surveys from helicopters.LiNeBrEaKMoose hunting permits have been correspondingly reduced. Since the early 1990s, a hunter lucky enough to get a permit in the DNR's annual lottery can't apply again. One possible recommendation of the advisory committee is to discontinue the hunt.LiNeBrEaKMark Lenarz, DNR wildlife research group leader, told the group that temperature readings taken at an Ely weather station show that "over the past 48 years, average summer and winter temperatures have increased substantially." Mean midwinter temperatures in northwest Minnesota, which has fewer of the shade trees and lakes moose need to cool themselves, increased about 11 degrees from 1961 to 2001, a dramatic rise by most climate change measures.LiNeBrEaKLenarz cited a study that found that when temperatures go above 23 in the winter and 57 in the summer, moose must expend more energy, through a faster heartbeat and more labored breathing, to maintain a healthy temperature.LiNeBrEaKNo other factor examined -- not disease, parasites, starvation, deer density, hunting or predation by wolves -- correlates as reliably to the decline as does the rising temperature, Lenarz told the group.LiNeBrEaK"Because they are weakened, it predisposes them to other measures of mortality," he said, adding that because they must spend more time seeking shade and cooling off, "it takes away from the time they can actually feed."LiNeBrEaKWhile such a correlation has been observed, he added, "We don't have a cause and effect. ... We need to identify the specific mechanism" by which moose die of heat stress. More research is needed, he said.LiNeBrEaKLaurie Martinson, a DNR deputy commissioner, said the state is determined to find possible solutions.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to set a course that's proactive and that assures moose will be there for future generations," Martinson said before Monday's gathering, which continues today.LiNeBrEaKHowever, Peterson, the longtime researcher and advisory committee chair, said it may be too late.LiNeBrEaK"I don't know if we can do it," Peterson said. "We have only a few tools. ... We're not in charge of the weather. Things are just changing very quickly."LiNeBrEaKLarry Oakes - 1-800-266-9648LiNeBrEaKCOUNTING MOOSE Estimated moose numbers from aerial surveys in northeastern MinnesotaLiNeBrEaKNote: This is estimated survey data and can be anywhere from 23% toLiNeBrEaK40% higher or lower than the number chartedLiNeBrEaKThousands of mooseLiNeBrEaKSource: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources	CLIMATOLOGY (90%); MAMMALS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); RESEARCH (89%); WILDLIFE (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH (78%); TRENDS (78%); TALKS and MEETINGS (78%); BIOLOGY (78%); EXPERIMENTATION and RESEARCH (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (72%); DESTINATIONS and ATTRACTIONS (68%); CHRISTMAS (66%); LEGISLATORS (65%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (63%) minnesota; population; decrease; animal; environment  					MINNESOTA, USA (98%); MICHIGAN, USA (79%); LAKE SUPERIOR (79%) UNITED STATES (98%)  	December 12, 2008  	ENGLISH  	CHART PHOTO 		Newspaper  	2008 Star Tribune All Rights Reserved

The Washington Times 	December 9, 2008 Tuesday 	Boxer: Stimulus will pass quickly;  Senate eyes alternative energy 	By Tom LoBianco, THE WASHINGTON TIMES  	NATION; A06  	565 words  	A top Senate Democrat on Monday sent a letter to President-elect Barack Obama assuring him that Congress will move quickly to approve an economic stimulus plan between $500 billion and $1 trillion, and base much of it on establishing energy independence through renewable and alternative energy sources. LiNeBrEaKSen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said her committee is ready to pass any plan that comes from the House.LiNeBrEaK"We know what we need to do - accelerate our economic recovery in the short term and ensure our long-term prosperity," Mrs. Boxer wrote in her letter to Mr. Obama. "Investing in transportation infrastructure and working toward energy independence, while combating global warming, are initiatives that meet these goals."LiNeBrEaKMrs. Boxer has been working closely with the president-elect's transition team on energy and environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKMr. Obama, who is widely expected to announce his picks for top energy and environment posts this week, is set to meet with former Vice President Al Gore on Thursday. Mr. Gore's name has been floated for several high-level positions, including a possible new post of "climate czar."LiNeBrEaKCongressional leaders and Mr. Obama's transition team have yet to release specifics of the stimulus plan, but the broad outline is clear: Spend hundreds of billions on roads and bridges, invest in renewable energy sources and retrofit federal buildings to increase their energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKMrs. Boxer did not say Monday how the government would pay for a new stimulus plan, either through increased debt load or increased taxes. She did tout a carbon emission cap-and-trade program as a key measure.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists have long wanted some sort of carbon-emission pricing - either through a direct tax or as part of a cap-and-trade program as the first step in any push for renewable energy projects.LiNeBrEaKBut Republican leaders have questioned what such a measure would do.LiNeBrEaK"As Congress considers spending billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out the auto industry, it seems odd that some in the Democratic Party would continue to advocate for such an approach," said Matt Dempsey, communications director for Sen. James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican and ranking member on Mrs. Boxer's committee.LiNeBrEaK"We shall soon see if the liberal environmental agenda of the Democratic Party trumps any sincere effort to provide a workable solution for improving our nation's economy," he said.LiNeBrEaKAs speculation continued over who Mr. Obama would pick to shepherd his energy and environmental priorities, one group pre-emptively attacked his likely choice for Environmental Protection Agency administrator.LiNeBrEaKPublic Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) on Monday panned Lisa Jackson, who ran the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for two years, in a letter to Mr. Obama Monday.LiNeBrEaK"While Ms. Jackson has a compelling biography, little of what occurred during her 31-month tenure commends her for promotion," PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch saidin a statement. "Under her watch, New Jersey's environment only got dirtier, incredible as that may seem."LiNeBrEaKA spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) said the group's claims lacked substance.LiNeBrEaK"It's really a personal attack on Lisa," said DEP spokeswoman Elaine Makatura.LiNeBrEaK* Christina Bellantoni contributed to this report.

The Bakersfield Californian  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Man cycling into new courier business  	Courtenay Edelhart, The Bakersfield Californian  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	389 words  	Dec. 8--A resident of the Bakersfield Rescue Mission is making the rounds downtown trying to drum up business for a new bicycle courier service he's starting. LiNeBrEaKWendell Riggs, 44, has lived at the mission on and off for about a year, and starting his own business is part of his plan to turn his life around.LiNeBrEaK"I quit drinking more than two years ago but my life still wasn't changing," Riggs said. "I decided it was my attitude. I needed to be in charge of my own destiny and feel better about things, so now, when I feel myself going negative, I try to think of something positive."LiNeBrEaKFor Riggs, that something positive was often bike riding, one of the few pleasures he had left after years of alcoholism destroyed a career in the oil fields. He always looked forward to riding recreationaly.LiNeBrEaKNow, he's searching for a way to make a living at it.LiNeBrEaKFor weeks, Riggs has been handing out fliers for his new venture, which he's calling Spoke's Bicycle Courier Service.LiNeBrEaKHe knows such services are more common in larger, more dense cities, but still thinks he can make a go of it in Bakersfield.LiNeBrEaK"Everyone's talking about global warming, and not driving to make deliveries is one way to help," Riggs said. "Plus, with all the identity theft problems, there's a lot of information people don't feel comfortable conveying over the Internet."LiNeBrEaKRiggs has gone on one job so far, for the Bakersfield Downtown Business Association, which used him to circulate posters about an upcoming event.LiNeBrEaK"He talked to us about what he was trying to do, and I wanted to support him," said association president Cathy Butler. "We have so much going on downtown that we don't market as well as we should, so that was one way to get the word out."LiNeBrEaKRiggs is negotiating with some potential clients for a regular route, but says he'll continue undaunted no matter how that turns out.LiNeBrEaK"If you're doing what you love, you'll be successful," Riggs said.

Bangor Daily News (Maine)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	A bid to build a better robot  	Rich Hewitt, Bangor Daily News, Maine  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	626 words  	Dec. 8--CASTINE, Maine -- Preprogrammed robots rolled across a small field Sunday, performing assigned tasks related to the dangers associated with climate change -- strengthening a levee, retrieving ice cores, studying wildlife and raising a flood barrier.LiNeBrEaKThe robots were small, as were the budding engineers and mathematicians who had programmed them. LiNeBrEaKThe tasks were part of the annual First LEGO League competition held at Maine Maritime Academy, and the young programmers were students ages 9-14 from schools throughout northern and eastern Maine.LiNeBrEaK"The purpose of the tournament is to interest students in science, math and technology," said Thomas Bickford, president and director of Maine Robotics, which sponsors the tournament.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Bickford, the students are presented in September with a series of tasks that their robots must perform and they work in teams throughout the fall in preparation for the competition. They design the robots, which are built from the LEGO blocks, and develop the programs with the help of local coaches.LiNeBrEaKThis year, about 120 students from 18 schools participated in the competition in Castine. Next Saturday, in a separate competition, 32 teams from around the state will gather in southern Maine for a similar tournament.LiNeBrEaKMore than 10,000 students internationally and about 7,000 in the U.S. participate in the competition. They are assigned identical tasks to perform on the same playing field, which is a large table laid out with identical features, over and around which the robots must navigate.LiNeBrEaKVolunteer judges observe the demonstration, ranking the teams based on tasks completed and on how well they have designed and programmed the robots.LiNeBrEaK"We show the judges how the robot works and how we came up with the design for it," said Owen Weigang, a fifth-grade member of The Big Bang team from Asa Adams School in Orono.LiNeBrEaKClassmate Zachary Welch-Enman said they were judged on the programming and whether the students had programmed the robot correctly. After they had run the course, he said, they met with a judge to show the program on their computer and answer questions.LiNeBrEaKThe challenges, which change each year, encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the tasks, which also includes problem solving. Students exhibited their problem-solving skills on Sunday, especially when their robots didn't work as designed.LiNeBrEaK"We've had some difficulties," said Karen Noble, a fifth-grade pupil from the Luigians Team from Beech Hill School in Otis. "We only have one computer and we've had some problems with it. We're not able to access the program so we can't change anything."LiNeBrEaKDespite their difficulties, the team members said they enjoyed the competition and the different aspects of the challenge, including learning about climate change and the work required to compete.LiNeBrEaKAt another table, the team from Surry Elementary School seemed to be having a little more success. They had their laptop computer with them as they put the robot through a trial run, making changes where needed.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to the robotic challenge, each team was required to make a presentation on a topic related to the tournament theme, which this year was Climate Connections, dealing with climate change.LiNeBrEaKResults of the competition were not available Sunday afternoon. Performance and technical awards were to be given.

Birmingham News (Alabama) 	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Professor plans storm-proof housing UAB designer works on highly resistant material  	HANNAH WOLFSON News staff writer  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 1B Vol. 121 No. 270  	684 words  	A house made of plastic may sound like a joke, but for millions of people who live in fear of cyclones in coastal Asia, a stormproof dwelling is no laughing matter.LiNeBrEaK Nasim Uddin, an engineering professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is serious when he says he's designing housing from new materials that could save lives in coastal areas, from his native Bangladesh to the Alabama Gulf Coast.LiNeBrEaKUddin has been working with a high-tech composite material - essentially styrofoam sandwiched between skins of interwoven plastic and glass fibers - to create an inexpensive house that will resist storms, wind and floods. LiNeBrEaKThe house is designed for places where people live in traditional bamboo and straw huts. But Uddin said he can imagine the idea being adapted for use in hurricane-prone parts of this country, such as New Orleans, the Alabama coast or Galveston, Texas.LiNeBrEaK''Many people, more than you think, live along the coastline,'' he said. Experts figure at least half of the world's population lives in coastal areas. ''Especially now, with the greenhouse effect and the sea level rising, there is a big concern about what people are going to do.''LiNeBrEaKUddin speaks from experience: He grew up in Bangladesh, where he saw people devastated by storms. A massive cyclone there last year killed at least 1,700 people, injured 4,000 and damaged more than 770,000 houses, according to news reports.LiNeBrEaKUddin was inspired by his own upbringing to start working on his project in 2005. He's just started a six-month trip to Bangladesh, where he'll be working on his idea with BRAC, one of the region's biggest nonprofit organizations. His trip is being funded by a prestigious Fulbright scholarship, and he has also received more than $1 million in grants in recent years from the National Science Foundation.LiNeBrEaK''This is a poor country with an extremely poor coastal community that is completely devastated by these storms,'' Uddin said. ''A single storm can kill millions. So if our technology can be applied there successfully, you can see how many lives it could save in U.S. cities or anywhere else.''LiNeBrEaKWhile in Bangladesh, he'll also be testing ways to use jute, a fast-growing, environmentally sustainable plant, to replace the material's glass fibers. The same process could eventually be adapted to various native plant fibers - bamboo in Southeast Asia, palm in Latin America - to create a new green industry, Uddin said. It will also make the panels recyclable, which they aren't now because the glass gets in the way.LiNeBrEaK Uddin and a team at UAB have already tested the superstrong, super-light material in the laboratory to show that it withstands high winds and is rot-proof when wet. They also plan to put it though flood tests at Tuskegee University and through a hurricane simulator at the University of Florida.LiNeBrEaKBecause the houses will be prefabricated in panels at a factory, then assembled on site, they're cheap to make and can be built in as little as a couple of days, making them affordable for nonprofit groups or governments to build en masse.LiNeBrEaKUddin even imagines that in the future, the houses could be designed to float in a massive storm surge and either tethered to the ground or tracked through a GPS signal and towed in from the sea.LiNeBrEaKBut the most important task is to figure out how to make the houses pleasant to live in.LiNeBrEaK''Once you make those plastic houses, can you make people live in them?'' Uddin asked. ''The cultural adoption is very important.''LiNeBrEaKHe will be working with architects at BRAC's university to design a house that has enough windows without weakening its storm-resistance. It will definitely have a window in the roof to avoid tragedies like those in New Orleans, where residents were trapped inside their attics by rising waters.LiNeBrEaKUddin said it will take at least a couple of years to make the houses a practical reality, and as long as a generation for them to be widely adopted. But he's confident they'll work and save lives.LiNeBrEaK''It's going to happen,'' he said. ''That's what I want to see, and whether I do it or my son does it, I don't care.''LiNeBrEaKEMAIL: hwolfson@bhamnews.com	COASTAL AREAS (91%); NATURAL DISASTERS (89%); FIBERGLASS (89%); WEATHER (78%); POPULATION SIZE (78%); COMPOSITE MATERIALS (78%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (78%); HURRICANES (78%); SCHOLARSHIPS and GRANTS (77%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); GRANTS and GIFTS (67%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (68%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (60%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (50%)  		UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA (58%)  			BIRMINGHAM, AL, USA (88%); NEW ORLEANS, LA, USA (79%) ALABAMA, USA (96%); GULF OF MEXICO (92%); SOUTHEAST USA (92%); LOUISIANA, USA (79%); TEXAS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (96%); BANGLADESH (94%); ASIA (90%); LATIN AMERICA (79%); SOUTH EAST ASIA (78%)  	December 11, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Birmingham News All Rights Reserved  																
The Boston Herald 	December 8, 2008 Monday   ALL EDITIONS	PLUM ISLAND ON THE BRINK;   Erosion threatens to claim homes 	By IRA KANTOR  	NEWS; Pg. 005  	288 words  	The race on Plum Island to save coastal homes from toppling into the Atlantic Ocean is intensifying and residents are scrambling to prepare for the worst.LiNeBrEaK``I have moved some valuables out of the house just to be safe,'' said Robert Slepoy, 23, who rents a beach house on Northern Boulevard. ``It definitely is a problem with the global climate change. It really is changing the landscape down here.'' LiNeBrEaKErosion concerns in Plum Island have greatly increased in the wake of resident Geri Buzzotta losing her home. Buzzotta's Northern Boulevard home was demolished on Thanksgiving eve after erosion caused several support beams to collapse.LiNeBrEaKPlum Island resident Michele Holtgrefe, who lives directly across the street from where Buzzotta's beach house once stood, attributed the problem to the Army Corps of Engineers, who dredge the beaches every three to five years in order to redeposit sand to areas affected by storms or other natural disasters.LiNeBrEaK``It's been eight to 10 years since maintenance of the beach has been done, and as a result of that we're losing houses to the water which is unforgivable,'' Holtgrefe said.LiNeBrEaKNewburyport Mayor John Moak said yesterday he was pleased with the efforts of Netco Construction Project Managers Inc., a company contracted by the town, which has placed three-ton sand bags on the beach to stop erosion from eating away the shores.LiNeBrEaK``It's pretty impressive what they've been able to do so far,'' Moak said. ``I think it's a real proactive approach to getting the dunes back to their normal strength again.''LiNeBrEaKYet with winter fast approaching, Holtgrefe said state officials need to take stronger measures to fix the problems and soothe residential fears.LiNeBrEaK``I think everyone is fairly scared,'' she said.

The Boston Globe 	December 8, 2008 Monday   THIRD EDITION	A head-on approach to green-based prosperity  	Robert C. Holub  	OP-ED; Pg. A15  	745 words  	AS OUR NATION struggles with the global economic crisis, President-elect Obama and Congress must find the right measures to stimulate the economy today and invest wisely to create sustained prosperity. Obama recognizes that an extraordinary opportunity exists to restart the economy and combat the threat of global warming by launching a Green New Deal, but our long-term success greatly depends on educating skilled workers for new technical fields.LiNeBrEaKObama has outlined an immediate plan to create 2. 5 million jobs through green-based initiatives, such as building wind farms and solar panels. This first step must be complemented with a long-term strategy that improves the environmental and economic sustainability of our nation. I believe that through a national green initiative, centered at our nation's public research universities, we can meet this challenge and emerge with a more sustainable environment and economy in the short and longer term. LiNeBrEaKThis national green initiative, which would be launched in coordination with the flagship research universities across the country, would have three parts but one simple goal - building the human and capital infrastructure necessary to compete in the decades ahead, while simultaneously infusing millions of dollars into the private sector right away in building the facilities needed to create tomorrow's green technology breakthroughs.LiNeBrEaK- The federal government will create a loan-forgiveness program that would allow students in science, technology, engineering, and math to have their student loans partially or completely forgiven in return for a multi-year commitment to teaching in these fields in K-12 schools. Every state is facing shortages in qualified teachers, and at a time when the job market is increasingly difficult, there's never been a better time to encourage bright young people to become teachers. The right incentives now could make a big difference.LiNeBrEaK- To educate these students, each state's public research university would develop a proposal to build or renovate the laboratories and classrooms necessary to train both workers and educators in math and sciences as well as environmental sciences and related fields. These facilities would drive innovation and research breakthroughs as well as provide valuable learning space. To support this, the federal government would establish a $50 billion fund for such construction across the nation, and encourage universities to match these federal funds with state and private support. At the same time, the universities would be required to plan to work with the educational systems in their state to increase the numbers of students in these fields, and to offer current teachers access to these facilities for improved training.LiNeBrEaKFor this plan to work, these efforts must be aimed at improving the learning environment across the state, and our public research universities are uniquely positioned to drive this effort.LiNeBrEaK- Each of these construction projects must meet the latest green building standards, and the bid process should require that local workers in each of the states be employed on these projects - thereby training a whole new cadre of workers in the latest sustainable technologies. In addition, faculty at these universities should be directly involved in the project development to ensure that not only are these facilities as green as possible, but that they meet the teaching and research needs of our next generation of students and teachers, as well as for training our workforce of the future.LiNeBrEaKWhile this idea is, in many ways, very simple, it will require our government and our universities to work closely together, to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and to move right away to begin these projects. It will also require our universities to fully engage the community colleges and other higher-educational institutions in a partnership. Most important, it will mean that our entire educational system, from K-12 to graduate schools, will need to contribute to solving the issues that face us.LiNeBrEaKWe must, as a nation, address head-on the issue of energy self-sufficiency while combating global climate change. We must create jobs and financial security now, even as we attempt to prepare for an uncertain future. That won't be easy, but by investing in our future as a way of bolstering our current economy, we'll rise to our challenges today and tomorrow.LiNeBrEaKRobert C. Holub is chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Daily Breeze (Torrance, California)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Hands On Experience  	Douglas Morino, Daily Breeze, Torrance, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	437 words  	Dec. 8--The 24 students of Regat Yehdego's seventh-grade robotics class, part of the new "School for Advanced Studies," are applying the principles of math and science to solve environmental issues that will affect the world as they grow older. LiNeBrEaKProblems of fire, drought and global warming are being discussed, and tangible solutions are being created.LiNeBrEaKOn Sunday, a semester of hard work paid off, as the Fleming Middle School students boarded buses headed for Legoland in Carlsbad, where they competed against the region's best at the Lego League robotics competition.LiNeBrEaKThe Lomita middle school received help from the Boys and Girls Club of San Pedro for equipment and transportation, and the motorized robots used in the competition were designed, built and programmed entirely by the students.LiNeBrEaK"(In the Robotics class) we're combining math, science and technology -- and we keep it fun," said seventhgrader Ashley Silvas, who has been working with her classmates preparing for the competition since the start of the school year. "We've learned to work together on real problems and creating solutions to help protect our environment," she said.LiNeBrEaKTheir robots complete various "mini-tasks" replicating solutions to environmental problems. All the tasks are timed, and afterward the results are analyzed by the class. The students are being introduced to carbon dioxide sequestration (capture), reducing greenhouse gas emissions and levee building.LiNeBrEaK"Once you get the basics, it's all pretty simple," joked student Nick Lozano as he fine-tuned one of the motorized robots. Like Ashley, he enrolled in the class after being recommended by a counselor.LiNeBrEaKAside from the robotics course, Yehdego also teaches classes in Web design and development -- she also aims to add an after-school robotics club soon. And for all the complex issues she is introducing to the students of her robotics class, Yehdego's core philosophy is simple:LiNeBrEaK"If there is a love of learning, the kids can really take off," Yehdego said Friday, as she took a break from helping students put the final touches on their projects. "I've always believed that if you set the bar high, they will rise up to the challenge."LiNeBrEaKdouglas.morino@dailybreeze.com	ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); STUDENTS and STUDENT LIFE (90%); ROBOTICS (90%); YOUTH CLUBS and ACTIVITIES (78%); MATHEMATICS (78%); CLIMATOLOGY (78%); CHILDREN (78%); EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (78%); EMISSIONS (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT (73%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (61%)  			General  	CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 8, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (56%)  	20081208-QT-Hands-On-Experience-1208  	QT  												
Daily Oklahoman  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	The Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, Bryan Painter column: Warm up to ice data, Oklahoma researchers say  	Bryan Painter, The Oklahoman, Oklahoma City  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	465 words  	Dec. 8--A study of recent ice storms may help people prepare.LiNeBrEaKThere have been six storms bringing ice of more than an inch since the turn of the millennium. With those have come deaths, injuries and more than $1 billion in property damage. LiNeBrEaK"The Sperry-Piltz Utility Ice Damage Index" is a way to measure ice storms' severity. It was designed by Sid Sperry, director of Public Relations and Communications and Research at the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives in Oklahoma City, and Steve Piltz, the meteorologist in charge at the Tulsa National Weather Service forecast office.LiNeBrEaKResearchers at the Oklahoma Climatological Survey office in Norman found evidence of warming at the surface by studying statewide average winter -- December through February -- temperatures since 1896. Another report indicated warming at the surface and lower portions in the atmosphere across most of the nation and in particular the northern hemisphere.LiNeBrEaKThe hypothesis that a warming climate could lead to more frequent ice storms meshes with ideas of conditions needed to form freezing rain.LiNeBrEaKAgain, there's no solid proof of a connection between the two.LiNeBrEaKBut since 2000, research suggests the possibility that significant ice storms will continue to affect our state.LiNeBrEaKWhat does this mean for us? Damage potential is categorized in five levels by ice thickness, wind speed and direction, and temperatures for the storm period.LiNeBrEaKUtility systems may be able to handle moderate ice accumulations, but lines, poles and other structures are more likely to break when wind speeds increase.LiNeBrEaKHow will this information help others help us?LiNeBrEaK"By being able to predict three or four days in advance not only the likely path and footprint of an ice storm, but also accurately estimating the total amount of ice that could potentially accumulate on power lines, and knowing well ahead of time the forecast wind speeds and temperatures, we can better prepare our electric line crews for the potential damage that they may be dealing with," Sperry said.LiNeBrEaKHe said they can know well ahead of time where to send additional repair crews, where ice accumulations will be the most severe, and predict with a high degree of accuracy the amount of damage to a utility system.LiNeBrEaK"Sid has been accumulating his knowledge of ice storm impacts for years...and I have seen him prepare well for the last several big storms," Piltz said.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Draft of bill demands federal oversight of aid for automakers  	Justin Hyde, Detroit Free Press  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	376 words  	Dec. 8--WASHINGTON -- Detroit automakers would face strict oversight from a federal official and have to drop lawsuits against California's limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks under a draft of the rescue obtained by the Free Press. LiNeBrEaKThe final amount of the loans available under the plan was one of the issues still unresolved, with some lawmakers wanting more than the $15 billion that appeared available. General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC have said they need $8 billion before the end of the year to avoid collapse, and GM has said it could need $6 billion early next year.LiNeBrEaKUnder the bill, automakers would have to submit a restructuring plan by March 31 to what's being called a "financial viability advisor," who would have the power to set negotiations among the company, unions and creditors. If the advisor deems the company isn't making progress, the loans could be called back.LiNeBrEaKIn return for the loans, automakers would be barred "from participating in, pursuing, funding, or supporting in any way, lawsuits (existing or contemplated) challenging State laws concerning greenhouse gas emission standards."LiNeBrEaKAs with the first rescue plan, automakers would have to pledge stock to the government equal to 20% of the loan value in return for the money, and the loans would be senior to all of the company's other debts.LiNeBrEaKForeign and domestic companies have fought California's global warming rules on vehicles, which have been adopted in 17 states, saying they would create an unworkable state-by-state sales limit on some vehicles and complicate manufacturing.LiNeBrEaKWhite House spokeswoman Dana Perino said today a deal was "very likely."LiNeBrEaKEven if the White House and congressional Democrats reach a compromise, winning approval will require significant Republican votes, especially in the Senate where 60 votes are needed to stop filibusters.

Detroit Free Press (Michigan)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	$17-billion auto deal 'very close,' Levin says: Wagoner's fate one of the key disputes  	Justin Hyde, Detroit Free Press  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	965 words  	Dec. 8--WASHINGTON -- As lawmakers drew closer to granting $17 billion to keep General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC alive, key disputes remained over how much power the U.S. government would claim for itself, whether GM Chairman Rick Wagoner would be ousted, and whether automakers would be forced to drop lawsuits against state global warming rules.LiNeBrEaKEven if a deal can be cobbled together for Congress to consider this week, the prospects of an auto industry rescue winning approval remained uncertain at best Sunday, despite dire warnings from the current and future U.S. presidents that Detroit's automakers should not be allowed to fail in a deepening recession. LiNeBrEaKCapitol Hill staffers and the White House worked through the weekend on a compromise following a breakthrough Friday over drawing the money from a fund set aside to grant $25 billion in factory retooling loans to automakers.LiNeBrEaK"I think they're very close to a deal, I'm very confident there will be a deal, and that will happen within 24 hours," Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said on "Fox News Sunday."LiNeBrEaKLevin said he expected the bill to be introduced as soon as today. The Senate is set to come back in session this afternoon, with the House planning to return Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKBut Sen. Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat overseeing the talks for the Senate, suggested Sunday that Wagoner should have to step down as part of any rescue.LiNeBrEaK"I think he has to move on," Dodd said, noting that GM was in the worst shape of Detroit's automakers. "If you're really going to restructure this, you've got to bring in a new team to do this."LiNeBrEaKWagoner, who has served as GM's chief executive for eight years and as its chairman for five, has been the de facto leader among Detroit executives to Washington. When asked during the hearings last week whether he should be forced out as part of any government rescue, Wagoner told senators, "I think the leadership team we have is the right one, but I serve at the pleasure of the board."LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama on Sunday said he supported Congress' efforts to require tough conditions as part of any automaker rescue, but didn't say whether he would want Wagoner to leave.LiNeBrEaK"If this management team doesn't understand the urgency of the situation and isn't willing to make the tough choices and adapt to these new circumstances, then they should go," Obama said Sunday. "If on the other hand they are willing and able and show themselves committed to making those important changes, that raises a different situation."LiNeBrEaKA GM board member said Friday that directors support Wagoner. GM spokesman Greg Martin said while the company appreciated Dodd's work, "the employees of General Motors, its dealers, its suppliers and its board of directors all support Rick Wagoner and are confident he is the person to lead GM through these difficult times."LiNeBrEaKLevin told the Free Pres removing Wagoner shouldn't be in the bill.LiNeBrEaKWhether or not there should be any changes should be a matter for recommendation by the loan administrator or the shareholders, he said.LiNeBrEaKLevin also said the bill would provide at least $17 billion, more than the $14 billion GM and Chrysler say they need to survive through March but far short of the $34 billion the industry says it needs. With GM asking for $12 billion and a $6-billion line of credit, Chrysler seeking $7 billion and Ford Motor Co. asking for a $9-billion line of credit, the deal will likely require automakers to prove progress by March 31 to receive any additional money.LiNeBrEaKThe bill is to include numerous conditions on the auto industry, including appointing an overseer to monitor the automakers' progress on restructuring plans. One of the main contentions Sunday was over how much power such a person would wield -- for example, ordering creditors to reduce the companies' debt -- and how the position would be filled.LiNeBrEaKLevin said he believed the bill would name the overseer 60 to 90 days after it passes, or force the Bush administration to consult with the Obama team on an appointment.LiNeBrEaKA proposal drafted by key Democrats on Sunday would force Detroit automakers to drop lawsuits challenging California's global warming rules on vehicles, which have been adopted in 17 states. Foreign and domestic companies have fought the rules in three lawsuits, saying they would create an unworkable state-by-state sales limit on some vehicles and complicate manufacturing.LiNeBrEaKThe rules have strong backing from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and many other Democrats. But such a clause would be a "nuclear option," Levin said, and he vowed to fight against it.LiNeBrEaKEven if the White House and congressional Democrats reach a compromise this week, winning approval will require significant Republican votes, especially in the Senate where 60 votes are needed to stop filibusters.LiNeBrEaKDodd told CBS' "Face the Nation" that he believed there were enough votes to pass; Levin would not vouch for that, saying the bill would have to come out first before votes could be counted. And Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala, who opposes any rescue, said automakers lacked the ability to turn themselves around, and vowed a filibuster.LiNeBrEaK"This is a bridge loan to nowhere," Shelby said on Fox. "This is a down payment on many billions to come. ... These companies have basically failed, or are failing."LiNeBrEaKContact JUSTIN HYDE at jhyde@freepress.com Brent Snavely and Sarah A.

Foreign and domestic companies have fought the rules in three lawsuits, saying they would create an unworkable state-by-state sales limit on some vehicles and complicate manufacturing.LiNeBrEaKThe rules have strong backing from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and many other Democrats. But such a clause would be a "nuclear option," Levin said, and he vowed to fight against it.LiNeBrEaKEven if the White House and congressional Democrats reach a compromise this week, winning approval will require significant Republican votes, especially in the Senate where 60 votes are needed to stop filibusters.LiNeBrEaKDodd told CBS' "Face the Nation" that he believed there were enough votes to pass; Levin would not vouch for that, saying the bill would have to come out first before votes could be counted. And Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala, who opposes any rescue, said automakers lacked the ability to turn themselves around, and vowed a filibuster.LiNeBrEaK"This is a bridge loan to nowhere," Shelby said on Fox. "This is a down payment on many billions to come. ... These companies have basically failed, or are failing."LiNeBrEaKContact JUSTIN HYDE at jhyde@freepress.com Brent Snavely and Sarah A.

Duluth News-Tribune (Minnesota)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Minnesota trying to save its moose  	John Myers, Duluth News Tribune, Minn.  	SPORTS  	914 words  	Dec. 8--Wildlife researchers from across North America are in Duluth today as part of a developing effort to see if Minnesota can save its moose.LiNeBrEaKHit hard by parasites and heat, Minnesota's moose numbers are shrinking and moose experts fear the state may be destined to loose the big, beloved animal for good.LiNeBrEaKThe moose summit offers a snapshot of the moose situation in Minnesota and worldwide. It also serves as the kickoff for a seven-month moose advisory committee to decide what research is necessary to understand moose issues and then develop a management plan for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to follow. LiNeBrEaKThe committee is ordered to report back next summer on what should be done.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to figure this out. We're going to set a course that's proactive,'' said Laurie Martinson, deputy DNR director. "There's nothing that makes your heart beat faster [than seeing a moose], and we want to make sure we save that for future generations.''LiNeBrEaKBut a rapidly warming climate may be too much for moose to overcome, said Rolf Peterson, a world-renowned moose expert from Michigan Technological University.LiNeBrEaK"I don't know that we can do it,'' Peterson said of preserving moose in Minnesota. "The changes we've set in motion in terms of climate change are already there, are already in motion.''LiNeBrEaKMarkedly shorter winters, hotter summer days and more extreme climate and natural phenomenon are all combining against moose on the southern edge of their natural range, Peterson said. The animal was built to withstand deep snow and cold. But even days in the upper 70s take their toll.LiNeBrEaK"It will be a challenge to hang on to a species [so affected] by summertime heat,'' Peterson said. 'Things are just changing too fast for moose to hang on in all of their former range.''LiNeBrEaKPeterson said moose are hit hard by even moderately warmer days because of their black coat, back hair and inability to perspire. Moose can only lose heat by breathing faster, he noted. When moose are overheated they don't eat, and if they lose too much weight they may not survive winter. It's believed some moose even perish from heatstroke.LiNeBrEaKWarmer, less severe winters also have produced unprecedented deer populations in northern Minnesota. Deer carry a brain worm that is harmless to whitetails but is fatal to moose.LiNeBrEaKIn areas of even modest deer densities -- about 10 deer per square mile, which includes much of Northeastern Minnesota now -- the parasite becomes prevalent and moose die out.LiNeBrEaKWarmer weather at key periods also increase a bug called winter ticks, causing heavy tick infestations that bother moose so much that they rub off their insulating hair, leaving them open to death by exposure.LiNeBrEaKWildlife experts say efforts to help moose hang on could include reducing or eliminating moose hunting. This year, about 2,700 hunters applied for just 250 permits to hunt moose. Minnesota hunters shot 110 bulls. Ojibwe tribal hunters shot another 30 or so.LiNeBrEaKBut shooting only a few bulls each year is not believed to affect the overall population, said Dave Schad, DNR fish and wildlife division director. Schad said it's not clear how much longer hunting seasons can be offered.LiNeBrEaK"At some point the population will be low enough where we can't sustain hunting seasons,'' he said.LiNeBrEaKOther efforts could include drastically reducing white-tailed deer numbers in some areas to allow moose to rebound, but it's not clear if that would be publicly accepted or even work.LiNeBrEaKPeterson said habitat, namely tree cover, can be modified to encourage moose, such as leaving plenty of evergreen trees for moose to escape summer heat and winter cold. But that's already being done, he noted.LiNeBrEaKMoose were common across the northern third of Minnesota before settlers arrived. Their numbers were decimated by intense logging, farming and over-hunting, and moose hunting seasons were closed in 1921.LiNeBrEaKMoose numbers slowly rebounded, peaking in the mid-1980's with more than 4,000 moose in northwestern Minnesota and up to 8,000 in Northeastern counties. The DNR resumed limited hunting season in 1871, and moose seemed to be doing well.LiNeBrEaKStarting in the 1990s, however, the northwestern herd crashed. Now, fewer than 100 moose remain. Climate experts found significantly more hot days in the region and the overall growing season, between frosts, is now 20 days longer than a half-century ago. While several problems contributed to the decline of northwestern Minnesota moose, a long-term study pointed to the warming climate as the overriding factor.LiNeBrEaKIn recent years, the Northeastern herd also has started to decline, by about 6 percent annually. The herd remains strong at about 7,600 animals. But wildlife officials fear the same rapid decline could strike the Northeast as it did the Northwest.LiNeBrEaKPregnancy rates remain unusually low in the Northeast, and the number of moose that die from natural causes in Minnesota remains unusually high compared to Canada and other areas where moose are common.LiNeBrEaKMoose also are declining rapidly in areas of Northwestern Ontario where deer are now common, Peterson said.

The Kansas City Star (Missouri)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	The Kansas City Star, Mo., Robert Trussell column: Martin City Melodrama's holiday show is clever, silly  	Robert Trussell, The Kansas City Star, Mo.  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	482 words  	Dec. 8--The Martin City Melodrama holiday show is an agreeably silly affair, replete with groan-inducing puns embedded in a clever script, creative if undernourished musical accompaniment and some very talented performers. LiNeBrEaKThis year's enterprise is called "Rudolph the Recycled Reindeer, or, It's Not Easy Being Green," a two-act "melodrama" that imposes an eco-friendly plot on familiar North Pole traditions.LiNeBrEaKDan Hall's script casts Rudolph (played by musical director Jon Copeland) as a spoiler, literally -- he blithely contributes to global warming (and the eventual destruction of the North Pole) by blithely pouring paint left over from the elves' workshop into the water.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile his son Rudy (Logan Smalley) enters a self-imposed exile and wanders the Great Forest, where he encounters a number of fellow reindeer outcasts, all very funny and all played by Martin City founder Jeanne Beechwood.LiNeBrEaKMy favorite among these is Kung Fu, a martial-arts reindeer who at one point sings about the pole in the center of the stage and then proceeds to attack it with her fighting stick. "I hate the pole!" she shouts. The moment is authentic, because Beechwood really does hate the iron beam running from floor to ceiling near center stage.LiNeBrEaKSmalley is just one of several talented performers. Emerson Roland Rapp III, who also does standup, is a natural, exuding a strong presence and a beautiful sense of timing. Amanda Nicole Riley keeps her energy at near-manic levels without letup and Whitney Beiler gets serious laughs as a codes inspector.LiNeBrEaKCopeland's reworking of familiar holiday tunes is always clever but his arrangements (some performed by pianist Jill Santero) almost scream for more instruments. Drums, especially, would be most welcome.LiNeBrEaKBut this is Martin City, where Beechwood has made poverty a virtue. And, as usual, the warmest audience response is triggered by the highlight of the musical vaudeville -- the Water Glass Symphony.LiNeBrEaKThis year the cast taps out two distinctive numbers on their containers of colored water, Jingle Bells Rock and the Hallelujah Chorus. And as usual, the audience is amazed by a.) Copeland's ability to figure out extremely complex arrangements and b.) the actors' ability to execute it.LiNeBrEaKThe Martin City Melodrama and Vaudeville Company production "Rudolph the Recycled Reindeer, or, It's Not Easy Being Green" runs through Jan. 4 at Metcalf South Shopping Center.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	EPA officials didn't violate anti-lobbying laws, audit finds  	By Michael Doyle, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	825 words  	WASHINGTON _ Environmental Protection Agency officials didn't violate anti-lobbying laws amid a high-stakes campaign over California's request for permission to strictly regulate greenhouse gas emissions in vehicles, federal investigators have concluded.LiNeBrEaKRejecting charges by conservatives, the investigators said two top agency officials acted legally when they conveyed information to former EPA Administrator William Reilly, who supported California's clean-air waiver request. Reilly, a moderate Republican, was EPA administrator under former President George H.W. Bush.LiNeBrEaK"EPA staff did not engage in any effort to influence a member of Congress or other covered official," the EPA's Office of Inspector General concluded in a new audit. LiNeBrEaKThe latest investigation may close out the controversy over what happened as the current Bush administration considered California's waiver request. The clean-air waiver proposal itself, though, remains alive and kicking.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia lawmakers are now urging President-elect Barack Obama to reconsider the clean-air waiver, which EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson, a Bush appointee, rejected in December 2007.LiNeBrEaK"I definitely believe that Barack Obama will sign the waiver, because he said he was going to do it, and he's a man of his word," Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said Monday.LiNeBrEaKAt least 18 other states likewise seek more power to regulate emissions, Boxer noted. First, though, the states need a waiver from the federal air pollution law that sets a less stringent national standard. California's stricter rules would cut tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 30 percent by the year 2016.LiNeBrEaKLobbying controversies have pervaded the clean-air waiver fight from the start. Last year, congressional investigators revealed the Transportation Department was actively lobbying Congress to rally opposition to a waiver. Top White House officials also pressured Johnson to deny the waiver, Boxer has previously charged.LiNeBrEaK"Relatively early in the process, I had the impression that (Johnson) was quite interested in and was seriously exploring ... granting the waiver," EPA official Jason Burnett told House investigators in a deposition. "His final decision is well known."LiNeBrEaKBurnett refused, however, to explain further what role the White House might have played in Johnson's apparent change of mind.LiNeBrEaKDiscussions between Capitol Hill and Obama transition officials now focus on how the waiver might happen. A lawsuit filed by California probably will have to be settled, though it's unclear whether a new public comment period will have to be opened.LiNeBrEaK"Combating global warming is not only good for the environment, it's great for the economy," Boxer said, "and I believe that Barack Obama believes that, too."LiNeBrEaKBoxer is the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The senior Republican on her committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, is a critic of the science surrounding greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKIn March, Inhofe requested that investigators look into how EPA information came into Reilly's hands. Inhofe suggested officials might've violated the anti-lobbying act, which prohibits federal employees from using public funds to influence members of Congress or other government officials.LiNeBrEaKInhofe's allegation amounted to a bank shot. EPA officials were giving information to Reilly, who in turn was trying to persuade the EPA administrator to grant California's longstanding waiver request.LiNeBrEaKAt a cost of $52,858, the Inspector General's Office looked into Inhofe's charges and quietly released its conclusions last week.LiNeBrEaK"The preparation and subsequent release of information to former administrator Reilly do not constitute a violation of law, regulation, or policy," the investigators concluded.LiNeBrEaKThe investigators explained that Reilly called the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality in October 2007. He wanted background information for his upcoming conversation with Johnson.LiNeBrEaK"Mr. Reilly was not asking for inside information, or anything that was confidential or could be considered deliberative, but ... he wanted public information, like what the press was reporting on the matter," the investigators stated.LiNeBrEaKAn EPA staffer prepared a four-page response for Reilly, with one page called "Talking Points." Another EPA staffer decided not to send the "Talking Points" after concluding they were "too flowery." The EPA officials told investigators it was "very common" to share such information.LiNeBrEaK"If an automotive executive had asked for similar written material, he would have provided it," investigators said of one EPA staffer.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Environmental group seeks to add whitebark pine tree to endangered species list  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	WASHINGTON DATELINE  	668 words  	WASHINGTON _ The whitebark pine, a tree found in the high elevations of the western U.S. and Canada, is being killed as a consequence of global warming and should be protected as an endangered species, an environmental group formally told the Interior Department Tuesday.LiNeBrEaKIf the federal government accepts the scientific arguments in a petition by the Natural Resources Defense Council, it would be the first time a wide-ranging tree has been added to the list. The NRDC also sees an endangered designation as a warning about worsening climate change. LiNeBrEaKThe listing would require the government to look at a variety of options that scientists have suggested might help preserve the tree, choose what might work and spend enough money to put those ideas into practice.LiNeBrEaKMature whitebark pines are often gnarled and twisted because they grow slowly in the tough terrain of the high mountains of California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Nevada, and in British Columbia and Alberta. It's typically found at the treeline or at somewhat lower elevations mixed with other conifers.LiNeBrEaKThe whitebark pine has declined dramatically due to a triple threat _ a disease called the white pine blister rust; the mountain pine beetle, which thrives in the warmer high-altitude conditions produced by the burning of fossil fuels; and forest management practices that have allowed other trees to crowd it out, the NRDC's petition said.LiNeBrEaKWarming also will limit the range of the whitebark pine, the petition said. Many live more than 500 years.LiNeBrEaK"It's kind of a wakeup call about the scope of the problems we're going to be facing," said NRDC scientist Sylvia Fallon, an ecologist who was one of the authors of the petition. "All of the pieces of the ecosystem it holds together will also be affected by its loss."LiNeBrEaKThe whitebark pine stabilizes the soil and shades the snow, providing water over longer periods for other plants. Grizzly bears, smaller mammals and birds eat its seeds, and elk, grouse and other mountain wildlife find shelter beneath it.LiNeBrEaKThe tree has been declining in numbers for 50 years. In recent years, climate change has started to make the threats worse, due to shorter periods of cold that kill the beetle and extended periods in which the trees are exposed to spores from the blister rust, Fallon said.LiNeBrEaKDifferent forms of fire management might help the tree. The whitebark pine thrives in areas opened up by fires, but firefighting in the West has created more mature forests over larger areas. And while natural fires can be good for the tree, fire also can be an unnatural threat with changes in climate leaving drier forests, Fallon said.LiNeBrEaKThe petition argued that the current extent of the losses of whitebark pines and the future threat of continued global warming put the tree at risk. Under the law, a species is considered endangered if it is in danger of extinction in all or a significant portion of its range.LiNeBrEaKFallon said that early studies show that a small percentage of the trees might have some defense to the beetle. If scientists can find a way to control the beetle, planting resistant trees might make sense, she said.LiNeBrEaKThe Interior Department secretary and the department's Fish and Wildlife Service have 90 days after receiving the petition to determine whether the tree is threatened or endangered. The period spans the presidential transition. The whole process would take two years.LiNeBrEaKFallon said the timing of the petition had nothing to do with change at the White House. NRDC's Montana office had been studying the threats for a long time, she said.LiNeBrEaKON THE WEBLiNeBrEaKMore on the whitebark pine: http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/whitebar.htm	ENDANGERED SPECIES (91%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); WILDLIFE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); MOUNTAINS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (90%); SCIENCE NEWS (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); PETITIONS (89%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (89%); BIOLOGY (89%); MAMMALS (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (77%); BIRDS (77%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (77%); FOREST FIRES (70%)  		NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL (83%)  			WEST USA (92%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); OREGON, USA (79%); NEVADA, USA (79%); MONTANA, USA (79%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%); WYOMING, USA (79%); IDAHO, USA (79%); BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA (58%); ALBERTA, CANADA (58%) UNITED STATES (96%); NORTH AMERICA (94%); CANADA (92%)  	December 9, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Knight Ridder Washington Bureau   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (54%)  	20081208-BC-ENV-PINE-ADV09  	WA  	WASHINGTON

The Marin Independent Journal (Novato, California)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	EDITORIAL: Take pride in being Bay Area's solar leader  	The Marin Independent Journal, Novato, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	324 words  	Dec. 8--MARIN residents are giving much more than lip service to the war on global warming.LiNeBrEaKHomeowners, businesses and governmental agencies have been busy installing solar panels -- enough to lead the Bay Area in the number of solar-energy panels per capita. LiNeBrEaKThat success likely stems from awareness and affluence.LiNeBrEaKLocal residents long have had a strong environmental ethic. Over the years, residents have invested tax dollars and political energy into preserving ridge lines, redwood groves, marshlands and farmlands. That so much of Marin is protected as parkland and open space is a lasting reflection of that ethic.LiNeBrEaKIn recent years, the installation of solar panels has become another example.LiNeBrEaKWorries about global warming and costly power bills have led a growing number of Marin residents to install solar panels to tap sunshine for electricity.LiNeBrEaKLocal government has been responsive, waiving or reducing permit fees. The county, instead of charging for a permit, offers a rebate. Combined with federal and state rebates, which agencies should renew, the $35,000 average cost of installing a solar system on a home is lowered to less than $20,000.LiNeBrEaKThat's no small investment, but it is one that pays off in lower electricity bills and helps reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy sources.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the Northern California Solar Energy Association, Marin has 4. 3 solar-energy systems per 1,000 residents. That ratio leads the nine Bay Area counties.LiNeBrEaKMarin shouldLiNeBrEaKtake pride in that top ranking.

The Monitor (McAllen, Texas)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	A clean environment needs to be a universal right  	By Kate Davies  	COMMENTARY  	684 words  	As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on Dec. 10, we should consider adding another key right to it: the right to a clean environment.LiNeBrEaKThe declaration, adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 1948, boldly laid down a vision of a just world, a vision that still applies today.LiNeBrEaKIn a world where many are denied free speech, peaceful assembly and fair treatment under the law, and many suffer discrimination, slavery and torture, it is essential to have a globally accepted statement to make it clear these things are wrong. LiNeBrEaKEven this country, with its policies of "extraordinary rendition" and "extreme interrogation," needs the declaration as a reminder about inalienable human rights.LiNeBrEaKAlthough its promise is not yet a reality for all, the declaration provides a moral benchmark.LiNeBrEaKDespite the declaration's enduring relevance, the world has changed in many ways over the past 60 years. Perhaps most significantly, we are facing a rapidly deteriorating environment, which is causing disastrous effects on human health and well-being.LiNeBrEaKAlready about 40 percent of the world's population cannot get enough water, and this proportion is expected to increase to 50 percent in the next 15 years.LiNeBrEaKWorldwide, outdoor air pollution kills about 800,000 a year and indoor air pollution is responsible for many more deaths.LiNeBrEaKAlmost a billion people _ nearly one-sixth of the world's population _ are hungry and about 5 million children die from malnutrition every year.LiNeBrEaKThe World Health Organization estimates that more than one-fourth of all disease and disability is the result of poor environmental conditions, and this proportion is likely to increase given the inevitable effects of global warming.LiNeBrEaKWithout a safe and adequate supply of drinking water, clean air, nutritious food and a safeguarded climate, humanity cannot survive. If we destroy the environment, all the political and social rights in the world will be for nought.LiNeBrEaKAmending the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to provide everyone with the right to a healthy environment would be a way to hold governments responsible for their actions.LiNeBrEaKThis is not an outlandish idea. In 1994, the U.N. commissioned a report that concluded everyone has the right to a safe and healthy environment. It even proposed a set of principles. However, the U.N. has dragged its feet for the past 14 years.LiNeBrEaKIt's a different story in the constitutions of more than 60 countries, all of which contain provisions on the environment. Many of them recognize peoples' rights to a healthy environment. These include Bulgaria, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Spain, South Africa and Turkey. Even the tiny African country of Burkina Faso guarantees everyone "the right to live in an environment free from contamination." So what is the U.N. waiting for? By taking action, the U.N. would show that the bold, visionary and compassionate spirit demonstrated by the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is still alive and well in 2008.LiNeBrEaKABOUT THE WRITERLiNeBrEaKKate Davies is director of the Center for Creative Change at Antioch University Seattle.

The New York Times 	December 8, 2008 Monday  Correction Appended  	When They Send In These Clowns, Every Day Is a Snow Day  LiNeBrEaKSlava's Snowshow (Play)&gt;; Slava's Snowshow (Play)&gt;  	By CHARLES ISHERWOOD  	Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; THEATER REVIEW 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW'; Pg. 1  	893 words  	Late Edition - FinalLiNeBrEaKGlobal warming is seriously bad news for polar bears and other arctic critters, but it's been hell on some unendangered species too, like snow-loving New Yorkers. Having grown up in a sunny California suburb, in a family that regarded skiing as a deplorably extravagant way to acquire a broken leg, I became snow-crazed as soon as I started visiting New York in the chillier months.LiNeBrEaK  The last few winters have been sadly flake-deficient, and I have sorely felt the loss. Frequent reminders that city snow quickly turns to ashen, slippery slush fall on deaf ears. The snow-mad want snow and consider a closet full of salt-corroded shoes a small price to pay. LiNeBrEaK  Saturday night's flurries were lovely but really just an amuse-bouche in meteorological terms. So my heart leapt as I entered the Helen Hayes Theater, where the delightful kiddie curio ''Slava's Snowshow'' opened on Sunday night for a brief holiday run. A fine dusting of snow -- well, fluffy white confetti, anyway -- was already piled up in the aisles, and if the show lived up to the promise of its title, more was on the way. LiNeBrEaK  The young children in the audience were already acting like fellow sufferers from snow deprivation. A girl in front of me was dispatching her pretzel nuggets from Auntie Anne's with alarming speed so she could join in the fun. As soon as she finished, she grabbed big gobs of pseudosnow from the floor and flung them skyward with a peal of joy. My companion, apparently not a snow lover, bristled at receiving the brunt of her fistful, but it was all I could do to keep from flinging a few myself.LiNeBrEaK  ''Slava's Snowshow'' was created in 1993 in Moscow by the Russian-born clown-artist Slava Polunin and has been seen in 25 countries since. It had an Off Broadway run of more than two years at the Union Square Theater, beginning in September 2004. LiNeBrEaK  Despite its worldwide success the show has retained the feel of a handmade diversion, modest in its means but powerful in its ability to induce waves of giggles and sighs of pleasure. Mr. Polunin, done up in a baggy yellow suit, with a bulbous red nose and traditional black-and-white clown makeup, alternates with a couple of others in the central role. This yellow fellow is flanked by a cadre of green-coated goofs in similar makeup, with mile-wide floppy black shoes and hats with wingspans to match.LiNeBrEaK  They bumble and stumble about, acting sad-clown-like, employing props like straw brooms, balloons and bubble machines. To analyze what they do would be pointless, like describing a kitten at play and expecting to transmit your pleasure at witnessing the scene.LiNeBrEaK  Let's just say if I were charged with the entertainment of children under 10 and had a Broadway budget at my disposal, this would be the show I'd favor. It does not stun children with spectacle but fires their imaginations and gives them a savory taste of the sensory pleasures of live entertainment without forcing too much unsettling clown intimacy on the adults in the audience. LiNeBrEaK  Which isn't to say you will emerge completely unmolested. The 20-minute intermission is more like recess, with some of the performers clambering across the audience and leading the more aggressive kids in snow fights and other raillery, some involving sprays of water. Adults without children to supervise might want to know that Sardi's, next door, makes a fine martini. LiNeBrEaK  The taped musical score leaves a lot to be desired, including as it does banalities like the ''Chariots of Fire'' theme and the famous shrieky bits from Orff's ''Carmina Burana.'' But you don't come to ''Slava's Snowshow'' for the music. You come for the snow.LiNeBrEaK  And on that front it does not disappoint. By the full-on blizzard finale, snow was generally all over the Helen Hayes Theater. It was falling on every part of the dark central section, on the balcony, falling softly upon the first rows. It lay thickly drifted on the aisles and on the floor, on the delighted faces of the littlest children, on the coat-covered laps of their parents. My soul swooned slowly as I heard the snow falling faintly through the universe of the Helen Hayes, and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and -- well, the jaded theater critics too.LiNeBrEaK  Please excuse that strange peroration. In my snow frenzy I seem to have purloined a few lines from James Joyce -- the immortal culminating paragraph of ''The Dead.'' But something tells me Joyce wouldn't mind. Judging from those gorgeous last lines, I suspect he was an inveterate snow lover himself.

Newsday (Melville, New York)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	1951 sci-fi classic gets an update for 21st-century audiences  	By John Anderson, Newsday  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	512 words  	There's a reasonable chance that this season's all-purpose, ecumenical holiday greeting will be "Klaatu barada nikto." Which is actually alien-speak for "Don't destroy the Earth, and get Klaatu back in the spaceship."LiNeBrEaKAudiences old enough to have seen the original 1951 "The Day the Earth Stood Still," either in theaters or via what used to be regular TV broadcasts, may remember that Klaatu was the uber-terrestrial played by Michael Rennie, who upon his arrival in America was shot by an overanxious soldier. He escaped from the hospital, developed a sort-of interspecies romance with Patricia Neal's Helen Benson and was envied by Hugh Marlowe's Tom Stevens. But even if viewers remember nothing else, the phrase _ which Klaatu had Helen repeat to his giant robot, Gort, to keep Gort from liquidating Washington _ is indelible. (AMC is airing the original Thursday at 8 p.m. EST and Friday at 3: 30 p.m.) LiNeBrEaKA parable about the human race, its fear of the unknown, its self-destructive xenophobia and its general belligerence, director Robert Wise's classic has now been remade, with Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly as the two leads. How it's been remade may say a lot about us, and how movie audiences view themselves. The movie opens Friday.LiNeBrEaKThe perils of global warming take center stage in the new film, rather than the threat of nuclear war (which was the subtext of virtually every '50s sci-fi movie). Reeves plays Klaatu, who has arrived on Earth with all intent of wiping out human life so the planet itself can survive. (Frankly, the casting of Reeves as a superior life-form packs as much potential for comedy as his casting as a doctor in the Jack Nicholson-Diane Keaton romp "Something's Got to Give.") Helen Benson, who was a secretary in the original, has become a Princeton astrobiologist. She's still a single mother _ of a black stepson, played by Will Smith's son Jaden, which one wouldn't have seen in the '50s _ and John Cleese plays Prof. Barnhardt, who was portrayed in the original by Sam ("Gunga Din") Jaffe.LiNeBrEaKSymptomatic of the times, perhaps, there is no actor credit for Gort, who in the original was played by 7-foot-tall Lock Martin. In the remake, Klaatu's mechanical accompanist is a computer-generated, animated robot estimated by his creators to be 28 feet tall. Reportedly, Gort's computer model was programmed to reflect light, and the process of motion-capture _ most memorably represented in "The Polar Express" and a system used to most closely replicate human movement _ was used for the "performance."LiNeBrEaKGort's destructive power dwarfs that of his predecessor, but in today's Hollywood bigger is always better, as is more lethal and, certainly, newer.LiNeBrEaKVisit Newsday online at http://www.newsday.com/	MOVIE REVIEWS (90%); SCIENCE FICTION and FANTASY FILMS (90%); FILM (89%); SPACECRAFT (77%); BROADCASTING INDUSTRY (72%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); THEATER (57%); SINGLE PARENTS (50%); ACTORS and ACTRESSES (76%); MOVIE RELEASE DATES (76%)  					EARTH (91%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 8, 2008  	ENGLISH  	PHOTOS (from MCT Photo Service, 202-383-6099).

Northwest Florida Daily News (Fort Walton Beach, Florida)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	From rubbish to earthship  	Kimberly White, Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	616 words  	Dec. 8--DEFUNIAK SPRINGS -- Kristen Hoffnung and her husband were traveling through New Mexico when they saw what looked like dozens of alien structures rising out of the barren landscape.LiNeBrEaK"You drive down the road and you're on the other side of the Rio Grande (River), and you look to the west and see the mountain range and that's what catches your eye," she remembered. "But then there's these bumps in the field that just aren't natural."LiNeBrEaKThey weren't in Roswell. They had just entered the Greater World Earthship Community near Taos and saw Earthships, or homes made of rubbish. LiNeBrEaKIntrigued, Hoffnung -- a science teacher at the Walton Career Development Center -- did some research and discovered that the Earth ships are the brainchild of architect Michael Reynolds, who in the mid-1970s began tinkering with the concept of building homes from recycled and reclaimed materials.LiNeBrEaKThe Career Development Center is open to high school students and adults in Walton and surrounding counties. Day classes are for high school students who want to gain practical experience in cosmetology, information technology, automotive skills or construction.LiNeBrEaKWhen classes started in the fall, Hoffnung presented the Earthship concept to her students. She told them to do a project on alternative housing and environmentally friendly designs, and they jumped on the idea of building their own Earthship. Hoffnung recruited Thomas Martin, the school's building construction technology instructor, to help.LiNeBrEaK"We live in a society now where you can't turn on a TV or read a magazine and not hear the words 'global warming,' 'going green' or 'carbon footprint,' " Hoffnung said. "These kids hear these words all day long but (the words) have no meaning to them ... This way, we can introduce them to different avenues, different ways of thinking, different ways of being."LiNeBrEaKNearly 60 students are learning the importance of reducing, reusing and recycling while building a selfsustaining building from old aluminum cans, plastic bottles and tires packed with earth.LiNeBrEaKThe Earthship is being built in eight nine-week phases. During the first phase, students collected and cleaned the material, excavated the site, and made fencing and a tire path. They are now working on the second phase, which involves laying out the site and erecting walls.LiNeBrEaKWhen the exterior walls are complete, students will shape the earth around the sides of the building and maybe plant grass on the roof, Hoffnung said.LiNeBrEaKThe students eventually will install solar panels to heat the house and a cistern to collect rainwater.LiNeBrEaKSo far, students have used materials donated by businesses. Hoffnung recently applied for a grant and will find out early next year whether it is accepted. Martin said the school also is looking to partner with Choctawhatchee Electric Cooperative and Gulf Power to develop the energy grid.LiNeBrEaKThe 1,400-square-foot house is expected to be finished by the end of next school year. It will then be used as a classroom.LiNeBrEaK"It's such an amazing concept. It just seems like it's a duh factor," Hoffnung said. "Why didn't we do this earlier? Why are we building skyscrapers? Why aren't we considering the environment and the terrain and the future? We don't. Not yet. But we're working on it."

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   Sunrise Edition	Scrutinize automakers' recovery plan  		Editorial; Pg. ELL  	530 words  	When I read and hear all the comments on not rewarding bad management, I have to wonder where all these voices were when money was practically thrown at the Wall Street bailout and then promptly misused by some overpaid CEOs. LiNeBrEaKIt seems that all these reservations only rear up when the jobs of ordinary Americans are at stake and when there is a chance to shift the auto industry manufacturing base to the foreign manufacturers in Alabama where there is considerable hostility to unions.LiNeBrEaKWorkers there work for whatever they can get and if they are ever dissatisfied with their compensation package or working conditions, too bad.LiNeBrEaKFor people who think this would be a perfectly fine way to run things, read your history of late 19th and early 20th century working conditions for the labor class before unions were formed. Workers gave their lives to form unions so that future workers would work in more humane conditions and receive a living wage for their efforts.LiNeBrEaKIt takes a strong working class to make a country prosperous and to support a democracy.LiNeBrEaKBARBARA BRANHAMLiNeBrEaKSouthwest PortlandLiNeBrEaKThe U.S. auto industry has no respect for taxpayers at home. They have pulled the rug out from under thousands of their own workers, sending jobs abroad where they can pay paltry wages and still claim they are not making a profit. Most importantly, they continue to do so.LiNeBrEaKBusiness is very good in Latin America and China where the fuel-efficient vehicles they never bothered with in the U.S. sell like hotcakes. Taxpayers should not rescue an industry with poor business practices and little national interest.LiNeBrEaKInstead, we should kindly suggest that they try knocking on the door of the oil companies whose business they have subsidized by creating gas-guzzling vehicles as if there is no tomorrow. Maybe they can come up with something creative.LiNeBrEaKEither way, as far as I'm concerned, tomorrow has arrived and a bailout is out of the question!LiNeBrEaKANITA CRUMPLiNeBrEaKVancouverLiNeBrEaKFor an auto industry bailout, we must demand requirements for guarantee of repayment or security via partial governmental ownership, re-tooling to produce only vehicles that meet minimum fuel-efficiency requirements, affordability standards for middle-class consumers, and strict emission standards to offset global warming and environmental quality. The industry must also pledge to re-employ displaced workers as soon as the turn-around begins.LiNeBrEaKThis bailout, while painful, is essential if we hope to stop the economic hemorrhaging and increasing unemployment that worsens with every passing day.LiNeBrEaKJAMES C. HERNANDEZ IILiNeBrEaKNortheast PortlandLiNeBrEaKWhile Congress rightfully scrutinizes the financial plans of the Big Three automakers, I hope it is looking at the United Auto Workers union as well.LiNeBrEaKOne of the UAW's demands a few decades back forced the automakers to create "job banks" --entities which have paid thousands of laid off workers $70,000 to $90,000 per year plus benefits in exchange for not working up to two years.LiNeBrEaKI thought Democrats like Nancy Pelosi were supposed to help the less fortunate, not force taxpayers to bail out companies where the bulk of the employees make more than twice the national average salary.LiNeBrEaKBILL BYRNELiNeBrEaKWest Linn	AUTOMAKERS (90%); EMPLOYMENT (90%); BAILOUTS (90%); AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (90%); WAGES and SALARIES (90%); CREDIT CRISIS (89%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (86%); EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (78%); LABOR UNIONS (78%); AUTOMOTIVE WORKERS (77%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (76%); AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY and ENVIRONMENT (76%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS (76%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (76%); EMISSIONS (69%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (65%); GLOBAL WARMING (64%); STANDARDS and MEASUREMENTS (60%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (60%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (60%); MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS (71%)  					PORTLAND, OR, USA (92%) OREGON, USA (92%); ALABAMA, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (94%); CHINA (79%); LATIN AMERICA (79%)  	December 9, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved  		MICHAEL MCMAHON (64%)  														
Plain Dealer (Cleveland) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   Final Edition; All Editions	Woodmere wins again at recycling  	Michael Scott, Plain Dealer Reporter  	METRO; Pg. B6  	530 words  	ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKIt's a three-peat for Woodmere.LiNeBrEaKThe tiny East Side suburb won for a third straight year the Cuyahoga County Solid Waste District's "Lead Community in a Recycling Role" at the agency's annual Trash Oscars recently. LiNeBrEaKWoodmere residents recycled at a rate of nearly 68. 7 percent - just ahead of Beachwood at 67. 1 percent. Beachwood, of course, was given the "Best Supporting Role" award.LiNeBrEaKLast year, Woodmere had finished nearly 6 percent higher than its nearby recycling rival, so the race is tightening.LiNeBrEaKThere are fewer than 1,000 people living (and making trash) in Woodmere, a burg along Interstate 271 of less than one square mile. So its trash and recycling volume - 200 tons of trash, 439 tons recycled -is considerably less than many others as well.LiNeBrEaKIf you want big trash, you have to go to Cleveland, where residents churn out nearly 196,000 tons of garbage. About 22,600 (11 percent) is recycled, a slight increase from the previous year.LiNeBrEaKThe waste district's Trash Oscars were held in Strongsville on Nov. 21. The rankings were based on 2007 figures turned in by the communities.LiNeBrEaKAmong the other winners was South Euclid, which won "Most Improved" after jumping 32. 9 to 41. 9 percent recycling over a year's time.LiNeBrEaKThe waste district has been publishing a recycling report since 2001 and recycling rates have risen from 18. 5 percent to 26. 5 percent overall in Cuyahoga County.LiNeBrEaKLast year, more than 213,000 tons of paper, plastic, metals, glass and organic debris was kept out of landfills in 59 Cuyahoga County communities.LiNeBrEaKFor more on the Trash Oscars, the recycling report and all things Cuyahoga County solid waste, go to cuyahogaswd.orgLiNeBrEaKMore enviro-winners: Biodiversity Alliance and Dominion presented their second annual Northeast Ohio Environmental Awards recently.LiNeBrEaKWinners received a $2,500 donation to the nonprofit environmental organization of their choice and a framed print of an endangered native wildflower from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's herbarium collection.LiNeBrEaKThe award winners named on Oct. 3 were:LiNeBrEaKThe West Geauga High School's Wetlands Education Team, which helped organize a statewide campaign to recognize the spotted salamander as the official state amphibian. The bill passed the Senate and is pending in the House of Representatives.LiNeBrEaKMassillon Middle School's 100-member "Stop Global Warming" Club, which recycled 20 tons of paper collected from classroom and office bins and created a wildlife habitat to offset carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKCase Western Reserve University, for following its 2005 strategic plan for sustainability. The university has put projects in place to conserve and capture water, refresh aquifers and prevent storm drain runoff into Lake Erie.LiNeBrEaKEarthWatch Ohio for publishing its free bi-monthly environmental newspaper, now distributed at more than 2,000 locations in 12 Northeast Ohio counties.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 8, 2008 Monday 	State air monitors gunning for diesel;  Soot-control plan worrying truckers 	Michael Gardner, U-T SACRAMENTO BUREAU  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	1131 words  	SACRAMENTO -- California's air-quality regulators once again find their pursuit of aggressive public health safeguards in conflict with the economy.LiNeBrEaKThis time, the state Air Resources Board is closing in on diesel soot emissions from nearly 1 million trucks.LiNeBrEaK"Ultimately, we have no choice but to proceed to control this source," said Mary Nichols, the air board's chairwoman. "They are a huge source of emissions that up until now have been essentially uncontrolled."LiNeBrEaKThe proposed regulations -- considered to be the nation's most restrictive -- would require many truckers to either gradually replace their rigs or install anti-pollution devices starting in 2010, depending on the model year and fleet size. By 2023, most diesel rigs "would have the cleanest engines available," according to an air board report.LiNeBrEaKMoreover, during its two-day meeting Thursday and Friday in Sacramento, the air board also is expected to adopt rules to squeeze better fuel efficiency out of long-haul big rigs. LiNeBrEaKThat proposal is part of the state's ongoing quest to reduce reliance on fossil fuels contributing to greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming. To move in that direction, regulators want truck cabs and trailers, depending on size and age, to be outfitted with smoother rolling tires and better aerodynamic equipment to cut wind resistance, for example.LiNeBrEaKThe rules also would apply to out-of-state trucks that deliver goods to California. Most shuttle buses, such as those at airports, also must comply. In all, 900,000 trucks and 170,000 businesses could be affected.LiNeBrEaK"Any way we look at this, it's going to be a watershed change," said Bob Ramorino, president of the California Trucking Association. "It's going to increase the complexity and cost of moving goods."LiNeBrEaKCritics say the new pollution standards could cost some operators their rigs and act as a drag on retail and construction. The air board's analysis reports that compliance will cost fleet owners $5. 5 billion through 2020.LiNeBrEaK"If this activity happens, I'll be forced to quit," said Tom Williamson, who makes his living with one 12-year-old truck, mostly hauling construction debris and materials in San Diego County.LiNeBrEaKThe industry has also warned that the cost will be passed along to customers, adding to the price of food and other commodities.LiNeBrEaKRegulators, though, describe any potential increases as negligible. If the air board adopts the regulations, no further approval is required.LiNeBrEaKPublic health advocates are lobbying for the air board to stick to its timetable, arguing that the public is paying a high price for diesel pollution through premature deaths and escalated rates of respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.LiNeBrEaKThe health impacts are staggering, according to regulators. They estimate that over the next 15 years the new rules would prevent 9,400 premature deaths, result in 150,000 fewer asthma cases, save 950,000 work days lost because of illness, and reduce public health costs by as much as $68 billion.LiNeBrEaK"These regulations are critical to public health," said Bonnie Holmes-Gen, who tracks the issue for the American Lung Association of California.LiNeBrEaKWithout action, the state will fail to meet federal air-quality standard deadlines, risking millions of dollars in federal highway funding, Nichols said.LiNeBrEaKThe air board estimates that, by 2020, the regulations would cut particulate matter in the soot emitted by diesel engines by 5. 2 tons per day, a 43 percent decline. Emissions of oxides of nitrogen, a primary contributor to smog, would be cut by 79 tons per day, a 23 percent reduction by 2020.LiNeBrEaKTruckers say they want to do their part, but worry about the financial costs.LiNeBrEaK"We are breathing the same air. We want it cleaned up, too," said Jennifer Secord, owner of Pacific Coast Truck and Warehouse in San Diego.LiNeBrEaKBut the recession makes that goal even more challenging, particularly for contract truckers, she said. Equipment to clean the soot, such as particulate filters, could cost $40,000 for a truck worth $10,000. At the same time, the number of runs has dropped off precipitously.LiNeBrEaK"It's going to be tough. I don't know how it's going to happen," Secord said. "They're doing half the trips they were doing at this time last year."LiNeBrEaKIndustry representatives say the tight credit market makes it virtually impossible to buy new trucks or equipment.LiNeBrEaKThe vehicle resale market has largely dried up, said Williamson, president of the California Dump Truck Owners Association, which has about 100 members in San Diego County.LiNeBrEaK"At the end of 2012, my truck will have to be pulled off the road," Williamson said. "There will be no market to sell my truck in California -- possibly in other states or countries. But they would only want it at a bargain price."LiNeBrEaKUsed trucks that drew bids of up to $40,000 a year ago now bring in less than $8,000, according to Robert Tennies, a salesman at Western Truck Center in West Sacramento.LiNeBrEaK"These trucks are going out of state for 10 cents on the dollar ... Even if they wanted to sell a truck today, they are really not in a position where they can afford to," Tennies said.LiNeBrEaKState regulators have put together a $1 billion package of grants and loans to help the industry comply over the coming years, Nichols said. The state plans to tap several different existing accounts, including bond money passed by voters and funding approved by lawmakers, to come up with the aid.LiNeBrEaKTruckers have prepared alternatives, including providing more time to comply and exemptions if proven clean technology is not readily available.LiNeBrEaKThe industry also proposes a hand-me-down program that it says will help clean the air without economic hardship. First, the state would buy trucks required to have soot-cleaning equipment installed. Then, after being retrofitted, those trucks could be used to replace some of the oldest and dirtiest rigs that are exempt from the regulations because they are driven so few miles. Operators who sell their vehicles initially to the state could use the money to buy new trucks.LiNeBrEaK"We want to take the oldest vintage trucks and scrap them as quickly as we can. They pollute the most," said Ramorino, the trucking association president.LiNeBrEaKOVERVIEWLiNeBrEaKBackground:LiNeBrEaKDiesel exhaust emissions threaten the health of Californians, but the cost of reducing the emissions could burden the trucking industry and, by extension, the retail and construction sectors during a time of economic turmoil.LiNeBrEaKWhat's changing:LiNeBrEaKState air-quality regulators are considering stringent standards that could force truckers to install soot-catching equipment or replace engines, depending on the age of the rigs and fleet sizes.LiNeBrEaKThe future:LiNeBrEaKTruckers insist many will have to sell out, but health advocates say the state will help offset compliance costs and the reward will be healthier air.

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Dishonest debate;  Credible climate policy skeptics are ignored 		OPINION; Pg. B-6  	491 words  	On Friday, the California Air Resources Board will decide whether to adopt its "scoping plan" for the implementation of AB 32, the 2006 anti-global warming law. It requires state energy suppliers to use far more power from cleaner but more costly sources. LiNeBrEaKGiven that this would impose unique burdens on California businesses, many observers (including this editorial page) have been skeptical and said a national or international approach to global warming makes more sense. The response from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been that the opposite is true: Far from burdening the economy, the forced transition to new sources of power would touch off a statewide boom as California companies become world leaders in alternate energy and as businesses benefit from efficient new technologies.LiNeBrEaKThe ARB's scoping plan confirms this rosy view. Now, however, several highly credible authorities have emerged to shred these claims.LiNeBrEaKFirst, the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office -- the most respected voice in Sacramento -- issued a Nov. 17 analysis that said the ARB's methodology was deeply flawed and often ignored evidence that would counter the economic-boom thesis. Its most startling finding was that the ARB arbitrarily defined any reduction in greenhouse gas emission as being cost-effective. If, say, energy costs double for a small business because of AB 32, how is that possibly cost-effective?LiNeBrEaKThen came the release of a scathing "peer review" of the scoping plan. Harvard's Robert Stavins wrote that the ARB's "economic analysis is terribly deficient in critical ways" and could not be relied on. Janet Peace and Liwayway Adkins of the Pew Center for Global Climate Change wrote that the analysis "gives the appearance of justifying the chosen package of regulatory measures rather than evaluating it." Wesleyan University's Gary Yohe wrote it was "almost beyond belief" that the agency could claim vast economic gains and decried the "spurious precision" of its forecasts. UCLA's Matthew Kahn noted the considerable evidence contradicting the ARB's claims that manufacturers, who employ 1. 5 million Californians, would not be hurt by higher energy costs. Dallas Burtraw of the Resources for the Future group said the models used by the ARB underestimate costs, wrongly anticipate a "frictionless," easy transition to new energy sources and are in troubling "harmony" about the economic upside of the scoping plan.LiNeBrEaKThese analyses make it obvious that there must be a do-over on the ARB plan -- one that takes an honest look at the effects of AB 32. Instead, both the governor and the ARB are essentially dismissing the LAO and peer-review reports -- and as of Friday, the Union-Tribune was the only newspaper in the state to have even mentioned either.LiNeBrEaKHow is this possible? How does this make any sense? How can all the elephants in the room be ignored?LiNeBrEaKCalifornians deserve infinitely better from Arnold Schwarzenegger -- and from the media.

San Antonio Express-News 	December 8, 2008 Monday   STATEandMETRO Edition	It's time to clear the air and help Texas  	Chris Lehman, Loyd Cortez and Cyrus Reed  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 4B  	706 words  	A watershed moment - or rather a Bonanza - has just occurred for the U.S. and Texas, allowing us to move to a clean energy economy and cut global warming emissions.LiNeBrEaKIn November, the Environmental Protection Agency governance board, the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) rejected all the EPA's reasons for refusing to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new coal-fired power plants. Before the decision, the EPA - and the state agencies it oversees - were approving new coal plants without requiring them to reduce or even look at their carbon dioxide emissions. Then came Bonanza, a Deseret Power Electric Cooperative in Utah that would have emitted 3. 37 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. The EAB told Bonanza, No.LiNeBrEaKTexas is number one in wind capacity, production and future generation. But if our state doesn't do more to get on board the clean energy train, Texas will lose jobs in the clean energy economy and be left behind in a cloud of expensive coal plant smog. LiNeBrEaKThe EAB decision means all new proposed coal plants nationwide must go back and address their carbon dioxide emissions. In Texas, this applies to recently permitted coal plants - Luminant's huge greenhouse gas emitter, Oak Grove 1 and 2, Dynegy's Sandy Creek plant and San Antonio's CPS Spruce II, all currently in early-phase construction, and to a raft of coal and petroleum coke project applications currently under review by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, including Limestone III, Las Brisas, Coleto Creek, Tenaska, and White Stallion.LiNeBrEaKIf Texas ignores this decision and all of the new coal plants proposed in Texas are built, an additional 75 million tons per year of CO2 - the principal greenhouse gas will be emitted, 15 percent more than now, though we must cut global warming emissions by 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKLast week, Gov. Rick Perry and the Texas Advisory Panel on Environmental Regulations blasted future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at a press conference at the Capitol, saying it would devastate Texas' economy. It will, however, cost the Texas economy more not to cut greenhouse gas emissions now.LiNeBrEaKPerry and the panel should view this moment as a great opportunity for Texas to repower and rebuild by investing in clean energy technologies that will boost the economy, create jobs and help the climate recover.LiNeBrEaKWe can credit Perry, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and the Legislature for starting down the track toward a clean energy future in Texas. Successful wind energy projects have created thousands of jobs across the state, and the decisions to create Competitive Renewable Energy Zones - transmission lines from West Texas - and to double the energy efficiency requirements of our utilities are good first steps. But we can and must do more.LiNeBrEaKBefore the coming legislative session, the governor and our Legislature must prepare to cut our emissions and grow the clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaKTexas needs an action plan that includes an inventory and reporting and permitting systems that do not allow gross emissions by coal plants. We must create a Texas solar program that requires at least 5 percent of our peak demand to be met by utility-scale and on-site solar by 2020 through a combination of requirements and incentives. We must fund a weatherization program "on steroids" for low-income Texans, using the hundreds of millions of dollars that have accumulated in the Systems Benefit Fund, paid by virtually all Texans. We must increase our energy efficiency requirements to meet 1500 MWs - two percent of peak demand - by 2020. We must update state minimum building codes, based upon now-outdated 2001 efficiency codes. We must triple the Texas LoanSTAR program, which lends money to public to make energy efficiency changes in public buildings that save Texas taxpayers money, and we must "green" our public transportation fleets toward electric and hybrid vehicles. Businesses can also develop geothermal power in Texas.LiNeBrEaKThe coming session is the place to seize this opportunity and get on board the clean energy economy train.LiNeBrEaKChris Lehman is chairman of the Austin Sierra Club; Loyd Cortez, chairman of the Alamo Group Sierra Club; and Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club.

The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   FINAL Edition	Obama can't really walk on water;  LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 		Op-Ed; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. B4  	1408 words  	Editor - I am rather amazed to see letters from some readers who seem to think our new President-elect Obama must completely change everything and immediately initiate bold agendas, while simultaneously solving the greatest economic recession since the great crash of 1929; fixing an American global reputation left in total diplomatic shambles after eight years of shoot-first cowboy mind-set; maintaining our national security and safety while two different overseas wars rage and restoring lost bipartisanship - all in the blink of an eye. LiNeBrEaKI stand confidently, as does the vast majority, with the noble agendas Obama set forth and just wish these utopians would take off their rose-colored glasses and realize that a magic wand and pixie dust won't cut it. It's a 21st century global reality that we are dealing with.LiNeBrEaKKENNETH HODGES  LiNeBrEaKSaratoga LiNeBrEaKEditor - Many of your readers are already writing to express their disenchantment with President-elect Obama, based largely upon his cabinet picks. The gist of their letters is that the selection of Sen. Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and General James Jones to serve in his administration does not represent "change."LiNeBrEaKThe amazing thing about the Obama phenomenon during the campaign was the tendency of people everywhere to project upon him their various political ideals. He was all things to all people. But, if one paid close attention to what he actually said about substantive issues, he was not nearly so liberal as people imagined. His talk about bipartisanship, in particular, was a signal that he would govern from the political center.LiNeBrEaKDespite my left-leaning personal biases, I am heartened by Obama's election and by his cabinet picks. Beyond the obvious historical significance of his ascendance as the first African-American president, the fact that he is celebrated by the entire world presents an unprecedented opportunity for global efforts to deal with the current economic crisis, climate change and geopolitical polarization.LiNeBrEaK Moreover, his cabinet picks send a strong message of non-ideological competence, in sharp contrast to the Bush administration. Now, that is change I can believe in.LiNeBrEaKSTEVE ABERN LiNeBrEaKOakland LiNeBrEaKMove on?LiNeBrEaKEditor - In "S.F. archbishop defends role in Prop. 8 passage," Dec. 4, The Chronicle wrote in its deck that San Francisco Catholic Archbishop George Niederauer "urges both sides to tone down rhetoric, move on." I'd like to ask the archbishop a couple of questions: Does this mean that Your Excellency's church is going to stop calling me an "objectively disordered," "grave threat to the family" because I'm gay?LiNeBrEaKWould Your Excellency be asking both sides to move on if Your Excellency's side had lost? Your excellent subscriber,LiNeBrEaKLOUIS BRYAN LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco LiNeBrEaKExpectationsLiNeBrEaKEditor - In stories about Michelle Obama, the emphasis is invariably on her race, her clothes or her roles as wife and mother, with little said about her superb professional training and experience, and the ways in which her career accomplishments prepare her to be confidante and adviser to the president and undertake important initiatives as first lady.LiNeBrEaK This week, a niece of mine sent pictures of her new granddaughter. The child is shown happily inspecting a toy stove and refrigerator. I couldn't help wondering if that is where it all begins. Girls are taught from the earliest age that whatever else they may become or accomplish in life, their first duty is to home and hearth and the rearing of children. Boys are never saddled with such expectations.LiNeBrEaK Rev. FRED FENTON LiNeBrEaKConcord LiNeBrEaKCongestion punishmentLiNeBrEaK Editor - Not everyone in central San Francisco drives in from outside to work or shop. Thousands of us actually live there. We have a myriad of daily events taking us and our friends and family in and out of the center: kids in school, after-school activities, jobs, car pool pick-ups, evening errands, visitors and more.LiNeBrEaK A toll to the city center punishes local residents, too, and would pile on another element making family life here untenable.LiNeBrEaKJANET LEWIS WONG LiNeBrEaKSan Francisco LiNeBrEaKInnovate, or go underLiNeBrEaK Editor - Recently , there has been a lot written about the requested bailout of the U.S. automakers. One of the fears they seem to have had is that buyers who identify with the longtime American brands will not buy anything that's termed "energy efficient."LiNeBrEaK The right marketing can sell anything, even is it's the right and best thing imagine that!. We must demand U.S. automakers build innovative, energy efficient cars for now and our future if we are to consider supporting them. If they can't agree to this, we'll give the innovators our business.LiNeBrEaKANITA SALTANIS LiNeBrEaK San Bruno LiNeBrEaKBailout here, there ...LiNeBrEaKEditor - Almost everybody seems to be getting bailed out by the government, with behemoths being rewarded for careless management. AIG had to be saved, then Citigroup. Will Detroit carmakers, with their corporate jets, be next?LiNeBrEaKCEOs are strapping on their golden parachutes in droves. And the president even pardons 14 convicts.LiNeBrEaKThe government absorbs worthless mortgages, even where floated under less-than-honest circumstances by slick manipulators. And it now guarantees money-market funds. LiNeBrEaKJust one problem: When it took over Fannie Mae, my supposedly conservative investment in Fannie Mae preferred stock, whose income was paying down the mortgage on my home, became nearly worthless. Payouts ceased, and the dominoes continue to topple. Does the government really want me, too, to default on my mortgage?LiNeBrEaKPAUL HERTELENDY Piedmont LiNeBrEaKBig feedersLiNeBrEaKEditor -"Too big to fail" didn't work for dinosaurs, why should it for business?LiNeBrEaKThe Tyrannosaurus Rex ran out of food. Big cars fed on cheap gasoline and big banks fed on the fantasy that property values only go up. They are perfect candidates for the Malthusian effect: a large correction, occurring when populations expand rapidly and either disease or famines wipe them out. Predators rely on large numbers of small prey being healthy.LiNeBrEaK It is ridiculous to rescue those failed institutions at the direct expense of their prey. Killing the food source kills the ecosystem.LiNeBrEaKThe idea that a company is "too big to fail" is the very reason it is overdue for extinction. Things won't improve if we rescue hubristic institutions which think it is a pretty nifty idea to fly to Washington in private jets to beg for money without a plan, or for AIG to spend $400,000 on an executive retreat, right after it received an $85 billion bailout. What a delicious epicaricacy!LiNeBrEaKRUSSELL HOULSTON LiNeBrEaKWalnut Creek LiNeBrEaKBuy them outLiNeBrEaKEditor - Now that we know how the story ends with "compassionate conservatism" and Reaganomics, I hope our next president and Congress look at how well capitalism is working. With finance, insurance and real estate industries in government receivership, and the auto industry next up, the smell of rot is wilting my poinsettias.LiNeBrEaKIs it trickle-down economics? The current government response to the looming depression is classic trickle down: Use the Social Security trust fund to prop up bankrupt corporations and rich individuals.LiNeBrEaK The economic problem today isn't a lack of supply, it is a lack of demand. Has anyone noticed house prices in Michigan and Ohio lately? Instead of transferring taxpayer wealth to another corporate boardroom, why not try giving it to the employees directly? What's to lose?LiNeBrEaK The auto industry is asking for $34 billion. For about $45 billion, the United States could give all 600,000 employees of GM, Ford, and Chrysler a $75,000 buyout each so they can survive. Then the U.S. government could take out the industry and rebuild it - just like the Japanese and Europeans did after WWII.LiNeBrEaK PAUL PAGE San Francisco LiNeBrEaKA senseless death at Wal-MartLiNeBrEaK Editor - The tragic, unnecessary death of 34-year-old Wal-Mart store employee Jdimytai Damour stunningly begs discussion of our national character. LiNeBrEaKGood heavens folks, this wasn't the last helicopter out of Saigon 30 years ago. An estimated 2,000 people were lined up for hours, not for food, water, or medicine, not for rescue from flood or famine, but just to buy stuff. LiNeBrEaKWhile we debate the necessity of taxpayer dollars rescuing or bailing out banks and industries, can we not honestly look at ourselves and our collective confusion between wants and needs, our apparent choice to allow ourselves to be reduced to a "consumer society" and the moral values we have lost along the way?LiNeBrEaKSHARON WILLIAMS LiNeBrEaK Redwood City 	LETTERS and COMMENTS (91%); RELIGION (87%); CLERGY and RELIGIOUS (84%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (77%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (77%); HISTORY (76%); GREAT DEPRESSION (72%); NATIONAL SECURITY (72%); RECESSION (72%); ECONOMIC NEWS (72%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (71%); CATHOLICS and CATHOLICISM (65%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (77%) OP-ED; LETTER  					SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 8, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (95%); MICHELLE OBAMA (50%); JAMES L JONES (55%); ROBERT M GATES (55%); HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (55%); LAWRENCE SUMMERS (55%)  														
The San Francisco Chronicle (California) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   FINAL Edition	THE BOTTOM LINE  	Andrew S. Ross  	Business; THE BOTTOM LINE; Pg. D1  	660 words  	Clean energy appears out of reach for yearsLiNeBrEaKWill clean tech save us by 2025? Will it end our dependence on global-warming fossil fuels by then? Not very likely, says the U.S. government's National Intelligence Council. "All current technologies are inadequate for replacing the traditional energy architecture on the scale needed, and new energy technologies probably will not be commercially viable and widespread by 2025." So says the council's just-released report, "Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World." LiNeBrEaK The report, now in the hands of President-elect Barack Obama, is a 100-page view, put together by U.S. intelligence analysts, with input from outside experts, of what the world will look like two decades from now. LiNeBrEaK Much of it we've already heard. The United States, while still No. 1, will be sharing power with others, like Brazil; terrorism and nuclear proliferation will pose major threats; the Middle East will still be a cauldron; the "unprecedented transfer of wealth" from West to East - notably China and India - is unstoppable. And the growing pressure on traditional energy sources will make an already perilous planet, with 1. 5 billion more people on it, even more so. LiNeBrEaKDespite its skepticism that high-tech will ride to energy's rescue, the report offers some reason for optimism: "Despite what are seen as long odds now, the greatest possibility for a relatively quick and inexpensive transition from fossil fuels comes from better renewable generation sources photovoltaic and wind and improvements in battery technology." LiNeBrEaKIn the main, however, the report throws cold water on the expectations of the more idealistic clean-tech advocates. Yes, the world will be moving away from oil by 2025, it says, but in its place expect more natural gas, coal and nuclear energy. And any technology-driven improvements will take longer than you think. LiNeBrEaK"In the energy sector, a recent study found that it takes an average of 25 years for a new production technology to become widely adopted," the report notes. "Even with a favorable policy and funding environment for biofuels, clean coal, or hydrogen, the transition to new fuels will be slow." LiNeBrEaKTo download a copy of the report, go to www.dni.gov/nic. The more detailed treatment of energy and technology are on Pages 61-67.LiNeBrEaKOn the brighter side: Not all is lost on the high-tech front, according to the council. Here are its Probable Breakthroughs for 2025:LiNeBrEaK-- Clean coal. Advances in carbon capture sequestration and "syngas" coal gasification, which curbs emissions, improves energy efficiency. Syngas can also be used as a replacement for oil-based transportation fuels and industrial chemicals.LiNeBrEaK-- Clean water. Much better purification of fresh water and wastewater, and desalination of brackish and seawater. The technology here include membrane bioreactors, materials' substitutions, nanoparticles, nanofibers and other purification technologies. LiNeBrEaK-- Energy storage. Major steps forward in battery materials, ultracapacitors and hydrogen storage materials, particularly for fuel cells.LiNeBrEaK-- Biogerontechnology. New biotech-driven treatments, especially for the ailments of old age, courtesy of real-time biosensor monitoring, DNA-specific medicine and targeted drug delivery mechanisms.LiNeBrEaK-- Ubiquitous computing. Also called the Internet of Things, involving tagging and networking of such things as food packages, rooms, furniture and paper documents. Think radio-frequency identification, sensor networks and tiny embedded servers.LiNeBrEaKTo read the section on Technological Breakthroughs by 2025, ranging from probable to possible to plausible including robots and "human augmentation technologies", see Page 69 of the report.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Congress should move to re-enact the oil-shale moratorium  	By Craig Thompson  	OPINION; Columnists  	644 words  	In a blind rush to promote oil shale development, the Bureau of Land Management released rules Nov. 17 governing public-land oil shale operations and royalties. Not surprisingly, oil shale royalties are a fraction of those charged for other public-land energy resources.LiNeBrEaKWhy do we have to sweeten the deal when the Rocky Mountain oil shale potential energy reserve is both enormous and seductive? Past attempts to subsidize the industry have not worked. LiNeBrEaKWhy? To begin with, it is neither oil nor shale. The energy source is kerogen with a low heat content --- about 10 percent of crude oil -- a lower heat content than municipal garbage and half the heat content of prunes. Oil shale boosters tell us that there may be a trillion or two barrels of kerogen -- perhaps 800 billion barrels of it recoverable. That is an enormous reserve and is seductive to a fossil-fuel addicted country.LiNeBrEaKAppropriately seduced, the BLM is in an obvious hurry. Their rules will take effect three days before the Bush administration leaves office. Their urgency was obvious when in May they denied a request by Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal and Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter for additional time to review the 2,000-page environmental impact statement. Why the rush? The reserve has been here for the last 50 million years.LiNeBrEaKOil-shale development also produces huge environmental costs globally and locally.LiNeBrEaKLow-heat fuels that require a lot of energy to develop mean more carbon dioxide per unit of heat yielded. This means considerably more global warming pollution. Some of the world's top climate scientists recently have issued warnings that we are on the verge of unstoppable global warming.LiNeBrEaKOil shale expands when retorted. It expands into an enormous solid waste problem --concentrated in water-soluble salts and metals that must be isolated to prevent environmental contamination. Oil shale beds often serve as the floor for aquifers. Heat the oil shale in place and you heat the aquifer. That causes the groundwater to become contaminated with elements like arsenic and fluoride. This becomes a groundwater nightmare.LiNeBrEaKOne cost will be paid in units of acre-feet -- water. Turning shale into useful fuel will require lakes of water in all phases of development. Water has to come from somewhere in this arid region. It can only come from unclaimed Colorado River drainage water or from existing users. The former source promises a fight and the latter a major war.LiNeBrEaKWater is not the only issue. Public oil-shale lands support some of the richest wildlife populations in North America -- already impacted by a booming gas development industry. These 2 million acres are home to the largest mule deer herd in the country, mountain lions, black bears, bald eagles and elk. Develop that habitat and Americans will be left with an impoverished landscape.LiNeBrEaKIn spite of the enormous promise, oil shale remains a finite, non-renewable resource. With current technology, oil shale development will not solve our energy problems. It is a desperately poor fuel that will not bring energy independence. That solution will ultimately come by converting to renewable resources. At best, oil shale development may delay a transition to renewable energy that we will have to make in the future anyway. That delay will come at a terrible cost to the West and perhaps to the planet.LiNeBrEaKGovernors Freudenthal and Ritter, along with U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar and Senator-elect Mark Udall get it. They have called for a go-slow approach. We need to support them and to urge them to call on Congress to re-enact the oil shale moratorium.LiNeBrEaKCraig Thompson was an oil shale worker in the 1970s, an oil shale/ground water researcher in the 1980s, and is now professor of engineering and environmental science at Western Wyoming Community College. He is also the chair-elect of the National Wildlife Federation board of directors.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Obama urged to think big, act boldly on clean energy  	By Frank Davies Mercury News Washington Bureau  	BREAKING; Politics; News; National; Business; Lifestyle  	930 words  	WASHINGTON   Memo to Barack Obama on ways to revamp the nation's energy policy and boost the economy: Think big. Act boldly.LiNeBrEaKThat's the emerging consensus of policy experts, Bay Area clean-tech leaders and even hardened politicians who know the obstacles. They are urging the president-elect to seize a rare opportunity and dramatically accelerate the nation toward a clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaK"We can't lose this moment," said Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania at a forum last week. "We have to do things in a big way." LiNeBrEaKSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid told an energy conference at Google's Washington office to expect a large spending package when Congress convenes in January.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not concerned about spending money," he said. "It's the only way to get out of the hole that's been dug for us, and that applies to energy."LiNeBrEaKObama and congressional leaders are about to make key decisions that will show just how bold they want to be on the energy front:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKObama's energy and environment team could be unveiled as early as this week. Those appointments will give clues on how aggressively Obama wants to move. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWith the recession getting worse and unemployment on the rise, pressure is building for a large stimulus plan, costing $500 billion or more, next month. Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and John Podesta, chief of the transition team, favor a large "green recovery" component in that package, including more spending on alternative fuels. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKCiting the threat of climate change, Obama has said he wants to push for strict limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, with utilities and manufacturers buying and trading pollution permits. But is setting up a complex cap-and-trade system achievable in 2009, with fears that it could boost energy prices in the short term? LiNeBrEaKObama enters the White House with lots of political capital, an expanded Democratic majority in Congress, and a raft of specific proposals from his own team and allies in the center-left think tanks of Washington.LiNeBrEaKPodesta, former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, heads one of those groups, the Center for American Progress. He became Obama's transition chief in August, three months before the election, and quietly began planning a fast start for the Obama presidency.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's center in September issued a $100 billion "green recovery" plan of tax credits, direct spending and loan guarantees to spur clean technology and energy efficiency and create 2 million jobs   a major Obama goal.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's group even forecast the impact on each state. California would receive $12. 7 billion, creating 235,000 jobs, under the plan. That could include federal funding for high-speed rail, backed by state voters in November.LiNeBrEaK"The investment described here is doable in the early days of a new administration," Podesta wrote three months ago.LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus package in January will include at least $15 billion for clean tech and energy efficiency, an Obama adviser told The New York Times. That would include money to weatherize homes and grants for mass transit.LiNeBrEaKReid and Obama have used similar language that the economic crisis is "an opportunity" to build a clean-tech infrastructure for the future while boosting jobs and growth in the short term.LiNeBrEaKJeff Anderson of San Francisco, who chaired Clean Tech for Obama during the campaign, said the Obama team "wants as many green elements as they can get" in the stimulus bill.LiNeBrEaK"What's important for a recovery is getting an immediate bang for your buck, and energy efficiency is easier stuff that you can do quickly," Anderson said.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the stimulus plan, the long-range effort to combat global warming will be a priority, Obama has promised.LiNeBrEaKBut complex cap-and-trade legislation raises big questions about costs, as long as the U.S. economy relies on oil and coal. Depending on how pollution permits are sold, utilities could face higher costs in the short term that they would pass on to consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental groups and many businesses say a cap-and-trade system is the only way to set a price on carbon and shift market forces in favor of renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe overarching question Obama faces is whether he can press for two complicated domestic initiatives   health care reform and tackling climate change   while focusing on the biggest priority, an economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKHistorian Matt Dallek of the University of California-Berkeley said the Obama team "is weighing how far and how fast they can move on all these things."LiNeBrEaK"It may help them to do health care and energy early, even if you don't get everything you want," Dallek said. "The election has given Obama a clear mandate and more space to act than presidents usually have, and they want to take advantage of that."LiNeBrEaKContact Frank Davies at fdavies@mercurynews.com or (202) 662-8921.LiNeBrEaKcontenders FOR ENERGY, ENVIRONMENTLiNeBrEaKSpeculation is building over who will fill key energy and environment jobs in Barack Obama"s Cabinet.

The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   FINAL EDITION	Renewable energy can power America past many problems  	MICHAEL ECKHART  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 013  	661 words  	In just several short weeks, Barack Obama will be sworn in as the 44th president of the United States before a crowd of millions in America and billions worldwide. This historic occasion represents to many a break with the politics of the past and hope for newfound solutions to many of the difficult issues that confront our nation.LiNeBrEaKAs the incoming administration and Congress get down to work in January, their plates will be full dealing with the financial crisis and economic downturn, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, restoration of our foreign relations, health care reform, education reform and the enormous package of energy, climate and environment issues. LiNeBrEaKIn this tsunami of policy issues, there is one golden (green) option that unlocks solutions for almost all: renewable energy. Immediate investment in this field will unravel the errors of the past and begin to weave a tapestry of positive effects that will cover every one of our policy challenges.LiNeBrEaKIncentives that cause investment in wind farms, solar power projects and other renewables will create immediate markets for new high-tech companies and jobs in manufacturing, engineering, finance, installation, maintenance and repair. This will be a boon to corporate America, including autoworkers, who are already skilled at such jobs, as well as the high-tech venture capital investors who are in the business of creating companies.LiNeBrEaKGermany did this in 2003, and by 2007 this country of 90 million had created more than 230,000 jobs directly attributed to renewables: 82,000 jobs in wind power, 27,000 in solar power, 13,000 in solar heating, 9,400 in small hydropower, 4,200 in geothermal energy and 95,200 in biomass energy, power and fuels. Had the United States done the same thing, our country with more than 300 million people could have created approximately 750,000 jobs as a result.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy can even help ameliorate the financial crisis. The banks see risk everywhere and have stopped lending. But they will slowly come back through a "flight to quality." And what is more high quality than a wind farm or solar project that has both revenues from the electric utility and real assets as collateral for the loan?LiNeBrEaKThe Obama-led energy strategy can be based on a commitment to increase renewable energy to 25 percent of our nation's energy supply by the year 2025.LiNeBrEaKThis will require an investment of $2 trillion to $3 trillion starting immediately, directing our money into new, job-creating investments.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy takes us forward as a nation and makes money doing it.LiNeBrEaKRenewable energy can also give us a new focus on education. We will need to educate and train the millions of scientists, engineers, technicians, installers, electricians, plumbers, carpenters and all manner of workers to rebuild our infrastructure. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers already possess the vast majority of occupational skills necessary to reduce global warming and make the shift to a clean-energy economy. Today, green-collar workers are installing solar panels, retrofitting buildings to make them more efficient, constructing transit lines, refining waste oil into biodiesel, erecting wind farms, repairing hybrid cars, building green rooftops, planting trees and more.LiNeBrEaKIn fact, according to research by the American Solar Energy Society and Management Information Services Inc., aggressive development of the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries could generate up to $4. 5 trillion in revenue and create 40 million jobs by 2030.LiNeBrEaKIt is widely recognized that renewable energy will play an integral role in energy supply in the 21st century. Let's unleash the power of innovation that will create the immediate jobs that are needed to return our country to its rightful place on the global stage.LiNeBrEaKMichael Eckhart is founding president and a member of the board of directors of the American Council on Renewable Energy.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Al Gore not interested in Obama job  	By Jonathan Martin Politico  	POLITICS; News  	627 words  	He may be assembling a Team of Heavyweights, but Barack Obama isn't likely to have the full-time services of one of the most formidable powers on the political landscape.LiNeBrEaKWhen Obama and Joe Biden sit down with Al Gore at noon today in Chicago, they'll be talking issues -- not making the pitch for the former vice president to return to government service, say transition officials and those close to Gore.LiNeBrEaKGore intends on continuing his work on the environment and energy from the outside rather than accepting a post. LiNeBrEaK"This meeting is a continuation of their conversations about climate and energy and how policies to address them can help the economy and jobs," said Gore spokeswoman Kalee Kreider. "Former Vice President Gore still believes his calling at this time is to help educate the public about the issues through his roles at the Alliance at Climate Protection and other work."LiNeBrEaKEven from the outside, though, Gore remains a forceful voice and enjoys a considerable following. That's why Obama disclosed the event to the public and why he'll let cameras in to take shots of the three.LiNeBrEaKCalled the "Goreacle," half in jest, for his early prophecy on global warming, the Nobel Prize winner may be on his way to having that nickname validated further.LiNeBrEaKIn his radio address Saturday, Obama began detailing the stimulus package he hopes to sign upon taking office and it just so happens to include much of what Gore has been urging for months: That there is a way to marry economic recovery with restoring the environment.LiNeBrEaK"We need to upgrade our federal buildings by replacing old heating systems and installing efficient light bulbs," Obama said in the address, promising to do much the same in schools around the country.LiNeBrEaKIt's this nexus of job creation, energy and the environment that Gore has been discussing privately with Obama and advocating for in public, especially through his Repower America initiative, which aims to get the country to 100% clean electricity within 10 years.LiNeBrEaKIn launching this self-described "moon-shot" proposal in a speech in July, Gore said: "It turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever-rising energy prices."LiNeBrEaKBut having won a Nobel Prize for his work on climate change and an Academy Award for his documentary "An Inconvenient Truth," Gore appears to be comfortable, and effective, advocating from the outside. In some ways, he has done more to advance the issues he cares about as a private citizen than as a government official.LiNeBrEaKBut those close to him indicate he'll still maintain a voice on these topics in the new administration.LiNeBrEaK"You could certainly seek him asked to play a special envoy role on a discrete issue such as a global climate change summit or to provide expertise on how to integrate green infrastructure into a future economic recovery plan," said Chris Lehane, who worked on Gore's 2000 presidential campaign.LiNeBrEaKGore waited until after the hard-fought Democratic primary before offering his endorsement, but he had conversations on energy and the environment long before then.LiNeBrEaKAccepting Gore's endorsement after he wrapped up the nomination in June, Obama said: "When I am president, I will be counting on Al Gore to help me lead the fight for a clean energy future here in America and around the globe."LiNeBrEaKGore tapped into his vast fundraising list to help raise money for Obama and hosted the then-candidate at his Nashville home at a fundraiser after the second presidential debate in that city. Gore and his wife, Tipper, also stumped in Florida for Obama in the last days of the presidential campaign, invoking memories of the campaign there that cost him the presidency.LiNeBrEaKCarrie Budoff Brown contributed to this story.

Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Minnesota's moose declining as temps rise, scientists say: The Minnesota Moose Summit convened in Duluth to consider responses to the declining moose population.  	Larry Oakes, Star Tribune, Minneapolis  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	550 words  	Dec. 8--DULUTH -- Scientists brought together by Minnesota's Moose Advisory Committee said this morning that they've seen a clear correlation between rising average temperatures and the state's declining moose population. LiNeBrEaKThe Minnesota Moose Summit was convened by the state Department of Natural Resources [DNR] to gather experts and start formulating possible responses to a marked decline in moose in the state.LiNeBrEaKThe population has dropped from as many as 14,000 moose in the mid-1980s to an estimated 7,700 today. In northwestern Minnesota the population nearly  collapsed, from about 4,000 in the 1980s to fewer than 100 in 2007. The population in northeastern Minnesota has declined an estimated 6 percent per year since 2002, according to DNR estimates.LiNeBrEaKMoose hunting permits have been correspondingly reduced, to the point since the early 1990s that a hunter lucky enough to be picked in the DNR's annual lottery can't apply again.LiNeBrEaKWildlife experts gathered this morning said that while disease, parasites, predation and other factors all contribute to moose mortality in northern Minnesota -- a place already on the extreme southern fringe of the moose's historic range -- heat stress from climate change appears to be the root cause of the population decline.LiNeBrEaK"Moose are very heat sensitive," said Prof. Rolf Peterson of Michigan Technological University, chair of the advisory committee, which has been directed by the Minnesota Legislature to examine the decline and make recommendations.LiNeBrEaK"They're a 1,000-pound animal, and they're almost black,"  continued Peterson, who has studied the isolated moose population on Lake Superior's Isle Royale.  "They don't sweat like a horse. They have no terribly effective way of getting rid of heat except by breathing faster."LiNeBrEaKMark Lenarz, the DNR's wildlife research group leader, told the group that temperature readings taken at an Ely weather station document that "over the past 48 years, average summer and winter temperatures have increased substantially." Lenarz cited a study that found that when temperatures go above 23 in the winter and 57 in the summer, moose must expend more energy, through a faster heartbeat and more labored breathing, in order to maintain a healthy temperature.LiNeBrEaKNo other factor, including disease, parasites, starvation, deer density, hunting, or being preyed upon by wolves, correlates as reliably to the moose decline as does the rising temperature, Lenarz told the group.LiNeBrEaK"Because they are weakened, it predisposes them to other measures of mortality," he said, adding that because they must spend more time seeking shade and cooling off, "it takes away from the time they can actually feed."LiNeBrEaKWhile such a correlation has been observed, he added, "we don't have a cause and effect...we need to identify the specific mechanism" by which moose die of heat stress. Therefore, more research is needed, he said.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Going nuts  	Sharon Hong, Times Union, Albany, N.Y.  	LIFESTYLE  	582 words  	Dec. 8--This fall has been a season of high anxiety for squirrels.LiNeBrEaKWith a squirrel population boom this year, the furry creatures started to harvest acorns prematurely, state Wildlife Pathologist Ward Stone said. By September, most of their dietary staple was eaten.LiNeBrEaK"I can see a lot of squirrels all over the place hopping around and acting very nervous," Stone said. "They're on the move this time of year, but this is more than one usually sees." LiNeBrEaKStone noticed the absence of acorns in August, while he was on a walk. On subsequent trips to look specifically for the seeds produced by oak trees in Columbia County, "we couldn't even find caps from the tops of the acorns," Stone said. In addition, he has received letters and e-mails from listeners of his weekly radio show on WAMC, "In Our Backyard," expressing concerns about squirrels behaving erratically and sharing observations of fewer acorns.LiNeBrEaKPeople in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania also have noticed a dearth of acorns, the Washington Post reported. Although Stone said there are areas like the Catskills where acorn production appears normal, the decrease elsewhere is limiting the food supply for other creatures too, including chipmunks, turkeys, deer and birds.LiNeBrEaKGerald Andritz, a forester with the state Department of Environmental Conservation, linked the shortage to environmental factors during pollination and flowering.LiNeBrEaK"Wet weather, freezing or dry weather can all affect the success in white oaks of producing acorns," he said. Pollen dissemination lasts for only three days. During flowering, the oak also depends on the right combination of warm and cool weather.LiNeBrEaKSome years, trees produce bumper crops, called mast years. Other times, oaks bear no seeds at all.LiNeBrEaK"This is a perfectly normal occurrence," Andritz said.LiNeBrEaKAt the Landis Arboretum in Esperance, Director of Horticulture Fred Breglia had another theory -- an influx of forest tent caterpillars that feast on oak and maple leaves.LiNeBrEaK"The past three years there was constant defoliation by the caterpillars," Breglia said, "This stressed out the trees, so there could be a correlation." He said global warming may be a factor, though he agrees there is no present danger to the oaks.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, squirrels have been roaming about still in search of food, often with lethal consequences.LiNeBrEaK"I see increases of the number of squirrels getting hit on the roads" Stone said. He said a transporation department worker in Westchester told him he roadkill is claiming 25 to 50 squirrels a day, when normally he would only see one or two a day. "This year a lot of them are young squirrels," Stone said.LiNeBrEaKHungry and less-mature squirrels are also more vulnerable to predators. In November, Stone saw an increased number of fishers with squirrels in their stomachs. He said the squirrels will be weaker and easier to catch as winter progresses.LiNeBrEaKOn a brighter note, Stone said the scarcity of the nuts could curb the spread of Lyme disease. The population of mice and other rodents that eat acorns will go down, diminishing the number of hosts for disease-carrying ticks.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   Final Edition	Power-plant proposal criticized  	SUSAN HYLTON World Staff Writer  	News; Pg. A1  	546 words  	PANAMA A proposed coal-fired power plant near this LeFlore County town is firing up air-quality watchdogs on both sides of the state line. AES Shady Point seeks to build a new 600-megawatt plant in addition to its existing 320-megawatt facility about 10 miles northwest of Poteau. Opposition to coal-fired plants centers on mercury and other harmful emissions including carbon dioxide, which research shows contributes to global warming.  LiNeBrEaKCoal is considered the dirtiest-burning of the fossil fuels due to its chemical composition. "There really isn't such a thing as clean coal," said Charles Wesner, chairman of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club. "It's a national issue. We're facing it here on the ground now." Wesner said they are developing local opposition andconsidering legal action. Leah Arnold, spokeswoman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said that regulated emissions at U.S. coal-fired plants have been reduced by 70 percent since the 1970s. "Part of the problem is people think clean coal and think it has to be no emissions at all," she said. Total carbon capture and storage is the next step in clean coal technology. Arnold said that will require increased funding, research and development. Proponents of the coal industry point out that coal produces more than 50 percent of the country's energy needs, is plentiful domestically and is affordable. AES Shady Point spokesman Lundy Kiger said that every coal-fired power plant being built will be a little cleaner than the existing ones due to Best Available Control Technology, the national standard for pollution control. "I know it'll be the cleanest coal-fired plant in the state and the nation at the time it's constructed," Kiger said. AES Shady Point sells its electricity to OGandE and not directly to users. It is not a public utility. In October, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission dismissed a request from AES that would have required OGandE's customers to pay for additional pollution controls. Kiger said AES Shady Point filed for emission recovery when new mercury rules were put in place. "We decided to go ahead and pull that application until the rules become more clear. Everybody's in limbo. Nobody knows what the new standards will be," Kiger said. The environmental coalition opposing the new plant includes both Oklahoma and Arkansas chapters of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, as well as the Omni Center for Peace, Justice and Ecology in Fayetteville. Matthew Petty of Omni's Carbon Caps Task Force said more coal-powered plants are anticipated across the country before the expected adoption of the "cap and trade" system, which some believe would make coal-fired plants cost-prohibitive. Building now could be a way to "grandfather in" the pollution output, he said. Emissions trading or "cap and trade" would set individual pollution output limits. Those who exceed their limit can buy credits from others who pollute less. Petty contends that energy-efficiency improvements to buildings would create more jobs than coal-fired plants. "Most buildings could be about 40 percent more efficient with new windows and efficient heating and air-conditioning units and other efficiency improvements," he said.

To friends in the protest movement, Lucy was an eager 20-something who attended their events and sent encouraging e-mails to support their causes. Only one thing seemed strange. "At one demonstration, I remember her showing up with a laptop computer and typing away," said Mike Stark, who helped lead the march against the death penalty in Baltimore that day.  LiNeBrEaK"We all thought that was odd." Not really. Lucy was an undercover Maryland State Police trooper who between 2005 and 2007 infiltrated more than two dozen rallies and meetings of nonviolent groups. Maryland officials now concede that, based on information gathered by Lucy and others, state police wrongly listed at least 53 Americans as terrorists in a criminal intelligence database and shared some information about them with a half-dozen state and federal agencies, including the National Security Agency. Among those labeled as terrorists: two Catholic nuns, a former Democratic congressional candidate, a lifelong pacifist and a registered lobbyist. One suspect's file warned that she was "involved in puppet making and allows anarchists to utilize her property for meetings." "There wasn't a scintilla of illegal activity" going on, said David Rocah, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit and obtained the first surveillance files in July. State police have released other heavily redacted documents in recent weeks. The files show that investigators targeted groups that advocated against abortion, global warming, nuclear arms, military recruiting in high schools and bio-defense research, among other issues. "It was unconscionable conduct," said state Sen. Brian Frosh, a Democrat who is backing legislation to ban similar spying in Maryland unless the police superintendent can document a "reasonable, articulable suspicion" of criminal activity. The case is the latest to emerge since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks spurred a sharp increase in state and federal surveillance of Americans. In the largest known effort, the Pentagon monitored at least 186 lawful protests and meetings including church services and silent vigils in the U.S. The Maryland operation has ended, but critics still question why police spent hundreds of hours spying on Quakers and other peace groups in a state that reported more than 36,000 violent crimes last year. Stephen Sachs, a former Maryland attorney general, investigated the scandal for Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat. He concluded that state police had violated federal regulations and "significantly overreached." According to Sachs' report and other documents, state police launched the operation in March 2005 out of concern that the planned execution of a murderer might lead to violent protests. They sent Lucy to join local activists at Takoma Park's Electrik Maid, a funky community center popular with punk rockers and slam poets. Ten people attended the gathering, including a local representative from Amnesty International. Using the aliases Lucy Shoup and Lucy McDonald, she befriended activists. "I want to get involved in different causes," she wrote in an e-mail, citing her interest in "anti-death penalty, anti-war and pro-animal actions!!!" Greg Shipley, a state police spokesman, said that no one in the department had been disciplined in connection with the program. Lucy, who has not been publicly identified, would not consent to an interview, he said. Shipley called the surveillance inappropriate. And the listing of lawful activity as terrorism "shouldn't have happened and has been corrected," he said. Most of the files list terrorism as a "primary crime" and a "secondary crime," then add subgroups for designations such as anti-war protester or anarchist. Josh Tulkin, 27, a registered lobbyist with the Virginia state legislature, is cited under "terrorism environmental extremists." He was the deputy director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network, an environmental group that claims 15,000 members and regularly meets with governors and members of Congress. "If asking your elected officials a question about public policy is a crime, then I'm guilty," he said.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 8, 2008 Monday   Final Edition	Native peoples warn of climate changes  	ARTHUR MAX Associated Press  	News; Pg. D5  	416 words  	POZNAN, Poland Chief Bill Erasmus of the Dene nation in northern Canada brought a stark warning about the climate crisis: The once-abundant herds of caribou are dwindling, rivers are running lower and the ice is too thin on which to hunt. Erasmus raised his concerns in recent days on the sidelines of a U.N. climate conference, seeking to ensure that North America's indigenous peoples are not left out in the cold when it comes to any global warming negotiations. Erasmus, the 54-year-old elected leader of 30,000 native Americans in Canada, and representatives of other indigenous peoples met with the U.N.'s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, and have lobbied national delegations to recognize them as an "expert group" that can participate in the talks like other nongovernment organizations.  LiNeBrEaK"We bring our traditional knowledge to the table that other people don't have," he said. Nearly 11,000 national and environmental delegates from 190 countries are negotiating a treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which regulates emissions of carbon dioxide that scientists blame for global warming. The protocol expires in 2012. The alliance of native peoples include groups from the forests of Borneo to the depths of the Amazon. De Boer said he advised the alliance to draw up a proposal and muster support among the national delegations to have their group approved by the countries involved in the talks. Erasmus, from Yellowknife in Canada's Northwest Territories, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) south of the Arctic Circle, brings firsthand experience of climate change. The caribou, or reindeer, herds are declining across North America and northern Europe, he said. "We can't hunt because the ice is not frozen yet. Our hunters are falling through the ice, and lives are being lost," Erasmus told The Associated Press. He is concerned that warmer winters will mean less luxurious fur on the muskrat and beaver that his people sell. Nearly 40 years ago, he said, tribal elders noticed changes in the annual migrations of animals. The weather, which they could forecast three weeks in advance from animal behavior and the appearance of the sunsets, is now unpredictable. Scientists have warned that conditions in the Arctic are a barometer of climate change. The region is warming faster than more temperate zones, and the seas are ice-free for longer periods. The melting of the permafrost threatens to release stored methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, U.N. scientists have reported.

TODAY, SHE SAID, TH  	News; Pg. D5  	152 words  	Jagger is attending a two-week U.N. climate conference in Poznan, lobbying to save the world's rain forests and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for weather that already devastates the lives of some of the world's poor. Jagger, 58, the chairwoman of an environmental group called World Future Council, said Sunday that she hoped the talks among 190 countries seeking a new climate change treaty "will not be an exercise in futility." The former model and ex-wife of the Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger is using her celebrity to raise awareness of what she says is the need to stop climate change around the globe. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the cutting and burning of forests is responsible for 20 percent of carbon dioxide emissions caused by man.

Tulsa World (Oklahoma)  	December 8, 2008 Monday 	Power-plant proposal criticized  	Susan Hylton, Tulsa World, Okla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	612 words  	Dec. 8--PANAMA -- A proposed coal-fired power plant near this LeFlore County town is firing up air-quality watchdogs on both sides of the state line.LiNeBrEaKAES Shady Point seeks to build a new 600-megawatt plant in addition to its existing 320-megawatt facility about 10 miles northwest of Poteau.LiNeBrEaKOpposition to coal-fired plants centers on mercury and other harmful emissions including carbon dioxide, which research shows contributes to global warming. Coal is considered the dirtiest-burning of the fossil fuels due to its chemical composition. LiNeBrEaK"There really isn't such a thing as clean coal," said Charles Wesner, chairman of the Oklahoma chapter of the Sierra Club. "It's a national issue. We're facing it here on the ground now."LiNeBrEaKWesner said they are developing local opposition and considering legal action.LiNeBrEaKLeah Arnold, spokeswoman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said that regulated emissions at U.S. coal-fired plants have been reduced by 70 percent since the 1970s.LiNeBrEaK"Part of the problem is people think clean coal and think it has to be no emissions at all," she said.LiNeBrEaKTotal carbon capture and storage is the next step in clean coal technology. Arnold said that will require increased funding, research and development.LiNeBrEaKProponents of the coal industry point out that coal produces more than 50 percent of the country's energy needs, is plentiful domestically and is affordable.LiNeBrEaKAES Shady Point spokesman Lundy Kiger said that every coal-fired power plant being built will be a little cleaner than the existing ones due to Best Available Control Technology, the national standard for pollution control.LiNeBrEaK"I know it'll be the cleanest coal-fired plant in the state and the nation at the time it's constructed," Kiger said.LiNeBrEaKAES Shady Point sells its electricity to OGandE and not directly to users. It is not a public utility.LiNeBrEaKIn October, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission dismissed a request from AES that would have required OGandE's customers to pay for additional pollution controls.LiNeBrEaKKiger said AES Shady Point filed for emission recovery when new mercury rules were put in place.LiNeBrEaK"We decided to go ahead and pull that application until the rules become more clear. Everybody's in limbo. Nobody knows what the new standards will be," Kiger said.LiNeBrEaKThe environmental coalition opposing the new plant includes both Oklahoma and Arkansas chapters of the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, as well as the Omni Center for Peace, Justice and Ecology in Fayetteville.LiNeBrEaKMatthew Petty of Omni's Carbon Caps Task Force said more coal-powered plants are anticipated across the country before the expected adoption of the "cap and trade" system, which some believe would make coal-fired plants cost-prohibitive. Building now could be a way to "grandfather in" the pollution output, he said.LiNeBrEaKEmissions trading or "cap and trade" would set individual pollution output limits. Those who exceed their limit can buy credits from others who pollute less.LiNeBrEaKPetty contends that energy-efficiency improvements to buildings would create more jobs than coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaK"Most buildings could be about 40 percent more efficient with new windows and efficient heating and air-conditioning units and other efficiency improvements," he said.LiNeBrEaKSusan Hylton 581-8381 susan.hylton@tulsaworld.com	COAL FIRED PLANTS (93%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (92%); CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGY (92%); POWER PLANTS (91%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT (76%); ENERGY DEMAND (73%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (72%); RESEARCH (71%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (58%)  	AES CORP (92%)  	SIERRA CLUB (56%)  	AES (NYSE) (92%) AES  	NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (92%); SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES (92%) Utilities  	OKLAHOMA, USA (94%); ARKANSAS, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 8, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Tulsa World   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (56%)  	20081208-TU-POWER-PLANT-20081208  	TU  												
The Washington Post 	December 8, 2008 Monday   Regional Edition	Start Making Sense;  America must end its denial about gas taxes. 		EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A18  	538 words  	THERE IS a certain unreal quality to current debate over the state of the U.S. economy, national security and the environment. As Detroit's Big Three automakers approach bankruptcy, dangerous oil-exporting states threaten international stability and climate change continues unchecked, Congress and the incoming Obama administration ponder costly and complex proposals to address these related crises. Under consideration are tens of billions of dollars in loans to the car companies; sanctions and diplomacy targeted at Iran, Russia and others; and a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. Each of these may have its place. What's striking, though, is that the only idea that seems to be off the table is the one that would address all three concerns directly and efficiently: higher gas taxes. This step would stimulate the market for new fuel-efficient cars; defund mischief-making petro-states; and cut carbon emissions. Not only that, it would reduce traffic, curb urban sprawl and, by giving drivers an incentive to drive more slowly, improve highway safety. LiNeBrEaKAmerica's state of denial about fuel taxes is not new. But the time has come for it to end. The recent plunge in oil prices has created a golden opportunity. The price of a gallon of regular gasoline, which peaked at over $4 last summer, is now about  $1. 75. This means that today's drivers are enjoying the equivalent of 1980 prices, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, the average per-gallon tax on gasoline is about 40 cents, including state levies. The federal portion of that has held steady at 18. 4 cents since 1993; thus, in real terms, consumers have gotten a significant gas tax cut over the past 15 years. This tax should have been indexed to inflation long ago.LiNeBrEaKEurope's motorists pay far higher gas taxes than American drivers do, a principal reason that its manufacturers (like Japan's) are practiced experts at profitably building fuel-efficient vehicles -- and that the average fuel efficiency of new cars on European roads in 2006 was 38 miles per gallon. In contrast, newly enacted CAFE fuel-efficiency rules would require U.S. cars to get 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2004 that raising the gas tax by 46 cents per gallon would cut fuel consumption more quickly and cheaply than CAFE.LiNeBrEaKCongress should enact a steep, inflation-indexed hike in gas taxes, one big enough to alter consumer incentives and habits permanently. This would take back some of the de facto economic stimulus consumers have received from the recent drop in gas prices, and it would be a hard sell politically. But surely voters can understand that, even if Congress were to triple the tax to 55. 2 cents, gas would still be cheaper, in real terms, than it was in 2005. The increase could be rebated through the income tax system.LiNeBrEaKWhenever anyone mentions the gas tax, politicians are quick to warn their constituents about the costs; rarely do they mention the benefits. A higher gas tax would buy valuable public goods: national security; a cleaner environment; and safer, less congested streets. No matter what, Americans will have to pay for all of that.

The Washington Post 	December 8, 2008 Monday   Regional Edition	Transition's Timing Hits Climate Talks;  U.S. Delegates Report to Bush, Not Obama 	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	A-SECTION; Pg. A02  	1401 words  	Barack Obama's pledge to make the United States a leader in confronting global warming raised hopes that his election would rapidly end the long impasse in international negotiations over climate change, but the timing of the presidential transition has severely dimmed those expectations as the current round of talks comes to a head this week in Poland.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. delegates still report to President Bush, and they made it clear last week that they will not commit to specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would bind the incoming administration. Obama, meanwhile, has hewed to his one-president-at-a-time policy and declined to send his representatives to the Poznan meeting, as many had expected.LiNeBrEaKThe result, a number of negotiators say, is that the world will have a hard time meeting the long-standing 2009 target for reaching a binding agreement on carbon emissions reductions to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. LiNeBrEaKThe delicate state of the global climate talks -- weighted down by the worldwide financial crisis -- highlights the challenges the negotiators face. The Bush administration and its allies successfully resisted setting specific climate goals during the past few negotiating rounds, and there are doubts that Obama can get Congress to approve a sufficiently ambitious national carbon cap by the time delegates meet again next December in Copenhagen. And without a U.S. commitment in place, other nations will be reluctant to sign a deal.LiNeBrEaK"A full, final, ratifiable agreement just isn't in the cards" next year, said Elliot Diringer, director of international strategies for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. "It's really important to have realistic expectations going into Copenhagen, and then there's a chance of success."LiNeBrEaKStill, international officials hoping for action on climate change have been encouraged by Obama's election, especially in light of his videotaped message last month to a bipartisan group of governors that "once I take office, you can be sure that the United States will once again engage vigorously in these negotiations and help lead the world toward a new era of global cooperation on climate change." The top U.N. negotiator said Friday that he remains confident that the United States could sign on to a global pact next year even without congressional action.LiNeBrEaKBut in Europe, the question remains, "What is the U.S. administration going to do, and how are they going to act?" said Frederic Hauge, who heads the Norwegian environmental group Bellona and holds a key post on a European Commission panel pursuing zero-emissions power generation.LiNeBrEaKThe answer to the question, however, is complicated.LiNeBrEaKBush's delegation is headed by Paula J. Dobriansky, undersecretary of state for democracy and global affairs, and James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.LiNeBrEaK"Our agenda is to assure two outcomes," Connaughton said in a telephone interview last week before leaving for Poland. "One is a practical and comprehensive negotiating agenda and, as important, the establishment of an agenda of cooperative action, with the view of giving the next administration maximum flexibility."LiNeBrEaKThe delegation's chief negotiator, Harlan L. Watson, told reporters last Monday that there are few differences between Bush and Obama in their approach to the talks, saying that Obama "has been relatively silent on the international aspects, with the logic being that the United States has to reach consensus domestically before we can bring that forward internationally."LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest obstacles facing negotiators has been the gulf between the United States and the European Union on the extent to which industrialized countries must reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to avert dangerous warming, and Obama's arrival goes only partway toward closing that divide. The European Union backs a goal of cutting emissions by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020; Obama has called for the United States simply to get back to 1990 levels; and Bush promised only to halt the rise of emissions by 2020, which could leave the United States nearly 30 percent above 1990 levels.LiNeBrEaKDuring Bush's two terms, U.S. emissions have risen 4. 7 percent and stand 16. 7 percent above the benchmark 1990 levels, according to a new report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). To meet the E.U. climate goal, the United States would have to cut emissions by more than 45 percent over the next dozen years, data from EIA and the International Energy Agency show.LiNeBrEaKThe European Union has not contained its emissions growth either: The 15 E.U. states that have committed to cut greenhouse gases 8 percent by 2012 compared with 1990 increased their total emissions 0. 8 percent from 2000 to 2006, according to U.N. data.LiNeBrEaKPolish Minister of Environment Maciej Nowicki, who is presiding over the Poznan talks, wrote in an e-mail, "Without the participation of the United States, we cannot speak about the common responsibility -- especially as seen from the perspective of the developing countries."LiNeBrEaKHanne Inger Bjurstrom, Norway's chief negotiator, said Obama's promise of a return to 1990 levels over the next 12 years "is not sufficient." Obama's speech to the governors, he said, was "good information, but also what the world needs to see is a clear commitment from the U.S. I know it's difficult. I know you need to do things nationally first, and that's difficult."LiNeBrEaKDemocrats will enjoy bigger majorities in Congress next year, which will make it easier for Obama to push through a domestic carbon cap, and he has indicated that he will be briefed on the Poznan outcome by the congressional delegation, which includes Democratic Sens. John F. Kerry (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.).LiNeBrEaKRep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who heads a select House committee on climate change, said he is confident the new president will be able to sign a bill by 2010, if not earlier.LiNeBrEaK"The math has changed dramatically since the last time people calculated the chances of success" in Congress, Markey said.LiNeBrEaKKlobuchar said in an interview that she and Kerry will tell foreign leaders that "something can and will happen out of this Congress with this new president" and that key congressional players on climate change are prepared to engage in horse trading to get a bill passed.LiNeBrEaK"The administration's enormous commitment to put resources into technology, that's going to be key to get people on board," she said, noting that wind energy has spurred economic development in her state.LiNeBrEaKEven as industrialized countries seek to ease the transition to a low-carbon society by investing in green technology, developing countries at the Poznan talks will demand aid to make the switch themselves. China, India and Brazil -- which are not bound to specific climate targets under the Kyoto Protocol -- say they will commit to binding actions only when richer countries identify their future emissions cuts and what money they will give developing nations to acquire new energy technology and adapt to global warming.LiNeBrEaKYvo de Boer, executive secretary for the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which hosts the talks, said in an interview that when it comes to putting together "the financial and institutional infrastructure" to put developing nations on a greener path, "we're still a ways from making that happen. At the moment people are just telling developing countries what to do without outlining what will help make that happen."LiNeBrEaKTimothy Wirth, president of the U.N. Foundation, said it's "probably asking too much" to expect a binding agreement by the end of 2009, but delegates may leave Copenhagen with the "building blocks" in place for a pact, along with "an overall agreement in principle" on how to address climate change. "That's all doable," he said.LiNeBrEaKAnd, de Boer emphasized, "The U.S. can be part of an agreement in Copenhagen without having domestic legislation written yet."LiNeBrEaKNorway's Bjurstrom, who does not have "big expectations" for Poznan, said she hopes the talks will at least keep up the political pressure for a deal in Copenhagen.LiNeBrEaK"I realize maybe Copenhagen is a bit early for the U.S.," she said, adding that if a final agreement was postponed until 2010, "the most important thing" would be to ensure that there was no gap between the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 and the next agreement taking effect. "That should suffice, in a sense."

We're to blame as much as the bloated chairman of the Outback Bowl who gets paid more than $350,000 a year. We're to blame because we sit back and take it instead of backing up our whines with the one power we have -- to not care.LiNeBrEaKI understand that once again I'm tilting at windmills. It is impossible to get the American public to unite on anything from global warming to whether or not the incoming president is a clandestine Muslim. So massive staged boycotts are generally doomed to fail before they start.LiNeBrEaKThat said, here's three steps that if enough of us take can at least send a message that we don't like being ignored. Con-sidering the current economic malaise, this will be good on the family budget as well as for the common college football good:LiNeBrEaK1. Don't attend any bowl games. Go ahead and buy one ticket in order to help your favorite team fulfill its bowl allotment so that your school won't be punished down the road when a sensible system gets installed. But don't go and don't use it. Let the TV cameras try to avoid showing the empty seats. Spend your money on something for the holidays that will help stimulate the economy where you live.LiNeBrEaK2. Don't contribute to the TV ratings. Of course you can watch your own team play, but go to a local bar with like-minded friends and watch there to dilute the ratings. And set your home television DVR to record all shows opposite the bowl games on competing networks -- especially the BCS bowls and title game.LiNeBrEaK3. Send thank you notes supporting a future playoff. Draft a short, polite note signed by every member of your family with a simple statement of displeasure and send it to BCS commissioner John Swofford, the president of ABC/ESPN, the commissioner of your favorite conference and the president of your favorite school. Here's some simple text to get started.LiNeBrEaKDear so-and-so. I love college football and support my school's program. But I will not support the current bowl system in person or on television until a sensible limited playoff system is put in place. Thanks for your consideration.LiNeBrEaKReally, it's not that hard. Do you really want to watch the Metro Conference reunion of Cincinnati and Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl that badly? That four hours could be spent much more productively playing with your children or sleeping. Multiply those four hours by the 34 bowl games and you just saved 17 work days from your life.LiNeBrEaKYou're welcome.LiNeBrEaKThe only way change is going to happen if we hit them were it hurts -- in the wallets. Let's give the sponsors a reason to trim their budgets in the future by questioning whether they are getting anything in return for their BCS investment.LiNeBrEaKClearly the geniuses at College Football Inc. don't respond to embarrassment when year after year a new fiasco prompts them to soldier on with their stupid BCS system. Last year was a disaster with more two-loss teams in the BCS games than one-loss teams, but they shot down a band-aid plus-one proposal nonetheless and signed a new deal with ESPN through 2014.LiNeBrEaKThis year the mess grows as a playoff case can be made for a handful of major-conference teams plus two undefeated smaller programs (Utah and Boise State), one of which will likely get dismissed out of hand so that the power conferences can make sure another BCS season doesn't go by without Ohio State in the mix.LiNeBrEaKAnd just imagine if Southeastern Conference champion Florida inexplicably gets stiffed by computer bias so we can have a rematch of Oklahoma-Texas.LiNeBrEaKSo don't let another BC-mess roll by in front of your eyes.LiNeBrEaKAs the great Otter suggested in standing up to the Faber College establishment in Animal House , "I think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part."LiNeBrEaKAnd we're just the guys to do it.LiNeBrEaKReach Scott Michaux at (706) 823-3219 or scott.michaux@augustachronicle.com	COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY SPORTS (90%); SPORTS (89%); AMERICAN FOOTBALL (89%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (78%); SPORTS and RECREATION (76%); FAMILY (69%); BOYCOTTS (60%); GLOBAL WARMING (50%)  			NYSE:DIS  	Telecommunications  	GEORGIA, USA (74%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 7, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Augusta Chronicle   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (65%)  	20081207-AG-The-Augusta-Chronicle-Ga-Scott-Michaux-column-1207  	AG  												
The Boston Globe 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   THIRD EDITION	Coalition seeking `green new deal'  	Eric Moskowitz GLOBE STAFF  	METRO; Pg. B4  	778 words  	Envisioning a "green new deal" to fortify the economy while preserving the planet, a group of community, environmental, and labor leaders gathered in Roxbury yesterday to add their voices to a national movement seeking billions of dollars in federal clean-energy investment.LiNeBrEaKThe Boston Green Justice Coalition, as the new organization is calling itself, and Community Labor United joined the national Apollo Alliance in calling for $50 billion a year over the next 10 years to build the green economy. The coalition issued a 60-page report detailing how that investment could be used here to create good-paying "green collar" jobs and address energy needs for lower-income communities - in addition to erecting wind turbines on the Cape or solar panels in the suburbs. LiNeBrEaKMore than 200 people filled the pews at Twelfth Baptist Church on Warren Street for the coalition's announcement rally, as labor and environmental leaders, community organizers, and officials highlighted the need to target investment to narrow wealth and social justice gaps while addressing fossil fuel dependence, climate change, and other environmental issues.LiNeBrEaK"The Green Justice Coalition is all about making sure that huge tsunami of change - what we're calling a green wave - lifts all boats," said Loie Hayes, coordinator for the Boston Climate Action Network; the network is on the steering committee of the coalition, which includes more than two dozen local agencies and organizations.LiNeBrEaKThe coalition rally was combined with a four-hour energy fair for area residents to learn immediate ways to save money and make their homes more efficient.LiNeBrEaKAt the fair, Robert Wilson, 33, of Dorchester, collected low-cost tips to help his aunt seal her windows and improve the efficiency of her radiators.LiNeBrEaKWilson, who is enrolled in a green-collar job-training program through JFYNetWorks, also attended the coalition kickoff. He said he appreciated the short- and long-term focus of the two events in making sure that Boston is not left behind in the greening of the economy.LiNeBrEaK"It's good to see it's not just in Chestnut Hill, Braintree, or Brighton," Wilson said. "It's about everybody."LiNeBrEaKYesterday's meeting served as an official kickoff for the coalition, which has come together over the past year, as well as a chance for it to align with the Apollo Alliance, a growing national organization of business, labor, environmental, and community leaders calling for clean energy investment in a manner that echoes the 1960s Apollo space program.LiNeBrEaK"When we first announced this, we thought that [a total of $500 billion] sounds like a lot of money," Ron Ruggiero, national field director for the California-based Apollo Alliance, said referring to Wall Street bailouts.LiNeBrEaK"We've since seen that there's clearly not a question in our country about the amount of money; there's a question about priorities."LiNeBrEaKAmong other figures, the Boston Green Justice Coalition's "Green Justice Solution" report cited a study by the Center for American Progress and the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst estimating that $100 billion in federal investment would create 2 million jobs nationally in clean energy and energy efficiency, four times as many as if the money were spent on the oil industry.LiNeBrEaKJim Hunt, Thomas M. Menino's chief of environmental and energy services, addressed the gathering to signal the mayor's support for "green justice."LiNeBrEaKIn addition to calling for reducing the city's carbon emissions and boosting its solar capacity, Menino plans to plant 100,000 trees and has started investing in training programs for "green collar" jobs.LiNeBrEaKHe is also looking to President-elect Barack Obama and Congress for help, Hunt said.LiNeBrEaK"There's great hope that our new president will be making the changes necessary to dig us out of this hole we have been digging ourselves in in the US, both from an environmental standpoint and an economic standpoint," Hunt said.LiNeBrEaKHunt said Menino wanted to attend but was unable.LiNeBrEaKOther local officials were present, including state Senator-elect Sonia Chang-Diaz and City Councilors John Connolly, Chuck Turner, and Charles Yancey.LiNeBrEaKThe kickoff was followed at the church by an energy fair, put together by the Boston Climate Action Network and ACORN.LiNeBrEaKMoving among tables staffed by members of nonprofits, utilities, community groups, and vendors, Mary Washington, a 68-year-old Roxbury retiree, asked questions about drafty windows and collected a bag full of compact fluorescent bulbs, as well as coupons and literature to share.LiNeBrEaK"I'm a senior, and this is good, because I can come and get the information and give it back to my neighbors," said Washington.

The Boston Globe 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	Aiming to restore the natural order Officials keep pace with global warming  	Robert Knox Globe Correspondent  	SOUTH; Pg. Reg1  	1337 words  	GLOBE SOUTH 1LiNeBrEaKAt Burrage Pond, a 1,900-acre conservation site on the Hanson and Halifax border, state wildlife protection workers are raising and lowering old flumes to allow the waters of a onetime cranberry plantation to seek their own level.LiNeBrEaKBy restoring the natural water patterns, the bog is reverting to a state described as "shallow emergent marshes," by Jason Zimmer, regional manager with the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.LiNeBrEaKThe marshes provide a stopover for migrating water birds, attracting black ducks, pintails, herons, egrets, ibis, and geese. Fish hide in the grass. Wild rice, a long-suppressed native species, is returning. "The overall goal is a mosaic of different habitats," Zimmer said.LiNeBrEaKThe restoration of a large, functionally intact wetlands is not only good for plants and wildlife, it's part of an emerging strategy by conservationists to help the natural environment adapt to the anticipated stresses of global warming. LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental managers say they have started to realize it's their job to plan for climate change and ecological disruptions in coastal zones, wetlands, rivers, and forests. These include higher temperatures, more rain, and species migrations.LiNeBrEaKConservation land must be managed to deal with the effects of global warming and help the environment adapt to the changes. One way to do that is to preserve and expand wetlands such as the state-owned Burrage Pond Conservation Area. Specialists say the restoration of a significant wetlands area will help prevent floods, provide a refuge for plant and animal communities fleeing the loss of coastal wetlands, and offer a home to species from warmer climates.LiNeBrEaK"The Burrage Pond restoration project relates to a climate change expected to bring 20 percent more rain to New England," said Mary Griffin, commissioner of the state Department of Fish and Game, which oversees the Burrage Pond property. "At a time when the state may be losing coastal salt marsh wetland, it makes sense to restore inland wetland habitat that can effectively absorb rainfall." LiNeBrEaKThe Burrage Pond conservation area consists of a 1,638-acre former white cedar swamp located in Hanson and Halifax acquired six years ago from a company ready to get out of the cranberry growing business, plus an additional 270 acres acquired since. It includes 200 acres of fishable waters, extensive uplands, cedar swamps, and roads and dikes providing pedestrian access, Griffin said.LiNeBrEaKState workers have been raising the steel and aluminum flumes left by the cranberry growers to restore natural water flows and encourage native species to return to the bogs.LiNeBrEaKSome old flumes need to be repaired or replaced, and many of the sand and gravel earthen dikes will be removed. The growers' control system, including large open water reservoirs, was specific to the needs of the cranberry plant - keeping water levels low while vines were growing and high during the winter to protect them from freezing.LiNeBrEaKWorkers are substituting a natural hydrology pattern to encourage biodiversity in a wetlands habitat, using the bogs as a starting point. "We have flooded them in spring and fall," Zimmer said, turning bogs into marshes where water depth ranges from 6 to 24 inches depending on rainfall patterns.LiNeBrEaK"We have the superstructure to manage the water and make the restoration easier," Zimmer said. "We use the bogs themselves as units to create different types of wetlands to provide biodiversity."LiNeBrEaKAbout 300 acres of cranberry bog have returned to various stages of native wetlands. White cedar, a durable wood once used for fence posts and building foundations, is returning to one of the bogs. Workers are lowering water levels in some places to encourage the return of the cedar trees, turned into stumps when their habitat became a cranberry grower's reservoir. The conservation area also includes some 600 acres of red maple and white cedar swamp near the reservoirs, fed by Stump Brook and the growers' water system.LiNeBrEaKOther specialists agree that wetlands are a great sponge for flood waters. Alison Bowden of the Nature Conservancy, which has been studying how to manage its own conservation properties to deal with global warming, compares Burrage Pond to another regional wetland, the 6,000-acre Hockomock Swamp in Easton and West Bridgewater.LiNeBrEaK"Hockomock swamp has a tremendous capacity to absorb water," Bowden said. A restored Burrage Pond wetlands will do the same.LiNeBrEaKBoth Griffin and Bowden attended last month's conference on adapting ecosystems to climate change sponsored by the Plymouth-based Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences and led by climate guru Hector Galbraith.LiNeBrEaKGalbraith, the Manomet Center's Climate Change Initiative director, pointed to flood damage in regions such as the Gulf Coast, which have lost coastal wetlands. Massachusetts coastlines are at risk from the predicted 1- to 2-meter global rise in sea level, Galbraith said. "It will not be just gradual sea level rise," he said. "What will that rise do to storms?" Dune systems will be affected, and some tidal lands will become "marine lands."LiNeBrEaKThe climate-change pressure on coastal areas will push saltwater and brackish ecosystems inland, regional specialists say, and cause migrating birds to seek new homes. Inland wetlands such as Burrage Pond will not only absorb increased rain but offer a large habitat to plant and animal species being squeezed out by rising temperatures and higher sea levels. Burrage Pond will become a good fallback position for these species, Zimmer said, when wetlands nearer the ocean become more brackish.LiNeBrEaKThe Burrage Pond marshes are home to water-dependent birds, amphibians, and reptiles, including rare spotted turtles and Blanding's turtles. As a "warm water" fishery, it's a refuge for young fish that avoid more open waters.LiNeBrEaKPreserving large intact habitats such as Burrage Pond to reduce environmental stress in a time of climate change should a "no-brainer," said Wayne Petersen of the Massachusetts Audubon Society.LiNeBrEaKMigrating water birds have already discovered Burrage Pond, said Petersen, who lives in Hanson. The wetlands are also providing homes for Southern birds, such as red-bellied woodpeckers and turkey vultures, that are making their way into the region and, paradoxically, for a few cold-loving birds such as the northern water thrush, which nests in the swamp's low "cool pockets," he said.LiNeBrEaKWhile wetlands restoration can't prevent changes brought on by global warming, it can help manage the impact. An ecosystem is not a museum, it's a stage, say environmentalists, and the emphasis on helping ecosystems function naturally, Bowden said, is "preserving the stage for the actors."LiNeBrEaKSIDEBAR:LiNeBrEaKWinds of changeLiNeBrEaKPredicted climate changes from global warming that will affect our region:LiNeBrEaK1 to 2 meter rise in sea levelLiNeBrEaK20 percent more rainLiNeBrEaK4 to 8 degree increase in mean annual temperature by midcentury. Boston's average temperature, currently 51, will rise to 55-59, resembling North Carolina's. LiNeBrEaKBlack-capped chickadee, the state bird, will migrate to a colder climate. Carolina chickadee will migrate here.LiNeBrEaKBoreal trees such as balsam and red spruce go north; Southern trees such as gum trees, magnolia, and hickory come here.LiNeBrEaKSome changes from global warming already here:LiNeBrEaKTree swallows breed two weeks earlier in New England.LiNeBrEaKTurkey vultures and black vultures have migrated here from Southern regions.LiNeBrEaKMilder winters have led to an increase of wild mammals such as deer. More deer also means more ticks and more Lyme disease.LiNeBrEaKInsect pest infestations such as the hemlock woolly adelgid, which is killing the region's hemlock trees, are no longer killed off by colder winters.LiNeBrEaKSOURCES: Mary Griffin, the commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game; Hector Galbraith, Climate Change Initiative director for the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences; Wayne Petersen, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's Important Bird Areas Program; The National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationLiNeBrEaKRobert Knox can be contacted at rc.knox@gmail.com	WETLANDS (91%); WILDLIFE (90%); BIRDS (90%); WILDLIFE CONSERVATION (90%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); LAND USE PLANNING (89%); LAND RECLAMATION (89%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); COASTAL AREAS (89%); BERRY FARMING (89%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ECOLOGY and ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE (78%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (78%); FISHERIES (78%); BUILDING RENOVATION (77%); WATER QUALITY (73%); FISHERIES ADMINISTRATION (73%)  					NORTHEAST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (79%)  	December 10, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Jason Zimmer of the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife strolls around a former cranberry bog where wildlife workers are raising and lowering old flumes (lower left) to restore natural water patterns.

The Boston Globe 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   FOURTH EDITION	Unleashing the wild  	ROBERT KNOX  	SOUTH; Pg. Reg3  	314 words  	GLOBE SOUTH 1LiNeBrEaKWareham's Red Brook, a 5-mile-long stream that flows into Buttermilk Bay, provides the clear, cold water needed by sea-run trout and other fish trying to reach inland spawning and feeding habitats. LiNeBrEaKHigher temperatures will warm many rivers and streams, making it essential that fish be able to take advantage of colder streams such as Red Brook. But the brook's flow is interrupted by dams and berms.LiNeBrEaKSo New Way Dam had to go.LiNeBrEaKThe state Department of Fish and Game's Riverways Program recently spearheaded the removal of the dam, one of several cooperative projects by state officials and environmental partners to help the southeastern region adapt to climate change.LiNeBrEaKTo preserve Myles Standish State Forest, located in Plymouth and Carver, two years ago the state made it part of the Forest Reserve - an area where no motorized recreation vehicles or timbering is permitted. Environmentally sensitive management of the forest reduces stress on plants and animals, enabling them to adapt better to climate change. Large old-growth forests also fight global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKThe state is working with the town of Plymouth and the Nature Conservancy to restore Town Brook, which runs into Plymouth Harbor, to make it possible for American eel to thrive and for alewife herring to reach their spawning areas. Improvements include keeping storm water out of the brook, rebuilding fish ladders, restoring wetlands, and removing 19th-century dams. As in Wareham's Red Brook project, the goal is to help fish survive climate change stress by guaranteeing them access to cold-water streams.LiNeBrEaKPlymouth's Eel River is also a cold-water stream. Here the approach is to help keep the waters cool and a community of plants and aquatic animals healthy by planting 17,000 Atlantic white cedar trees on town-owned property to shade the moving waters of the Eel River watershed.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	371 words  	Dec. 7--A string of events aimed at elevating government's role in discussions about, and responsibility for, climate change begins Monday in Charlottesville.LiNeBrEaKThe events are part of Local Climate Action Week, a nationwide effort to get the federal government to give money to localities to address climate change. LiNeBrEaKA panel discussion from 11: 30 a.m. to 1: 30 p.m. Monday kicks off the events. The free-luncheon panel, at City Space on the Downtown Mall, is open to the public and will focus on what can be done to address climate change at the local level.LiNeBrEaKMonday evening, City Space will host a workshop from 6 to 7: 15 to focus on how homeowners can conserve energy and save money.LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday, a two-day national conference on climate change begins at the University of Virginia.LiNeBrEaKHosted by the Miller Center of Public Affairs, the conference will focus on what policies local, state and federal governments can implement to combat climate change.LiNeBrEaKA national poll gauging the public's attitude on climate issues will be released during the conference. That poll is an expanded version of one released in October that surveyed Virginians' attitudes.LiNeBrEaKThe conference is the first of its kind and is expected to draw a national and international mixture of roughly 30 speakers from higher education and governmental agencies.LiNeBrEaKThe conference is not open to the public, but will be broadcast live on the Miller Center's Web site.LiNeBrEaKCity Space will round out the week with a screening from noon to 1: 30 p.m. Saturday of "Too Hot Not to Handle," an HBO documentary about climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe week of climate talks comes on the heels of last week's news that the Virginia Commission on Climate Change finalized a plan that includes calling for the state to cut global warming pollution by 25 percent in the next 12 years.

COMMENTARY  	312 words  	Dec. 7--Fining the Tennessee Valley Authority for polluting the atmosphere makes sense. Fining farmers because their livestock foul the air doesn't.LiNeBrEaKFines might induce TVA to clean up its emissions. But what are low-tech farmers to do? LiNeBrEaKYet, some are buying into the rumor that the federal Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to stampede their herds into a dead-end canyon and rustle some of their profits.LiNeBrEaKSurely, the rumor is just bull.LiNeBrEaKThen, who knows? Government has a way of doing the absurd. An EPA press spokesman, however, said the agency has not recommended regulating any emissions and has not committed to specific steps to address greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKThe American Farm Bureau says fees per head of livestock would come as permit costs, like industries pay, when they continue to emit noxious gases.LiNeBrEaKAmerican farmers can take other steps to help clean up the environment, such as not allowing livestock waste to reach streams and rivers, but they can't shortcut Mother Nature.LiNeBrEaKThe executive director of the Alabama Cattlemen's Association, Billy Powell, said rumors of permitting are "undue hysteria."LiNeBrEaKRick Krause of the American Farm Bureau warned that the alleged proposal would affect more than 90 percent of beef, dairy and hog farmers.LiNeBrEaKThe other 10 percent would be exempt because the size of their herds doesn't exceed 25 head of dairy cattle, 50 head of beef cattle or 200 hogs.LiNeBrEaKYou've got to wonder why it wouldn't affect the other 10 percent.

Kyodo News International (Tokyo, Japan)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Finance, climate chiefs to meet in Poland on global warming  	Kyodo News International, Tokyo  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	620 words  	Dec. 7--POZNAN -- Finance and environment ministers from around the world will gather in Poland this week to discuss measures to address climate change, with mounting concern that the financial crisis could derail efforts by governments and industry to fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKFinance ministers and officials from about 40 countries will hold a two-day meeting from Monday in Warsaw to study fiscal and non-budgetary instruments to help countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost energy efficiency, according to delegates. LiNeBrEaKTop officials from economies such as Japan, the United States, Brazil, India and the European Union are also expected to consider ways to develop carbon markets through increased fund flows, a move that would give the private sector bigger incentives to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.LiNeBrEaKThe officials will meet on the sidelines of two-week U.N. climate change talks in Poznan, which will culminate in a two-day environment ministers' meeting from Thursday in the western Polish city.LiNeBrEaKThe meeting of environment ministers and officials from about 190 countries will focus on ways to craft a successor treaty to the carbon-capping Kyoto Protocol by the planned deadline of December next year.LiNeBrEaK"Although we are in the midst of the financial crisis, I think it will be important to issue a powerful political message that we are determined to accelerate negotiations and to tackle global warming by acting together," Japanese Environment Minister Tetsuo Saito said Friday in Tokyo.LiNeBrEaKSaito told reporters that Japan wants all parties at the 14th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change to adopt a target of reducing emissions by half by 2050, as agreed by the Group of Eight leaders during their July summit in Toyako, Hokkaido.LiNeBrEaKSaito, who plans to attend the Poznan talks, said he will also call for the involvement of "all major emitting countries," such as the United States, China and India, in a new climate pact to make it effective in reining in global emissions.LiNeBrEaK"I believe developed countries need to show that they have an ambitious package to draw all major emitters into a new climate deal," he said. "The package would include technology transfers and financial assistance (to help developing countries curb emissions and adapt to climate change) and medium-term emissions reduction targets for developed nations" for 2020 or 2030.LiNeBrEaKJapan's call for all parties to share the mid-century target is likely to draw opposition from developing countries, which insist that rich countries should first commit to slashing emissions by 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, a range advocated by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.LiNeBrEaKJapan has pledged to reduce its emissions by 60-80 percent from current levels by 2050. But the government has stopped short of unveiling a reduction target for 2020 or 2030, saying it will announce one "at an appropriate time next year." Critics argue that the Kyoto accord, which will expire in 2012, is ineffective as it covers only 30 percent of the world's emissions and fails to include the United States and China -- the world's biggest emitters -- as well as other major emerging economies that will produce the bulk of the increase in emissions in the coming decades.

Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Going green: UK scientists explore algae as pollution reducer  	Jim Warren, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	614 words  	Dec. 7--Eliminating greenhouse gases and developing new, non-petroleum-based fuels are two of America's biggest environmental challenges. University of Kentucky researchers think algae might offer an answer.LiNeBrEaKThey propose to employ algae to scrub carbon dioxide from the flue-gases of coal-fire power plants -- of which Kentucky has many -- and use the algae to produce an oil that could then be refined into fuel.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide, or CO2, is the principal pollutant associated with global warming. But under UK's plan, algae would consume the power-plant CO2 as food, converting it into biomass from which algae oil could be removed and processed into biodiesel, jet fuel or similar products, researchers say. LiNeBrEaKAlgae-based facilities to trap the CO2 would probably be located adjacent to coal-fired power plants in order to quickly receive and process their emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The reason algae is so interesting is that it can directly convert CO2 into biomass very quickly, more efficiently than anything else we know of," says Rodney Andrews, director of UK's Center for Applied Energy Research.LiNeBrEaK"Then, you basically squeeze the oil out of the algae and refine it as you would other natural oils."LiNeBrEaKThe energy center is working on the project along with the UK College of Agriculture's Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering. The state of Kentucky has provided more than $500,000 for the effort.LiNeBrEaKUK scientists say they hope to have a test facility operating within three to four years. If the algae-based system works, it could benefit both the electrical power industry and Kentucky's coal industry.LiNeBrEaK"The appeal is that if you have a power plant where you burn coal, and you capture the CO2 and use that to produce fuel with algae, you effectively become twice as efficient in the amount of energy achieved per ton of CO2 emitted," Andrews said.LiNeBrEaKAs a first step in the research, Czarena Crofcheck, a biological engineer with the UK biosystems and agriculture engineering department, is searching for a strain of algae that would remove CO2 from power plant gases with the greatest efficiency.LiNeBrEaKIn her search, Crofcheck watches over bubbling tanks called photo-bioreactors that contain various strains of algae in shifting shades of green. The darker the green, the more efficiently the algae in the tank is growing.LiNeBrEaK"These are my babies," she quips. "We're primarily interested in strains that grow quickly and consume CO2 very quickly."LiNeBrEaKFinding the right strain could take a while. Crofcheck notes that there are at least 50,000 species of algae.LiNeBrEaKAnd, as in many alternative energy projects, there are some problems to be overcome.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Andrews, capturing the carbon dioxide emitted from a 500-megawatt power plant would require 5,000 to 6,000 acres of ponds containing algae. To get around that, UK hopes to contain the algae in vessels that would operate more efficiently at much smaller size.LiNeBrEaKExpense is another issue. As of now, it costs $18 to $30 a gallon to produce algae oil, which then has to be refined into fuel.LiNeBrEaKBut Andrews says producing fuel really is a secondary goal of the UK effort.LiNeBrEaK"The main idea is to get rid of the CO2 and then figure out what you do with the algae," he said.LiNeBrEaKReach Jim Warren at 1-800-950-6397 Ext. 3255 or 859-231-3255	SCIENCE NEWS (90%); BIOMASS (90%); POWER PLANTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); RESEARCH (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENGINEERING (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); SEAWEED and ALGAE (89%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ENERGY RESEARCH (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); BIOFUELS (78%); COAL INDUSTRY (77%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (76%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); JET FUEL (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (63%)  		UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (84%)  		General  	KENTUCKY, USA (95%) UNITED STATES (95%); UNITED KINGDOM (90%)  	December 7, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Lexington Herald-Leader   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (51%)  	20081207-LX-Going-green-UK-scientists-explore-algae-as-pollution-reducer-1207  	LX  												
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	Here's the poop on cow power &lt;|&gt; State is leader in making energy from manure  	THOMAS CONTENT, Staff, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  	D Business; Pg. 1  	1252 words  	When it comes to generating renewable energy, Wisconsin lacks the high winds of the Great Plains and the steady sunlight of Arizona, but it has one abundant resource few others can match - cow power.LiNeBrEaK Although renewable energy makes up only a fraction of the state's total energy mix, one area that's growing fast is systems that convert cow manure into electricity and heat.LiNeBrEaK At the Crave Brothers dairy farm and cheese factory in Waterloo, the farm's anaerobic digester - its cow power system - takes manure from the farm's 1,100 cows and converts it to electricity.LiNeBrEaK Rising demand for the company's specialty cheeses led to an expansion that will add a second digester and triple the amount of electricity the farm produces. LiNeBrEaK "They process their own milk, and the demand for the specialty cheeses they make has increased enough to justify an expansion," said Dan Nemke, general manager of Clear Horizons, which provides the digester.LiNeBrEaK Clear Horizons estimates it invested $4 million in the Waterloo system.LiNeBrEaK Wisconsin leads the country in anaerobic digesters with 19 projects. California is second, with 16.LiNeBrEaK "And we have 16 projects under contract right now set to go in, so we should be doubling the number of digesters in this state in the next year," said Don Wichert, director of renewable energy with the state Focus on Energy program.LiNeBrEaK Behind the surge in interest in homegrown energy is the recognition that what once was waste now has value. That can include anything from cheese whey to restaurant grease to cow manure.LiNeBrEaKAlternative energy pushLiNeBrEaK Renewable energy experts expect activity to intensify, given the drive to boost alternative energy sources by state and federal policy-makers.LiNeBrEaK Several recommendations to boost renewable energy from waste - known as biogas - were suggested by the state's global warming task force and may be included in a package of proposals Gov. Jim Doyle submits to the Legislature next year.LiNeBrEaK President-elect Barack Obama has voiced support for global warming legislation and has said boosting alternative energy will be one of the ingredients of his economic stimulus package that he would like to see Congress enact in early 2009.LiNeBrEaK "We've got lots of projects that would be ready to go if the economics in some way were improved," said Richard Pieper, president of Pieper Power, the Milwaukee parent company of Clear Horizons. If the U.S. enacted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the economics would improve and "we would have enough opportunity here to power 175,000 homes in Wisconsin," he said.LiNeBrEaK Clear Horizons is a unit of Pieper's mining equipment automation business and its wastewater technology business. The firm entered the renewable energy arena seeking ways to take its construction and automation know-how and adapt it to emerging energy technologies.LiNeBrEaK "At this point, it doesn't amount to anything. It's very modest. It's less than a percent, but we're a pretty good-sized company," Pieper said.LiNeBrEaK Cow power and other renewable energy projects could be a big piece of total sales in 12 to 24 months, he said.LiNeBrEaK But Wisconsin's leadership role in renewable energy is being challenged as other states deploy the digester systems, which help reduce waste runoff into streams and minimize odors.LiNeBrEaK At the moment, other states are more competitive than Wisconsin in attracting investment in the systems, either through special electricity rates, tax incentives or both. California, which supplanted Wisconsin as the biggest dairy state several years ago, could soon overtake the state in anaerobic digesters.LiNeBrEaK Renewable energy projects are more economical in other states, such as Vermont, where incentives such as the state's Cow Power program are more lucrative than what Wisconsin offers.LiNeBrEaK "We've got a bunch of opportunities in Wisconsin," Pieper said. "They're planned, but there's nothing going forward. The economics of the plants aren't where they need to be moving forward."LiNeBrEaKThe price of powerLiNeBrEaK GHD Inc., which opened its first digester system in 2001, now has more digesters installed in Wisconsin than any other company.LiNeBrEaK The Chilton firm has 30 systems operating in nearly a dozen states, with another 20 planned. In Wisconsin, 10 systems have been built with another five on tap.LiNeBrEaK "We came close to doubling our size this year," said Melissa VanOrnum, marketing manager at GHD.LiNeBrEaK Driving the increase: Utilities are paying more for electricity generated by the systems. Also, farmers are more confident in the anaerobic digester technology.LiNeBrEaK "When I started working for GHD in 2004, the first question that farmers asked was, 'Does it really work?' But for at least the last two years, they're not asking, 'Does it work?' They're asking, 'What's my payback?' " VanOrnum said.LiNeBrEaK Other companies also are seeing growth outside Wisconsin.LiNeBrEaK Microgy, which installed three systems in Wisconsin, is focusing on projects in Texas, Nebraska and California.LiNeBrEaK One of the challenges for Wisconsin is that the digesters make the most economic sense for large farms, Focus on Energy's Wichert said.LiNeBrEaK "The biggest farms that we had were the first ones that went in, and all these gigantic farms in California, Texas, Florida and New York are realizing they should be doing digestion, too."LiNeBrEaK The price of power also determines where a system will be installed, said Larry Krom, who manages biogas renewable-energy programs for Focus on Energy.LiNeBrEaK Power prices are steeper in states such as  California and Vermont. When prices are higher, the rate small generators can collect from selling power to utilities is higher.LiNeBrEaK Several utilities have boosted their renewable rates in recent years, and Madison's Wisconsin Power and Light Co. will have the highest rate in the state beginning in January.LiNeBrEaK The utility is proposing to boost its rate by 50% to 9. 24 cents per kilowatt in a case that's pending with state regulators.LiNeBrEaK Interest in new biogas projects is still active, Krom said.LiNeBrEaK "Over the next month or two, a whole bunch of them are going to come on," he said.LiNeBrEaK Although most of the projects in the state process cow manure, food businesses are getting into the act. In La Crosse, City Brewery and Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation set up a system using waste from the brewing process to create enough electricity to power 492 average Wisconsin homes, according to Focus on Energy.LiNeBrEaK As they watch to see whether more policies encouraging renewable energy will be implemented in Washington and Madison, those in the biogas industry see plenty of room for expansion in Wisconsin.LiNeBrEaK Wichert predicts a tenfold increase in the number of cow-power systems in the state, with digesters dotting the rural landscape.LiNeBrEaK "We still have a long way to go," Wichert said, noting Wisconsin has 250 farms with at least 500 cows each. "Those probably will all eventually have digesters," he said.LiNeBrEaKGASWORKSLiNeBrEaK An anaerobic digester is a system that converts energy stored in organic materials present in manure into biogas. The manure is stored in large concrete tanks. When heated, the manure is converted into a biogas that is composed of 55% to 70% methane. The methane is then used to power a turbine or engine to produce electricity. Excess heat is used to heat farm buildings, and solids left over from the conversion of manure into the gas are used by farmers as animal bedding or fertilizer or sold as potting soil.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   01 EDITION	Proposed fee on smelly animals angers farmers  	BOB JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer  	F; Pg. 05  	640 words  	Proposed fee on smelly animals angers farmersLiNeBrEaKEPA plan seeks to curb greenhouse gases emitted by cows, hogsLiNeBrEaKBy BOB JOHNSONLiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKMONTGOMERY - For farmers, this stinks: Belching and gaseous cows and hogs could start costing them money if a federal proposal to charge fees for air-polluting animals becomes law.LiNeBrEaKFarmers so far are turning their noses up at the notion, which is one of several put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases emitted by belching and flatulence amounts to air pollution. LiNeBrEaK"This is one of the most ridiculous things the federal government has tried to do," said Alabama Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks, an outspoken opponent of the proposal.LiNeBrEaKIt would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog.LiNeBrEaKThe executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation, Ken Hamilton, estimated the fee would cost owners of a modest-sized cattle ranch $30,000 to $40,000 a year. He said he has talked to a number of livestock owners about the proposals, and "all have said if the fees were carried out, it would bankrupt them."LiNeBrEaKSparks said Wednesday he's worried the fee could be extended to chickens and other farm animals and cause more meat to be imported.LiNeBrEaK"We'll let other countries put food on our tables like they are putting gas in our cars. Other countries don't have the health standards we have," Sparks said.LiNeBrEaKEPA spokesman Nick Butterfield said the fee was proposed for farms with livestock operations that emit more than 100 tons of carbon emissions in a year and fall under federal Clean Air Act provisions.LiNeBrEaKButterfield said the EPA has not taken a position on any of the proposals. But farmers from across the country have expressed outrage over the idea, both on Internet sites and in opinions sent to EPA during a public comment period that ended last week.LiNeBrEaK"It's something that really has a very big potential adverse impact for the livestock industry," said Rick Krause, the senior director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.LiNeBrEaKThe fee would cover the cost of a permit for the livestock operations. While farmers say it would drive them out of business, an organization supporting the proposal hopes it forces the farms and ranches to switch to healthier crops.LiNeBrEaK"It makes perfect sense if you are looking for ways to cut down on meat consumption and recoup environmental losses," said Bruce Friedrich, a spokesman in Washington for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.LiNeBrEaK"We certainly support making factory farms pay their fair share," he said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt, a Republican from Haleyville in northwest Alabama, said he has spoken with EPA officials and doesn't believe the cow tax is a serious proposal that will ever be adopted by the agency.LiNeBrEaK"Who comes up with this kind of stuff?" said Perry Mobley, director of the Alabama Farmers Federation's beef division. "It seems there is an ulterior motive, to destroy livestock farms. This would certainly put them out of business."LiNeBrEaKButterfield said the EPA is reviewing the public comments and didn't have a timetable for the next steps.LiNeBrEaKDAVE MARTIN/Associated PressLiNeBrEaKThese Montgomery cows seem unaware of a proposal Thursday by the Environmental Protection Agency to charge a fee for air-polluting cows and hogs. The proposal was one of several drafted after a 2007 Supreme Court ruling found that greenhouse gases the animals emit through flatulence or belching amounts to air pollution. It would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog.

The New York Times 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   Late Edition - Final	Obama Vows Public Works On Vast Scale  	By PETER BAKER and JOHN M. BRODER  	Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1  	1324 words  	President-elect Barack Obama promised Saturday to create the largest public works construction program since the inception of the interstate highway system a half century ago as he seeks to put together a plan to resuscitate the reeling economy.LiNeBrEaK  With jobs evaporating and the recession deepening, Mr. Obama began highlighting elements of the economic recovery program he is trying to fashion with Congressional leaders in hopes of being able to enact it shortly after being sworn in on Jan. 20. His address on Saturday followed the report on Friday indicating that the country lost 533,000 jobs in November alone, bringing the total number of jobs lost over the past year to nearly 2 million.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama's remarks showcased his ambition to expand the definition of traditional work programs for the middle class, like infrastructure projects to repair roads and bridges, to include new-era jobs in technology and so-called green jobs that reduce energy use and global warming emissions. ''We need action -- and action now,'' Mr. Obama said in an address broadcast Saturday morning on radio and YouTube.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama's plan, if enacted, would be in part a government-directed industrial policy, with lawmakers and administration officials picking winners and losers among private projects and raining large amounts of taxpayer money on them.  LiNeBrEaK  It would cover a range of programs to expand broadband Internet access, to make government buildings more energy efficient, to improve information technology at hospitals and doctors' offices, and to upgrade computers in schools.LiNeBrEaK  ''It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Here, in the country that invented the Internet, every child should have the chance to get online.''LiNeBrEaK  President Bush and many conservative economists have opposed such large-scale government intervention in the economy because it supports enterprises that might not survive in a free market. That is the crux of the argument against a government bailout of the auto industry.LiNeBrEaK  But Mr. Obama proposes to charge ahead, asserting that extensive government support is needed to preserve and create jobs while building the latticework of a 21st century economy.LiNeBrEaK  Although Mr. Obama put no price tag on his plan, he said he would invest record amounts of money in the vast infrastructure program, which also includes work on schools, sewer systems, mass transit, electrical grids, dams and other public utilities. The green jobs would include various categories, including jobs dedicated to creating alternative fuels, windmills and solar panels; building energy efficient appliances, or installing fuel-efficient heating or cooling systems. LiNeBrEaK  Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House energy adviser, said that Mr. Obama had now settled whatever debate there was in his transition team and among Democrats in Congress over how to lift the economy in the short term and over a longer horizon.LiNeBrEaK  ''It's now clear that Obama intends to stimulate the economy through large direct government spending on infrastructure projects as well as through business and individual tax cuts,'' said Mr. Bledsoe, now an official of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. ''He is advocating things like guaranteeing every American a college education, wiring the entire country for Internet, putting in a smart electric grid. If he can do it, these will be major systemic advantages for the United States in the competitive global economy.''LiNeBrEaK  Although Mr. Obama is weeks away from taking office, Friday's grim jobs report heightened pressure on him to assert leadership before his inauguration.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama and his team are working with Congressional leaders to devise a spending package that some lawmakers suggest could total $400 billion to $700 billion. Some analysts forecast even higher costs. Mr. Obama has said he would direct his team to come up with a plan to save or create 2. 5 million jobs in the first two years of his administration.LiNeBrEaK  A big part of that will be public works spending. ''We will create millions of jobs by making the single largest new investment in our national infrastructure since the creation of the federal highway system in the 1950s,'' Mr. Obama said. He did not estimate how much he would devote to that purpose, but when he met with the nation's governors last week, they said the states had $136 billion worth of road, bridge, water and other projects ready to go as soon as money became available. They estimated that each billion dollars spent would create up to 40,000 jobs.LiNeBrEaK  Local and regional transit systems have $8 billion more in projects that could begin immediately, like buying hybrid buses and expanding light rail systems, creating thousands of jobs.LiNeBrEaK  ''He hasn't given us any commitment, but we are fairly certain it's going to be large,'' Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat and chairman of the National Governors Association, said in an interview Saturday. ''I think he understands if you're trying to reverse the economy and turn it around, this is not the time to do it on the cheap. This is not the time to do it in small doses.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Bush and other Republicans have resisted such an approach in part out of concern for the already soaring federal budget deficit, which could easily hit $1 trillion this year. Borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars today to try to fix the economy, they argue, will leave a huge bill for the next generation.LiNeBrEaK  Conservative economists have also long derided public works spending as a poor response to tough economic times, saying it has not been a reliable catalyst for short-term growth and instead is more about politicians gaining points with constituents.LiNeBrEaK  Alan D. Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, told the House Ways and Means Committee recently that public works spending should not be authorized out of the ''illusory hope of job gains or economic stabilization.''LiNeBrEaK  ''If more money is spent on infrastructure, more workers will be employed in that sector,'' Mr. Viard added.  ''In the long run, however, an increase in infrastructure spending requires a reduction in public or private spending for other goods and services. As a result, fewer workers are employed in other sectors of the economy.''LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama implicitly tried to counter such arguments by invoking the federal interstate highway program, seen as one of the most successful public works efforts in American history.LiNeBrEaK  President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act in 1956, ultimately resulting in the construction of 42,795 miles of roads. In 1991, the government concluded that the total cost came to $128. 9 billion, with the federal government paying $114. 3 billion and the states picking up the rest.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Obama also responded to criticism of waste and inefficiency in such programs by promising new spending rules, like a requirement that states act quickly to invest in roads and bridges or sacrifice federal money.LiNeBrEaK  ''We'll measure progress by the reforms we make,'' Mr. Obama said, ''and the results we achieve by the jobs we create, by the energy we save, by whether America is more competitive in the world.''LiNeBrEaK  The green jobs portion of the economic package could run as high as $100 billion over two years, according to an aide familiar with the discussions. LiNeBrEaK  A blueprint for such spending can be found in a study financed by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts and the Center for American Progress, a Washington research organization founded by John D. Podesta, who isa co-chairman of Mr. Obama's transition team.LiNeBrEaK  Daniel J. Weiss, an environmental analyst at Mr. Podesta's center, said Washington should invest more money in existing programs that create work while cutting energy use, like home weatherization programs that have been chronically underfinanced.

What if the proposal reduced energy consumption and Oregon's carbon footprint, yet appealed to those who believe global warming is a myth?LiNeBrEaKAnd what if the plan provided the perfect, low-risk investment opportunity in an environment where those no longer exist?LiNeBrEaKKing, the director of new product development at Pacific Crest Securities, began thinking a while back about ways to cut energy use and make our energy delivery system more efficient. When he needed fresh ideas and fresh fuel, he sat down with state Rep. Jules Kopel-Bailey, D-Portland, and Angus Duncan over beers at Paddy's.LiNeBrEaKDuncan heads the Bonneville Environmental Foundation. Kopel-Bailey, King says, has "the passion of an activist, the brain of an economist and the heart of a pragmatist."LiNeBrEaKAnd together they developed the Energy Efficiency and Productivity Initiative.LiNeBrEaKWhich is what exactly? "It's an investment in Oregon," Kopel-Bailey said. "It's a job-creation tool. It's economic stimulus. It helps people with home-heating bills. And it confronts climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe initiative is based on several key assumptions. If we want to reduce our carbon footprint -- not to mention the state's energy costs -- we can't simply focus on new construction. We must reduce the load leaking out of the old buildings.LiNeBrEaKAnd though the owners of those buildings may be zealous recyclers, or contemplating trading in that Camry for a Prius, they may not have the money or the motivation to refit their building in the name of energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKNo problem: The Energy Efficiency and Productivity Initiative supplies the contractor and the financing, trusting that more often than not the monthly savings on your new energy bill will be greater than the new monthly loan payment.LiNeBrEaK"You have to make it user-friendly. You have to make it turnkey. You have to make it a no-brainer," says Rep.-elect Tim Freeman, R-Roseburg, and he's on board because the folks behind the initiative have done just that.LiNeBrEaKThe financing is a tad too complicated for this introductory column. "My first thought when I saw it: I could have sworn Rube Goldberg was dead," said Jon Chandler, lobbyist for the Oregon Home Builders.LiNeBrEaKBut that financing doesn't require a single general-fund dollar, and Chandler is a big fan. "For my membership, this is huge. It will put a lot of people to work right away. And it's an evolutionary step in getting some energy efficiency paid for."LiNeBrEaKIn theory, the energy initiative won't be dramatically different, Kopel-Bailey said, from calling the Dish Network to modernize your home TV system . . . except that the building owner won't pay the installation fee or higher rates on his monthly bill.LiNeBrEaK"We're creating a package that will put money in people's pockets from Day One," Kopel-Bailey said, and return money to the institutional investors. "Nothing is set in stone . . . but we have all the right people at the table."LiNeBrEaKSteve Duin: 503-221-8597; 1320 S.W.

Orlando Sentinel (Florida)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Will Obama help the fate of endangered species?  	Kevin Spear, The Orlando Sentinel, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1007 words  	Dec. 7--American workers aren't the only endangered species counting on new life from the Obama administration.LiNeBrEaKThe fate of polar bears, tiny-but-mighty red knot birds and a large cast of other creatures also hangs in the balance.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups from the National Audubon Society to Defenders of Wildlife blame President Bush for suppressing efforts during the past eight years to prevent the extinction of threatened and endangered animals. LiNeBrEaKBut even as these advocates celebrate the change in administrations, they're also expecting a lot from President-elect Barack Obama.LiNeBrEaKIt's not enough, they say, to simply rebuild safeguards for imperiled wildlife. Global warming -- and its potential to inflict hotter weather, drought and rising seas upon wildlife -- has joined their list of top threats to endangered species.LiNeBrEaK"Confront climate change -- that has to be job No. 1," said John Kostyack at the National Wildlife Federation.LiNeBrEaKSpecies ranging from massive whales to tiny beach mice edged closer to oblivion in recent years. Environmentalists say that one of them, the red knot, illustrates the all-too-common plight of a creature in a downward spiral at a time of weakened protections and rising global-warming fears.LiNeBrEaKBird loss may be a signalLiNeBrEaKEvery spring, red knots fly 9,000 miles from southern South America to the Arctic Circle, reversing the route in the fall to complete one of the longest wildlife migrations.LiNeBrEaKThe 9-inch-long birds starve during the trips and make refueling breaks at the same locations. One such pit stop is North Florida's Atlantic coastline, where the exhausted birds gorge on tiny clams -- if they can.LiNeBrEaKSince the start of this decade, worried birdwatcher Patrick Leary has monitored red knots that flock to coastal sandbars east of Jacksonville. He has chronicled how dogs, jet skis, kite surfers and beach driving repeatedly interrupt the birds' foraging.LiNeBrEaKThose assaults can be prevented by federal authorities -- but no time soon.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged it should help the bird. But the agency opted not to list red knots as threatened or endangered because of "higher priority activities" such as protecting the more than 1,300 species already on the list.LiNeBrEaKThere are about 15,000 red knots, down in the past 20 years from nearly 150,000. Environmental groups said the agency cleared the way for its extinction.LiNeBrEaK"Red knots are definitely one of the victims of the Bush administration," Leary said.LiNeBrEaKThe loss of red knots, hardly endearing like the endangered manatee or charismatic like the Florida panther, might not be widely noticed. But environmentalists are concerned the loss of the bird or any other species signals the breakdown of complex food chains and ecosystems, with consequences potentially disastrous to people.LiNeBrEaKOne suspected cause of environmental collapse is a changing climate.LiNeBrEaKDid Bush do enough?LiNeBrEaKWildlife authorities say the red knot -- like the polar bear and many other imperiled species -- is vulnerable to a knockout blow by global warming. Even the Fish and Wildlife Service pointed out that red knot survival depends on refuges at the chilly ends of the earth where rising temperatures already have damaged ecosystems.LiNeBrEaKThe plight of red knots this decade isn't unique. Bush officials on average listed fewer than eight species a year as endangered or threatened, said Defenders of Wildlife scientist Bob Davison. Former presidents were more active, with 65 average annual listings under Bill Clinton, 59 under George H.W. Bush and 30 by Ronald Reagan's administration.LiNeBrEaK"Over the past eight years we've seen an undermining of 35 years of bipartisan commitments to protecting endangered species," Davison said.LiNeBrEaKOther complaints about the Bush administration include the starving of budgets and meddling by political appointees. In one instance, an Interior Department official resigned last year after she was accused by the agency's inspector general of "editing, commenting on, and reshaping the Endangered Species Program's scientific reports from the field." Many of the official's decisions in Fish and Wildlife Service actions were later reversed.LiNeBrEaKFish and Wildlife Service spokesman Chris Tollefson said budgets have tightened for many federal agencies while workloads have increased. He added that the days for political intervening are over.LiNeBrEaK"We've acted aggressively to correct those situations," Tollefson said.LiNeBrEaKTollefson and others said the service has been hampered by heavy crossfire between environmental groups that are suing to uphold protections and property-rights advocates such as the Pacific Legal Foundation that are seeking to lessen them.LiNeBrEaK"I don't know how much worse Obama could get," said Valerie Fernandez, a foundation attorney in Stuart who thinks the Bush administration has been too diligent in protecting endangered species.LiNeBrEaKThe Bush administration contends it has sought to streamline rules that it finds cumbersome and poorly defined by the Endangered Species Act. To environmental groups, however, Bush went overboard.LiNeBrEaKHis administration now might allow federal agencies to decide for themselves if their many activities could endanger wildlife. In doing so, they could skip the longstanding requirement of consulting with experts at the Fish and Wildlife Service.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups disagree on whether such a change could be nullified easily by the Obama administration. But that's just one item on a list of expectations for the new president.LiNeBrEaK"We're hoping for a dramatic shift," said Audubon attorney Greer Goldman in Washington, D.C.

Palm Beach Post (Florida) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	U.S. SUGAR: THE REAL DEAL?  		OPINION; Pg. 16A  	680 words  	U.S. Sugar may want to sell its land to the state for Everglades restoration, but U.S. Sugar doesn't care about Everglades restoration.LiNeBrEaKWith nine days left before what U.S. Sugar calls the deadline on its offer to sell 182,500 acres for $1. 34 billion, that reality must be understood. In June, when the South Florida Water Management District proposed buying the whole company -- including a citrus plant, a railroad and a sugar mill -- U.S. Sugar CEO Bob Buker called the deal "the right thing for the state of Florida." He must have needed Botox to say that with a straight face.LiNeBrEaKAnyone who knows the troubled marriage of the Everglades and farming knows that the sugar growers rarely have had the state or the environment as their priority. It took a federal lawsuit in 1988 and jawboning by former Gov. Lawton Chiles to make the growers part of the 1994 law that set pollution standards for water entering the Everglades. Under the law, they are helping to pay for a problem that for years they claimed they didn't cause. LiNeBrEaKSo if you assume, correctly, that Clewiston-based U.S. Sugar doesn't care first about the environment, you have to assume that U.S. Sugar cares first about U.S. Sugar. No surprise there, right? Companies have to look out for themselves. But not all companies are asking the South Florida Water Management District taxpayers to enrich them in the name of restoring what's left of the Everglades.LiNeBrEaKHere's a theory:LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sugar, according to its annual report, has been losing money. U.S. Sugar didn't support Gov. Crist when he ran in 2006. In 2007, because of Gov. Crist's appointments to the water district board, U.S. Sugar for the first time lost big votes. Its employees have sued the company for trying to shortchange them on the sale of their stock. U.S. Sugar is breaking in its expensive, high-tech mill.LiNeBrEaKLate last year, during a gripe session with Gov. Crist, the governor or someone on his staff asks why the company doesn't just sell out. Environmentalists have fantasized about the end of agriculture in the Everglades, but all the scientists studying Everglades restoration assumed that they would have to work around the sugar land. The people in the Glades communities assumed that U.S. Sugar would remain loyal to Clewiston.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sugar, however, agrees. Top management -- executives in Clewiston and the Mott family -- concludes that cashing out makes sense. They get richer. Gov. Crist gets to create what he compares to "our nation's first national park." U.S. Sugar and the governor announce the sale one day before Gov. Crist's conference on climate change. In October, Audubon of Florida gives the governor its "Champion of the Everglades" award.LiNeBrEaKBut questions come up. What will the water district do with a citrus plant, railroad and sugar mill? Why is the water district paying so much? What happens to the Glades when all those U.S. Sugar jobs and the company go away? The deal shrinks. Now, it's just for the 182,500 acres. Still, the price shrinks only to $1. 34 billion, and the district says that it may need no more than 45,000 acres of U.S. Sugar land. The company gets to lease the land for six years at a very cheap rate.LiNeBrEaKTo keep the deal from collapsing, the Crist administration lobbies those seven of eight Crist appointees on the water district board to approve the contract. They are torn between this historic opportunity to save the Everglades and the growing worry that the contract terms are far too generous to U.S. Sugar.LiNeBrEaKThat's how you can imagine events developing between last December and last Tuesday, when the water district board spent seven hours without getting sufficient answers to the many questions about the deal. The biggest is whether buying U.S. Sugar's land really would save the Everglades.LiNeBrEaKGov. Crist wants this Everglades deal to be his environmental legacy. But that legacy won't be one the governor likes if he only gives a windfall to a company that doesn't care about saving the Everglades.LiNeBrEaKRandy Schultz is the editor of the editorial page of The Palm Beach Post.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	CMU competition engages, encourages students' scientific curiosities  	Luis Fabregas, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	407 words  	Dec. 7--Future scientists came together Saturday to show their creativity in an annual robot design competition hosted by the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy.LiNeBrEaKThe group of roughly 1,000 middle school students gathered at the National Robotics Engineering Center in Lawrenceville as part of the First LEGO League, an international program aimed at getting middle school students interested in science. LiNeBrEaK"We're putting kids in the roles of scientists," said Robin Shoop, the academy's director. "Our mission is to excite them about math and science."LiNeBrEaKThis year's competition centered on the theme of climate change, prompting students to program their Lego-made robots to perform a series of climate-related challenges.LiNeBrEaKIt wasn't easy.LiNeBrEaKThe challenges ranged from the frustratingly difficult task of transporting a lemon-sized polar bear across a long table, to the much easier job of making the robot open the window of a small house built with Legos.LiNeBrEaK"It's so much harder than last year," said Sonny Dornburg, a sixth-grader from Springs in Somerset County. "Nobody's going to get a perfect score."LiNeBrEaKStill, most of the students saw the competition as an opportunity to learn about issues such as global warming and greenhouse gases. That was the case of Tara Nath of Bethel Park who said preparing for the competition caused her to learn about the effects of climate change.LiNeBrEaK"I'm turning off more lights and not using as much electricity," said Nath, 11, who attends Neil Armstrong Middle School. "It's just been a fun way to learn about the weather."LiNeBrEaKAs students yesterday gave their final tweaks to their robots and crossed their fingers so they wouldn't fail, some parents paused to praise organizers for an event they wouldn't miss.LiNeBrEaK"It's more about the teamwork and getting them to work together and listen to each other and just have fun," said Pam Baratka of Pine, whose son Tyler participated in a team of students from Pine-Richland Middle School. "A lot of them wouldn't have met without this."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   TWO STAR EDITION	BRAZIL'S DECISION TO REDUCE DEFORESTATION PRAISED  	Joshua Partlow, The Washington Post  	WORLD; Pg. A-6  	445 words  	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil -- Brazil's decision to set a target for reducing deforestation by 70 percent over the next decade to combat climate change is being hailed by environmentalists as a significant goal for a major polluting country. LiNeBrEaK"This is an enormously important step," Stephan Schwartzman, an Amazon expert with the Environmental Defense Fund, said Friday by telephone from a climate change conference in Poland. "This is the first time that a major developing country, whose greenhouse gas emissions are a substantial part of the problem, has stepped up and made a commitment to bring down its total emissions. Brazil has set the standard. Now we want to see the U.S. and President Obama come up to it."LiNeBrEaKThe clear-cutting and burning of the Amazon rain forest for cattle and soybean ranches, roads and settlements makes up one of the world's largest sources of the types of gases that contribute to global warming. Since reaching a recent peak of 10,588 square miles of forest destroyed in the Amazon in 2004, deforestation dropped for the next three years, before rising slightly this year to 4,621 square miles, according to data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, which monitors deforestation.LiNeBrEaKBrazil is one of the world's top four emitters of greenhouse gases, with China, the United States and Indonesia. The destruction of the world's rain forest accounts for about 20 percent of annual greenhouse gas pollution, of which Brazil makes up 40 percent, Dr. Schwartzman said.LiNeBrEaKBrazil's plan, detailed Friday by Environment Minister Carlos Minc, calls for reducing the annual rate of deforestation to 1,900 square miles by 2017, down from 7,300 square miles, which has been the average rate of deforestation over a recent 10-year period. Mr. Minc said reaching this target would prevent 4. 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being pumped into the atmosphere, more than the combined commitment of industrialized countries under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is one of the issues that most worries our civilization these days," Mr. Minc said. "Many people used to say it was just the delirium of environmentalists, but after they started to see ice melting on their TVs, they changed their minds."LiNeBrEaKUnder Mr. Minc's predecessor, Marina Silva, Brazil set aside millions of acres of forest as protected areas. But in practice, it has been difficult to protect the vast, sparsely populated areas because of pressure from farmers and ranchers, corruption, illegal clearing and a lack of economic incentives.LiNeBrEaKAna Cristina Barros, the Brazilian representative for the Nature Conservancy, called the new deforestation target a "time for celebration."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   TWO STAR EDITION	Middle-schoolers get taste of theLEGO challenge  	Paula Reed Ward Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  	HEALTH, SCIENCE, MEDICINE and TECHNOLOGY; Pg. B-1  	1015 words  	In 2 1/2 minutes, the teams had to elevate and insulate a house; extract an ice core sample and test a levee system.LiNeBrEaKAll on a small competition table, using a robot made out of LEGOs that children, ages 9 to 14, built and programmed.LiNeBrEaKIt was part of the FIRST LEGO League competition hosted yesterday at Carnegie Mellon University's National Robotics Center in Lawrenceville. LiNeBrEaKA total of 72 teams of more than 1,000 middle-school students from around the region participated in the robotics and research challenge, whose theme this year was "Climate Connection."LiNeBrEaK"The goal is to get them excited about science and engineering, not necessarily to win the competition," said Shawn Walk, a fourth-grade teacher at Edgeworth Elementary School in Sewickley.LiNeBrEaKIn the first round, one team he helped coach from Edgeworth Elementary attempted four missions out of a possible 18.LiNeBrEaKAfter each run, they returned the robot, which includes light and touch sensors, to a home base on the competition board, and frenetically switched out LEGO accessories that were used to lift, push or carry.LiNeBrEaKThe team finished three missions: "riding" a bike, installing the insulation and testing the levee.LiNeBrEaK"I didn't feel much pressure," said Peter Hall, 10. "It was kind of like the normal runs at school."LiNeBrEaKThe hard work had been done long before yesterday, said Duff Klaber, 9.LiNeBrEaK"All you need to know at the table was where to aim it," he said.LiNeBrEaKWhen they finished, Mr. Walk high-fived them.LiNeBrEaKThe Edgeworth teams, which have 24 students, normally meet twice each week, but last week they practiced the missions every day after school.LiNeBrEaKOne of the best things about the FIRST LEGO project, Mr. Walk said, is that the computer programming is designed to be easy for younger children to understand. It uses pictures instead of coding.LiNeBrEaKThe competition teaches students problem-solving skills, teamwork, patience and perseverance, Mr. Walk said.LiNeBrEaK"This stuff, it never goes right the first time," he said. "They have to do it over and over and over again."LiNeBrEaKAnother thing Mr. Walk likes about the robotics program is that it offers competition for children who may not be interested in athletics.LiNeBrEaK"This is a sport for the mind," he said. "They can be competitive in an academic pursuit."LiNeBrEaKIndeed, parents and siblings packed into bleachers that lined the competition tables, cheering for their teams with home-made signs, all the while snacking on nachos, hot dogs and pizza.LiNeBrEaKSome teams had to identify a problem associated with the area's changing climate and then find a solution.LiNeBrEaKThe problem one group of Edgeworth students focused on? How warmer temperatures have led to a shorter winter sports season. The solution: Create artificial snow that won't melt.LiNeBrEaKAt first, the kids thought about using packing peanuts, said Rhonda Schuldt, whose son, Morgan, is on the Edgeworth team. But the students knew that those weren't good for the environment. Then they found biodegradable packing peanuts.LiNeBrEaK"They process the information so swiftly, and they're so passionate," Ms. Schuldt said. "It's amazing these are fourth- and fifth-graders."LiNeBrEaKThe children made a model of a mountain ski slope, covered it in shaved-down biodegradable peanut snow and used LEGO people to ski and snowboard down it.LiNeBrEaK"The judge was just amazed," Ms. Schuldt said.LiNeBrEaKAn all-girls team from the Homewood-Brushton YWCA wore tiaras along with their hot pink T-shirts proclaiming their name, La Reine des Abeilles -- French for "queen bees."LiNeBrEaKThe 10 girls, all in seventh or eighth grade, said the competition was both fun and exasperating.LiNeBrEaK"When we were doing our programming and building our robot, things weren't working, and we lost our confidence," said Paige McIntosh, 14, of Monroeville.LiNeBrEaK"At times we got frustrated because pieces weren't working together," added Breonna Johnson, 13, of Wilkinsburg. "But we got through it."LiNeBrEaKIt was their first year in the competition.LiNeBrEaKTeams were judged on programming; the hardware and design of the robot; research and teamwork, said Robin Shoop, director of the Robotics Academy.LiNeBrEaK"Kids today, they really want things they can get their arms around," Mr. Shoop said. "Abstract just doesn't get it done."LiNeBrEaKBy using LEGOs, the students see how the parts fit together, and they can repeatedly take their robots apart and put them back together.LiNeBrEaK"To me, it's not about the competition," he said. "It's about putting kids in a position to be scientists." LiNeBrEaKLEGO COMPETITION WINNERSLiNeBrEaKFollowing are the winning teams in the FIRST LEGO League competition held yesterday at Carnegie Mellon University.LiNeBrEaKThe annual event is part of the FIRST LEGO League, an international program for 9- to 14-year-olds created in partnership between FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and The LEGO Group.LiNeBrEaKSome students represent a school while others make up groups of middle-schoolers who are not associated with a particular school:LiNeBrEaKDIRECTOR'S AWARDLiNeBrEaK* First: Next Gen, from Garrett County, Md.LiNeBrEaK* Second: Terrabytes, a group of middle-schoolers from Murrysville, Westmoreland CountyLiNeBrEaK* Third: RoboDukes of Lightning, ErieLiNeBrEaK* Fourth: Team SOS, Fort Loudon, Franklin CountyLiNeBrEaK* Fifth: Alphabots, Providence Heights Alpha School, North HillsLiNeBrEaKPROGRAMMING AWARDLiNeBrEaK* First: Corning 3, Corning, N.Y.LiNeBrEaK* Second: Terrabytes, MurrysvilleLiNeBrEaK* Third: Alphabots, Providence Heights Alpha School, North HillsLiNeBrEaK* Fourth: Derry Middle School, YWCA Westmoreland CountyLiNeBrEaK* Fifth: Team SOSLiNeBrEaKHARDWARE DESIGN AWARD LiNeBrEaK* First: TerrabytesLiNeBrEaK* Second-place: Next GenLiNeBrEaK* Third: RoboDukes of LightningLiNeBrEaK* Fourth: RoboRounders, Bethel Park middle schoolsLiNeBrEaK* Fifth: Corning 3 LiNeBrEaK* Sixth: Team SOSLiNeBrEaK* Seventh: Solar Dukes, Carlow Campus School, OaklandLiNeBrEaKRESEARCH AWARDLiNeBrEaK* First: Next GenLiNeBrEaK* Second: Team SOSLiNeBrEaK* Third: Royals, from Baden, Beaver CountyLiNeBrEaK* Fourth: Yough Middle School, Yough, Westmoreland CountyLiNeBrEaK* Fifth: TerrabytesLiNeBrEaK* Sixth: Invisible Robonaught, Falk Middle School, OaklandLiNeBrEaK* Seventh: Electric Dreams, ErieLiNeBrEaKTEAMWORK AWARDLiNeBrEaK* First: RoboDukesLiNeBrEaK* Second: Max Mustangs, Manchester Academic Charter School, North SideLiNeBrEaK* Third: Next GenLiNeBrEaK* Fourth: Invisible RobonaughtsLiNeBrEaK* Fifth: Corning 3LiNeBrEaK* Sixth: Rambots, group of students from Gibsonia, Pa.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Pennsylvania) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   FIVE STAR EDITION	OBAMA TEAM ASSEMBLING GREEN JOBS PLAN  	John M. Broder, The New York Times  	NATIONAL; Pg. A-9  	659 words  	WASHINGTON -- President-elect Barack Obama and leaders in Congress are fashioning a plan to pour billions of dollars into a jobs program to jolt the economy and lay the groundwork for a more energy-efficient economy.LiNeBrEaKThe details and cost of the so-called green jobs program are still unclear, but a senior Obama aide, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a work in progress, said it would probably include the weatherizing of hundreds of thousands of homes, the installation of so-called smart meters to monitor and reduce home energy use, and billions of dollars in grants to state and local governments for mass transit and infrastructure projects. LiNeBrEaKThe green component of the much-larger stimulus plan would cost at least $15 billion a year, and perhaps considerably more, depending on how the projects were defined, aides working on the package said.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Mr. Obama supported a measure to address global warming by capping carbon emissions while allowing emitters to buy and trade pollution permits. He said he would devote $150 billion of the revenue from the sale of those permits over 10 years to energy efficiency and alternative energy projects, to wean the nation from fuels that are the main causes of the heating of the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKBut the Obama adviser who discussed the green energy project said Mr. Obama would not await passage of a global warming bill before embarking on the new energy and infrastructure spending. House and Senate supporters of a climate bill said they would continue working on legislative language, but did not expect quick action on a cap-and-trade law because of the economic emergency.LiNeBrEaKThat means the green-jobs program would not be financed with pollution credits bought by power generators and other carbon emitters, but instead would be added to the budget deficit.LiNeBrEaKCongressional officials working with the Obama administration said the stimulus program was also likely to involve tax breaks or direct government subsidies for a variety of clean-energy projects, including solar arrays, wind farms, advanced biofuels and technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants.LiNeBrEaKThe programs will be a part of a larger economic stimulus package whose outlines are faint, but which is expected to cost $400 billion to $500 billion. Mr. Obama has said his goal is to create or save 2. 5 million jobs in the next two years. He has assigned to his economic and environmental advisers the task of devising a proposal expected to combine a shot of new federal money into existing federal and state programs and the possible creation of new agencies modeled on New Deal public works programs.LiNeBrEaKThe political climate seems favorable to an economic stimulus plan, but large sums of new money touch off lobbying frenzies and energy projects spark debate between conservationists and those who want to more fully exploit domestic sources of oil, natural gas and coal.LiNeBrEaKSome experts said the record of government intervention in energy markets and new technologies is not promising, citing as a spectacular example the Carter-era Synthetic Fuels Corp., which spent more than $3 billion without producing any commercially usable amount of coal-based liquid fuel. Ethanol and other non-oil-based fuels have also not proved their commercial value -- in some cases, yielding less energy than was needed to produce them or, in ethanol's case, diverting land to corn and driving up food prices.LiNeBrEaKThe plan could also face resistance from fiscal hawks. In 2004, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., almost single-handedly blocked a $100 billion energy package, saying the billions of dollars in subsidies for ethanol and other alternative fuels were little more than a special-interest boondoggle. The bill was revived a year later at half the cost, and much of the money in it has not been spent.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama team and congressional leaders say they want a plan ready shortly after Congress reconvenes in January.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   All Editions	Helping preserve the environment even while on vacation  	EILEEN OGINTZ, Wire Services  	TRAVEL; TAKING THE KIDS; Pg. T02  	607 words  	I hate to be a nag, especially on vacation.LiNeBrEaKThe kids hate when I nag them about getting up early or posing for next year's holiday card. But now I've got new motivation to nag, and I don't think my environmentally conscious gang will complain about it ? traveling greener.LiNeBrEaKIf we turn out the lights when we leave home, why not in a hotel room? asks Herve Houdre, the general manager of the historic Willard Intercontinental Washington in Washington, D.C., and an emerging leader in hotel environmental initiatives. Ditto for turning down the air conditioning (or the heat) and hanging up towels. No one needs fresh towels or sheets every day in a hotel. Think how much water and energy that could save. (Download the Willard's "Pocket Guide to Going Green" at willarddc.com/sd.) LiNeBrEaKTravelers say they want to travel greener, even if it costs them more. Seventy-eight percent of those polled by Travelocity recently said they would spend extra for an eco-friendly destination. At the same time, according to TripAdvisor's latest survey, travelers vow to travel greener in the coming year ? doing more outdoors, at national parks. One-third of those polled by TripAdvisor report they are now more environmentally conscious of their travel decisions.LiNeBrEaKBut that resolve seems to crumble the minute we're in a hotel. "A lot of people just don't think about it. They think the energy is free," says Rosamond Kinzler, whose responsibility as the senior director at the American Natural History Museum's Center for Science Literacy and Technology (amnh.org/nationalcenter) is to engage kids in science. And with the museum's new "Climate Change" exhibit, that includes showing kids how they can reduce their carbon footprint ? on vacation and at home.LiNeBrEaKCertainly it makes sense to tote a reusable water bottle rather than buying plastic ones every few hours. Not only are they cheaper and better for the environment, but they also make instant souvenirs, once the kids slap stickers all over them from the places they've visited. We could also carry tote bags or backpacks for souvenirs, rather than take new bags everywhere. We don't need to drive everywhere either. Clearly, you get a better sense of a place on foot, on a bicycle or via public transportation. Even packing lighter makes a difference, we learn from the museum exhibit. The heavier the load, the more fuel it takes to get it there.LiNeBrEaKEven the way we eat on vacation can make a difference, suggests Richard Edwards, co-founder of Greenspot.travel, which is dedicated to helping travelers vacation greener. Local foods and local products, he explains, don't have to be transported to that region. At the same time, you can introduce your kids to local flavors and the local culture. Check out a farmers' market like San Francisco's Ferry Plaza Farmers Market (cuesa.org), where the kids can talk to California growers and sample their goods.LiNeBrEaKRent a greener ? or at least smaller, fuel-efficient car. Hertz (hertz.com), Avis (avis.com) and Budget (budget.com), for example, all offer the option of renting a hybrid.LiNeBrEaKIt always pays to ask hotels exactly what they're doing to "be green," says Melissa Teates, the research director for the American Society of Travel Agents (asta.org), which has developed a green program to better educate travel agents. Ask if the hotel uses "green" cleaning products, she suggests. (Visit travelsense.org to find a travel agent who is a "green" specialist.) When you arrive, stage a scavenger hunt with your eco-savvy kids. Where are the recycling bins? Are there reusable coffee mugs in the rooms, rather than paper cups? Does the hotel use energy-efficient light bulbs?

The Reporter (Vacaville, California)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Packing sun power  	Richard Bammer, The Reporter, Vacaville, Calif.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	891 words  	Dec. 7--Mariani Packing Co. has joined the ranks of heroes in the fight against global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Vacaville-based business, one of the nation's largest dried fruit manufacturers, earlier this week activated its new 1. 1-megawatt solar power system and immediately reduced its corporate carbon footprint.LiNeBrEaKAt a press conference in the company parking lot at 500 Crocker Drive, just a stone's throw from the five-football-fields-sized array of photovoltaic solar panels, CEO Mark Mariani flipped a symbolic oversized electric switch and his company became the third major business in the city to generate some of its electrical needs from the sun. LiNeBrEaKMariani, whose grandfather started the company more than a century ago and used the sun to dry fruit, said the panels' electricity-generating capacity was the equivalent of taking 3,000 cars off the road for an entire year and enough energy to power 3,000 home for a year. That is roughly one-fourth of the power Pacific Gas and Electric currently supplies the company to dry more than 100 million pounds of fruit, from plums and apricots to cherries and cranberries, each year.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking to a small gathering of print, TV journalists and city officials, Mariani said the project -- 5,800 sun-tracking panels financed at no-cost by SunEdison, a Maryland solar energy company, and installed in 90 days by groSolar, a Vermont concern -- was "a natural decision." He added that the notion of being a "steward of the land" includes caring forLiNeBrEaKits water and air "and what we breath here."LiNeBrEaKThe new system will lead to a better quality of life in Vacaville, said Mariani, adding, "We plan to grow with the city of Vacaville."LiNeBrEaKIn brief remarks, Vacaville Mayor Len Augustine said the Mariani solar installation symbolized the 102-year-old company's "progressive" thinking about the future. The mayor's comments were, in part, an allusion to Mariani's father, Paul. Nearly 50 years ago, when irrigation boomed in the Central Valley and California was becoming the major food supplier to America, Paul Mariani installed the first micro-irrigation system in the state. It cut the company's water use by 70 percent at its Santa Clara Valley orchards.LiNeBrEaK"Mark thinks to the future," Augustine said, adding that Vacaville was something of a hub in California fast-growing solar energy market, exceeded only by Oakland and San Francisco.LiNeBrEaKOthers who have gone "green" in recent months include ALZA Corp., the drug and medical delivery systems firm, which turned on a 1-megawatt facility last year, and the newly built State Compensation Insurance Fund, which in October activated a set of 300-kilowatt panels turned skyward above its parking lot, which can be seen by drivers going north or south along Interstate 505 near I-80.LiNeBrEaK"It tells companies that we are open for business," Augustine said, then quipped, "We have great sun -- and fog that makes people from San Francisco feel right at home. Mariani has put us on the map."LiNeBrEaKSunEdison, under its solar power purchase agreement, will charge no more than current retail costs for electricity supplied by the seven acres of solar panels. The economic lure for Mariani, of course, was the provision that stabilizes those rates for the life of the contract, 20 years. Most of the savings for Mariani will come during summer months, when PGandE boosts its rates during high-demand hours. On weekends, when the plant is closed, Mariani can sell power from its solar system to the PGandE grid and recoup some costs.LiNeBrEaKCompany spokeswoman Kimberly Hathaway noted that during the first 20 years of production, the zero-emission system will reduce by more than 30 million pounds the amount of carbon dioxide that would have been spewed into the earth's atmosphere if the power had come from fossil fuels.LiNeBrEaKIn an era of fluctuating but mostly historically increasing energy costs, corporate interest in renewable energy sources has burgeoned across the state, country and world, in part because the supply of fossil fuels is finite and diminishing.LiNeBrEaKIn a 2007 report, the U.S. Department of Energy noted that concern over the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels has helped to spur interest in alternative fuels that are less polluting. However, renewable energy sources still make up only a small share of U.S. domestic energy production (about 6. 8 percent or excluding hydropower about 4 percent). The major reason for this is the relatively higher cost (in some cases two to four times that of power obtained from traditional fuels).LiNeBrEaKAt the Mariani plant, as it is elsewhere, the solar energy, an increasingly common source of electricity, will be generated using heat and light from the sun. The photovoltaic cells are made of semi-conducting materials that directly convert sunlight to electricity without any harmful waste product.LiNeBrEaKAccording to the DOE, the downside to solar energy is its heavy dependence on a range of factors, including location, time of year and weather.

Richmond Times - Dispatch (Virginia)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va., Andy Thompson column  	Andy Thompson, Richmond Times-Dispatch, Va.  	SPORTS  	861 words  	Dec. 7--Word of the madness unfolding on Snowshoe Mountain first arrived in an e-mail: "31 inches of snow overnight!," it read.LiNeBrEaKHad this been February, I wouldn't have given it a second thought; the West Virginia ski resort receives an average of 180 inches of the white stuff a year. But this e-mail hit the in-box a week before Thanksgiving. Mother Nature -- or maybe it was Old Man Winter -- was offering an early start to the ski season. And she was just getting warmed up.LiNeBrEaKThe e-mail updates kept coming. The cold temperatures we experienced in Richmond in late November brought a steady supply of powder to Snowshoe, which, at 4,848 feet, is just 15 below West Virginia's highest point, Spruce Knob. LiNeBrEaKA new skier -- and one newly obsessed with the sport -- I checked out the resort's Web site last weekend to see what was going on. There it was on the front page: 68 inches of natural powder. And November wasn't even over yet. That settled it. I had to go see this for myself.LiNeBrEaKThe only places I've ever skied are Virginia's Wintergreen Resort and a number of mountains in Colorado last winter. The latter experience is what spawned this new fixation of mine. Sixty-eight inches of snow! Dozens of trails open. Sparse crowds. All of a sudden, the prospect of a 4. 5-hour drive seemed a fair price to pay.LiNeBrEaKI called Laura Parquette, communications manager for the resort, who confirmed that I wasn't dreaming all of this. Somehow, sitting in 50-degree weather in Richmond, it seemed surreal that I could drive less than five hours and be schussing down the slopes in a wintry paradise.LiNeBrEaK"Based on the pattern for the last couple of years, with climate change, I don't think anybody expected this," she said. "For this time of year, we've never had this amount of snow."LiNeBrEaKBy Thursday morning, I was on top of the mountain in line to rent skis at the Elk River Snowboard and Ski shop. Owner Gil Willis has lived and worked in the area for more than 30 years. He, too, couldn't remember this much snow this early.LiNeBrEaK"Moisture just runs up against these 4,000-foot peaks, and it just pukes snow," he said, explaining how the microclimate in the area makes it possible.LiNeBrEaKWillis' colorful description was apt. In the valley below, it was puking a rain-sleet-slush mix. On top, a thick fog had settled in. By the time I left Willis' shop around 10: 30, I couldn't see my car 100 feet away in the adjacent parking lot. This is going to be interesting, I thought.LiNeBrEaKA half-hour later -- ready to go with shoes buckled, goggles down, skis locked in -- the fog had somehow deepened. I stood at the top of the mountain gazing out over nothing. I couldn't see as far as the first trail sign. My map said a lift was right in front of me, but I was happy just to make out my ski tips. There were so few other skiers on the mountain on this weekday morning that I couldn't find anyone to follow. This was going to be interesting.LiNeBrEaKI hesitated for a second, leery of venturing out into the nothingness. But there were no other good options. So I did the only thing that came to mind: I pointed the skis downhill and gave myself to the mountain.LiNeBrEaKI wanted to start on a green-colored (easier) slope until the muscle memory came back. I was looking for Powder Monkey but wound up instead on the blue (intermediate) Moonshine. There was no time to change my mind, so away I went.LiNeBrEaKI don't know what it is about skiing that does this to me, but I couldn't stop smiling as I cut back and forth across the trail. I can't explain it, but whatever it is, the root of my fascination with this sport must lie there.LiNeBrEaKMoonshine quickly merged with Powder Monkey, and just as I was getting my bearings in the fog -- if I stayed close to the edges I could make out the trail signs in time to read them -- I shot out of it. It was like going from night to day. What a rush!LiNeBrEaKAlmost as ethereal was taking the lift back up into the fog. The boundary where clear sight and near-zero visibility met was as stark as a line drawn in the snow.LiNeBrEaKThat was the pattern for the next few hours: start in fog, ski around willy-nilly until I found my way down, then ride the lift back into the fog. After about an hour, as if to make the dreamlike conditions seem a little more so, a light snow began to fall.LiNeBrEaKI sampled almost all of the more than 20 trails that were open -- it'll be 30 by the time the paper goes to press today -- then figured I better start heading back to Richmond before the weather got bad.LiNeBrEaKI should have known better. I drove down the mountain through the same fog line, and by the time I reached the valley below, there was no snow and little indication that a short distance above, winter already was in full swing.LiNeBrEaKContact Andy Thompson at (804) 649-6579 or outdoors@timesdispatch.com	SKIING (91%); WEATHER (90%); RESORTS (90%); MOUNTAINS (89%); SPORTING GOODS STORES (77%); CLIMATOLOGY (74%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); SNOWBOARDING (73%); SPORTS (73%); SPORTS and RECREATION (73%); THANKSGIVING (71%); SPORTS and RECREATION EVENTS (68%); SKIING FACILITIES (72%)  				Sports (sports events/team news)  	RICHMOND, VA, USA (73%) WEST VIRGINIA, USA (90%); VIRGINIA, USA (90%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 8, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Richmond Times - Dispatch   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081207-RV-THOMPSON-COL-20081207  	RV  												
Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   Final Edition	On Change, Warming, U.S. Cars, Pre-emption, Palin, Etc.  	Ross MacKenzie  	EDITORIAL; Pg. E-3  	880 words  	 Quotations on a variety of topics currently in the news...LiNeBrEaK Barack Obama, discussing the many Clinton-era alumni he is selecting for his administration of "change": "Understand where the vision for change comes from first and foremost. It comes from me. That's my job... to provide a vision in terms of where we are going and to make sure that my team is implementing it."LiNeBrEaK Emory University law and economics professor Paul Rubin, formerly a member of the Reagan administration and an unpaid adviser to the McCain presidential campaign: "Today, the U.S. is in better shape than in 1932. But it faces similar circumstances. The stock market has been in a tailspin, credit markets have locked up, and [Obama ran] on expanding the role of government, laying the blame for the economic turmoil on the current occupant of the White House and his party's economic policies. Barack Obama is one of the most liberal members of the Senate. His reaction to the financial crisis is to blame deregulation....[With the heavy Democratic majority in the Senate, he will have] more power than any president has had in decades to push a liberal agenda. And given the opportunity, Mr. Obama will likely radically increase government interference in the economy." LiNeBrEaK The late novelist Michael Crichton - author of Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain - on global warming, in a 2005 National Press Club speech: "Our approach to global warming exemplifies everything that is wrong with our approach to the environment.LiNeBrEaKWe are basing our decisions on speculation, not evidence."LiNeBrEaK Brookings Institution fellows Robert Crandall and Clifford Winston, on the U.S. auto industry: "The most constructive role the government can play at this point is to provide a short-term infusion of capital with strict repayment rules that will essentially require the automakers to sell off their assets to other, successful companies. Why is such a dramatic step necessary? For the unavoidable reality that the fundamental problem the automakers face is not their pension, health care, or other legacy costs. It is that they are not making cars and trucks that enough Americans want to buy. And this has been true to some degree since the first energy shock hit the U.S. in the early 1970s."LiNeBrEaK Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad - on war with the West (in 2005): "Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism? You had best know that this slogan and this goal are attainable, and surely they can be achieved." (And in 2008): "The big powers are going down."LiNeBrEaK Sheik Yusuf al-Qaradawi of Egypt - a country with a per-capita GDP of $1,697, ranking it 111th in the world, compared with America's 10th-ranking $45,790 - on the recession gripping the developed world: "The collapse of the capitalist system based on usury and paper and not on goods traded on the market, is proof that it is in crisis and shows that Islamic economic philosophy is holding up."LiNeBrEaK Gen. James Conway, Marine Corps commandant and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on al-Qaida's shifting focus to Afghanistan and Pakistan from an Iraq where "it smells like [U.S./Iraqi] victory": "I don't think there is anybody in Iraq these days planning a strike on the U.S. But I fear there are people in Afghanistan or Pakistan who could be doing that very thing."LiNeBrEaK George Shultz, secretary of state in the Reagan administration, on the need to continue the Bush administration's policy of pre-emption against regimes advancing Islamofascist terror: "In this age where there are people who want to do damage to us through terrorist tactics, you want to be aggressive in trying to find out what might happen before it happens, and then stop it from happening. That is, take preventive action....That's an uncomfortable idea for people, particularly when the act of prevention takes place in some other country. Even if it takes place in this country, it has its problems."LiNeBrEaK The Week magazine: "Emergency rooms in Canada are so crowded that patients are dying while they wait to be treated, Canadian doctors said [last month]. Treatment is free in Canada's national health care system, and at many hospitals packed ambulances idle outside for hours because there is no place to leave patients....'We've had people have heart attacks in the waiting room, people seize in the waiting room, and patients have miscarriages in the waiting room,' said Dr. Brian Rowe of the University of Alberta Hospital. 'It's like a Third World country.' "LiNeBrEaK Bill Clinton, during the presidential campaign, discussing the popularity of Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin: "I get why she's hot out there, why she's doing well. People look at her, and they say: 'All those kids. Something that happens in everybody's family. I'm glad she loves her daughter and she's not ashamed of her. Glad that girl's going around with her boyfriend. Glad they're going to get married....' [Voters will think,] 'I like that little Down syndrome kid. One of them lives down the street. They're wonderful children. They're wonderful people. And I like the idea that [her husband] does those long-distance races. Stayed in the race for 500 miles with a broken arm. My kind of guy.'

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Sierra Nevada climate changes feed monster, forest-devouring fires  	By Tom Knudson, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	732 words  	SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Driving home from Lake Tahoe, Leah Wills watched the column of ash-gray smoke from the Moonlight fire grow and grow _ until finally she was under it.LiNeBrEaKOverhead, the sky that September afternoon in 2007 turned eerie pink. Orange-red flecks of burning bark streaked like missiles through the air. And the smoke _ eye-watering and acrid _ was inescapable.LiNeBrEaK"It was like a nuclear cloud," said Wills, 59, a policy analyst for the Plumas County Flood Control District who lives near the tiny hamlet of Genesee. "I've been to Denali and Kilimanjaro. I grew up with tornadoes. I've seen some big things. I never saw anything that big in my life." LiNeBrEaKWildfire has marched across the West for centuries. But no longer are major conflagrations fueled simply by heavy brush and timber. Now climate change is stoking the flames higher and hotter, too.LiNeBrEaKThat view, common among firefighters, is reflected in new studies that tie changing patterns of heat and moisture in the western United States to an unprecedented rash of costly and destructive wildfires.LiNeBrEaKAmong other things, researchers have found the frequency of wildfire increased fourfold _ and the terrain burned expanded sixfold _ as summers grew longer and hotter over the past two decades.LiNeBrEaKThe fire season now stretches out 78 days longer than it did during the 1970s and '80s. And, on average, large fires burn for more than a month, compared with just a week a generation ago.LiNeBrEaKScientists also have discovered that in many places, nothing signals a bad fire year like a short winter and an early snowmelt. Overall, 72 percent of the land scorched across the West from 1987 to 2003 burned in early snowmelt years.LiNeBrEaKAcross the Sierra, satellite imagery shows that today's wildfires are far more destructive than fires of the past, leaving larger portions of the burned landscape looking like nuclear blast zones. That searing intensity, in turn, is threatening water quality, wildlife habitat, rural and resort communities and firefighter lives.LiNeBrEaKAs the climate warms, the ability of the region's mixed conifer forest ecosystem to recover from these destructive fires is in danger.LiNeBrEaK"We're getting into a place where we are almost having a perfect storm" for wildfire, said Jay Miller, a U.S. Forest Service researcher and lead author of a recent paper published in the scientific journal Ecosystems linking climate change to the more severe fires in the Sierra.LiNeBrEaK"We have increased fuels, but this changing climate is adding an additional stress on the whole situation," Miller said. "When things get bad, things will get much worse."LiNeBrEaKThat future may already have arrived. This year, the fire season got off to an early June start in the north state and only recently came to a close. Statewide, 1. 4 million acres burned in 2008, just shy of last year's 1. 5 million acres, the highest total in at least four decades.LiNeBrEaK"When I started fighting fire, the normal fire season was from the beginning of June to the end of September," said Pete Duncan, a fuels management officer for the Plumas National Forest. "Now we are bringing crews on in the middle of April and they are working into November and December."LiNeBrEaK"And we're seeing fires now burning in areas that normally we wouldn't consider a high-intensity burn situation."LiNeBrEaKJust a few weeks ago, Duncan heard about one such incident: the Panther fire on the Klamath National Forest near the Oregon border.LiNeBrEaK"It made an eight-mile run one afternoon, in late October. It burned through an area of fairly high elevation old-growth timber and at very high severity," Duncan said.LiNeBrEaK"I was kind of amazed that something would have burned to that scale," he added. "To make a 40,000-acre run in an afternoon is significant for any time of year _ but particularly for that time of year."LiNeBrEaKThe Moonlight fire, which burned across the Plumas National Forest and timber industry land north of Quincy, was one of the most environmentally destructive in recent memory.LiNeBrEaKVisit The Sacramento Bee online at http://www.sacbee.com/	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); FOREST FIRES (90%); FIRES (90%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (88%); ECOSYSTEMS and HABITATS (85%); DISASTER and EMERGENCY AGENCIES (78%); FORESTS and WOODLANDS (78%); LAKES (78%); SCIENCE NEWS (76%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (76%); FORESTRY and ENVIRONMENT (73%); RESEARCH (72%); FLOOD CONTROL (56%); WILDLIFE (50%)  					SACRAMENTO, CA, USA (93%) CALIFORNIA, USA (93%); WEST USA (79%); MOUNT KILIMANJARO (57%); MOUNT MCKINLEY (57%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 7, 2008  	ENGLISH  	PHOTOS (from MCT Photo Service, 202-383-6099): ENV-SIERRANEVADA-FIRES		Newspaper  	2008 Sacramento Bee   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (52%)  	20081207-BC-ENV-SIERRANEVADA-FIRES  	SA  	SACRAMENTO, Calif.   											
Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	The Sacramento Bee, Calif., Dan Walters column: Dan Walters: Governor's cultivating a new buddy  	Dan Walters, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	568 words  	Dec. 7--ONE OF THE PECULIAR -- but very important -- aspects of state Capitol life is the three-way interplay among the governor, the president pro tem of the Senate and the speaker of the Assembly.LiNeBrEaKThe relationships are as much personal as political, and usually transcend party. More often than not, in fact, the governor is a Republican and the legislative leaders are Democrats. And usually the governor forges a close, or at least closer, relationship with one of those leaders, and the other is the odd person out. LiNeBrEaKArnold Schwarzenegger's five-year governorship is a case in point. He quickly established a rapport with the irascible, mercurial leader of the Senate, John Burton -- one rooted, at least partially, in Burton's love of movies and their joint ribaldry. Fabian Nunez, the very young and very new Assembly speaker, was often ignored as Schwarzenegger and Burton swapped gossip, jokes and little gifts and did business.LiNeBrEaKWhen Burton left the Senate a year later, however, and Don Perata took over as Senate leader, a transformation began. Schwarzenegger and Perata never hit it off, but the governor developed an increasingly tight relationship with Nunez.LiNeBrEaKHe and Nunez became close personal friends and developed a powerful political partnership that resulted in a massive package of infrastructure bonds and a landmark anti-global warming bill. There was also one spectacular failure, an ambitious scheme to extend health insurance to the working poor that was killed in Perata's Senate.LiNeBrEaKKaren Bass succeeded Nunez last year and, it's apparent, has never had more than an arm's-length association with Schwarzenegger. That's left the governor isolated since he and Perata never reconciled, and he's had a very frosty relationship with Republican legislators.LiNeBrEaKThe Senate now has a new leader, Darrell Steinberg, and Schwarzenegger is seeking the same kind of rapport that he enjoyed with Burton and Nunez.LiNeBrEaKThat intent was signaled a few months ago when Schwarzenegger signed Steinberg's bill aimed at changing residential development patterns in California to reduce auto traffic and greenhouse gases, despite widespread opposition from the business community.LiNeBrEaKSchwarzenegger has tagged Steinberg with a nickname, "Steinie," that's another sign of a burgeoning personal relationship, and the new Senate leader has praised the governor on health care and his willingness to enact new taxes to balance the budget.LiNeBrEaKStill another sign that Schwarzenegger is cultivating Steinberg is his appointment of Carole Migden -- who was ousted from the Senate this year by Democratic voters -- to a high-paying state board position, thereby solving a little internal political problem for Steinberg.LiNeBrEaKIt's too early to tell whether a new political partnership is developing, but Schwarzenegger and Steinberg evidently want one. And if it does, expanding health care, especially for children, would be high on their agenda.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Dan Walters, (916) 321-1195. Back columns, www.sacbee.com/walters.

Sacramento Bee (California)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	OPINION: The Conversation: Something in the air: To fight global warming, a single state board could affect our economy to an unprecedented degree  	Daniel Weintraub, The Sacramento Bee, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	1109 words  	Dec. 7--California's commitment to limiting its emission of carbon and other greenhouse gases in hopes of fighting global warming is about to get real with the adoption as soon as Thursday of a sweeping plan that might ultimately represent the biggest government intervention in the economy in the history of the state.LiNeBrEaKThe cars we drive, the electricity we use to light and heat our houses, and the location of our future homes, jobs and businesses all could be directly regulated by the state's powerful, appointed Air Resources Board. Industry, meanwhile, will have to find ways to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases or else face huge fines levied by the state. LiNeBrEaKThe risk is great and the reward uncertain. Coming at a time when California's economy already is reeling from the collapse of the housing industry, the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and a general slowdown in investment and retail activity, the new policy will add higher costs on employers that could force some to curtail operations or even leave the state.LiNeBrEaKSupporters of the policy, however, contend that the changes will eventually mean a net benefit to the economy as the state uses less energy and learns to rely on cheaper, cleaner-burning fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe environmental benefit is also uncertain. Greenhouse gases themselves -- mainly carbon dioxide -- are not a health hazard when dispersed into the atmosphere, although global warming could eventually have catastrophic effects on our way of life. And by unilaterally reducing its emissions, California cannot guarantee a slowdown or reduction in global warming, because the state accounts for only a tiny percentage of worldwide emissions, and any reduction here is likely to be swamped by increases in fast-developing countries, such as China.LiNeBrEaKBut the great hope behind Assembly Bill 32, the 2006 law that started California down this path, is that two things will happen. First, California's leadership will prove to be an example for the nation and ultimately the world. And second, that by declaring itself a leader in the move toward a low-carbon future, California will become a hub of research, development and manufacturing for new industries that arise to meet the needs of a post-carbon world.LiNeBrEaKFirst, though, the Air Resources Board must work through the nitty-gritty details of limiting carbon emissions from tens of thousands of sources around the state. The board plans to do so with a mix of direct regulations and a market-based program that will give businesses the economic incentive and the freedom to find solutions on their own.LiNeBrEaKThe board's first steps will be targeted at relatively few entities -- large companies and industries that account for most of the greenhouse gas now emitted in the state.LiNeBrEaKTransportation, for example, is expected to account for about 37 percent of greenhouse gases by 2020 if nothing is done to reduce them. One part of the plan targets the automobile companies with a regulation that would force manufacturers to change the way their engines burn fuel so that they produce less carbon dioxide in their exhaust. Another regulation would force oil companies to reduce the carbon content of their fuels by 10 percent. Another would hold local governments accountable for reducing emissions caused by new development, potentially forcing builders to design more densely populated communities where links between jobs and housing make residents less reliant on the automobile.LiNeBrEaKUtilities, meanwhile, will be required to increase their use of renewable energy sources until those sources account for 33 percent of the electricity generated in the state. Homeowners will be given incentives to install solar roofs and water heaters.LiNeBrEaKOther regulations will target smaller segments of the economy that produce large amounts of especially potent gases that are thought to contribute far more to global warming, on a pound-for-pound basis, than does carbon dioxide. Most of these emissions come from chemicals involved in refrigeration and air conditioning, and the air board's plan contemplates an entire new regime of regulations aimed at homeowners, motorists and business, with new fees, reporting requirements and inspections designed to reduce the release of these gases.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to all the new direct regulation mandating or banning specific practices, major industries will be subject to a blanket cap on their emissions and will have to obtain permits allowing them to produce a certain amount of greenhouse gases in a year. The idea is that those permits will then be bought and sold in an exchange, leading companies that can reduce their emissions the most at the least possible cost to do so.LiNeBrEaKAll of this comes at a huge cost, estimated by the air board to be almost $25 billion a year in today's dollars. But the board also projects that the changes will save Californians more than $40 billion a year, for a net benefit to the economy of about $16 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe problem is that the costs are more concrete than the benefits, which are more dependent on changes in the economy and worldwide energy prices. It is possible, as the board's staff believes, that the benefits from its policies are understated. But if the costs are overstated, the effects could be disastrous. Anyone who lived through California's attempt to restructure the electricity industry in 2000 and 2001 knows how easy it is for government intervention in the economy to throw thousands of complex financial relationships out of whack.LiNeBrEaKAt this point, with the Democrat-controlled Legislature, a Republican governor, his appointees on the air board and the general public all in support of California taking on this challenge, it seems all but inevitable. About the only thing likely to change that would be a quick, aggressive move by the federal government to take over the field, but even if it did so, much of what is happening now in California would probably continue, with more oversight and involvement from Washington.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia led the nation in fighting smog, cleaning its water and regulating land use. It is now destined, for better or worse, to find itself on the cutting edge of using public policy in an attempt to battle global warming.LiNeBrEaKCall The Bee's Daniel Weintraub, (916) 321-1914.

San Jose Mercury News (California)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Backers of clean energy urge Obama to act decisively  	By Frank Davies, San Jose Mercury News  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	853 words  	WASHINGTON _ Memo to Barack Obama on ways to revamp the nation's energy policy and boost the economy: Think big. Act boldly.LiNeBrEaKThat's the emerging consensus of policy experts, Bay Area clean-tech leaders and even hardened pols who know the obstacles. They are urging the president-elect to seize a rare opportunity and dramatically accelerate the nation toward a clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaK"We can't lose this moment _ we have to do things in a big way," said Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania at a forum last week. LiNeBrEaKSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid told an energy conference at Google's Washington office to expect a large spending package when Congress convenes in January.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not concerned about spending money," he said. "It's the only way to get out of the hole that's been dug for us, and that applies to energy."LiNeBrEaKObama and congressional leaders are about to make key decisions that will show just how bold they want to be on the energy front:LiNeBrEaK_Obama's energy and environment team could be unveiled as early as this week. Those appointments will give clues on how aggressively Obama wants to move.LiNeBrEaK_With the recession getting worse and unemployment on the rise, pressure is building for a large stimulus plan, costing $500 billion or more, next month. Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and John Podesta, chief of the transition team, favor a large "green recovery" component of that package, including more spending on alternative fuels.LiNeBrEaK_Citing the threat of climate change, Obama has said he wants to push for strict limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, with utilities and manufacturers buying and trading pollution permits. But is setting up a complex cap-and-trade system achievable in 2009, with fears that it could boost energy prices in the short term?LiNeBrEaKObama enters the White House with lots of political capital, an expanded Democratic majority in Congress, and a raft of specific proposals from his own team and allies in the center-left think tanks of Washington.LiNeBrEaKPodesta, former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, heads one of those groups, the Center for American Progress. He became Obama's transition chief in August, three months before the election, and quietly began planning a fast start for the Obama presidency.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's center in September issued a $100 billion "green recovery" plan of tax credits, direct spending and loan guarantees to spur clean technology and energy efficiency and create 2 million jobs _ a major Obama goal.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's group even forecast the impact on each state. California would receive $12. 7 billion, creating 235,000 jobs, under the plan. That could include federal funding for high-speed rail, backed by state voters in November.LiNeBrEaK"The investment described here is doable in the early days of a new administration," Podesta wrote three months ago.LiNeBrEaK(EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM)LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus package in January will include at least $15 billion for clean tech and energy efficiency, an Obama adviser told the New York Times. That would include money to weatherize homes and grants for mass transit.LiNeBrEaKReid and Obama have used similar language that the economic crisis is "an opportunity" to build a clean-tech infrastructure for the future while boosting jobs and growth in the short term.LiNeBrEaKJeff Anderson of San Francisco, who chaired Clean Tech for Obama during the campaign, said the Obama team "wants as many green elements as they can get" in the stimulus bill.LiNeBrEaK"What's important for a recovery is getting an immediate bang for your buck, and energy efficiency is easier stuff that you can do quickly," said Anderson.LiNeBrEaKBeyond the stimulus plan, the long-range effort to combat global warming will be a priority, Obama has promised.LiNeBrEaKBut complex cap-and-trade legislation raises big questions about costs, as long as the U.S. economy relies on oil and coal. Depending on how pollution permits are sold, utilities could face higher costs in the short term that they would pass on to consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut environmental groups and many businesses say a cap-and-trade system is the only way to set a price on carbon and shift market forces in favor of renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe overarching question Obama faces is whether he can press for two complicated domestic initiatives _ health care reform and tackling climate change _ while focusing on the biggest priority, an economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKHistorian Matt Dallek of the University of California at Berkeley said the Obama team "is weighing how far and how fast they can move on all these things."LiNeBrEaK"It may help them to do health care and energy early, even if you don't get everything you want," Dallek said. "The election has given Obama a clear mandate and more space to act than presidents usually have, and they want to take advantage of that."

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Listen to the science  	Tribune Editorial  	OPINION; Editorials  	396 words  	Ignoring scientific evidence of looming catastrophes doesn't make the danger go away.LiNeBrEaKFor years the Bush administration pretty much ignored scientists' warnings about climate change, including its effects on the arid West. Keeping its head in the sand, the Bush Interior Department in its final days would like to suppress scientific evidence about the likely effects of an ill-conceived proposal to pump water from aquifers under the Nevada-Utah boundary at Snake Valley and pipe it south to slake the thirst of Las Vegans. LiNeBrEaKThe water level, at equilibrium now, could be reduced by warming global temperatures, and pumping a hefty share of what remains to Las Vegas could devastate Utah's west desert.LiNeBrEaKWe hope a Barack Obama Interior Department will not only allow but encourage federal scientific research when hearings on the Southern Nevada Water Authority's plan begin next fall. Without those reports, the meetings would be a sham.LiNeBrEaKResearch already shows that pumping 50,000 acre-feet of water annually would have an enormous negative impact on the shallow water table that supports a delicate desert ecosystem. SNWA has convinced Nevada State Engineer Tracy Taylor to allow that much water to be pumped from the Nevada side. Utah must agree before water can be taken from the shared aquifer under Snake Valley.LiNeBrEaKBut U.S. Geological Survey studies show the water is not contained in one area but moves beneath the surface. Surface water is affected, too, when groundwater is removed. So taking water from adjacent valleys in Nevada could reduce the aquifer on the Utah side.LiNeBrEaKRemoving groundwater from arid land would damage wildlife, the land itself and the ranching it supports. Worse, if Snake Valley were pumped dry, it could well become a giant dust bowl, sending windblown particles directly over the heavily populated and already polluted Wasatch Front.LiNeBrEaKAll 29 Utah counties have jointly asked the Department of Interior to thoroughly consider all scientific data. But the department has already shown its hand. At similar hearings regarding pumping Nevada valleys, Interior refused to hear protests from the BLM, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Park Service, which worries about impacts on Great Basin National Park.LiNeBrEaKIf science on the Snake Valley is squelched, the project could be approved by default. And that would be a travesty.

LiNeBrEaKIn an Earth-friendly move, Buzz Cuccia, owner of Vince's here, has installed solar panels on the roof of his restaurant, at 8241 Foothill Blvd.LiNeBrEaKHalf the popular eatery's energy consumption will now come from the sun.LiNeBrEaK"With the cost of oil and electricity going up, people are always asking, `What are they going to do about it?' " Cuccia said. "Well, who's `they'? `They' is us."LiNeBrEaKThe Prius-driving pasta proprietor is the first in the city to bring solar energy to a business.LiNeBrEaKAccording to city records, there are 17 residential units in the city with solar panels.LiNeBrEaKThe initial cost for the Westlake Village- based Solar Electrical Systems to install the panels was $200,000, but after rebates and tax credits, Cuccia said he paid less than $80,000.LiNeBrEaKCuccia expects to recover the cost through savings in his electricity bills after five years.LiNeBrEaKThe restaurant, which seats 350 people, consumes a lot of energy, especially during the summer when it runs five air conditioners.LiNeBrEaK"We don't know if we're the cause of global warming, but we certainly contributed to it," Cuccia said.

San Gabriel Valley Tribune (California) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Steady reform for clean air  		OPINION  	562 words  	CALIFORNIA - which leads the nation in green initiatives - will set a new standard Friday for the clean-up of diesel exhaust from big rig trucks.LiNeBrEaKIt's a legacy that must continue, not only to help LiNeBrEaK36 million Californians breathe cleaner air with fewer soot particles, but to continue growing a green jobs industry that will help rebuild our economy.LiNeBrEaKStill, when the California Air Resources Board convenes to approve the new big rig pollution rule, it must ensure that the $1 billion in funding promised by the governor and the voters of Proposition 1B will be available to help trucking companies pay for retrofits to old trucks and for brand new cleaner-burning rigs.LiNeBrEaKWe sympathize with trucking firms that told our editorial board they are being hit by not just one regulation but a series of regulations in a slumping economy when keeping trucks on the road and employees on payroll is tough enough. That's why we are also recommending that the CARB provide incentives for companies to voluntarily meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's "SmartWay" proposal that offers aerodynamic "skirts" and wider tires to increase fuel efficiency.LiNeBrEaKWhile the CARB has scheduled this voluntary EPA program to become a second, mandatory rule in California, it can help trucking firms ease into cleaner trucks by spreading out the mandatory burden. Many larger firms will go ahead and make trailer improvements anyway, because it will save them fuel costs. Others will surely follow suit.LiNeBrEaKHowever, we don't believe the CARB should roll back its main proposal to cut down on diesel exhaust, a rule that will affect 400,000 trucks registered in California and about 500,000 registered elsewhere but using California roads.LiNeBrEaKThis is simply way too important.LiNeBrEaKFor years, regulators have been criticized for picking on gasoline-powered cars while ignoring diesel-powered vehicles. Even though the science says pollution from diesel exhaust - tiny particulates that can lodge deep in the lungs and cause lung cancer - kills thousands of Californians every day. The rule will also require reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx), an irritant itself and also a precursor to another deadly smog gas, ozone. CARB estimates the cleaner trucks will save 9,400 lives between 2010 and 2025, including those of truckers themselves, who have a higher rate of lung cancer than the average population.LiNeBrEaKOn the larger scale, fewer diesel emissions will reduce the build up of greenhouse gases, which are contributing to global warming. The reductions will also reduce health-care costs.LiNeBrEaKWhile the state leads in breakthrough legislation, such as AB 32 which puts California on a path to bring down emissions that cause global warming to 1990 levels by 2020, it still must answer to the U.S. EPA when it comes to clean air goals. LiNeBrEaKFurther delays in reaching EPA-specified clean air levels could jeopardize the state's share of federal highway funds - something the near-bankrupt state of California can't afford to let happen.LiNeBrEaKThe best approach is one of steady, clean air reform with grants and loans available for companies to buy new clean-diesel or compressed natural gas-burning trucks. Since the CARB workshopped this rule for more than 18 months and delayed it once already in order to incorporate industry suggestions, further delays would be irresponsible both to the lives and the lungs of all Californians.

St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	How broad can energy reform get?  	By Frank Davies San Jose Mercury News  	NATIONAL  	693 words  	WASHINGTON -- Memo to Barack Obama on ways to revamp the nation's energy policy and boost the economy: Think big. Act boldly.LiNeBrEaKThat's the emerging consensus of many clean-tech leaders and even hardened pols who know the obstacles. They are urging the president-elect to seize a rare opportunity and accelerate the nation toward a clean energy economy.LiNeBrEaK"We can't lose this moment -- we have to do things in a big way," said Gov. Ed Rendell, of Pennsylvania, last week. LiNeBrEaKSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid told an energy conference at Google's Washington office to expect a large spending package when Congress convenes in January.LiNeBrEaK"I'm not concerned about spending money," he said. "It's the only way to get out of the hole that's been dug for us, and that applies to energy."LiNeBrEaKObama and congressional leaders are about to make key decisions that will show just how bold they want to be on the energy front:LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKObama's energy and environment team could be unveiled as early as this week. Those appointments will give clues on how aggressively Obama wants to move. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKWith the recession getting worse and unemployment on the rise, pressure is building for a large stimulus plan, costing $500 billion or more, next month. Reid, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and John Podesta, chief of the transition team, favor a large "green recovery" component of that package. LiNeBrEaK&bull;LiNeBrEaKCiting the threat of climate change, Obama has said he wants to push for strict limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, with utilities and manufacturers buying and trading pollution permits. But is setting up a complex cap-and-trade system achievable in 2009, with fears that it could boost energy prices in the short term? LiNeBrEaKObama enters the White House with lots of political capital, an expanded Democratic majority in Congress, and a raft of specific proposals from his own team and allies in the center-left think tanks of Washington.LiNeBrEaKPodesta, former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, heads one of those groups, the Center for American Progress. He became Obama's transition chief in August, three months before the election, and quietly began planning a fast start for the Obama presidency.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's center in September issued a $100 billion "green recovery" plan of tax credits, direct spending and loan guarantees to spur clean technology and energy efficiency and create 2 million jobs -- a major Obama goal.LiNeBrEaKPodesta's group even forecast the impact on each state. California would receive $12. 7 billion, creating 235,000 jobs, under the plan. That could include federal funding for high-speed rail, backed by state voters in November.LiNeBrEaKThe stimulus package in January will include at least $15 billion for clean tech and energy efficiency, an Obama adviser told the New York Times. That would include money to weatherize homes and grants for mass transit.LiNeBrEaKReid and Obama have used similar language that the economic crisis is "an opportunity" to build a clean-tech infrastructure while boosting jobs and growth in the short term.LiNeBrEaKJeff Anderson of San Francisco, who chaired Clean Tech for Obama during the campaign, said the Obama team "wants as many green elements as they can get."LiNeBrEaKBeyond the stimulus plan, the long-range effort to combat global warming will be a priority, Obama has promised.LiNeBrEaKBut complex cap-and-trade legislation raises big questions about costs, as long as the U.S. economy relies on oil and coal. Depending on how pollution permits are sold, utilities could face higher costs in the short term that they would pass on to consumers.LiNeBrEaKBut even many businesses say a cap-and-trade system is the only way to set a price on carbon and shift market forces in favor of renewable fuels.LiNeBrEaKThe question is whether Obama can press two complicated domestic initiatives -- health care reform and tackling climate change -- while focusing on an economic recovery.LiNeBrEaKHistorian Matt Dallek, of the University of California, said the Obama team "is weighing how far and how fast they can move on all these things."LiNeBrEaK"It may help them to do health care and energy early, even if you don't get everything you want," Dallek said.

The Sunday Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   Sunrise Edition	Green? You ain't seen nothing, yet  		Local News  	614 words  	Green? YouLiNeBrEaKain't seenLiNeBrEaKnothing, yetLiNeBrEaKA s Jeffrey King notes, "You can't throw a rock in this town without hitting sustainability." It's the initiative du jour, if not du decade . . . but we've yet to craft a lean, green machine. If the neighbors are intrigued, many are not yet engaged. For all the chatter about sustainability, infatuation has not yet produced saturation on Main Street.LiNeBrEaKThe old water heater still chugs away in the garage. The energy audit is forgotten. The insulation goes unrolled. LiNeBrEaKBut what if someone came up with a financial incentive to refit every house, every building, every green inch of Oregon?LiNeBrEaKWhat if the plan created hundreds of jobs and cost the state nothing? What if the proposal reduced energy consumption and Oregon's carbon footprint, yet appealed to those who believe global warming is a myth?LiNeBrEaKAnd what if the plan provided the perfect, low-risk investment opportunity in an environment where those no longer exist?LiNeBrEaKKing, the director of new product development at Pacific Crest Securities, began thinking a while back about ways to cut energy use and make our energy delivery system more efficient. When he needed fresh ideas and fresh fuel, he sat down with state Rep. Jules Kopel-Bailey, D-Portland, and Angus Duncan over beers at Paddy's.LiNeBrEaKDuncan heads the Bonneville Environmental Foundation. Kopel-Bailey, King says, has "the passion of an activist, the brain of an economist and the heart of a pragmatist."LiNeBrEaKAnd together they developed the Energy Efficiency and Productivity Initiative.LiNeBrEaKWhich is what exactly? "It's an investment in Oregon," Kopel-Bailey said. "It's a job-creation tool. It's economic stimulus. It helps people with home-heating bills. And it confronts climate change."LiNeBrEaKThe initiative is based on several key assumptions. If we want to reduce our carbon footprint --not to mention the state's energy costs --we can't simply focus on new construction. We must reduce the load leaking out of the old buildings.LiNeBrEaKAnd though the owners of those buildings may be zealous recyclers, or contemplating trading in that Camry for a Prius, they may not have the money or the motivation to refit their building in the name of energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaKNo problem: The Energy Efficiency and Productivity Initiative supplies the contractor and the financing, trusting that more often than not the monthly savings on your new energy bill will be greater than the new monthly loan payment.LiNeBrEaK"You have to make it user-friendly. You have to make it turnkey. You have to make it a no-brainer," says Rep.-elect Tim Freeman, R-Roseburg, and he's on board because the folks behind the initiative have done just that.LiNeBrEaKThe financing is a tad too complicated for this introductory column. "My first thought when I saw it: I could have sworn Rube Goldberg was dead," said Jon Chandler, lobbyist for the Oregon Home Builders.LiNeBrEaKBut that financing doesn't require a single general-fund dollar, and Chandler is a big fan. "For my membership, this is huge. It will put a lot of people to work right away. And it's an evolutionary step in getting some energy efficiency paid for."LiNeBrEaKIn theory, the energy initiative won't be dramatically different, Kopel-Bailey said, from calling the Dish Network to modernize your home TV system . . . except that the building owner won't pay the installation fee or higher rates on his monthly bill.LiNeBrEaK"We're creating a package that will put money in people's pockets from Day One," Kopel-Bailey said, and return money to the institutional investors. "Nothing is set in stone . . . but we have all the right people at the table."LiNeBrEaKSteve Duin: 503-221-8597;LiNeBrEaK1320 S.W.

Tampa Tribune (Florida) 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   FINAL EDITION	Automakers May Face New Standards  	CATHERINE DOLINSKI, cdolinski@tampatrib.com  	LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 6  	881 words  	Emissions rules still must be approved by Legislature, regulators.LiNeBrEaKBy CATHERINE DOLINSKILiNeBrEaKcdolinski@tampatrib.comLiNeBrEaKTALLAHASSEE - A vote last week by a state regulatory commission means auto manufacturers may have to revamp the cars and trucks they sell in Florida to meet a tough new emissions standard.LiNeBrEaKDespite pleas from automakers about hard economic times, the Florida Environmental Regulation Commission voted 6-1 to adopt California's tougher emissions standard as proposed by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. State lawmakers and federal regulators will have to approve the new rule for it to take effect as planned in 2013. LiNeBrEaKCar and truck emissions currently account for about 40 percent of greenhouse gases produced in Florida.LiNeBrEaK"We have got to start reducing our greenhouse gases - those are the chemicals that cause global warming," said Eric Draper, lobbyist for the Audubon Society. "If we don't, our cities are going to be under water."LiNeBrEaKThe state standard would expand on new fuel economy regulations expected from the federal government soon. The federal rule would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKBy adopting California's standard, Florida would force manufacturers to reduce emissions from new cars and trucks in Florida by an extra 10 million metric tons by 2020 - the equivalent of taking nearly 1. 1 million vehicles off of the road per year, according to state environment officials.LiNeBrEaKChanges Could Raise PricesLiNeBrEaKAutomakers and dealers warned that the technological changes required to meet the standard will be costly. That, they said, will drive up the cost of vehicles and could reduce the availability of some cars and light trucks in the state.LiNeBrEaKFor some vehicles, the cost might rise $5,000, maybe even up to $9,000, lobbyist Ron Book told the commission.LiNeBrEaKOne of Tallahassee's most powerful lobbyists, Book appeared at the commission's meeting last Tuesday on behalf of AutoNation, the country's largest auto dealer, which is based in Ft. Lauderdale.LiNeBrEaK"Vehicles will go up in price," he said. "I can assure you those light trucks ... that are readily available, and those SUVs that are sought after, will be almost nonexistent in Florida."LiNeBrEaKBut Sole and environmental advocates pointed out that some light trucks and SUVs meet the proposed standard, which will not apply to heavy trucks such as the Ford F-250. Even if the price of a new vehicle rises by several thousand dollars, consumers will reap equal or greater savings in lower fuel costs over the life of the vehicle, they said.LiNeBrEaK"It's unfortunate that the industry has raised some of the issues that it has; I have to admit, I think it harkens back to the '70s, when they said the same thing about the catalytic converter, other environmental initiatives and safety initiatives," Sole said.LiNeBrEaK"What I've personally seen over the years is if you ask the auto industry to achieve a goal, they will achieve it. And you know what - they're going to achieve it at the least cost to them as possible, because that's in their best interests."LiNeBrEaKAuto Industry 'On Their Backs'LiNeBrEaKThe 6-1 commission vote came on the same day that Ford, GM, Toyota and Honda reported drops in sales of more than 30 percent in November alone. America's major carmakers are asking Congress for $34 billion to stabilize their struggling companies, promising to cut back on executive pay, corporate jets and other costs in exchange.LiNeBrEaK"The auto industry - it is no secret - is on their backs," Book said, pleading with the commission not to add more regulation.LiNeBrEaKCharles Territo of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said having to comply with different standards is too burdensome.LiNeBrEaKThat was enough to persuade Commissioner Joe Joyce to cast the lone "no" vote. The modest emissions reduction target of the California standard, he said, did not justify forcing automakers facing tough times to meet different standards for different states.LiNeBrEaKSole acknowledged that the reduction in emissions would be incremental, but said it was nonetheless important.LiNeBrEaK"A 10 million metric ton reduction is something I look forward to doing. We need to achieve that," he said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is hoping to implement its standard next year, but has not yet received the necessary federal waiver. President-elect Barack Obama has already signaled that he is inclined to approve the California rule. Federal law will allow other states to follow suit if California gets its waiver.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, all states are awaiting the new federal fuel economy standard, which would set a minimum of 35 miles per gallon in 2020. Unlike the federal rule, the California standard sets specific requirements for reducing tailpipe gas emissions. Both the federal and state rules include incentives for manufacturers to produce ethanol-burning "flex-fuel" vehicles.LiNeBrEaKSpirited as the debate was before the commission, it is likely to be much tougher next spring when it reaches the conservative Legislature.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to have a hard time with this rule in the Legislature," Draper said. "The car industry is willing to spend millions of dollars on lobbyists, not on research and producing clean cars. I think they'll have an easier time over there."

The federal rule would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKBy adopting California's standard, Florida would force manufacturers to reduce emissions from new cars and trucks in Florida by an extra 10 million metric tons by 2020 -- the equivalent of taking nearly 1. 1 million vehicles off of the road per year, according to state environment officials.LiNeBrEaKChanges Could Raise PricesLiNeBrEaKAutomakers and dealers warned that the technological changes required to meet the standard will be costly. That, they said, will drive up the cost of vehicles and could reduce the availability of some cars and light trucks in the state.LiNeBrEaKFor some vehicles, the cost might rise $5,000, maybe even up to $9,000, lobbyist Ron Book told the commission.LiNeBrEaKOne of Tallahassee's most powerful lobbyists, Book appeared at the commission's meeting last Tuesday on behalf of AutoNation, the country's largest auto dealer, which is based in Ft. Lauderdale.LiNeBrEaK"Vehicles will go up in price," he said. "I can assure you those light trucks ... that are readily available, and those SUVs that are sought after, will be almost nonexistent in Florida."LiNeBrEaKBut Sole and environmental advocates pointed out that some light trucks and SUVs meet the proposed standard, which will not apply to heavy trucks such as the Ford F-250. Even if the price of a new vehicle rises by several thousand dollars, consumers will reap equal or greater savings in lower fuel costs over the life of the vehicle, they said.LiNeBrEaK"It's unfortunate that the industry has raised some of the issues that it has; I have to admit, I think it harkens back to the '70s, when they said the same thing about the catalytic converter, other environmental initiatives and safety initiatives," Sole said.LiNeBrEaK"What I've personally seen over the years is if you ask the auto industry to achieve a goal, they will achieve it. And you know what -- they're going to achieve it at the least cost to them as possible, because that's in their best interests."LiNeBrEaKAuto Industry 'On Their Backs'LiNeBrEaKThe 6-1 commission vote came on the same day that Ford, GM, Toyota and Honda reported drops in sales of more than 30 percent in November alone. America's major carmakers are asking Congress for $34 billion to stabilize their struggling companies, promising to cut back on executive pay, corporate jets and other costs in exchange.LiNeBrEaK"The auto industry -- it is no secret -- is on their backs," Book said, pleading with the commission not to add more regulation.LiNeBrEaKCharles Territo of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers said having to comply with different standards is too burdensome.LiNeBrEaKThat was enough to persuade Commissioner Joe Joyce to cast the lone "no" vote. The modest emissions reduction target of the California standard, he said, did not justify forcing automakers facing tough times to meet different standards for different states.LiNeBrEaKSole acknowledged that the reduction in emissions would be incremental, but said it was nonetheless important.LiNeBrEaK"A 10 million metric ton reduction is something I look forward to doing. We need to achieve that," he said.LiNeBrEaKCalifornia is hoping to implement its standard next year, but has not yet received the necessary federal waiver. President-elect Barack Obama has already signaled that he is inclined to approve the California rule. Federal law will allow other states to follow suit if California gets its waiver.LiNeBrEaKMeanwhile, all states are awaiting the new federal fuel economy standard, which would set a minimum of 35 miles per gallon in 2020. Unlike the federal rule, the California standard sets specific requirements for reducing tailpipe gas emissions. Both the federal and state rules include incentives for manufacturers to produce ethanol-burning "flex-fuel" vehicles.LiNeBrEaKSpirited as the debate was before the commission, it is likely to be much tougher next spring when it reaches the conservative Legislature.LiNeBrEaK"We're going to have a hard time with this rule in the Legislature," Draper said. "The car industry is willing to spend millions of dollars on lobbyists, not on research and producing clean cars. I think they'll have an easier time over there."

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Ski resorts cashing in on thinking green  	Alan Wechsler, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	SPORTS  	1049 words  	Dec. 7--When you think about skiing this year, the color the resorts want you to think about is not white, but green.LiNeBrEaKNot green grass or greenbacks, but green as in environmental consciousness. Like recycling, buying wind power or using snowmaking equipment that requires less energy.LiNeBrEaKSuch "green" activities are not new at ski resorts. But an increased vigilance about global warming has given such practices greater import. LiNeBrEaKAnd public consciousness about the environment has turned "sustainability practices" into something that ski resorts can market.LiNeBrEaK"The economy has changed, the business environment for the resorts has changed," said Jim Van Dyke, vice president of environmental sustainability for Jiminy Peak in Hancock, Mass. "Being green is worthy of people's attention."LiNeBrEaKJiminy Peak is perhaps the "greenest" of any local resort because of the mountain's $3. 9 million wind turbine. The turbine, installed last year, powers up to half the mountain's electricity, and also generates revenue for the business by selling the excess to the electricity grid.LiNeBrEaKOther mountains are taking other steps to limit environmental impact, though some are trying harder than others.LiNeBrEaKAt Vermont's Bromley Mountain, the resort is burning its deep-frying oil in a specialized furnace, which keeps the workshop heated all winter long. It also burns used motor oil from the snow grooming machines.LiNeBrEaKThat means the mountain doesn't have to consume up to 1,000 gallons of fuel oil, said Dustin Gordon, the shop foreman. The resort has also expanded its recycling program, which doesn't sound like a big deal until you take into account the mountain's tiny base lodge. With space at a premium, officials bought garbage cans with built-in recycling bins on top.LiNeBrEaK"It was the only place we could put them -- we don't have any room," said marketing manager Peter Dee.LiNeBrEaKNearby Stratton Mountain just opened a "green-certified" inn, but its policies may not exactly be world-saving -- the hotel uses recycled toilet paper, nontoxic cleaning products and puts recycling bins in every room, among other measures. Still it's a start.LiNeBrEaKIn the Catskills, Belleayre is doing its part by not producing marketing pamphlets this year, instead relying on online advertising (no doubt also a money-saving venture for the state-owned resort during a time of economic crisis). And neighbor Windham is buying wind energy to power three of its lifts. The mountain is also ramping up a recycling program to improve the way it limits waste. And a new private club built at the base lodge was made using timber harvested from a nearby mushroom farm.LiNeBrEaKLike many resorts, Windham has also invested in more efficient snow-making equipment, which use less power and allow the mountain to make snow at warmer temperatures. The fan-based system is also a lot quieter, which makes it possible to make snow without annoying the owners of the expensive weekend homes built around its base area.LiNeBrEaKAlso like many resorts, being environmentally-conscious is not new to Windham. In 1989, the mountain built a compressor system to help power its snowmaking equipment (pressurized air is mixed with water to make snow from nozzles). The heat generated by these giant machines is used to heat the nearby base lodge, saving in heating bills.LiNeBrEaK"We're in this business because we love the outdoors," said general manager Tim Woods. "It's great to save money, but that's not the sole reason for doing these things."LiNeBrEaKAs global warming becomes a front-burner issue, ski resorts have a big stake in the future. It only takes a few degrees difference these days to turn a major snowstorm into just another rain shower.LiNeBrEaKSki resorts have not always been seen in the most environmentally-friendly light. In 1998, environmental extremists burnt down a brand-new mountaintop lodge at the Vail ski resort in Colorado, saying the development was encroaching on wildlife. Several members of the Eugene, Ore.-based Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front were later sent to prison for that and other fires. The fire occurred after Vail had started an expansion project, which protestors said would encroach on nearby lynx habitats. The expansion went on anyway.LiNeBrEaKMore close to home, Killington resort in Vermont came under fire more than a decade ago after purchasing the nearby Pico. Officials had planned to connect the two resorts, but hikers opposed it, saying it would ruin part of the Appalachian Trail, which goes right over the summit. The plan was eventually dropped, although the mountain's new corporate owners say they are still considering it.LiNeBrEaKSki resorts, as an environmentally-conscious industry, get mixed reviews. The companies have a habit of expanding into virgin woods, said Kristina Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club. And running lifts and making snow requires a huge amount of energy.LiNeBrEaKBut on the other hand, most ski resorts are making earnest efforts to cut down on their environmental footprint, she said.LiNeBrEaK"One of the things that has been really exciting to see is the way the ski industry has taken a lead role in energy conservation," she said. "The ski industry has a huge stake in our energy policy and energy conservation. Global warming has the potential to bring the industry to its knees."LiNeBrEaKWhat resorts are doingLiNeBrEaKSki resorts around the region are bragging about the steps they've taken to be more environmentally conscious. Here's a few examples:LiNeBrEaKWindham: Better recycling, more efficient snow guns, reusing heat from compressors to heat base lodge.LiNeBrEaKBelleayre: Not printing promotional pamphlets this year.LiNeBrEaKBromley: Burning used frying oil and motor oil to heat the maintenance workshop.LiNeBrEaKStratton: Just opened a "green-certified" inn with recycling programs and non-toxic cleaning products.LiNeBrEaKJiminy Peak: Continues to generate wind power from its summit turbine.

Tri-City Herald (Kennewick, Washington)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Young students tackle climate issues with LEGOs  	John Trumbo, Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Wash.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	739 words  	Dec. 7--WEST RICHLAND -- LEGOs may not save the planet from global warming, but young minds were challenged to use the toys to make programmable robots perform various climate missions Saturday at the third annual robot competition in the Tri-Cities.LiNeBrEaKEach of the 17 teams of students ages 9-14 huddled around their robot creations at Enterprise Middle School in West Richland to compete in the FIRST LEGO League event. LiNeBrEaKFIRST means "For inspiration and recognition of science and technology."LiNeBrEaKEach team faced up to 13 missions, or challenges, in which their robots had to move various objects around a table top within 2 1/2 minutes.LiNeBrEaKThe tasks included pushing CO2 molecules into the carbon sequestration corner, or placing LEGO levee blocks along a shoreline, erecting a flood barrier or putting money -- represented by a yellow ball -- into research by moving it into a specific area.LiNeBrEaKSix teams will advance to the FIRSTWA State tournament Saturday in Bellevue for being award winners.LiNeBrEaKThey are: Lego Legion, regional directors award, home-schooled students from Burbank; The Tsunami, runner-up regional directors award, a group of student friends from south Richland and Kennewick; EMS RoboCats Team 1, project presentation award, from Enterprise Middle School of West Richland; Granite Group, robot design award, from Liberty Christian in Richland; Acid Rain, teamwork award; and OmniPigFish, robot performance wildcard, a group of student friends from West Richland. Lego Legion won the robot performance award.LiNeBrEaKIt's all about "logic, engineering, precision and teamwork," said Sriram Mythili, coach for a team called The Tsunami, the wave of change.LiNeBrEaKThe six members of The Tsunami team divided the assignment, with girls working on the software to program their robot while the boys did the mechanics, Mythili said.LiNeBrEaKHow well each team designed its robot's functionality as well as the plan to accomplish up to 13 missions determined the winners, said Shawn Brown, a volunteer referee for the competition.LiNeBrEaKEach team starts with the same programmable robot. Team members have to learn how to program the robot as well as design its accessories, such as arms, and what size and configuration to use for the drive wheels.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is to have a robot capable of performing the maximum number of missions in three timed trials.LiNeBrEaKNikki Hudson and Taylor Williams, both eighth-grade students at Sager Middle School in College Place, worked feverishly to keep their team's robot on task. Other members of the team Acid Rain cheered enthusiastically.LiNeBrEaK"I think we did pretty good," said Katelyn Rickords, a seventh-grade student at Sager. She said they designed their robot to be compact so it would be "together and hardy."LiNeBrEaKTop-heavy robots or those not given precise instructions tended to run into things or fall over.LiNeBrEaKRobots were not remote-controlled, but made their moves, turns, lifts and throws according to how they were programmed for each mission.LiNeBrEaK"Most have been working on their presentations since September," said David McKinnon, a co-director of this year's LEGOS Climate Connections.LiNeBrEaKMcKinnon, a computer scientist for Battelle and professor at Washington State University Tri-Cities, said the competition helps youths discover how to use robots and what the capabilities are.LiNeBrEaKTeams were judged in four areas: Project presentation, robot performance, technical design and programming of the robot, and teamwork.LiNeBrEaKJudges' awards were given to three teams: Legorydrz, from Washington State University "Gear Up" program at Stevens Middle School in Pasco, won for spirit, enthusiasm and teamwork; roboBUGS, students from Jefferson Elementary School in Richland, and Team Kill-A-Watt each won rising stars awards.LiNeBrEaKQualifying teams from state competitions will be invited to compete in a world festival event to be held April 16-18 in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.LiNeBrEaKThe competition in the Tri-Cities was sponsored by Battelle Memorial Institute and the Richland Section of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.

Waterloo Courier (Iowa)  	December 7, 2008 Sunday 	Opposition to coal heats up in U.S.  	Jim Offner, Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, Iowa  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1218 words  	Dec. 7--WATERLOO -- Across the United State, opponents of coal-fired energy plants are generating heat of their own. And they're having some success.LiNeBrEaKFor example:LiNeBrEaKThe Environmental Protection Agency recently was blocked from issuing a permit for a proposed plant in Utah without addressing global warming. The move put the fate of a number of proposed coal plants in jeopardy.LiNeBrEaKThe Public Service Commission of Wisconsin rejected a proposal by Wisconsin Power and Light, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy, to expand Nelson Dewey Generating Station in Cassville, Wis.LiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 20, the Environmental Integrity Project reported that the top 50 most-polluting power plants in the U.S. emitted 20 tons of mercury in 2007. While some coal-fired power plants are reporting reductions in such pollution since 2006, most of the worst 50 plants actually increased mercury emissions through 2007, the most recent period for which data is available, according to Environmental Integrity Project. LiNeBrEaKKelley Fuller, spokeswoman for Plains Justice, an opponent of coal power plants based in Vermillion, S.D., reports Iowa has three coal power plant units that are ranked in the top 50 in terms of mercury emitted per gigawatt hour.LiNeBrEaKCoal has long been a touchy subject. Americans are power-hungry, but subject to the caprices of an oil market largely beyond their control. They live on some of the richest coal reserves in the world, but voters also elected a president who promised a commitment to change the nation's energy infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKWhether those factors radiate on the Cedar Valley and surrounding regions remains to be seen. For now, however, the 750-megawatt Elk Run Energy Station slated to go up northeast of Waterloo appears to be on track.LiNeBrEaKElk Run Energy Associates, an arm of LS Power based in New Jersey, filed an application for the plant in June. The move came not long after the Waterloo City Council -- after collecting input from supporters and opponents of the project -- agreed to annex and rezone property along Newell Road east of John Deere's plant.LiNeBrEaKThe Iowa Department of Natural Resources is reviewing hundreds of pages included in the application. After that, agency officials will hold hearings on the $1. 3 billion project.LiNeBrEaKElk Run Energy must show the plant will use the best available technology to control hazardous emissions while utilizing modeling programs to show the exhaust will not cause air quality in the area to deteriorate below acceptable standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.LiNeBrEaK"After we receive the required permits -- and specifically the major permits are the Iowa Utilities Board and air-quality permit from the DNR -- once we have those, we're in a position where we can move forward and start construction," said Mark Milburn, project development manager for Elk Run Energy. "That could be the end of next year."LiNeBrEaKOr longer, he added, if opponents file objections.LiNeBrEaK"If there's any appeals to the permits, or there's litigation, it could get delayed one or two more years," Milburn said.LiNeBrEaKLS Energy says the new Elk Run Energy Station will contribute an estimated $3. 15 million in taxes annually based on 2006 tax rates. It will be a state-of-the-art facility providing enough electricity to power 650,000 homes, the company adds.LiNeBrEaK"This new source of electricity will make the area more attractive to new businesses that may choose to relocate in Black Hawk County," the company said in a prepared statement.LiNeBrEaKThat's not all the plant will add to the community, according to opponents.LiNeBrEaKOn Nov. 25, two nonprofit groups representing Iowa doctors and nurses urged the DNR to take stronger steps to protect public health from fine particulate matter. The substance is also known as PM2. 5, a hazardous air pollutant found in soot from coal-fired power plants.LiNeBrEaKA letter to the DNR on behalf of the Iowa chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Iowa Nurses' Association claimed the agency's existing requirements for coal power plants applicants are not only insufficient to protect the public from fine particulate air pollution, they also do not comply with the Clean Air Act.LiNeBrEaKThe letter goes on to request the DNR apply those required stronger standards before issuing draft air permits for the proposed Interstate Power and Light coal power plant in Marshalltown and the Elk Run Energy Station.LiNeBrEaK"The science continues to unfold about the harmfulness of fine particle pollution," Dr. Maureen McCue of the Iowa chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility wrote in a prepared statement. "We already know that PM2. 5 air pollution poses great risks to our most vulnerable citizens -- children, the elderly and people with heart or lung disease."LiNeBrEaKPat Hemphill Fuller, speaking on behalf of the Iowa Nurses Association, called on the DNR to "do more to control PM2. 5 than it's doing now" before approving any new plants.LiNeBrEaKThe DNR is expected to issue the draft air permit for the Marshalltown coal plant by the end of the year. The permit for LS Power is expected some time in 2009.LiNeBrEaKDon Shatzer, a member of Community Energy Solutions, which opposes the Elk Run Energy project, said lower-cost alternatives to coal exist.LiNeBrEaK"The lowest cost alternative is energy efficiency which can only be achieved through education, smart building and restructuring electric rates to encourage efficiency and conservation," Shatzer said.LiNeBrEaKCosts will come down as the nation focuses on clean-energy sources, such as solar and wind power, Shatzer said.LiNeBrEaK"Like all new technology, once we commit to alternative renewable energy, cost of production will fall and efficiency of the new technologies will increase," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe conversion might be particularly difficult for Iowa, which is more than 80 percent dependent on coal for its electric needs, compared to the national average of 52 percent, Shatzer said.LiNeBrEaK"Iowa rate payers are at great risk of exorbitant rate increases due to our lack of electric generation diversity and the certainty of future carbon regulation," he said.LiNeBrEaKProcuring coal to fire plants is a needless expense in itself, Shatzer said.LiNeBrEaK"Each year Iowa exports millions of dollars from its economy for the purchase of fossil fuels," he said. "By moving to clean alternative renewable energy, we will not only keep that money in our economy, but also add thousands of good jobs."LiNeBrEaKMilburn said the Elk Run plant will meet all environmental standards. He also said the company is working on alternative-fuel plants as part of its strategic planning.LiNeBrEaKFor the moment, though, alternative power sources remain stuff of the future, he said.LiNeBrEaK"When you look at the increasing demand for electricity, it's generally true the demand is increasing and even with renewable performance standards, the increase in supply of renewable energy appears like it cannot keep up with demand," Milburn said.LiNeBrEaKContact Jim Offner at (319) 291-1598 or jim.offner@wcfcourier.com	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (92%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (92%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (92%); POWER PLANTS (91%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (90%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (89%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (78%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); US ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (78%); HEAVY METALS and TOXIC MINERALS (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (77%); ZONING (77%); AIR QUALITY (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (76%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (76%); TOXIC and HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES (75%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (71%); INFRASTRUCTURE (66%); RANKINGS (66%); CITY GOVERNMENT (64%); CITIES (50%)  	ALLIANT ENERGY CORP (57%); WISCONSIN POWER and LIGHT CO (57%)  	US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (84%); ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY PROJECT (83%); PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF WISCONSIN (57%)  	LNT (NYSE) (57%); WIS (AMEX) (57%) NYSE:LNT, NYSE:DE  	NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (57%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (57%) General  	IOWA, USA (94%); WISCONSIN, USA (93%); UTAH, USA (92%); NEW JERSEY, USA (79%); SOUTH DAKOTA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 7, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Waterloo Courier   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (92%)  	20081207-OO-Opposition-to-coal-heats-up-in-U-S-1207  	OO  												
The Washington Post 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   Regional Edition	Making Sense of Science Reporting  	Deborah Howell  	EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. B06  	1466 words  	The job of science reporters is to take complicated subjects and translate them for readers who are not scientifically sophisticated. Critics say that the news media oversimplify and aren't skeptical enough of financing by special interests.LiNeBrEaKThat led me to review papers that are to be published soon as part of a project sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences on how the media cover science and technology, and to interview a half-dozen experts, from scientists to teachers of science writing. Here's my take:LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Look for the evidence. News organizations should give weight to scientific evidence, whether it is about global warming or what the medical establishment says about Lyme disease.LiNeBrEaKPost science reporter David Brown, who is also a physician, talked about this in a recent speech at the University of Iowa. It will be published next year. "In science, there is a natural tension between evidence and opinion, and evidence always wins. What authority figures have to say about anything in science is ultimately irrelevant. Unfortunately, in a lot of science reporting, as in a lot of reporting in general, that isn't the case.'' LiNeBrEaKScience reporters should give readers enough information to judge "the strength of a claim" and report "how the news fits into what's already known about the subject," Brown said. "It isn't always easy to boil down research findings to a few numbers that capture the essence" of a study. "Sometimes it can't be done or can't be done on deadline," he said. So follow-ups are important.LiNeBrEaKBrown recommends noticing how much space in an article is devoted to describing the evidence of the newsworthiness of the story and how much is devoted to someone telling you what to think about it. "If there isn't enough information to give you, the reader, a fighting chance to decide for yourself whether something is important, then somebody isn't doing his job, or hers."LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Look for context. Are the results preliminary? Does the research conflict with or confirm earlier work? Has it been published in a reputable science journal or been presented at a science meeting?LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Look beyond the lead paragraph and headline. Remember that antioxidants were touted to prevent all sorts of disease; research proved that not to be true. One recent Page 1 story, by veteran Post science reporter Rob Stein, attracted comment and criticism. Stein wrote that a study produced "powerful evidence" that a blood test designed to monitor inflammation could identify "seemingly healthy people who are at increased risk for a heart attack or stroke" and that a widely used statin drug offered "potent protection against the nation's leading killers." The story quoted the study's author and other prominent experts as calling the findings a "breakthrough," a "blockbuster" and "absolutely paradigm-shifting."LiNeBrEaKThe Foundation for Integrative AIDS Research (FIAR) -- which has a stake in the issue because AIDS drugs can raise "bad" cholesterol levels -- said stories about the study reflected "shoddy boosterism for the pharmaceutical industry rather than a careful and balanced analysis."LiNeBrEaKFIAR Director George M. Carter's chief complaint was that stories emphasized a change in "relative risk" -- a 44 percent fall in the number of heart attacks, strokes and surgical procedures among people taking the statin, compared with those in the placebo group. He said the fact that everyone in the study had an extremely low "absolute risk" for heart problems should have been emphasized more. About 1. 36 percent of people taking the placebo suffered a heart attack or stroke; that fell to 0. 8 percent among those taking the statin. That means that nearly 97  percent of the people using the drug would not see any benefit, he said.LiNeBrEaKStein quoted a skeptic in the ninth paragraph and noted near the story's end that "the actual risk reduction for an individual would be very small, given the relatively low risk for most middle-age people, so that the benefits easily could be outweighed by the costs of thousands more people taking tests, drugs and being monitored by doctors."LiNeBrEaKStein said, "While I would have liked to have explored many of the nuances of this study more fully, I feel confident we struck a responsible balance. I think it's crucial to provide readers with both the evidence supporting new claims and enough context and interpretation to help them gauge its significance." Independent experts, he said, concluded the study was "a very well done, very convincing piece of research."LiNeBrEaKOne of the issues in science reporting is that most readers aren't schooled in statistics. Harold Varmus, former director of the National Institutes of Health, recommends looking more deeply into the numbers. "The percentages may be high, but what is the risk of an event in the first place? If the risk is low, there's a much smaller benefit." Varmus, a Nobel laureate, is chief executive of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.LiNeBrEaKMarcia Angell, a physician and former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine who is now a senior lecturer at Harvard Medical School, said journalists can write "overly dramatic" stories for "gullible" readers. "Everyone has an interest in hyping news of medical research -- the researcher, the institution, reporters. Readers should be very skeptical of new findings. Newspapers are in the business of telling you the news, which needs to be startling or counterintuitive or flies in the face of what we knew. By definition these stories are less likely to be accurate."LiNeBrEaKDon J. Melnick, professor of conservation biology at Columbia University, said that if a story "doesn't sound newsworthy or front page-worthy, it will be buried or not printed at all. That tends to promote people hyping the research. They have to convince their editors to put it in the paper."LiNeBrEaKNils Bruzelius, The Post's science editor, said, "I thought the story and Page 1 play were justified because the potential impact was significant, even as I understand the criticisms. There's an inevitable tension between the desire of reporters and editors to get good play for their stories and the need to avoid hype or overstatement, and we feel this very acutely in dealing with scientific or medical stories, because the advances, even those that prove to be part of something very big, usually come in incremental steps. I've long believed that science and medical stories enter this competition at some disadvantage. I certainly don't have data on this but I suspect that most of the top editors who make the front-page decisions tend to be less drawn to these topics than the average reader because, with a few exceptions, they are a naturally self-selected group who got to where they are by dint of their interest and ability in covering such topics as politics, international relations, war and national security -- not science."LiNeBrEaK&Acirc;&middot; Who sponsored the research and who makes money from its findings? Angell, a critic of drug companies' influence on medical research, said, "The caveats are at the end [of the story]. The pharmaceutical industry is spreading money everywhere and the researchers have their hands out."LiNeBrEaKThat was true of the statin story. In the last six paragraphs, readers learned that the study was financed by AstraZeneca, which makes the statin Crestor, and that the study's author and his hospital will receive royalties on the blood test that was studied. Drugmakers fund many large medical studies. The story said that the company had no influence over the analysis.LiNeBrEaKVarmus said there is no mechanism for support or motivation to conduct clinical trials without drug industry money. "Obviously, companies have a vested interest in a good outcome and being truthful and getting answers that won't cause them grief later on," he said. Such trials also must follow Food and Drug Administration regulations.LiNeBrEaK"It's not new that the industry is the primary source of funding clinical research," Angell said. "What is new is the strings attached and the willingness of medical schools and faculty to accept these strings. They have influence over every detail of clinical trials."LiNeBrEaKJonathan Weiner, who teaches science writing at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said, "It's a very messy, complicated problem. With government funding tight, many doctors rely on industry for funding. People in research medicine can't stay current without going to industry-funded conferences that have the quality of junkets." Weiner wrote "The Beak of the Finch," a book about evolutionary biology that won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 1995.LiNeBrEaKFor readers, Brown's best advice is this: "In the end, all that counts is evidence."

The Washington Post 	December 7, 2008 Sunday   Bulldog Edition	China Is Growing Its Own Biotech Revolution;  Hunger Issues Prompt Genetics Research 	Elaine Kurtenbach; Associated Press  	A-SECTION; Pg. A18  	1270 words  	Zeng Yawen's outdoor laboratory in the terraced hills of southern China is a trove of genetic potential:  rice that thrives in unusually cool temperatures, high altitudes or in dry soil; rice rich in calcium, vitamins or iron.LiNeBrEaK"See these plants? They can tolerate the cold," Zeng says as he walks through a checkerboard of test fields sown with different rice varieties on the outskirts of Kunming, capital of southwestern China's Yunnan province.LiNeBrEaK"We can extract the cold-tolerant gene from this plant and use it in a genetically manipulated variety to improve its cold tolerance," Zeng says.LiNeBrEaKIn a mountainous place  such as Yunnan and in many other parts of the developing world, such advantages can tip the balance between hunger and a decent living. China is now ready to tip that scale in favor of genetically modified crops. LiNeBrEaKSurging costs, population growth, and drought and other setbacks linked to global climate change are pressuring world food supplies, while soaring prices on the street have triggered riots and raised the number of people going hungry to more than 923 million, according to estimates by the United Nations.LiNeBrEaKWith food demand forecast to increase by half by 2030, the incentive to use genetic engineering to boost harvests and protect precious crops from insects and other damage has never been greater.LiNeBrEaKIn Europe, Africa and Asia, some governments that have resisted imports of genetically modified foods and have banned growing such crops are loosening those restrictions. Meanwhile, they are pushing ahead faster with their own research, despite lingering questions over the safety of such technology.LiNeBrEaK"Influential voices around the world are calling for a reexamination of the G.M. debate," says C.S. Prakash, a professor of plant molecular genetics at Alabama's Tuskegee University. "Biotechnology provides such tools to help address food sustainability issues."LiNeBrEaKGenetic manipulation to insert desirable genes or accelerate changes that were traditionally achieved through crossbreeding can help make crops resistant to insects and disease or enable them to tolerate herbicides. Livestock similarly can be altered by inserting a gene from one animal into the DNA of another.LiNeBrEaKMany researchers think that such methods are essential for a second "green revolution," now that the gains from the first, in the mid-20th century, are tapering off.LiNeBrEaKBioengineered crops are widely grown in Canada, Argentina and the United States, where nearly all soybeans, most cotton and a growing proportion of corn are designed for tolerance to herbicides or resistance to insects. A virus-resistant  and genetically modified variety of papaya is commercially grown in Hawaii and China.LiNeBrEaKBiotechnology is bound to play an important role in the agriculture of the future, Robert Zeigler, director of the International Rice Research Institute, said at IRRI's headquarters near Manila.LiNeBrEaKSuch crops "bring tremendous power and advantages to producers and consumers," Zeigler said, noting the potential savings from reduced use of farm chemicals and of fuel for the tractors to spread them.LiNeBrEaKAfter delaying the long-expected commercialization of genetically modified grains for years, China's leaders in July endorsed a 13-year, $2. 9 billion program to promote use of genetically altered crops and livestock. Beijing is on the verge of releasing an insect-resistant rice variety, Zeigler said.LiNeBrEaKChinese Premier Wen Jiabao is a champion of the new agriculture.LiNeBrEaK"I strongly advocate making great efforts to pursue transgenic engineering. The recent food shortages around the world have further strengthened that belief," Wen recently told Science magazine.LiNeBrEaKHe praised the benefits -- higher farm incomes and reduced use of pesticides -- from widespread use of Bt cotton, engineered to prevent bollworm infestations.LiNeBrEaKThe trend extends beyond China: Worldwide cultivation of bioengineered crops has expanded by more than 10 percent a year for a decade, although by 2007, it still had reached only 282 million acres, an area about the size of Cuba, in 22 countries.LiNeBrEaKVietnam is pushing ahead with an ambitious program to develop commercial genetically modified crops to reduce reliance on imports. In May, South Korea, which already imports  genetically modified soybeans, began importing bioengineered corn to help bridge shortfalls of conventional corn after China began limiting its exports.LiNeBrEaKLast month, Brazil's National Biosafety Commission approved two new varieties of genetically modified corn seeds, after allowing genetically modified varieties of soybeans two years ago. India has followed China's example, tripling acreage of  genetically modified cotton, the only bioengineered crop it allows.LiNeBrEaKIn Africa, where governments have sometimes rejected food aid shipments containing  genetically modified grains, South African scientists have completed field tests of a potato developed to fend off tuber moths. They also recently approved trials of sorghum genetically enhanced to improve the digestibility and nutritional content of the coarse grain, which thrives in arid soils.LiNeBrEaKEuropean countries face growing pressure, under World Trade Organization rules, to open their markets to genetically modified products. Many among the EU's 27 member nations remain wary and, backed by consumers opposed to what some call "Franken-foods," are fighting to keep genetically altered crops out of their fields and supermarkets.LiNeBrEaK"Why should we change what nature has given us, when it is everything we need?" asked Filippo De Angelis, selling newspapers at a kiosk in Rome. "I don't think we can solve the problem of world hunger through genetics."LiNeBrEaKEven in China, despite its investments in the research, few are familiar with genetic modification. Some who have heard of it remain cautious.LiNeBrEaK"It's impossible to know if it's harmful to the body," said Zheng Wencai, a retired architect in Kunming shopping for soybeans in a downtown market. "There is still a global debate on this. So basically, I don't use it."LiNeBrEaKBesides papayas, China allows farmers to grow  genetically modified varieties of green peppers and tomatoes, along with several nonfood crops. Genetically modified rice and wheat are still in field tests.LiNeBrEaKThose test facilities are kept under high security, both to prevent contamination of traditional crops and to protect the country's own  biotechnology. Beijing seems determined not to cede its potentially huge local markets to big agribusinesses like the U.S. company Monsanto and Switzerland's Sygenta AG.LiNeBrEaK"In general, the government has a very positive view toward  G.M. technology and its products," says Lu Baorong, a member of the National Biosafety Committee, whose desk at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University was piled with  genetically modified rice seed samples to be tested on Hainan, a tropical southern island.LiNeBrEaK"Since China is a big country and we have so many people to feed, to have our own technology and guarantee food security is very important," Lu said.LiNeBrEaKHe  would not speculate on a timeline for commercial approvals of genetically engineered rice.LiNeBrEaKUltimately, widespread cultivation of such crops will depend on work done at IRRI and by researchers such as Zeng, who have spent years painstakingly searching for traits that might unlock the secrets to future abundance.LiNeBrEaKZeng views genetic engineering as one of many strategies, including irrigation and soil improvements and better farm management, needed to increase productivity to ensure future generations will have enough to eat.LiNeBrEaK"Without all these, it will be very hard to boost output further. There will be breakthroughs, but it will be very hard," he said.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Expectations low for climate-change talks in Poland  	Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	866 words  	Dec. 6--As the world gathers in Poznan, Poland to map out the future of efforts to combat global warming, the lack of progress has become a concern for developing nations in Asia, where growth hinges in part on the outcome.LiNeBrEaKThe Poznan summit, which opened on Monday and runs until Dec 12 is the halfway mark in a two-year process that was launched in Bali last year. However, the outcome is unlikely to be any more substantial than the results of preliminary talks held in Bangkok in April and Bonn, Germany in June this year. LiNeBrEaKThailand, unfortunately, is not represented at the talks of the 192-member UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its delegates were unable to leave the country because of the seizure of the capital's airports by anti-government protesters.LiNeBrEaKExpectations are low in Poznan, partly because so many countries are preoccupied with the spreading global economic downturn. But the urgency of global warming issues means that some movement is expected by the next big meeting in 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.LiNeBrEaKTalks in the Polish city are further complicated by a dispute within the European Union over how to distribute fresh cuts in emissions that scientists say are warming the Earth.LiNeBrEaKThe two-week conference is meant to put rich and poorer countries on track for an agreement that leaders can approve in December 2009 in Denmark, replacing the Kyoto Protocol, which covered only developed nations and expires in 2012.LiNeBrEaKYvo de Boer, the UN's top climate official, urged delegates to send a "strong political signal" while appealing to countries not to use the global economic downturn as an excuse to stick with "cheap and dirty" technologies.LiNeBrEaKDanish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen expressed confidence that the financial crisis would subside, but said climate change would remain a problem in the years ahead.LiNeBrEaK"We must agree to reduce global CO2 emissions by 50 percent in 2050. And we must agree on a mid-term reduction goal by 2020. The EU countries are ready to reduce emissions by 30 percent in 2020 as part of a global agreement," Mr Rasmussen was quoted as saying in the Jakarta Post.LiNeBrEaKThe key, though, is how rich nations can provide clean technology and financing to help poor and emerging countries lower their emissions -- mainly carbon dioxide created when fossil fuels are burned.LiNeBrEaKAt the heart of the debate will be developing nations such as China, which by some calculations has overtaken the United States as the biggest greenhouse-gas emitter. Beijing maintains that developed countries must take the lead in cutting emissions.LiNeBrEaKBut Washington is unlikely to join any binding cuts unless fast-growing economies such as China and India are included in the deal. The US never ratified the 1997 treaty signed in Kyoto, in part because the pact failed to set limits for big developing nations.LiNeBrEaKBut with the election of Barack Obama, there is some sign that Washington's stance may change as he has pledged to re-engage his country in climate talks.LiNeBrEaKBut with US policy now heavily focused on the domestic economy, the likelihood that President-elect Obama and his administration will focus much on climate change issues looks slim.LiNeBrEaKHowever, there has been talk of an Obama administration delivering a "Green New Deal" -- including "green" jobs -- a financial stimulus package that tackles both climate change and the economic crisis.LiNeBrEaKSo far nothing has emerged from Washington, and any deal is likely to concentrate on domestic policy, leaving international policy at a low-priority status.LiNeBrEaKThe EU for its part is seeking to spur action by the rest of the world. It has pledged to cut its carbon-dioxide emissions to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of whether other powers follow suit.LiNeBrEaKBut the 27-nation bloc is split over its own plans, with Italy and ex-communist nations in Eastern Europe baulking at details of an EU plan to auction pollution permits, which they say will make energy too expensive.LiNeBrEaKThe latest UN data show that emissions of greenhouse gases rose between 2000 and 2006, with fast-developing emerging nations leading the way.LiNeBrEaKIn a landmark series of reports last year, a UN blue-ribbon panel of scientists concluded that the world faces an average temperature rise of about three degrees Celsius this century if emissions continue to rise at the current pace.LiNeBrEaKIf that happens, climate changes would likely be more dramatic than in the 20th century, the panel said.LiNeBrEaKFor emerging economies, the key principle at stake is whether they should offset their continued economic growth, which is helping to lift millions out of poverty, with concerns for the environment.LiNeBrEaKDeveloping nations will continue to push for cuts from the developed nations -- including the US -- before they act to cut back on their own emissions.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Emissions trading makes sound economic sense to developing states  	Umesh Pandey, Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	813 words  	Dec. 6--Asia has become the hotbed for clean development mechanism (CDM) projects that are playing an increasing role in helping the world come to grips with climate change.LiNeBrEaKTo date about 65 percent or 774 out of 1,186 CDM projects registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have originated in Asia. The pace shows no sign of slowing despite the current economic difficulties.LiNeBrEaK"Across Asia, nations are gearing up to tap into the growth opportunities," said Michael Dreyer, the vice-president for Asia-Pacific of Koelnmesse, which staged Carbon Forum Asia in Singapore last month. LiNeBrEaK"Australia is establishing its own trading scheme, Japan recently announced that it would introduce a voluntary carbon market, and in China (where 73 percent of the CDM transactions took place), foreign investors are helping to speed up the installation of pollution-reduction technology by purchasing CER (carbon emission reduction) credits from the country's thriving carbon market."LiNeBrEaKThe enthusiasm was evident at Carbon Forum Asia, which witnessed a fourfold increase from the previous event in the number of projects being offered by more than 60 developers.LiNeBrEaKWorld Bank figures show that the international emissions trading market last year was worth 47 billion. Asia accounting for about 80 percent of the overall CER credits traded and China for nearly half of the Asian total. Asia's CDM market grew by nearly 200 percent in 2006 and 2007, the World Bank said.LiNeBrEaKThis year's Carbon Forum Asia programme featured more than 1,000 participants from 60 countries and 100 exhibitors from 30 countries, including new participants Armenia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Korea, Laos, Pakistan, China, and Thailand.LiNeBrEaKThailand along with Laos, Pakistan, Indonesia and India joined the trade show for the first time, alongside heavyweights such as China and India.LiNeBrEaKMr Dreyer says the current trade of CERs in Asia represents about 80 percent of all preliminary CERs traded in the international market. China and India lead the pack with 640 CDM projects, while Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines are not too far behind.LiNeBrEaK"For a long time, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has dominated the global carbon market. This is set to change," said Henry Derwent, president and CEO of the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA).LiNeBrEaK"With Australia and New Zealand en route to establishing their own trading scheme, and with trading of one sort or another being proposed in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, parts of China and even India, Asia's prominence in the global carbon market is certain.LiNeBrEaKThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports Carbon Forum Asia because it is "an excellent platform in Asia on which to showcase the Asian sellers in the CDM market", said Josh Carmody, an ADB manager.LiNeBrEaK"The predicted rate of growth in energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for the Asian region is staggering," he said.LiNeBrEaKBecause the world depends on reducing emissions in Asia, particularly those associated with energy, the ADB is working with developing countries to build their capacities.LiNeBrEaKIt has been looking to increase trading of CERs and CDMs in the region and has established various funds over the past few months to promote the goal.LiNeBrEaK"We see Carbon Forum Asia as an excellent way for ADB to help scale up the carbon market opportunities in the region," said Mr Carmody.LiNeBrEaK"We are sponsoring more than 60 of the projects that are present here and most are in the energy-related business," he said "But for greater success than what we see right now, what is needed is considerable support from the various governments to reduce emissions."LiNeBrEaKThe ADB is now looking to establish a fund that would help countries in the region until 2020. It hopes to be able to finance as much as $2 billion worth of transactions in 2009 against $1. 8 billion estimated this year.LiNeBrEaKBut with the global markets going south, fears are that during the short term the prices of carbon credits may head down. In Japan, CER prices have fallen by 50 percent over the past few months.LiNeBrEaKFumio Hoshi, executive director of the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) said that it too had been helping various companies to get carbon credits and at times even providing equity financing to them.LiNeBrEaK"Despite the hindrance caused by the financial crisis, we cannot take a step back and instead we have to look at ways to move forward on the path we are following," he said.

Bangkok Post (Thailand)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Minister says island state well positioned to drive Asia's green initiatives  	Umesh Pandey, Bangkok Post, Thailand  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	964 words  	Dec. 6--The rapid increase in carbon trading in Asia is an opportunity for Singapore to become a hub for trading activities, says a senior official.LiNeBrEaK"Within Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, China and India will be key originators of CDM projects. Singapore is well-placed geographically to serve as a bridge to bring these projects to fruition," said S. Iswaran, the senior minister of state for trade and industry.LiNeBrEaK"Singapore is committed to growing our carbon services cluster, and to serve as a regional carbon price discovery centre and trading hub. Our established legal, regulatory and financial institutions, business-friendly environment, and modern infrastructure and communications, are conducive to this endeavour." LiNeBrEaKTo encourage the sector, concessionary tax rates have been available since last year to companies involved in emissions trading under the International Enterprise Singapore Global Trader Programme. As well, there are plans to set up the Singapore Mercantile Exchange to trade derivatives in commodities, including futures contracts in energy and carbon credits, deepening the commodity trading and risk management infrastructure.LiNeBrEaKApart from this, he said, support for international events such as Carbon Forum Asia and the recently concluded Singapore Energy Conference were aimed at consolidating Singapore's role.LiNeBrEaKMr Iswaran said Singapore aimed to attract a vibrant cluster of companies and organisations across the carbon value chain, including project consultants and developers, financial and legal service providers, RandD and educational institutions, traders and fund managers.LiNeBrEaKSingapore-based companies will also benefit by becoming able to undertake emission reduction projects. Currently, Singapore has four Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects awaiting UN approval, with carbon credits potentially worth $235S million. Several more are in the pipeline.LiNeBrEaKMr Iswaran believes that Asia is also poised to be the largest supplier of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) to the global carbon market. According to the UNFCCC, more than 65 percent of registered CDM projects originated from the Asia-Pacific region as of November 2008. While China and India remain the world's largest suppliers, the rest of Asia also has immense potential.LiNeBrEaKMany Southeast Asian projects are in the pipeline, but on a relatively small scale. These include biofuel and biogas ventures in Malaysia and Indonesia, hydroelectric projects in Vietnam, and waste-water projects from Cambodia.LiNeBrEaKThese projects will yield large volumes of CER trades and potential CO2 savings from Asia.LiNeBrEaKIt is imperative that Asia succeed in this endeavour. Current models predict that Asia will contribute up to 45 percent of all worldwide emissions by 2050, while those from OECD countries will drop to half of Asia's.LiNeBrEaK"Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions ... is an objective valid even through the economic downturn," he said, stressing that tackling global warming required a long-term outlook and a poor economy was not an excuse to remain idle.LiNeBrEaK"If you look at it another way, an economic downturn is the right time to look at these issues, as it is positioning your business for the next upturn."LiNeBrEaKCarbon markets are seen as an effective way to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide. Carbon credit projects are regulated by the UN through the CDM programme set up under the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKOne credit is one less tonne of carbon dioxide emissions produced. The credits are then traded and bought by firms, normally from Europe, which have to comply with Kyoto reduction targets on greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKClimate change was one of the biggest global challenges facing the world in this millennium. The UN Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says evidence of global warming is "unequivocal", and that it will have a far-reaching impact on sea levels, disasters, biodiversity, agriculture and water resources, and on our lifestyles and those of our children, he said.LiNeBrEaKCountries that are members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are now engaged in complex negotiations to develop a global system for long-term co-operative action on climate change. The process started in Bali last year and is continuing in Poznan, Poland this week, with a conclusion expected at a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark at the end of 2009.LiNeBrEaKMr Iswaran acknowledged that governments now have to deal with compelling domestic imperatives and this may adversely affect the progress of climate change negotiations. But CO2 emissions are a "global commons" problem with serious cumulative consequences if left unabated.LiNeBrEaK"But, even as we build carbon markets, let us not lose sight of the imperatives that underpin emissions trading," he said.LiNeBrEaK"First, the purpose of emissions trading must be to drive emissions reductions in order to address climate change, and to optimise the allocation of carbon across sectors and countries.LiNeBrEaK"Second, the price discovery mechanism is equally important as it helps governments and industry factor in the cost of the carbon externality in decision-making.LiNeBrEaK"Third, this has been a useful means for developed countries to supplement their domestic mitigation actions and achieve their Kyoto Protocol targets.LiNeBrEaK"The prospect of carbon revenue streams will also motivate industries in developing countries to adopt less carbon-intensive processes."

The Boston Globe 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   THIRD EDITION	New US military report on global warming raises worry Calls theories on the cause `contradictory'  	Bryan Bender Globe Staff  	NATIONAL; Pg. A6  	726 words  	WASHINGTON - A new US military report has come under scrutiny for asserting that the scientific data on what is causing global warming is "contradictory" - a position one leading specialist said indicates the government still hasn't fully embraced the urgency of climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe long-range planning document, published Thursday by the US Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., which is responsible for developing blueprints for future military strategy, is intended to provide a "basis for thinking about the world a quarter of a century from now." LiNeBrEaKBut a section of the 56-page report on climate change and natural disasters prompted criticism yesterday from some leading specialists who said that spreading the inaccurate perception that the causes of climate change remain an open question could result in government agencies not taking the issue seriously enough.LiNeBrEaKThe report, titled Joint Operating Environment 2008, states that "the impact of global warming and its potential to cause natural disasters and other harmful phenomena such as rising sea levels has become a prominent - and controversial - national and international concern. Some argue that there will be more and greater storms and natural disasters, others that there will be fewer."LiNeBrEaKIt adds: "In many respects, scientific conclusions about the causes and potential effects of global warming are contradictory."LiNeBrEaKThat last line in particular was singled out at a panel discussion hosted yesterday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, on the topic of climate change and national security.LiNeBrEaKSharon Burke, a former Pentagon and State Department official who is now a specialist at the Center for a New American Security, said the report was factually "wrong" and "out of line," saying that there is a wide consensus that human activity, namely the production of greenhouse gases, is responsible for global warming.LiNeBrEaKOther specialists had similar reactions when they read the report.LiNeBrEaK"It's very wrong," said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose work was cited in the military report. "The jury is not out" on what is causing global warming, he added. "I don't know where that statement came from, but it's pretty bizarre."LiNeBrEaKEmanuel also took issue with the report's assertions about future storm intensity.LiNeBrEaK"Everyone pretty much agrees that the intensity of events could go up with global warming, although we argue how much," he said in an interview.LiNeBrEaKThe Joint Forces Command maintains that it is fully cognizant of the threat posed by climate change, saying the purpose of the report was not to debate what is or isn't causing global warming.LiNeBrEaK"We are in complete agreement that climate change will be a national security driver in the future," said Rear Admiral John M. Richardson, director of strategy for the command. "We are focused on the implications of climate change. We see what is happening. What is causing it is not in our purview. The commanders have to deal with the effects."LiNeBrEaKHe added in an interview yesterday: "Don't take away that we think it is any less important."LiNeBrEaKAt yesterday's conference, specialists agreed that the cascading effects of global warming - including drought, flooding, population flows, and disease epidemics - present the United States and other countries with enormous security threats in the years ahead - warnings that have been echoed by recent Pentagon reports and intelligence assessments.LiNeBrEaKRonald Sugar, the CEO of Northrop Grumman, one of the nation's leading defense companies, spoke of the need for private industry and the government to begin the difficult task of bridging the enormous knowledge base about what is happening to the earth's climate to development of technical solutions that can help repair it.LiNeBrEaK"We have to build something that does not exist," Sugar said.LiNeBrEaKBut Burke said in a follow-up interview that it remains worrisome that some in the military command responsible for helping prepare for future dangers still appear to question the science of why global warming is occurring. She believes there are many in the government who still don't fully embrace it. That makes it far more difficult for the leadership necessary to move the country to make the enormous changes necessary, she said.

The Charlotte Observer (North Carolina)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	BofA ending its ties to mountaintop removal: Bank says it's curbing the financing of coal companies that use the mining method.  	Bruce Henderson, The Charlotte Observer, N.C.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	298 words  	Dec. 6--Bank of America will phase out financing of coal companies that mine largely by removing Appalachian mountaintops, a practice under growing pressure for its environmental damage. LiNeBrEaKLast year, the bank announced a $20 billion initiative to curb energy use and develop new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe Rainforest Action Network, an advocacy group, had pressed Bank of America and another banking giant, Citi, since October 2007 to break ties to practices the group deemed environmentally harmful. The group links Bank of America to eight coal companies that engage in mountaintop mining, a number bank spokeswoman Colleen Haggerty would not confirm.LiNeBrEaKThe bank quietly posted its new policy online last week, following what it called ongoing talks with coal companies, environmental groups and others.LiNeBrEaKHaggerty said the bank will honor existing financing commitments.LiNeBrEaKThe Rainforest group criticized Bank of America's support of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, saying that capability is unproven. The bank addressed carbon capture in the coal policy posted last week.LiNeBrEaK"But obviously we're pleased that Bank of America has taken this step to curtail financing for mountaintop removal, because that's pretty much the worst of coal extraction," said spokesman Sam Haswell.

The Columbus Dispatch (Ohio) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   Home Final Edition	COAL-TO-FUEL PLANT;  Company set to start building in spring 	Spencer Hunt, THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH  	NEWS; Pg. 05B  	263 words  	The foundering economy, falling oil prices and opposition from environmental groups won't derail a proposed $6 billion plant along the Ohio River that would turn coal into diesel and jet fuel, supporters say. LiNeBrEaKBaard Energy of Vancouver, Wash., hopes to break ground in April or May near Wellsville in Columbiana County, company officials said yesterday. On Nov. 20, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency approved an air-pollution permit for the plant, the last permit the plant needed.LiNeBrEaKIn late October, another company canceled plans for a similar project in West Virginia because of trouble securing financing. Prices for crude oil also have dropped from more than $100 a barrel to $40 a barrel.LiNeBrEaKBaard believes it can make money on coal-based fuel if prices stay above $35 a barrel.LiNeBrEaKThe project is being challenged by the Natural Resources Defense Council, which says the plant will annually produce millions of tons of carbon dioxide, a gas that contributes to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"It's a climate-change disaster," said Josh Mogerman, a defense council spokesman.LiNeBrEaKBaard Energy Chief Executive Officer John Baardson said the plant's financing is based on the expected price of oil in 2013, when the plant should begin production. That price is about $85 a barrel.LiNeBrEaKWhen fully built, the plant will consume 7 million tons of coal a year to help produce an alternative diesel and jet fuel, priced to compete with oil-based fuels. The plant would produce up to 53,000 barrels of fuel a day, Baardson said, and be equipped to capture up to 85 percent of its carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKshunt@dispatch.com	OIL and GAS PRICES (91%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (90%); DIESEL FUEL (90%); JET FUEL (90%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); CRUDE OIL PRICES (78%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (78%); CRUDE OIL MARKETS (78%); AIR POLLUTION (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS (78%); COAL PRODUCTION STATISTICS (77%); ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS (76%); APPROVALS (73%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (73%); GLOBAL WARMING (67%)  		US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (57%); NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL (56%)  			COLUMBUS, OH, USA (58%) WASHINGTON, USA (92%); OHIO, USA (92%); WEST VIRGINIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 6, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Columbus Dispatch All Rights Reserved  																
Hickory Daily Record (North Carolina)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	OPINION: Going green necessary, expensive and frustrating  	Larry Clark, Hickory Daily Record, N.C.  	COMMENTARY  	789 words  	Dec. 6--The green movement began several decades ago and quickly became a political football.LiNeBrEaKConservation was a common practice, but environmentalism took conservation to another level, with critics -- scientists among them -- warning of ecological destruction.LiNeBrEaKDetractors passed off warnings as pseudo-science and flat-out misguided day-dreaming. LiNeBrEaKAn uncle put in his two-cents' worth this way: "Stick your head in a smokestack and see if you like it," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe difficult job of balancing a technological/industrial civilization with the need to be kind to nature was brought into focus.LiNeBrEaKSome writers predicted we would be living in cities enclosed with giant bubbles because of ecological destruction. Others opined humanity would have to find another planet to survive.LiNeBrEaKAnd many people said the whole environmental movement was a hoax, that the Earth would take care of itself and climatic changes and physical phenomena were purely cyclic.LiNeBrEaKNothing to worry about.LiNeBrEaKThe oil embargo of the early 1970s rekindled examination of a fossil-fueled society.LiNeBrEaKThe balance between necessities and nature was still an issue, but most people looked to technocrats and government for solutions.LiNeBrEaKNow, we're at it again, with Earth-friendly development at the top of to-do lists, and the naysayers asserting that society is being hoodwinked by environmentalism.LiNeBrEaKI recognize the reality of a mechanized, energy-eating population. I burn my share of fossil fuels, no doubt.LiNeBrEaKI still worry about the future of our Earth, and I'm frustrated at the cost of reducing energy consumption.LiNeBrEaKHere are a few quotes about our environment, just for the sake of conversation:LiNeBrEaK"Plant damage has been caused by sulfur dioxide ... virtually all of the principal types of agricultural crops have suffered important damage from air pollution."LiNeBrEaK"It is harder to breathe when the air is polluted."LiNeBrEaK"It had been has been said for decades that we knew far more about the dynamics and intimate nature of nuclear fission that we knew about combustion."LiNeBrEaK"The American Medical Association drafted a statement ... which called air pollution 'one of our most serious environmental health problems.'"LiNeBrEaKA president "called for the Public Health Service to engage in a more intensive research program, to provide financial stimulation for states and local air pollution control agencies to initiate or improve their control programs, and to ... abate interstate air pollution."LiNeBrEaK"Vehicle manufacturers stand ready to pass on the benefit of ... extensive research ... vehicle manufacturers, given sufficient time, can do the job." Testimony from the Automobile Manufacturers Association to Congress.LiNeBrEaK"Traditionally, the nation has dealt with environmental hazards ... as a reaction to crisis. Only when an environmental hazard becomes menacing do we attempt to eliminate or control it. This pattern of environmental protection has failed us."LiNeBrEaK"Mankind has lit the fuse of the environmental bomb. It is not a question of whether or not it will explode, but only a matter of how fast." David M. Gates, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden.LiNeBrEaKThe president in the above quotes was John Kennedy. The congressional testimony came as Lyndon Johnson served out Kennedy's unexpired term.LiNeBrEaKAll the quotes are from "Terracide," a book by Ron M. Linton, published in 1970. Linton worked with the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the Johnson administration. One of his most ardent supporters was Sen. Edmund Muskie.LiNeBrEaKWe have made significant strides in pollution control, but the war has not been won. Now, environmental danger has a new name: Global warming, and car exhaust lurks among the gremlins.LiNeBrEaKI would increase my contribution to a cleaner environment by driving a vehicle like the Tesla all-electric supercar, but the cost is prohibitive.LiNeBrEaKI do wonder why we can't use turning wheels, shafts and axles in our vehicles to operate generators to provide a substantial source of electric power.LiNeBrEaKI depend on my car. I depend on electricity and fossil fuel to illuminate my house and deliver the goods to supermarket and shopping center. I love the outdoors, but I am thoroughly civilized.LiNeBrEaKI can't help but think that if Linton and other ecologists are half right, the Earth is running on borrowed time.LiNeBrEaKLarry Clark is a Record staff writer.

Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	University of Kentucky scientists turning CO2 from coal-fired plants, algae into oil  	By Jim Warren, McClatchy Newspapers  	DOMESTIC NEWS  	600 words  	LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Eliminating greenhouse gases and developing new, non-petroleum-based fuels are two of America's biggest environmental challenges. University of Kentucky researchers think algae might offer an answer.LiNeBrEaKThey propose to employ algae to scrub carbon dioxide from the flue-gases of coal-fired power plants _ of which Kentucky has many _ and use the algae to produce an oil that could then be refined into fuel.LiNeBrEaKCarbon dioxide, or CO2, is the principal pollutant associated with global warming. But under UK's plan, algae would consume the power-plant CO2 as food, converting it into biomass from which algae oil could be removed and processed into biodiesel, jet fuel or similar products, researchers say. LiNeBrEaKAlgae-based facilities to trap the CO2 would probably be located adjacent to coal-fired power plants in order to quickly receive and process their emissions.LiNeBrEaK"The reason algae is so interesting is that it can directly convert CO2 into biomass very quickly, more efficiently than anything else we know of," says Rodney Andrews, director of UK's Center for Applied Energy Research.LiNeBrEaK"Then, you basically squeeze the oil out of the algae and refine it as you would other natural oils."LiNeBrEaKThe energy center is working on the project along with the UK College of Agriculture's Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering. The state of Kentucky has provided more than $500,000 for the effort.LiNeBrEaKUK scientists say they hope to have a test facility operating within three to four years. If the algae-based system works, it could benefit both the electrical power industry and Kentucky's coal industry.LiNeBrEaK"The appeal is that if you have a power plant where you burn coal, and you capture the CO2 and use that to produce fuel with algae, you effectively become twice as efficient in the amount of energy achieved per ton of CO2 emitted," Andrews said.LiNeBrEaKAs a first step in the research, Czarena Crofcheck, a biological engineer with the UK biosystems and agriculture engineering department, is searching for a strain of algae that would remove CO2 from power plant gases with the greatest efficiency.LiNeBrEaKIn her search, Crofcheck watches over bubbling tanks called photo-bioreactors that contain various strains of algae in shifting shades of green. The darker the green, the more efficiently the algae in the tank is growing.LiNeBrEaK"These are my babies," she quips. "We're primarily interested in strains that grow quickly and consume CO2 very quickly."LiNeBrEaKFinding the right strain could take a while. Crofcheck notes that there are at least 50,000 species of algae.LiNeBrEaKAnd, as in many alternative energy projects, there are some problems to be overcome.LiNeBrEaKAccording to Andrews, capturing the carbon dioxide emitted from a 500-megawatt power plant would require 5,000 to 6,000 acres of ponds containing algae. To get around that, UK hopes to contain the algae in vessels that would operate more efficiently at much smaller size.LiNeBrEaKExpense is another issue. As of now, it costs $18 to $30 a gallon to produce algae oil, which then has to be refined into fuel.LiNeBrEaKBut Andrews says producing fuel really is a secondary goal of the UK effort.LiNeBrEaK"The main idea is to get rid of the CO2 and then figure out what you do with the algae," he said.LiNeBrEaKVisit the World Wide Web site of the Herald-Leader at http://www.kentucky.com/	POWER PLANTS (92%); SCIENCE NEWS (90%); BIOMASS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (90%); RESEARCH (90%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (90%); SCIENCE and TECHNOLOGY (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); ENGINEERING (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); SEAWEED and ALGAE (89%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (89%); AUTOMOTIVE FUELS (78%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); ENERGY RESEARCH (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); BIOFUELS (78%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (77%); COAL INDUSTRY (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); JET FUEL (73%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (63%)  		UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY (93%)  			KENTUCKY, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%); UNITED KINGDOM (58%)  	December 7, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Lexington Herald-Leader   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune News Service  	MICHAEL MCMAHON (51%)  	20081206-BC-SCI-ALGAE  	LX  	LEXINGTON, Ky.   											
Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Kentucky environmentalists criticize state's energy usage: With costs rising, groups urge conservation  	Andy Mead, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1030 words  	Dec. 6--We've got to change our megawatt-wasting ways.LiNeBrEaKKentucky's energy-efficiency problem, experts say, is that low electrical rates have lulled us into lackadaisical light-switch-flipping.LiNeBrEaKThe average man, woman and child in Kentucky uses 70 percent more electricity than the average American, according to numbers compiled by Robert Ukeily, a Berea attorney who represents environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKThe average Kentucky home uses 24 percent more electricity than the national average. The average Kentucky industrial customer uses 427 percent more -- a testament to the state's history of using local electrical rates to draw aluminum smelters and other energy-hungry industries. LiNeBrEaKSeveral environmental groups -- the Sierra Club, Kentucky Energy Foundation and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth -- invited efficiency guru Glen Cannon to Kentucky this week to meet with executives at East Kentucky Power Cooperative, which is adding to its J.K. Smith Station in Clark County.LiNeBrEaKThe groups argue that East Kentucky Power could avoid the expense and the environmental toll of more coal-fired electricity by aggressively stressing customer-driven efficiency.LiNeBrEaKCompany officials listened to Cannon and later said that although they agree that efficiency is important, they still need the new unit.LiNeBrEaKBut the visit underscores Kentucky's efficiency problem, which also got a lot of attention last month when Gov. Steve Beshear released what he called the state's first comprehensive energy plan.LiNeBrEaKKentucky's electrical rates are low because more than 95 percent of our power is generated by burning coal, which is cheap and plentiful because it comes out of the ground here.LiNeBrEaKWith the cost of power so low, spending money to increase energy efficiency hasn't made economic sense for individual customers.LiNeBrEaKThat is going to change.LiNeBrEaKAs government moves to curb global climate change by constraining the amount of carbon being released into the air -- either through a carbon tax or a program that allows carbon credits to be traded -- the electricity bills arriving in Kentucky mailboxes will increase.LiNeBrEaKAnd that will beget energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"As costs go up ... we'll find that more programs become cost-effective," said John H. Davies, acting director of the state Division of Energy Efficiency and Conservation.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, coal-fired plants in Kentucky put 93 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the environment. That earned the state a ranking of No. 7 in per capita carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKWhen the Brookings Institute conducted a first-of-its-kind study of the per capita carbon footprints of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas earlier this year, Lexington's combination of coal-fired energy, sprawl and lack of attention to efficiency tagged it at No. 100 -- the worst of them all. Louisville was No. 96.LiNeBrEaKBeshear's plan says renewable energy and biofuels will play a role in the future, but it envisions a Kentucky in 2025 in which coal still is the major source of energy.LiNeBrEaKThe plans's first strategy for the future is improving the energy efficiency of the state's homes, buildings and transportation fleet.LiNeBrEaKIf that happens, the plan says, we will still need more energy in 2025, but will need 18 percent less than if we did nothing.LiNeBrEaKThe plan lays out steps for a process to obtain energy efficiency, but few details.LiNeBrEaK"The plan did not go into specific programs because they would have to be evaluated on their cost-effectiveness," Davies said.LiNeBrEaKThe plan envisions an education program to let Kentuckians know the advantages of buying energy-efficient appliances and insulating houses so it takes less energy to heat and cool them.LiNeBrEaKIt also calls for energy efficient resources standards -- a way to measure the effectiveness of efforts to increase efficiency.LiNeBrEaKSeventeen states already have such standards. In Kentucky, they would be used by the state Public Service Commission to require utilities to work with customers to increase efficiency.LiNeBrEaKCannon, the efficiency expert brought in by the environmental groups, said most utilities in Kentucky and elsewhere aren't paying enough attention to what he calls "both sides of the meter." Customers, not just utilities, need to be encouraged to be more efficient, he said.LiNeBrEaKDavies said, however, that utilities in Kentucky have become much more interested in energy efficiency for their customers in the last year or so.LiNeBrEaKThere are some programs already in place, but almost all are voluntary, said Andrew Melnykovych, a spokesman for the PSC.LiNeBrEaKThe most common, offered by Kentucky Utilities and others, are switches attached to air conditions or water heaters. When demand for electricity is high, a remote pager communicates with the switch, slightly altering the way the appliance runs, so that less electricity is is used.LiNeBrEaKIn Louisville, a "smart metering" pilot program puts meters in homes so that people can see just how much electricity they are using.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is that if people have real-time feedback on how much they're using," they'll say 'I'll go turn off a light,'" Melnykovych said.LiNeBrEaKA smaller program allows people to pay lower rates when electrical demand is low, and higher rates when it is high.LiNeBrEaKOn a hot afternoon in July, when air conditioners are running everywhere, a homeowner might decide to turn off some other appliances or put off running the dishwasher.LiNeBrEaKWhat Melnykovych called the "coolest" program is a small number of General Electric employees who have a new generation of energy-efficient appliances -- a refrigerator, water heater or dishwasher -- that talk to the smart meter.LiNeBrEaKIf electrical demand is high on a hot summer day, for example, the meter will let the fridge know that now is not the best time to go into that energy-eating defrost mode.LiNeBrEaKReach Andy Mead at (859) 231-3319 or 1-800-950-6397, Ext. 3319.

COMMENTARY  	363 words  	Dec. 6--Finally. It's here. Or, at least, it's coming. Snow. Tonight, forecasters are saying that there is a pretty good chance that the fluffy precipitation will float down upon our heads. LiNeBrEaKOf course, we have heard this before. We have even seen some wisps from time to time since the cold season began. But, watch out. Tonight could be the night.LiNeBrEaKEvidently global warming has not yet reduced our winters to a lukewarm transition between fall and spring. So, winter coats, scarves and gloves are still in fashion.LiNeBrEaKSo too is increased road rage and lackluster driving skills in the face of paralyzing frozen precipitation.LiNeBrEaKNorthern Virginia already has something of a reputation for poor, angry driving, but add snow to the mix and you might think the road was full of newly licensed teenage drivers.LiNeBrEaKIf snow does pay us a visit this evening, let's make an effort to stay off the roads, or if it is unavoidable, let's do some defensive driving and try not to turn our local streets into a community version ofLiNeBrEaKbumper cars.LiNeBrEaKAnd, if it does snow, let's take the time to tap into the magical spirit of our childhoods.LiNeBrEaKWhen we were young, snow was more than just an inconvenience or signal of cold weather; it was transformative. There was something about those crystalline flakes that made everything seem new or atLiNeBrEaKleast different.LiNeBrEaKGone was the mundane world we normally inhabited. Instead, it was replaced with a world of pure white.

The Record (Bergen County, NJ) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   All Editions	Corzine aide in lead for EPA chief;  Headed state DEP for two years 	By MARY JO LAYTON and HERB JACKSON, STAFF WRITERS, North Jersey Media Group  	NEWS; Pg. A01  	1006 words  	Lisa Jackson, Governor Corzine's chief of staff and the state's former top environmental official, appears closer to nomination as administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, environmentalists and congressional aides said Friday.LiNeBrEaKJackson, who serves on President-elect Barack Obama's energy and natural resources transition team, is apparently edging out the competition ? a California environmental official ? and could be named within two weeks, aides said.LiNeBrEaKU.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg declined to comment specifically on the possible appointment, but said he strongly supports Jackson. LiNeBrEaK"From fighting global warming and promoting a clean energy future to improving the quality of our air and water, she understands we need real leadership to rebound from the neglect of the last eight years," Lautenberg said in a statement released Friday.LiNeBrEaKLautenberg's staff was asked by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think-tank headed by John Podesta, co-chairman of Obama's transition team, to discuss Jackson's credentials and background with the media as Jackson has emerged as the likely nominee, a congressional aide said.LiNeBrEaK"That says to us they're pretty serious," said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.LiNeBrEaKAfter consulting with political insiders and national environmental leaders, Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club's New Jersey chapter, said Jackson is "the most probable person right now" to win the nomination.LiNeBrEaKHe praised her work on addressing global warming, coastal concerns and other key environmental issues.LiNeBrEaK"New Jersey is a sort of a laboratory for environmental policy," Tittel said. "It gives you a broad background to run the EPA."LiNeBrEaKA Washington lobbyist who works with New Jersey clients and spoke with members of the transition team said Jackson is "on the very, very short list," to head the EPA.LiNeBrEaKCorzine's office referred questions to Obama's transition team and described Jackson as "hard at work" in her position, which she began this week.LiNeBrEaK"She's in meetings and fulfilling the responsibilities of chief of staff," said Corzine spokesman Sean Darcy.LiNeBrEaKNews reports out of Washington this week said Jackson appeared to emerge as the top choice for the EPA, a post once held by former New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman. Stories also circulated in Washington that Ralph Izzo, Public Service Electric and Gas Co.'s president and chief executive, was in the running for secretary of the Department of Energy, but a spokeswoman downplayed the rumors.LiNeBrEaK"He's committed to leading PSEandG," spokeswoman Jenn Kramer said. "Ralph has not been interviewed and hasn't expressed interest in the job. The rumors, while flattering, are just rumors."LiNeBrEaKJackson's record at the state Department of Environmental Protection includes seeking $1 million in fines for alleged violations at the massive EnCap golf project in the Meadowlands, where former landfills and other contaminated land was to be turned into 2,600 homes, a golf course and a shopping center.LiNeBrEaKShe also aggressively pushed to make EnCap live up to its promise to clean up the landfills and contain toxic runoff polluting local waterways. And she called for a new testing program to check EnCap's claims about fill it had trucked to the site.LiNeBrEaKAfter the project stalled for good last year and the governor's office explored ways to prevent the developer from going bankrupt, Jackson urged ending EnCap's contract entirely.LiNeBrEaKNot all of her efforts in New Jersey, however, were praised by environmentalists.LiNeBrEaKA bill that would allow consultants to sign off on toxic cleanups instead of DEP employees is opposed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, Tittel said.LiNeBrEaKJackson appeared to be edging out Mary Nichols, head of the California Air Resources Board.LiNeBrEaKCongressional aides said there were concerns that selecting Nichols would add another key Californian to a prized post. They noted Rep. Harry Waxman of California unseated Rep. John Dingell of Michigan as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees EPA on many issues, including water and air quality.LiNeBrEaKSome said Nichols' chances may have dimmed when she found herself at odds with environmental groups this year after her board cut the number of electric vehicles the state will require car manufacturers to build.LiNeBrEaKJackson began her career in the EPA's Superfund office in Washington, overseeing toxic site cleanups, and she could find the administrator's job is changing.LiNeBrEaKIn a first, Obama is considering a creating a "climate czar" post in the White House that could assume some of the responsibilities previously under the direction of the EPA administrator, said Washington lobbyist Ed Krenik.LiNeBrEaKKrenik and others said the conventional wisdom is that that job would go to Carol M. Browner, who served as EPA administrator under President Bill Clinton and leads the Obama transition team's "policy working group" on energy and environmental issues.LiNeBrEaKLisa P. JacksonLiNeBrEaKAge: 46. Born Feb. 8, 1962LiNeBrEaKExperience: Began her career in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund office in Washington, overseeing toxic site cleanups, before heading enforcement in the agency's New York office from 1999 to 2002. After 16 years with the EPA, she joined the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2002 as assistant commissioner of compliance and enforcement. Was assistant commissioner for land-use management before becoming DEP commissioner in 2006. On Dec. 1, she became Governor Corzine's chief of staff and also landed a sought-after spot on President-elect Barack Obama's energy and natural resources transition team.LiNeBrEaKCareer highlights: At the EPA, oversaw hazardous waste cleanup projects in New Jersey. With the DEP, launched compliance investigations in Camden and Paterson.LiNeBrEaKEducation: Bachelor's degree with honors from Tulane University's School of Chemical Engineering; master's degree in chemical engineering from Princeton University.LiNeBrEaKStaff Writer Jeff Pillets contributed to this article.

Richmond Times Dispatch (Virginia) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   Final Edition	Farmers fuming about rumored livestock tax  		BUSINESS; Pg. B-9  	405 words  	 For farmers, this stinks: Belching and gaseous cows and hogs could start costing them money if the federal government decides to charge fees for air-polluting animals.LiNeBrEaK Farmers so far are turning up their noses at the notion, which they contend is a possible consequence of an Environmental Protection Agency report after the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases emitted by belching and flatulence amounts to air pollution. LiNeBrEaK "This is one of the most ridiculous things the federal government has tried to do," said Alabama Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks, an outspoken opponent of the fees.LiNeBrEaK EPA officials insisted yesterday that the lengthy, highly technical report, which mostly focuses on other sources of air pollution, does not include a proposal to tax livestock.LiNeBrEaK But the American Farm Bureau Federation said, based on federal agriculture department figures, it would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog.LiNeBrEaK The executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation, Ken Hamilton, estimated the fee would cost owners of a modest-sized cattle ranch $30,000 to $40,000 a year. He said he has talked to a number of livestock owners about the proposals, and "all have said if the fees were carried out, it would bankrupt them."LiNeBrEaK Sparks said Wednesday he's worried the fee could be extended to chickens and other farm animals and cause more meat to be imported.LiNeBrEaK "We'll let other countries put food on our tables like they are putting gas in our cars. Other countries don't have the health standards we have," Sparks said.LiNeBrEaK EPA officials said the agency has not taken a position on any of the matters discussed in its response to the Supreme Court ruling. And John Millett, a spokesman for EPA's air and radiation division, said there has been an oversimplification of the EPA's document "to the point of distortion."LiNeBrEaK "EPA is not proposing any type of tax on livestock," he said.LiNeBrEaK While farmers say fees would drive them out of business, an organization supporting the proposal hopes it forces the farms and ranches to switch to healthier crops.LiNeBrEaK "It makes perfect sense if you are looking for ways to cut down on meat consumption and recoup environmental losses," said Bruce Friedrich, a spokesman in Washington for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   New River Edition	YOUNG INVENTOR TURNS BUBBLE WRAP INTO SOLAR COOKER  	By Sean Kotz Special to The Roanoke Times  	CURRENT; Pg. NRV4  	838 words  	Last January, on his way back from New York, 11-year-old Jared Mann got an idea.LiNeBrEaKHe and his family had been up to the Big Apple as guests of honor for the 2007 Bubble Wrap Competition for Young Inventors. His sister, Nicolette, had just placed second out of 1,400 contestants in thenationwide competition.LiNeBrEaKJared had competed too with a rocket design, but it was his sister's creation -- a transformable, multi-faceted kite kit -- that caught the judges' attention in 2007, earning her a family trip to New Yorkand a $5,000 savings bond. LiNeBrEaKBut as Jared, who turned 12 in November, puts it: "I thought, 'Well, if Nicolette can do it, then I can, too.' "LiNeBrEaKSo this year, over the course of several months, he researched, developed, designed and built an invention that combines pragmatism and drama.LiNeBrEaKThis year, Jared made the list of 15 semifinalists.LiNeBrEaKJared's portable solar cooker that can be used as a grill or oven -- or both at the same time -- is made entirely of lightweight, recyclable or reusable materials such as corrugated plastic, Velcro and aluminum screws.LiNeBrEaKThe cooker is essentially a giant pop-up book that makes use of bubble wrap's translucence and its ability to trap and intensify heat.LiNeBrEaKSolar rays pass through the bubble wrap, generating heat. The hot air rises but the bubble wrap creates a greenhouse effect, allowing the air (and thus the food) inside to reach high temperatures.LiNeBrEaKHow high?LiNeBrEaKAccording to Jared, on sunny days he measured temperatures as high as 180 degrees in his cooker. Even in sweater weather he was able to reach 150 degrees.LiNeBrEaKAnd according to his experiments, it turns out bubble wrap is a better material for this than plastic wrap or plastic sheeting.LiNeBrEaKBut the real genius of the device is its design.LiNeBrEaKWhile Jared was in the early stages of the process, he happened to notice a pop-up encyclopedia of dinosaurs he had gotten as a gift one Christmas.LiNeBrEaK"I don't think I actually jumped up and shouted, 'Eureka!' " he saidwith a smile. "But I knew that this would be a way to make it portable and adjustable."LiNeBrEaKThe "book" has parts that lie flat when the cooker is closed and quickly pop into place when you are ready to heat liquids or prepare camp-out cuisine.LiNeBrEaKThe cooker also has a pair of handles that also may be used to adjust the angle of the reflective surfaces when in use.LiNeBrEaK"I did some research on solar cookers and they work OK, but the problem with most of them is they are heavy and hard to set up," Jared said.LiNeBrEaK"I thought, 'What if you could have something light that would assemble itself?' "LiNeBrEaKAt that point, Jared began the labor-intensive process of building prototypes and experimenting with them.LiNeBrEaKThe Bubble Wrap Competition for Young Inventors, which is hosted by the National Museum of Education and sponsored by Sealed Air Corp., has a number of strict requirements.LiNeBrEaKFirst, the invention must be original and make prominent use of bubble wrap.LiNeBrEaKSecond, while one parent or teacher may advise or mentor, the student must do all the work.LiNeBrEaKThird, in addition to creating the invention itself, contestants must write essays explaining their projects and their processes. They must also submit design drawings and photographs of the device in use.LiNeBrEaKIf the idea makes the first cut, the student must create a second copy of the final invention and send in the original for evaluation.LiNeBrEaKThis year there were more than 2,200 entrants.LiNeBrEaKBut Jared and his three siblings are used to competitions, so he is not as nervous as you might think being in the semifinals.LiNeBrEaKJared's parents, Judy and David Mann of Christiansburg, have home-schooled all four children, and each has entered national invention competitions.LiNeBrEaK"We have made invention a natural part of our kids' education," David Mann said.LiNeBrEaKTheir oldest son, David Jr., invented a pair of steel-tipped work gloves. Son Brian designed a rake that included an extra head and a scooping feature to make raking more efficient.LiNeBrEaKBoth David Jr., 21, and Brian, 18, are students at Radford University now.LiNeBrEaKAnd Nicolette, 14, not only placed second last year in the bubble wrap competition but placed first in a national contest sponsored by Craftsman Tools in 2004. That year, she created a special device that makes piano pedals easier for young children to use.LiNeBrEaKBut this year, the focus is on Jared and his Pop-Up Solar Cooker Book.LiNeBrEaKThe Manns said the mental exercise of invention and problem-solving has been one of the most important aspects of educating their children.LiNeBrEaK"I think what I wanted out of this," Judy Mann said, "is for the kids to learn that there is no limit on what they can do if they believe in themselves.LiNeBrEaK"And that if you have an idea, if you have imagination, its OK to use it even if other people don't see things the way you do."LiNeBrEaKAnd, she notes, "it also teaches them that they can do a lot with a little."LiNeBrEaKDavid Mann said he's proud that his son used his imagination to develop a creation using renewable enrergy.LiNeBrEaK"I think that has to be the direction of his generation," he added. "If we are going to get off fossil fuels, it will take that kind of thinking."

The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Deer camp closes with great memories but no shots fired  	Ed Zieralski, STAFF WRITER  	SPORTS; Pg. WEB  	1346 words  	WARREN, Pa. -- Although deer season extends to next Saturday here, our hunting camp's season ended today a half hour after sunset.LiNeBrEaK"We're part-time hunters chasing full-time deer," my brother-in-law Dale Olmsted said as he summed up our hunt for the elusive whitetail deer. "This is where they live. We're just visiting for a few days and we're gone."LiNeBrEaKOur season ended the way it started, with snow, bitterly cold weather and no deer.LiNeBrEaKOur hunt today was the most brutal of all -- at least for me -- in terms of high snow drifts that I fought through to reach our destination. The snow that fell a couple weeks ago has frozen. That made for tough sledding, particularly around the mountain laurel, which was almost impenetrable. Seems Warren didn't get the memo on global warming. The Arctic has shifted south. LiNeBrEaKWe started the day by walking across the street into the Allegheny National Forest at sunrise with neighbor Dan Murphy. We intended to rendezvous in the Mix Creek basin, but that never happened. I'm sure we all got there, just at different times.LiNeBrEaKOur plan was to drive Mix Creek from different angles. In the process, Dale, my nephew Denny Bambino and I drifted into some areas where no hunters had gone during this snowfall. Ours were the only human tracks in some of the areas we explored.LiNeBrEaKWhen Denny and Dale and I met back at camp just before noon, we were spent. This being what the locals call the Second Opening Day, I was a bit surprised I didn't see other hunters. My colleagues saw a few, but it wasn't anything like we expected.LiNeBrEaKI also was surprised that this inaugural deer camp went without a buck. It wasn't from lack of effort, as I've written all week.LiNeBrEaKAll three of us agreed that it's going to take a while to learn these big woods. We registered a lot of good areas to hunt, and that information will serve us well in the future. If there is no snow next year, it will be like hiking and hunting without weights on our feet.LiNeBrEaKWe didn't get a trophy buck, but we took away so many great memories from these woods. The state is in the midst of a deer herd management plan that should help add bigger bucks to the population. If hunters can lay off shooting does, something my neighbor Dan wishes they would, that will help the herd.LiNeBrEaKI've read and heard many reasons for the lack of deer in many areas of Pennsylvania. Some blame the Pennsylvania Game Commission for allowing far too much doe harvest. Back in the day, buck season was two weeks, followed by one or two days of doe season. Now doe season not only runs the entire two weeks of buck season, there are additional doe seasons, too.LiNeBrEaKIt's not true that these deer don't have natural predators. Coyotes and bobcats are two that come to mind. Hunters blamed the Game Commission for importing coyotes to keep the deer herd in check. The Game Commission has denied it, but some old-school hunters don't believe it.LiNeBrEaKPutting minimum antler restrictions on bucks will help the bigger, more productive males from getting killed too soon. But if Pennsylvanians don't quit shooting countless does, it won't matter.LiNeBrEaKIn my six days of hunting, I saw six does that I easily could have shot. I would have had to have a doe tag -- not that hard to get -- but I will follow my neighbor Dan's advice and not shoot does and not shoot small bucks. I don't see ever applying for a doe tag.LiNeBrEaKHis own rule is eight points or better the first week, and if he fails to get a buck, six points or better the second. Did I mention that I have one great sportsman for a neighbor? Great guy who has been showing us around the woods.LiNeBrEaKDeer may be scarce, but turkeys are plentiful. I was thrilled to see so many turkeys, so many tracks. A hen's nervous alarm putt would have angered me in the spring, but with my mind on deer and not turkeys, the hen that busted me today may as well have been Trisha Yearwood. I just sat and listened to her sing and laughed.LiNeBrEaKThis week's online posts have centered on our camp, what we did, the people we met. We kept to ourselves for the most part. But I met my other neighbor, Rick Zemanek of Erie, who shot the big buck on opening day while hunting with his buddy, Bruce Carnicelli. And Brian Miller, who lives down the road next to Hairy Scary, a dog grooming business up here on the mountain. Word is they're working on doing a makeover on the irrepressible Sasquatch, another critter rumored to be living up here.LiNeBrEaKI don't have to tell most of you that this is a different world compared with California when it comes to hunting.LiNeBrEaKIn California, we have about 300,000 hunters among 36. 5 million people. In Pennsylvania, there are a reported 900,000 hunters among 12. 5 million residents. Three times more hunters and one-third fewer folks. Hunting is a big part of the culture here.LiNeBrEaKI talked to a clerk at the local grocery store who had cleaned a half dozen deer for her boyfriend and his buddies.LiNeBrEaKI ran into hunters just about everywhere I went, whether it was the grocery store, Wal-Mart, even Applebee's and the Fresh Cup Coffee Shop, two places where I was able to get wireless service and send my reports each day.LiNeBrEaKWhen I say different culture, I mean different. One night as I went into Thorne's Grocery store in Warren, I glanced into the back of a pickup parked next to my rental SUV. There in the bed was the head and rack of a six-point buck.LiNeBrEaKNow there's something you don't see every day. Someone skipped their sensitivity training class.LiNeBrEaKAt another time, during the end of one of our hunts, my nephew Denny uncovered a box of deer parts and the deer's upper torso, propped up in the snow like it was in a butcher shop. Whoever cleaned and skinned the animal left far too much meat behind. Yes, other animals will make use of the carcass, but why leave something like that close enough to a gate entrance that non-hunters might see it and be offended by it?LiNeBrEaKI've seen worse in California. Like the time a couple of hunting club members shot a buck, field-dressed it and left the gut pile on an asphalt road inside the ranch property, part of which at the time was being purchased by County Parks. Stupidity and insensitivity among hunters can be found on both coasts.LiNeBrEaKAs for the media back here, coverage of the deer opener and opening week was terrific.LiNeBrEaKThe Erie Times on Tuesday, the day after the opener, had this headline at the top of the front page: "Deer time," with a "Special Report: Hunting Opening Day."LiNeBrEaKUnderneath was a photo of a father and son team, Paul and Nick Olson, dragging Nick's eight-point buck out of the woods.LiNeBrEaKIn Warren, the deer opener news wasn't across the top of the front page as it was in Erie, but it was in the center of the front page with the headline: "Buck Season."LiNeBrEaKIt ran with a photo of another father-son duo, Jack and Chase Barnes, posing on both sides of the back of their pickup with twin eight-point bucks in the truck bed. Not the most picturesque photo, I agree, but it told the story.LiNeBrEaKThe Times-Observer ran a photo page Thursday, showing some of the better bucks shot in the area.LiNeBrEaKTV stations like WJAC-TV in Johnstown gave early-morning reports on opening day from rural cafes. There were interviews with hunters and families -- good stuff that I watched before heading off into the woods.LiNeBrEaKAll of it was positive. I didn't see one TV person give a sarcastic or disgusted look after a report from the field or after interviews with hunters.LiNeBrEaKThere is respect for the traditions of fishing and hunting here, and the people don't take their right to hunt and fish for granted.LiNeBrEaKIt's a big part of what drew me back to this area to hunt. I never hunted as a youngster growing up here, so I've got a lot of catching up to do.LiNeBrEaKIf you followed and stayed with us through this entire series, thank you. I haven't read all the posts and comments after the reports, but I know the series caused some thought-provoking discussions among our valued readers.LiNeBrEaKRemember this, though, and it wasn't part of the plan, but no animals were hurt, injured, maimed or killed in the writing of this series. I can't guarantee that will always be the case, but it certainly was this year.

San Bernardino County Sun (California) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Solar power must replace lost habitat  	G. Sidney Silliman  	OPINION  	569 words  	Solar power is a preferred resource if we are to reverse global warming. Yet solar power, as with other energy resources, carries costs to our natural environment. The siting of solar power plants in the desert, in particular, will have adverse impacts on the desert tortoise and its habitat. LiNeBrEaKThe Ivanpah solar power plants proposed by Solar Partners, a subsidiary of Bright Source Energy, will permanently destroy 3,700 acres of prime tortoise habitat on public lands in the Eastern Mojave administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The resident tortoises will be removed and the land will be bulldozed to bare earth.LiNeBrEaKThe site of the Ivanpah Solar Energy Generating System (SEGS) is technically not within critical habitat, so it is unlikely that the project will be rejected by the agencies reviewing the application - the California Energy Commission and the Bureau of Land Management - even though the Mojave population of the desert tortoise is protected by both state and federal endangered-species law.LiNeBrEaKAssuming that the tortoises currently inhabiting the site can be safely moved - a large "if" given the risk of mortalities in translocating any desert tortoise population - it is essential that Solar Partners provide adequate compensation for the adverse impacts of its project. These are public lands and the public has an interest in protecting the valued resources on those lands. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, California Department of Fish and Game, and the California Energy Commission must require Solar Partners to compensate for the negative environmental effects of Ivanpah SEGS through acquisition of additional tortoise habitat at a ratio of 5: 1. Solar Partners proposes a mitigation ratio of 1: 1, arguing that the public lands it seeks are not critical for the Mojave tortoise.LiNeBrEaKThis argument ignores the biology. The land at the site is, in fact, Category I habitat - the most "valuable and protected habitat" as defined in The Desert Tortoise Management Oversight Group's 1991 report, "Compensation For The Desert Tortoise." Two surveys of the Ivanpah site document the presence of a tortoise population. According to Solar Partners, there are "indications that tortoises are active throughout this valley and have been reproducing ." The 2002 Northern and Eastern Mojave Plan sets the boundary for the nearby Desert Wildlife Management Area so as to exclude the area of the Ivanpah solar plants. But this administrative decision does not negate the biological importance of the Ivanpah habitat for the Mojave tortoise. The excluded area is prime tortoise habitat that will be completely eliminated by the solar project.LiNeBrEaKThe only acceptable option is to place additional habitat under conservation management so as to improve conditions to the long-term benefit of the desert tortoise. Thus the appropriate ratio of compensation should be 5: 1.LiNeBrEaKRequiring appropriate compensation by Solar Partners for the public lands it seeks to use would index the value we place on recovering the threatened Mojave desert tortoise, whose numbers have declined drastically over recent decades. The desert tortoise has made the Mojave its home for 10,000 years. If we must use a portion of the Mojave desert for solar power, we must ensure that the tortoise has a better than even chance of surviving on additional lands of equal or better quality.LiNeBrEaKG.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Readers' letters  	From Daily News Group readers  	COMMUNITIES; Peninsula; News; Local  	649 words  	Not just a perkLiNeBrEaKDear Editor: Caltrain's bikes-on-board service is a regional concernLiNeBrEaKNumerous recent writers have expressed frustration with inadequate bicycle capacity on Caltrain, complaining about being late for work too many times, missing appointments, and the stress of never knowing if they will be able to board their train. As a result many have stopped using Caltrain and returned to driving.LiNeBrEaKThis is a real shame, both for these individuals who lost a convenient, healthy and enjoyable commute, and for the region, which is losing a great opportunity to build a cost-effective transportation mode which offers huge cost and environmental benefits. It is frustrating to hear all the effort and money being spent on task forces to find ways to reduce driving, gasoline consumption, traffic congestion, global warming and other impacts of automobile use, when bikes-on-board service, proven by almost two decades of continuous operation, is being allowed to die due to lack of capacity and reliability. LiNeBrEaKBikes-on-board provides the most cost-effective commute option, since users don't require hugely expensive parking spaces, or subsidized buses or shuttles. Their commute to and from Caltrain doesn't contribute to global warming, air pollution and traffic congestion. Bikes-on-board is not a special perk for a few bicyclists, but a real opportunity to develop a long-term sustainable commute for thousands of workers in this region. It is a practical commute method for not just hard-core bicyclists, but for anyone looking for a low-cost, convenient and healthy way to get to work.LiNeBrEaKEven if Caltrain does not work for your commute, bikes-on-board deserves your support as we all must share in the effort to reduce oil dependence, air pollution and traffic congestion. Bikes-on-board can be a huge part of that effort. Please let your community leaders know you support bikes-on-board. With everyone's support the current capacity limitations can be corrected.LiNeBrEaKSteve Vanderlip,LiNeBrEaKSan MateoLiNeBrEaKPretty Gavin for governor?LiNeBrEaKDear Editor: Who does San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom think he's fooling? Hey Gavin, you're pretty but not 7 &frac12; hours worth of pretty.LiNeBrEaKBy utilizing YouTube to broadcast his 7 &frac12;-hour speech regarding the state of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom is obviously sending out the message to all of California and beyond. Supposedly the idea of press secretary Nathan Ballard, one would think that Gavin was already running for the governor of California.LiNeBrEaKWere I a citizen of San Francisco, I would be somewhat offended by the very young and arrogant mayor, especially after Newsom's comment on same sex-marriage   "It's going to happen, whether you like it or not!" I believe that comment contributed to the passage of Proposition 8 by a very narrow margin.LiNeBrEaKHis comment on the 7 &frac12;-hour address, "If you don't like it, you don't have watch/listen," is equally offensive. People don't take kindly to the "take me or leave me" attitudes in their elected government officials.LiNeBrEaKMuch to the detriment of our country, George W. Bush took a long skate on the coattails of his wealthy, influential family. Let's hope and pray Gavin Newsom will not be able to do the same in California. No governorship for Gavin, no way, no how.LiNeBrEaKToni M.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Opinion: How a 24-year-old technology can save the planet  	By Steve Kirsch  	NEWS; Opinion  	619 words  	We are running out of time. Scientists tell us that if we are to avoid irreversible damage to our planet due to climate change, we need a prompt worldwide moratorium on constructing new coal plants and a gradual phaseout of all existing coal plants by 2030.LiNeBrEaKThat isn't happening. Our best known climate scientist, James Hansen, has been traveling the globe, explaining the urgency, and exhorting world leaders to phase out coal completely. Leaders in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan politely listen and then ignore him. Germany, often held up as a model of government commitment to renewables, is planning to build more than 20 new coal plants. LiNeBrEaKNot a single world leader has heeded Hansen's advice. Not in the United States. Not anywhere.LiNeBrEaKSo now what? If the world leaders who are doing the most to combat climate change aren't listening to our top climate scientists, what chance do we have to persuade countries with large greenhouse gas emissions, such as China and India, to change their behavior?LiNeBrEaKAs the founder of five startup companies, I've faced similar problems many times where customers don't buy my product despite all the logical arguments that they should. The solution is the same: I change the product or the pitch until I get a product and pitch that resonates with the buyer.LiNeBrEaKNow, suppose Hansen skipped the climate science lecture and simply told world leaders that there's now a new technology available for generating electric power. It's cheaper and cleaner than coal, produces minimal waste and generates power 24/7. The fuel supply is virtually inexhaustible and is safer than coal. The technology uses as fuel the long-lived "waste" from today's reactors, and you can build a plant anywhere you can locate a coal plant.LiNeBrEaKWhat world leader could resist such a pitch?LiNeBrEaKBelieve it or not, such a power source actually exists. I lied about only one thing. It's not a new technology. It was invented 24 years ago by our country's top energy scientists at our most prestigious national energy laboratory. The project, a new, fourth generation advanced nuclear design known as the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) was led by Dr. Charles Till, then associate lab director at Argonne National Laboratory.LiNeBrEaK"No, that cannot be," you are thinking. "If that were true, then surely we would have heard about it and we'd be using it today."LiNeBrEaKWell, we probably would have heard about it if President Bill Clinton hadn't killed the project in 1994 because, as he said in his State of the Union speech in February 1993, the unlimited cheap clean power from this project was now "unneeded."LiNeBrEaKHansen, an expert on all things global warming, accidentally stumbled upon the IFR technology a few months ago and, now, after a lot of research, he's urging Obama to restart the project immediately.LiNeBrEaKOur government spent $1 billion over 10 years on this project. Our top scientists met every milestone. Why shouldn't we trust them to finish the job? Or shall we allow ignorance, misinformation, ideology and fear to once again triumph over science and facts?LiNeBrEaKThe benefits are huge. The IFR technology could do wonders to re-energize our economy, improve our balance of trade, and fight global warming.LiNeBrEaKIt's ready to be built. General Electric has a commercial design called the S-PRISM. It will cost about $1 billion to restart the project and prove to the world that the claims are true.LiNeBrEaKIf we are to avoid a climate crisis, we will need to show the world that there is a way to generate electric power that is more attractive than coal. The IFR does that. If there is not a better alternative, then what are we waiting for?LiNeBrEaKSteve Kirsch is a high-tech serial entrepreneur and philanthropist.

San Jose Mercury News (California) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	Opinion: How California can help its most polluted communities  	By Alberto Mendoza and Nora Vargas Special to the Mercury News  	NEWS; Opinion  	689 words  	Over the last decade, California has led the way on climate change. Now comes the hard part  how we protect every Californian   regardless of neighborhood.LiNeBrEaKWhat does your neighborhood have to do with it?LiNeBrEaKThe California Air Resources Board (CARB) is grappling with how best to implement California's landmark Global Warming Solutions Act, AB 32. The current plan calls for a cap-and-trade program, where total emissions are capped and polluters can trade carbon credits as part of the strategy to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKHere's where the neighborhood comes in. A cap-and-trade program has the potential to saddle some already highly polluted communities with an additional pollution burden as carbon credits are traded and additional pollution gets dumped in their backyards. LiNeBrEaKCARB is not alone in supporting a cap-and-trade approach. Recently at Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Governors' Global Climate Change Summit, President-elect Barack Obama also made it clear that he supports and will work to initiate a cap-and-trade program shortly after taking office.LiNeBrEaKIf a cap-and-trade program is adopted   and it looks as if that will be the case at both the state and national levels   we want to ensure that there is also a protect-and-strengthen program in place to protect every Californian and strengthen every community regardless of neighborhood.LiNeBrEaKFrom the outset, California must be specific about how we plan to protect all communities and strengthen those who have been hardest hit by America's addiction to pollution-driven energy. Here's how:LiNeBrEaKFirst, CARB must identify the California communities that are already saddled with an unfair air pollution burden. Knowing which communities are most polluted today is critical to designing effective policies that will protect all Californians and strengthen our communities. This assessment should be completed in 2009.LiNeBrEaKSecond, CARB should create a Community Benefits Fund so that a portion of any resources generated through the implementation of the Global Warming Solutions Act goes toward protecting highly polluted areas and assisting low-income communities with adaptation programs.LiNeBrEaKCommunities could use these resources to reduce pollution and create green jobs by upgrading to energy efficient equipment, installing pollution controls and replacing the most-polluting vehicles. Resources from the Community Benefits Fund could also help communities prepare for anticipated heat waves by creating cooling centers and teaching people to recognize and treat heat-related illnesses.LiNeBrEaKWhile many laws have been passed over the years to help the most polluted communities, almost none has provided resources to directly help these communities. California has the opportunity to beat back climate change and become a stronger, more prosperous state in the process. Targeting resources to both protect and strengthen the most polluted communities greatly increases the chance of turning this opportunity into a success.LiNeBrEaKThird, and finally, we must place a limit on how much pollution we allow to move from one community to another. While it's tempting to breathe a sigh of relief that California is taking action to address climate change, it's unfair to clean up the state for some Californians at the expense of others. This can be done through a combination of incentives and penalties that ensure all sources of pollution are reducing emissions.LiNeBrEaKThis protect-and-strengthen strategy is practical, required by the law and consistent with the values of our great state. California's climate-change solution has the potential to be emulated around the country, perhaps the world. If we do not get our cap-and-trade program right now, it has the potential to harm future programs.LiNeBrEaKNow is our chance to create an extraordinarily well designed climate-change solution. Any cap-and-trade program absent these concepts fails to protect and strengthen disadvantaged communities at home in California, and around the world.LiNeBrEaKAlberto Mendoza is president and CEO of the Coalition for Clean Air.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 06, 2008 Saturday 	TAKING A CHILLY DIVE FOR POLAR BEARS  	KERY MURAKAMI P-I reporter  	NEWS; Pg. W  	663 words  	Matt Reynolds and Lauren Brown were among those concerned enough about polar bears, and the global climate change threatening them, that on Saturday they were willing to make like the bears.LiNeBrEaKWith a blue towel wrapped around her shoulders, Brown, 22, stood at Seattle's Matthews Beach a little after 11 a.m. In a few minutes she and about 20 others were supposed to jump into Lake Washington and, through their cold, raise awareness about global warming.LiNeBrEaKBut while the cause was worthy enough to get Brown, Reynolds, 21, and their friend Katherine Rice, 20, to the water's edge, all three blanched at the reality of the cold lake in front of them. LiNeBrEaK"We're reassessing," Brown said.LiNeBrEaKOn New Year's Day, others run into the water from the same beach as part of the annual polar bear plunge. But that's strictly for fun.LiNeBrEaKKristina Byrne, 25, who organized Saturday's event for EarthCorps, which builds trails and other environmental projects in the area, said the frigid soak was part of International Climate Action Day, during which groups in 92 countries were holding similar polar bear plunges, rallies and other actions to raise awareness of the issue even as global leaders meet at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Poland.LiNeBrEaKThe polar bear, Byrne said, is a symbol of the ramifications of global warming, which is melting polar ice and driving the bears either inland or on thicker ice further out to sea, away from their food source.LiNeBrEaKAnd so what better way to show concern for polar bears than to have a polar bear plunge?LiNeBrEaKThe event was also designed to promote an exhibit by photographer Steven Kazlowski at the University of Washington's Burke Museum documenting the plight of the polar bear.LiNeBrEaKSaturday was a fortuitously mild day and organizers of the polar bear plunge measured the water temperature at 49 degrees. But, still, it is December.LiNeBrEaK"Apprehension," was how Rice described the way she and her friends were feeling.LiNeBrEaKBut Rice, a student at St. Martin's College and a member of the campus Kiwanis Club, said she's not always good about being green, "so I try to do the little things I can."LiNeBrEaKAnd Reynolds, who is president of the University of Puget Sound Kiwanis, where he and Brown are students, said global climate change has to be attacked locally.LiNeBrEaKAs the time to plunge drew near, Byrne told the group, "This is a little step to tell the people who are talking about really important things in Poland that we want more than just talk."LiNeBrEaKWith that, Jessie Dye, who is hosting an AmeriCorps member from Namibia, told the group, "Prepare to take your final warm breath."LiNeBrEaKAdding quickly, "I mean, not forever."LiNeBrEaKByrne did the polar bear plunge for climate action day at Chesapeake Bay in Maryland last year. The anticipation is worse than the reality, she noted.LiNeBrEaK"But it's still cold," she said.LiNeBrEaKWhich was what the others were about to find out.LiNeBrEaKDye counted down: "One, two, three."LiNeBrEaKThe group jumped up and down, clapping and whooping and ran into the lake.LiNeBrEaKA collective scream went up to clear blue sky.LiNeBrEaK"Oh my God!" one woman yelled as chilly waters hit flesh.LiNeBrEaKSome ran in, turned around and ran back out. Others, like Byrne, lingered, but not for more than half a minute, splashing each other.LiNeBrEaKAfter she toweled off, Brown said she focused on watching everyone else as she ran to take her mind off the cold.LiNeBrEaK"It was like a shock," Reynolds said.LiNeBrEaKGina DiCicco, a 24-year-old EarthCorps member, said she'd planned to go under the water as she ran in, but then the cold hit her when she got knee deep and she thought that wasn't such a good idea.LiNeBrEaKDave Olson, a 63-year-old teacher at Fife Alternative High School, was the only one who dove under the water.LiNeBrEaK"A little chilly," he said as he walked out. But not as bad as the time he fell through the ice as a child at Chautauqua Lake in upstate New York.LiNeBrEaK"Probably some hanging on to my youth," Olson said when asked why he'd gone in. "But really, I've been reading about the climate change thing and I've been encouraging my students to volunteer."

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 6, 2008 Saturday 	RPI hosts climate change talk: Speaker: Technologies are needed that don't produce carbon dioxide  	Brian Nearing, Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	545 words  	Dec. 6--TROY -- Rafe Pomerance, director of a New Hampshire-based advocacy group involved in the fight against climate change, will speak Wednesday at an entrepreneurship program at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. LiNeBrEaKAs the head of Clean Air -- Cool Planet, Pomerance helped organize a July trip to the Arctic that included former President Jimmy Carter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, eBay CEO Meg Whitman and Google founder Larry Page.LiNeBrEaKLast month, Pomerance's group issued a report urging President-Elect Barack Obama to make changes to the nation's policies on energy and climate change a top priority during the administration's first 150 days.LiNeBrEaK"The climate of the Northeast is changing. There are fewer snow days, less ice on our lakes and river. We are witnesses to this in our backyards," said Pomerance.LiNeBrEaK"Our nation needs highly advanced, low-cost technologies that don't produce carbon dioxide," he said. If Obama funds a federal energy research program knows as Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, it could be a "huge opportunity for a university like RPI," Pomerance said.LiNeBrEaKThe Obama administration is considering a multibillion-dollar energy efficiency program that could include funds to weatherize hundreds of thousands of homes, install "smart meters" to monitor and reduce home energy use, and to state and local governments for mass transit and infrastructure projects, according to recent published reports.LiNeBrEaKPomerance will speak before the Severino Interest Group, a program of RPI's Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, which links students to the business communityLiNeBrEaKThe event is set for 7: 30- 9 a.m. at the Century House in Latham. Registration is $15, or $20 if the attendee wishes to sponsor a student to also attend the event; to register, e-mail scte@rpi.edu or call 276-2650.LiNeBrEaKFrom 1993 to 1999, Pomerance was deputy assistant Secretary of State for environment and development in the Clinton administration, and helped negotiate the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty on climate change where countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKThe Kyoto Protocol was never ratified by the United States, and President George W. Bush has opposed it because countries such as China and India are exempt.LiNeBrEaKPrior to joining the Clinton administration, Pomerance worked for eight years with the World Resources Institute. From 1975 to 1984, he was with the environmental group Friends of the Earth, where he began working on climate change in 1978.LiNeBrEaK"When I first began speaking on global warming 30 years ago, there was basically zero public knowledge," Pomerance said. There had not been enough time for the measurements for society to take notice. Now, this has gone from a projection to something that can be felt and seen."

Tulsa World (Oklahoma) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   Final Edition	GAO report criticizes emissions efforts  	THE WASHINGTON POST  	News; Pg. A18  	418 words  	WASHINGTON The Government Accountability Office, in a report issued as negotiators convened the latest round of U.N. climate talks in Poland, has concluded that two key international programs aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions are not getting the job done. The study, requested by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, ranking minority member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and two other House Republicans, highlights problems in the European Union's emissions trading system and in a U.N. program that allows industrialized countries to offset their domestic emissions.  LiNeBrEaKThe GAO said that Europe's cap-and-trade system had created "a functioning market for carbon dioxide allowances, but its effects on emissions, the European economy, and technology investment are less certain." A separate program that grants offsets to industrialized nations for funding energy projects in the developing world, investigators wrote, has had an "uncertain" effect on carbon emissions, "and its impact on sustainable development has been limited." The report, released Tuesday, has implications for the United States, which could launch a program to limit greenhouse gas emissions as early as next year. President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are determined to adopt a cap-and-trade system for emissions linked to global warming, and opponents of such a plan seized upon the GAO study as a reason to block it. "This report identifies some of the potential risks and concerns about regulatory cap-and-trade and related rationing schemes," Barton said. "It further underscores my concerns that we should not follow Europe's course as it creates potential economic disaster for its citizens." Environmentalists concurred with several elements of the report, including its conclusion that European Union officials erred by miscalculating the region's projected emissions and initially giving away all pollution allowances for free. When it became clear the overall cap was higher than actual emissions, the price of carbon allowances crashed. "They ended up with a not very effective regime," said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "President-elect Obama's position that you ought to auction 100 percent of allowances is both analytically and politically right." A big problem of the Clean Development Mechanism, according to the GAO and experts, is it is difficult to know whether the projects funded in developing countries would have happened anyway.

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	December 6, 2008 Saturday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Activists pledge 'all-out war' to block large coal plant  	SCOTT HARPER  	FRONT; Pg. A1  	923 words  	By Scott HarperLiNeBrEaKThe Virginian-PilotLiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists are vowing to block a proposed $6 billion coal-fired power plant in Surry County, saying it would increase air pollution, would contribute to global warming and is not needed.LiNeBrEaKAdvocacy groups including the Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law Center and Chesapeake Climate Action Network are gearing up for what one activist called "all-out war" in response to plans announced this week by the project sponsor, Old Dominion Electric Cooperative.LiNeBrEaKODEC, a nonprofit utility based in Richmond, said it wants to build the plant on about 1,600 acres in the town of Dendron, about 40 miles west of Norfolk, in order to meet anticipated demand for electricity in the near future in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. LiNeBrEaKThe utility has given the plant a name - Cypress Creek Power Station - and said it would burn mostly Appalachian coal to produce 750 megawatts to 1,500 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 400,000 homes. Woody timber wastes, known as biomass, would fuel about 3 percent of the plant.LiNeBrEaKIn comparison, the coal-fired plant under construction in Wise County in Southwest Virginia is expected to produce 585 megawatts and cost about $1. 8 billion. That project, led by Dominion Virginia Power, is being challenged in court by environmentalists.LiNeBrEaK"In the face of an economic recession and mounting threats from climate change, the prospect of introducing an unnecessary $6 billion coal plant is outrageous," said Tom Cormons, a lawyer and campaign coordinator for Appalachian Voices, a group fighting the Wise County plant as well.LiNeBrEaKJeb Hockman, an ODEC spokesman, said the utility expects opposition from environmentalists and understands their concerns, but he stressed that the plant would be built with sophisticated controls to greatly curb emissions such as mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which causes smog.LiNeBrEaK"We're not against any of these groups," Hockman said. "We're willing to listen to them, work with them, to make a better project."LiNeBrEaKCarbon emissions linked to global warming would be captured and stored underground once such technology is developed, he said. Officials estimate the technology, known as carbon sequestration, will not be ready commercially until at least 2020.LiNeBrEaKODEC announced its plans the same week that the Governor's Commission on Climate Change made final more than 100 recommendations for combat ing global warming in Virginia. Chief among them is reducing greenhouse gases - most notably carbon dioxide - by 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKThe commission chairman, L. Preston Bryant, who also is Gov. Timothy M. Kaine's secretary of natural resources, said he knew little about the ODEC plant and that its projected emissions were not part of the panel's calculations.LiNeBrEaKNoting that coal will continue to be an energy source in Virginia and the rest of the world for decades to come, Bryant said, "We very much want coal to be an increasingly smaller and cleaner part of our energy supply.LiNeBrEaK"I personally look forward to hearing what advanced technologies are being proposed for this plant," he added.LiNeBrEaKHockman said ODEC's board of directors has not yet decided yet to build the plant, which is estimated to cost $3 billion to $4 billion but could go as high as $6 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe board selected Surry County as its preferred site after reviewing other locations throughout the mid- Atlantic. The utility also is interested in a site in neighboring Sussex County and will continue to consider it as a Plan B option, he said.LiNeBrEaKIt could take four to six years to build the plant, providing up to 2,200 jobs, Hockman said. ODEC hopes to start operations by 2016, with between 150 and 200 employees running the station.LiNeBrEaKHockman said the utility has sent letters to all residents of Dendron inviting them to an informational meeting from 5: 30 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the local high school. The meeting is open to the public.LiNeBrEaKODEC has not applied for permits from the State Corporation Commission or the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, though Hockman said those applications will be delivered soon.LiNeBrEaKThe utility has sat down with state environmental regulators in a "pre-application meeting" to discuss the complex process ahead, said Bill Hayden, a DEQ spokesman.LiNeBrEaKODEC generates and transmits wholesale electricity to nearly 1. 3 million people in three states. It owns 11. 6 percent of the North Anna nuclear power station outside of Richmond and 50 percent of the Clover power station in Halifax County in Southside Virginia.LiNeBrEaKBefore choosing coal for the Surry location, Hockman said, the utility also considered its own nuclear facility, as well as one fueled by natural gas. But both options proved too expensive and unwieldy.LiNeBrEaK"We're like the Saudi Arabia of coal," he said of America's reserves.

LiNeBrEaKThe Governor's Commission on Climate Change approved a final report, which urged Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) to consider setting a goal of reducing emissions to 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.LiNeBrEaKThe state's current goal, set by Kaine last year, sets a lower standard: By 2025, the state's emissions should be 30 percent less than they would have been, without any action to curb then.LiNeBrEaKThe panel also recommended that utilities be required to find ways to reduce energy consumption by encouraging conservation or the use of more efficient appliances. If left unchecked, the report said, climate change could alter Virginia ecosystems and pose a flooding threat to low-lying areas like Hampton Roads.LiNeBrEaK -- David Fahrenthold LiNeBrEaKPRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY LiNeBrEaKMan Pleads Guilty to Murder Conspiracy LiNeBrEaKA man pleaded guilty in Prince William County this week to charges that he conspired to kill a Manassas man after being recruited by the victim's wife and daughter.LiNeBrEaKThomas R.

The Washington Post 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   Suburban Edition	Brazil's Decision on Deforestation Draws Praise  	Joshua Partlow; Washington Post Foreign Service  	FOREIGN; Pg. A09  	644 words  	Brazil's decision to set a target for reducing deforestation by 70 percent over the next decade to combat climate change was hailed by environmentalists Friday as a significant goal for a major polluting country.LiNeBrEaK"This is an enormously important step," Stephan Schwartzman, an Amazon expert with the Environmental Defense Fund, said by telephone from a climate change conference in Poland. "This is the first time that a major developing country, whose greenhouse gas emissions are a substantial part of the problem, has stepped up and made a commitment to bring down its total emissions. Brazil has set the standard. Now we want to see the U.S. and President Obama come up to it."LiNeBrEaKThe clear-cutting and burning of the Amazon rain forest for cattle and soybean ranches, roads and settlements makes up one of the world's largest sources of the types of gases that contribute to global warming. Since reaching a recent peak of 10,588 square miles of forest destroyed in the Amazon in 2004, deforestation dropped for the next three years, before rising slightly this year to 4,621 square miles, according to data from Brazil's National Institute  for Space Research, which monitors deforestation. LiNeBrEaKBrazil is one of the world's top four emitters of greenhouse gases,  with China, the United States and Indonesia. The destruction of the world's rain forest accounts for about 20 percent of annual greenhouse gas pollution, of which Brazil makes up 40 percent, Schwartzman said.LiNeBrEaKBrazil's plan, announced this week and detailed Friday by Environment Minister Carlos Minc, calls for reducing the annual rate of deforestation to 1,900 square miles by 2017, down from 7,300 square miles, which has been the average rate of deforestation over a recent 10-year period. Minc said reaching this target would prevent 4. 8 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being pumped into the atmosphere, more than the combined commitment of industrialized countries under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaK"Climate change is one of the issues that most worries our civilization these days," Minc said. "Many people used to say it was just the delirium of environmentalists, but after they started to see ice melting on their TVs, they changed their minds."LiNeBrEaKUnder Minc's predecessor, Marina Silva, Brazil set aside millions of acres of forest as protected areas. But in practice, it has been difficult to protect the vast, sparsely populated areas because of pressure from farmers and ranchers, corruption, illegal clearing and a lack of economic incentives.LiNeBrEaKAna Cristina Barros, the Brazilian representative for the Nature Conservancy, called the new deforestation target a "time for celebration."LiNeBrEaK"It is possible for the government to control the Amazon frontier," she said. "It doesn't mean we have to prevent agriculture;  we just need to control it."LiNeBrEaKMinc said he would create an environmental police force of 3,000 people to protect national parks and target illegal loggers. But he said deforestation cannot be solved by police action alone and requires economic incentives for farmers and other residents of the Amazon.LiNeBrEaKFarmers were encouraged that the government's plan included a program to pay those who preserve forest on their property, said Marcelo Duarte Monteiro, executive director of an association of soybean farmers in the western Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. There are 62 million acres of cattle farms in the state, he said, and some of this land can be converted for soybean and other agricultural products.LiNeBrEaK"From our perspective, we are going to be looking at conversion, from pasture into cropland. That, in our opinion, is the way we should be going," he said. "On the other hand, we think it's fair to think of economic incentives for farmers who have forest and are delivering these environmental services, of carbon, of biodiversity, for free. And then everybody's going to be happy."

The Washington Post 	December 6, 2008 Saturday   Suburban Edition	Report Says 2 Global Programs To Curb Emissions Fall Short  	Juliet Eilperin; Washington Post Staff Writer  	FOREIGN; Pg. A09  	612 words  	The Government Accountability Office, in a report issued as negotiators convened the latest round of U.N. climate talks in Poland, has concluded that two key international programs aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions are not getting the job done.LiNeBrEaKThe study, requested by Rep. Joe L. Barton (R-Tex.), ranking minority member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and two other House Republicans, highlights problems in the European Union's emissions trading system and in a U.N. program that allows industrialized countries to offset their domestic greenhouse gas emissions. LiNeBrEaKThe GAO said that Europe's cap-and-trade system had created "a functioning market for carbon dioxide allowances, but its effects on emissions, the European economy, and technology investment are less certain." A separate program that grants offsets to industrialized nations for funding energy projects in the developing world, investigators wrote, has had an "uncertain" effect on carbon emissions, "and its impact on sustainable development has been limited."LiNeBrEaKThe report, released Tuesday, has implications for the United States, which could launch a program to limit greenhouse gas emissions as early as next year. President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are determined to adopt a cap-and-trade system for emissions linked to global warming, and opponents of such a plan seized upon the GAO study as a reason to block it.LiNeBrEaK"This report identifies some of the potential risks and concerns about regulatory cap-and-trade and related rationing schemes," Barton said in a statement. "It further underscores my concerns that we should not follow Europe's course as it creates potential economic disaster for its citizens."LiNeBrEaKBut Yvo de Boer, executive secretary for the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is the host of this week's talks, said yesterday that the GAO report is "not all gloom and doom. There are some positive elements in there. . . . We're in a learning process."LiNeBrEaKHe said the Clean Development Mechanism, the program that lets countries meet part of their emissions reduction targets by funding energy projects in nations such as China and India, "represents one of the only incentives for developing countries to participate in emissions reduction."LiNeBrEaKEnvironmentalists concurred with several elements of the report, including its conclusion that European Union officials erred by miscalculating the region's projected emissions and initially giving away all pollution allowances for free. When it became clear the overall cap was higher than actual emissions, the price of carbon allowances crashed.LiNeBrEaK"They ended up with a not very effective regime," said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "President-elect Obama's position that you ought to auction 100 percent of allowances is both analytically and politically right."LiNeBrEaKOne of the biggest problems facing the Clean Development Mechanism, according to both the GAO and several experts, is that it is difficult to determine whether the projects that industrialized nations are funding in developing countries would have happened anyway.LiNeBrEaK"Congress may wish to consider . . . that the use of carbon offsets in a cap-and-trade system can undermine the system's integrity, given that it is not possible to ensure that every credit represents a real, measurable, and long-term reduction in emissions," the report said.LiNeBrEaKDe Boer said the program has a screening process aimed at ensuring that reductions are meaningful. "It's not as if we're printing money in a garage," he told reporters on a conference call. "There are safeguards and methodologies in place."

Austin American-Statesman (Texas) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   Final Edition	Texans foresee a sunny future in clean energy  	Asher Price American-Statesman Staff  	METRO; Pg. B01  	651 words  	With emissions caps on global warming gases looming in Washington, venture capitalists and policymakers convened at the University of Texas this week to figure out how to make a buck off the new energy economy.LiNeBrEaKThe largely upbeat tenor of the Clean Energy Venture Summit , sponsored chiefly by Austin Energy and the Clean Energy Incubator at UT, was in contrast to comments made just a week before by Gov. Rick Perry, who said an environmentally driven regulatory regime would harm the Texas economy.LiNeBrEaK"Texas doesn't need to play defense; it doesn't need to convince people it's disastrous to regulate carbon," Patrick Basinski , a lawyer at Baker Botts who represents clean technology and renewable energy companies, said in what amounted to an implicit rebuke of the governor's remarks. LiNeBrEaKAlan Bickerstaff , a lawyer at Andrews Kurth , said "companies in Texas have an enormous opportunity to help other companies with their compliance" with carbon dioxide emissions rules. Tech companies could build instruments or engineer software to monitor emissions, for example, he said. "If it happens, it happens," he said about carbon caps. "The question is, how do you capitalize?"LiNeBrEaKThat's a question environmental groups and renewable energy businesses are taking to the Legislature.LiNeBrEaKThis week, a coalition led by Environment Texas asked lawmakers to create incentives to install 4,000 megawatts of solar power by 2020, require utilities to cut energy consumption by 2 percent a year by 2020, improve building codes, improve the efficiency of public buildings and expand efficiency standards for appliances.LiNeBrEaKThough Texas leads the nation in wind power, it gets a minuscule fraction of its electricity from the sun: fewer than 10 megawatts in a roughly 72,000-megawatt system, according to figures from the state.LiNeBrEaKBut Jim Marston , head of the Texas office of Environmental Defense Fund , told the conference that a carbon dioxide cap would promote innovation of new technologies.LiNeBrEaKMeasures filed in the Legislature that encourage alternative forms of energy include:LiNeBrEaK* Preventing homeowner associations from blocking the solar panels being placed atop homes.LiNeBrEaK* Creating a green jobs fund that would assist Texans in job training for "green industries" such as energy-efficient building and retrofitting, biofuels, recycling of materials and manufacturing of sustainable products.LiNeBrEaK* Studying ways to get at least 25 percent of the state's electricity generated by renewables by 2025.LiNeBrEaK* A business tax deduction for businesses that install solar panels.LiNeBrEaK* A sales tax exemption on the purchase of solar panels.LiNeBrEaKSolar power's best chance might be an omnibus bill that state Sen. Kip Averitt, R-Waco , the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee , said he would file that would require more energy efficiency in home building and appliances, and promote renewable energy.LiNeBrEaKAt a panel Thursday titled "How Will Texas Lead in a Lower Carbon World?," Brian Lloyd , a policy adviser to Perry on energy, said the governor's office supports the business tax bill and called homeowner associations' rules that block solar panels "silly."LiNeBrEaKBut more legislative action than that is uncertain.LiNeBrEaKRep. Phil King, R-Weatherford , a member of the Select Committee on Electric Generation Capacity and Environmental Effects , said on the same panel that he does not envision "major legislation this time for new incentive programs." He said switching from conventional power sources like coal would have little impact on global warming and he is unconvinced humans contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaK"Texas could go into the dark ages, and what effect would it have on global warming?" King said on the "Lower Carbon World" panel. "You could turn off all the power plants in Texas, and you'd have a negligible effect, at best, for global carbon dioxide emissions. I don't want Texas to carry the burden for everyone else."LiNeBrEaKasherprice@statesman.com; 445-3643	EMISSIONS (91%); SOLAR ENERGY (90%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (90%); LEGISLATORS (90%); PUBLIC POLICY (90%); VENTURE CAPITAL (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (88%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (78%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (78%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (78%); BIOMASS (78%); VEHICLE EMISSIONS (78%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (77%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (76%); GOVERNORS (76%); ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY (76%); GREEN BUILDING (76%); HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS (75%); SOLAR POWER PLANTS (74%); WIND ENERGY (72%); RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (72%); TAXES and TAXATION (72%); CONSUMPTION (72%); TAX LAW (70%); JOB CREATION (70%); BUILDING and HOUSING CODES (69%); CONSTRUCTION (69%); MAJOR US LAW FIRMS (69%); SALES TAX (63%); TAX DEDUCTIONS (60%); TAX EXEMPTIONS (60%); BIOFUELS (60%); CORPORATE TAX (50%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (67%)  	ANDREWS KURTH LLP (57%); BAKER BOTTS LLP (57%)  	UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS (84%)  			TEXAS, USA (97%) UNITED STATES (97%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved  		RICK PERRY (72%)  														
The Boston Herald 	December 5, 2008 Friday   ALL EDITIONS	Op-Ed;   In new post, Kerry can be comeback kid 	By WAYNE WOODLIEF  	EDITORIAL; Pg. 033  	577 words  	Don't be surprised to see the two Democrats who lost presidential campaigns to George W. Bush - robbed, some would say - lock arms in the fight against global warming at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing sometime soon in 2009.LiNeBrEaKAl Gore is the guru of the Clean Earth movement. With former Foreign Relations chairman Joe Biden's ascendancy to vice president, John Kerry - who, with his wife, co-authored ``This Moment on Earth'' last year - is the new chairman. And he aims to use that bully pulpit to mount a strong new push for international cooperation in saving the environment. LiNeBrEaKAddressing a conference on climate change recently, Kerry knitted the environmental issue to the fight against international turmoil, another treacherous issue his committee must confront. He warned that climate catastrophes ``create huge numbers of refugees . . . and food crises'' that can lead to breeding grounds for terrorists and to global conflicts.LiNeBrEaKAs an approach to the turmoil and tensions in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Kerry proposes a tough-love strategy. The U.S. should set up ``joint operations centers'' in Pakistan to coordinate long-term relief in education, economic recovery and other social needs, and obtain hard proof of progress in return.LiNeBrEaKAnd in Afghanistan, Kerry would hold out a carrot but also wield a big stick. ``We ought to join with the internatonal community to give the Afghans financial support . . . but demand more accountability.'' You know, like where's all that money going.LiNeBrEaKSure, Kerry will have some critics yelling at him about where taxpayer bucks are going. But Long Jawn's hide has grown tougher. Those Swift Boaters threw their toughest torpedoes at him, but he's still standing, still moving.LiNeBrEaKKerry's ambitious agenda for the Foreign Relations Committee includes holding confirmation hearings quickly on President-elect Obama's national security team - including Hillary Clinton for secretary of state, the job Kerry coveted. And Kerry should seek a partnership with Hillary, not a potential one-up rivalry.LiNeBrEaKHe also will demand ongoing oversight on ``ending the war in Iraq responsibly.'' (How's that for diplomatic wording - no timetable set, but urgency clearly implied.) Arms control and nuclear nonproliferation (see Pakistan and India) and keeping close watch on Iran are also high on Kerry's to-do list.LiNeBrEaKAs for global terrorism, Kerry claims that the ``battleground is the hearts and minds of the Muslim world.'' Hearts and minds. That sounds familiar from the Vietnam war, the one in which Kerry fought and then opposed - including an appearance before the committee he now will chair - after our goverment horrendously mismanaged that war.LiNeBrEaKThis time, Kerry believes it can work, if the U.S. works with tribes and other groups in hot-spot countries to resist terrorism, and provides them with security and humanitarian aid, such as it did after the Indonesia tsunami and Pakistan earthquake.LiNeBrEaKIt also would help, given that Kerry calls for winning Muslim ``hearts and minds,'' if he de-stigmatizes the very use of the word. ``Muslim'' came close to being a dirty word during the presidential campaign. Radio loons incessantly referred to Barack Obama as a Muslim (even if he is a Christian). And neither the candidate nor many of his supporters had the stuff to just say, ``What's wrong with being Muslim?''LiNeBrEaKJohn Kerry, from the bully pulpit he now enjoys, ought to be saying that, early and often.LiNeBrEaKTalk back at wzwoodlief@aol.com	US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (90%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (90%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (90%); FOREIGN POLICY (90%); CAMPAIGNS and ELECTIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS (89%); IRAQ WAR (78%); ARMS CONTROL and DISARMAMENT (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (77%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (77%); POLITICS (77%); CLIMATE CHANGE (77%); EMERGING MARKETS (77%); NUCLEAR WEAPONS (73%); TERRORISM (73%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (72%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (71%); REFUGEES (69%); NATIONAL SECURITY (68%); MUSLIMS and ISLAM (67%); VIETNAM WAR (60%); MILITARY WEAPONS (60%); US PRESIDENTS (78%)  					EARTH (79%) PAKISTAN (93%); AFGHANISTAN (93%); UNITED STATES (92%); IRAQ (79%); IRAN (79%); INDIA (79%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Boston Herald Inc.

STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	228 words  	Dec. 5--Bank of America will phase out financing of coal companies that mine largely by removing Appalachian mountaintops, a practice under growing scrutiny for its environmental damage. LiNeBrEaKThe bank quietly posted its new policy online last week, following what it called ongoing talks with coal companies and environmental groups. Spokeswoman Colleen Haggerty said the bank will honor existing financing commitments.LiNeBrEaKLast year, the bank announced a $20 billion initiative to curb energy use and develop new technologies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases linked to climate change.LiNeBrEaKThe Rainforest Action Network, an advocacy group, had pressed Bank of America and another banking giant, Citi, to break ties to practices it deemed environmentally harmful since October 2007.

Contra Costa Times (California) 	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Valley Times letters to the editor  	Letters from our readers  	LETTERS; Opinion  	1149 words  	The University of California is cheating retirees on medical benefits.LiNeBrEaKImagine you contracted for a lifetime annuity. Suddenly, a stranger informs you he will make the annuity payments but can change or eliminate them without consulting you. Would you be unhappy?LiNeBrEaKUC did that to LLNL retirees by transferring liability for their medical benefits to Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS). When I retired, UC told me I would receive the same medical benefits as their other employees. UC paid my medical benefits until Jan. 1, 2008. After LLNS took over LLNL from UC on Oct. 1, 2007, they notified me they were responsible for my medical insurance, and could modify or eliminate it at any time. UC told me absolutely nothing about the change.LiNeBrEaKEffective Jan. 1, 2009, I will receive worse benefits and will pay more for them because LLNS is cutting payments for benefits they provide. Rather than providing cost effective group medical policies, LLNS is providing individual policies. That makes coverage more expensive, especially for retirees.LiNeBrEaKAre you affected? Don't allow UC to cheat you! Sign up to help at home.comcast.net/ ~jrequa/retiree.htm LiNeBrEaKJoe RequaLiNeBrEaKLivermoreLiNeBrEaKNo confusionLiNeBrEaKThis is in response to the "Prop 8 Confusion" letter on Monday Dec. 1.LiNeBrEaKWhat is the confusion about the results of the Prop. 8 vote? You ask about the millions who voted no. What about them? Well folks, what about the millions who did not vote for Barack Obama? It's called the democratic vote, regardless of the reasons for people's choices and whether you agree with the results.LiNeBrEaKStop stamping your feet and making such a fuss. I personally don't oppose personal freedom and personal rights, but I respect a vote for what it is, a collective decision.LiNeBrEaKLet's now focus on more pressing issues, like children going to school hungry as one example. It's time to look at real suffering in this state.LiNeBrEaKAnn RichardsLiNeBrEaKDanvilleLiNeBrEaKTransition teamLiNeBrEaKI understand that Barack Obama want the best ideas for stimulating the American economy.LiNeBrEaKThis idea will not require rasing taxes on anyone! This idea will provide employment for hundreds of thousands of crafts people and will lower unemployment nationwide. We'll need to add more employees in order to fulfill the increased demands for their products.LiNeBrEaKThis idea will lower the annual deficits since there will be more taxes paid into the U.S. Treasury. This idea will reduce the amount of CO2 going into the environment by retiring fossil-fuel plants, which will reduce global warming.LiNeBrEaKThis idea can be implemented in five or six years depending on the availability of skilled workers.LiNeBrEaKQuite simply stated, this idea is to build and operate 100 nuclear power plants, which will essentially double the electrical power on the grid. The new plants, whether P/4Rs or BWRs, generate more than 1,000 megawatts. To answer the critics concern with spent nuclear fuel you'll need to expand reprocessing. Here's where you could help the world economy by signing contracts with the French or anyone else who will reprocess our spent fuel and return the output for our fuel fabrication plants use.LiNeBrEaKOf course you could enlist duPont to build reprocessing plants here in the USA like the Purex plants they built in the 1940s at Hanford. That way we keep control of the plutonium and the rest of the radioactive output.LiNeBrEaKFinally, there are a great number of bright and energetic folks in the current nuclear industry who can put this idea into practice once you let the me know that you want 100 more nuclear power plants.LiNeBrEaKRichard HickmanLiNeBrEaKPleasantonLiNeBrEaKShould know betterLiNeBrEaKSeveral recent letter writers have invoked the idea of "majority rule" regarding the passage of Proposition 8, suggesting that those of us who opposed it have no business challenging it in the courts. Suggesting, basically, that we should sit down and shut up. While that sort of sentiment is appropriate to Communist China, or fundamentalist Iran, or Afghanistan under the Taliban, we as Americans should know better.LiNeBrEaKPeople seem to have forgotten that just because the majority believes something, doesn't make it true, and that just because the majority wants something, doesn't mean they should have it.LiNeBrEaKOne need look no further than the Salem witch trials, or slavery in the south, or Japanese internment during World War II, to realize that sometimes the majority is wrong. Sometimes the majority passes laws which are unjust, unjustifiable, or just plain stupid. The courts exist to protect us, each and every one of us, from whatever tyranny or injustice the majority might choose to inflict.LiNeBrEaKTo dismiss the right of anyone to seek redress from the courts, even in the face of overwhelming majority opposition, is to spit on the best of what this country is supposed to stand for.LiNeBrEaKBrad GreenbergLiNeBrEaKDanvilleLiNeBrEaKDisappointingLiNeBrEaKIt was a disappointing Dec. 2 editorial.LiNeBrEaKWording such as squandering of goodwill, launching a war under false pretenses, ignoring international standards for human behavior are divisive; not respective of a difference of opinion on issues.LiNeBrEaKWhat goodwill you are talking about? You can't measure this goodwill except in terms of comments made by the leaders of countries who had vested interests in keeping the Middle East as status quo.LiNeBrEaKPlease let your readers know when this goodwill will be recaptured, how we will measure it and why it might go away, not as a result to something we do, but merely by the change of administration in a foreign country.LiNeBrEaKUsing this wording the war was launched under false pretenses does not make it true and is calling President Bush a liar, someone who knew the intelligence was wrong and proceeded anyway. There is no evidence Bush used the intelligence unilaterally; it was evaluated by others in the administration and acted upon.LiNeBrEaKRegarding international standards, every country other than the Scandinavian countries have harsher interrogation methods the does the U.S. You don't bother to define what international standards and the comments can only be taken as another empty attack.LiNeBrEaKPhilip R. La ScolaLiNeBrEaKLivermoreLiNeBrEaKCall for civilityLiNeBrEaK"Get over it!" Really? Letters to the editor (Nov. 30, Dec. 1, and prior) have used these words to tell those who voted No on Proposition 8 to get on with their lives and accept the majority vote. If that is what the losing side should do, why have pro-life supporters been fighting the last 35 years to overturn Roe v. Wade? After all, the Supreme Court of our land ruled on the constitutionality of this issue and the majority of American citizens agree with the decision.LiNeBrEaKSurely pro-life supporters stand for their principles or they wouldn't keep fighting for change. Does this now only apply to people who have their viewpoint?LiNeBrEaKCould those with this "get over it" attitude be more understanding and less inclined to throw their victory in the face of the opposition? Civility is an undervalued personality trait that deserves a comeback.LiNeBrEaKPatty BiascaLiNeBrEaKWalnut Creek	LETTERS and COMMENTS (93%); HEALTH INSURANCE (90%); RETIREMENT and RETIREES (89%); INSURANCE POLICIES (78%); TAXES and TAXATION (78%); FACTORY WORKERS (76%); NATIONAL SECURITY (71%); CHILDREN (71%); ECONOMIC NEWS (66%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (66%); POWER PLANTS (63%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (61%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (61%); GLOBAL WARMING (60%); ENERGY and UTILITY CONSTRUCTION (60%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES and TREASURIES (60%); NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS (60%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (60%); EDITORIALS and OPINIONS (59%); PLANT CONSTRUCTION (50%)  		UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (91%)  			SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, CA, USA (92%) CALIFORNIA, USA (92%) UNITED STATES (92%)  	December 6, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Contra Costa Newspapers All Rights Reserved  		BARACK OBAMA (82%)  														
The Daily Globe (Worthington, Minnesota)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Long, cold winter  	Kari Lucin, The Daily Globe, Worthington, Minn.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	653 words  	Dec. 5--WORTHINGTON -- Winter in parts of southwest Minnesota will be chillier and snowier than average, predicted National Weather Service hydrologist Mike Gillispie Thursday at a presentation in downtown Worthington.LiNeBrEaK"I've created my own computer model, looking at 15 different indices (including) weather patterns across the entire globe," Gillispie explained to the Early Riser Kiwanis Club during its meeting at BenLee's.LiNeBrEaKGillispie also drew on about 70 years of area weather history to make his predictions, showing maps and graphs of the tri-state area with large swaths of blue and green. LiNeBrEaKOn temperature maps, the blue indicated predictions of cooler temperatures than the average; and on precipitation maps, the green indicated predictions of more snow than average.LiNeBrEaKGillispie also showed forecasts by month, with December showing average or colder than average temperatures and above average precipitation; January showing colder than average temperatures and average precipitation, and February showing average and colder than average temperatures and above average precipitation.LiNeBrEaK"Not only are we going to be cold, but we are going to be wet," Gillispie said, noting the snow pack would be a good thing for area farmers.LiNeBrEaKThe snow also means colder temperatures, as snow has a tendency to retain cold, Gillispie explained.LiNeBrEaKHe also compared this year's climate patterns to similar patterns from the winter of 1962-'63, 1964-'65, 1971-'72 and 1959-'60 -- which were far more severe than the mild winters of the 1980s and 1990s.LiNeBrEaK"If things play out over the next two months, February's going to be an interesting month," Gillispie said.LiNeBrEaKTo a meteorologist with hydrology training like Gillispie, "interesting" weather usually means bad weather.LiNeBrEaKAlthough 30-, 60- and 90-day forecasts mostly concern average temperatures over big chunks of time, they can still be wrong. Small variations in temperature and conditions can balloon into massive changes in weather outcome, causing rain when sun had been predicted or vice versa.LiNeBrEaKTechnology advances have made weather prediction easier because more information can be tracked and factored into the complex prediction equations and maps.LiNeBrEaK"We are trying to model the atmosphere the best we can," Gillispie said. "Actual observed data is what we seem to be lacking."LiNeBrEaKWeather prediction will never be perfect, he added. "Getting close is kind of our goal."LiNeBrEaKGillispie also discussed global warming, warning his audience that statistics could be used to show anything and that climate patterns tend to change in cycles.LiNeBrEaK"Can man interrupt the cycle? Yes, we can. Are we doing it now? We don't know," Gillispie said, recalling the cold trend in the 1970s that prompted fears of global cooling and an impending ice age. The recent increase in hurricanes may also be cyclical, following a very quiet decade for hurricanes.LiNeBrEaKLocal weather data stretches as far back as the 1890s, but no confirmed data exists further back than that. Weather patterns for the area show higher temperatures in the winter but no increase in summer temperatures.LiNeBrEaKClimatologists have attempted to determine weather history using tree rings and other methods, Gillispie said, but such information isn't complete and should be viewed with caution.LiNeBrEaK"We are a part of the earth, part of the natural cycle," Gillispie warned. "What we do affects the weather, and what the weather does affects us... Are we having an impact? Yes. There is some impact in what we do. Does it hurt to reduce our impact? No."	WEATHER (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); EARTH and ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE (89%); HURRICANES (78%); METEOROLOGY (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (74%); TRENDS (73%)  				Disasters  	MINNESOTA, USA (91%) UNITED STATES (91%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008    	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081205-QG-Long-cold-winter-1205  	QG  												
The Dothan Eagle (Alabama)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	EPA-endorsed 'cow tax' not in the cards  	Greg Phillips, Dothan Eagle, Ala.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	576 words  	Dec. 5--Something stinks on the farm.LiNeBrEaKBut according to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Alabama Cattlemen's Association, the stench doesn't come from cattle, but rather an organization representing some of their owners.LiNeBrEaKThe source of the problem is the American Farm Bureau, which, on Nov. 20, released a statement condemning what it called a "tax on livestock" being proposed by the EPA. LiNeBrEaKAccording to the EPA, no such proposal was ever made.LiNeBrEaKOn July 30, the EPA submitted an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to the federal register in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2007 ruling in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which called for tighter restrictions on greenhouse gases and other pollutants, including those produced by cows.LiNeBrEaKIt set Nov. 28 as the deadline for public feedback on the notice, which the American Farm Bureau apparently misrepresented as the start date for a tax on cattle.LiNeBrEaK"The ANPR does not recommend the use of any particular Clean Air Act authority, regulate any emissions, nor commit to specific next steps to address greenhouse gases," the EPA said in a statement. "EPA is currently reviewing the public comments and does not yet have a timeframe for next steps."LiNeBrEaKYet the AFB's press release, dated Nov. 20, said the EPA planned to propose flatulence fees as high as $175 per dairy cow, $87. 50 per beef cow and $20 per hog.LiNeBrEaKAlabama Cattlemen's Association Executive Vice President Billy Powell says the press release was a prime example of creating a mountain out of a dung heap.LiNeBrEaK"There is no such thing as a cow tax," Powell said. "It was one of those cases where you say you're going to make a snwoman tomorrow, but it's got to snow first. There's nothing in that July bill where they would propose a tax in any form, and I don't even think the EPA has that authority. There was never a proposed tax for livestock emissions of methane."LiNeBrEaKAs for the figures, the EPA isn't responsible.LiNeBrEaK"Those figures are certainly not from the EPA," said Dale Kemery, press officer for the EPA.LiNeBrEaKPowell says he received countless calls from farmers throughout the state who were "terrified" of the potential legislation.LiNeBrEaK"We had folks who thought a tax was going to go into effect on the first of December. It dot way out of kilter," Powell said. "It was just a way to fire up troops to get letters in, but we didn't feel that was necessary."LiNeBrEaKAlabama Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks isn't so sure it was a case of jumping the gun.LiNeBrEaK"If you start talking agriculture in the same sentence as greenhouse emissions, we need to speak up," Sparks said. "We didn't overreact. We've sent a message loud and clear to the EPA that we're not gonna let this pass without a fight. The bottom line is, if something like this passed, we probably wouldn't have beef grown in Alabama. It would be coming from other areas of the world, because our farmers can't afford any additional fees. I don't want to sit around and let other countries put food on my table like they put gas in my vehicles."LiNeBrEaKThe AFB did not return calls on Thursday.

The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Climate impact, rates debated at coal plant hearing  	Dave DeWitte, The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	378 words  	Dec. 5--The rate impact of Alliant Energy's planned coal-burning power plant in Marshalltown on consumers will soon be decided.LiNeBrEaKA hearing on the rate-setting principles for the Sutherland Unit 4 was winding down Thursday after four days of testimony and cross-examination of witnesses before the Iowa Utilities Board. LiNeBrEaKThe plant is only the second new base-load coal plant proposed to the state in recent years. It has generated at least as much opposition as MidAmerican Energy's larger Walter Scott Jr. Energy Center Unit 4 plant, which began production last year.LiNeBrEaKThe effect of the plant's air emissions on climate change was a primary issue for opponents at the initial state hearing that led to the approval of the plant with extensive conditions. The conditions include substantial investments by Alliant in additional wind energy generation, and the mandatory use of biomass to provide part of the plant's fuel.LiNeBrEaKAt this week's hearing, plant opponents continued to oppose its construction, even though the main topic of the hearing was Alliant's request for a 12. 55 percent rate of return on its investment.LiNeBrEaKIntervenors in the case, including Iowa's Office of Consumer Advocate, argued for a lower rate of return. They also have argued that the utility should bear most of the financial risk of complying with any future federal regulations on emissions of carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaK"Iowans could pay 22 percent more for household electricity than they do now," said Tom Sanzillo, a former deputy controller for New York who testified for Plains Justice, a Mount Vernon-based legal advocacy non-profit focusing on environmental matters.LiNeBrEaKThe group said the price increase would come on top of Alliant's previously announced plans to seek a separate 6 percent to 10 percent rate increase in early 2009.LiNeBrEaK-- Contact the writer: (319) 398-8317 or david.dewitte@gazcomm.com	ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (91%); COAL FIRED PLANTS (91%); POWER PLANTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); TESTIMONY (90%); WIND POWER PLANTS (90%); FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS (90%); COAL INDUSTRY (90%); UTILITIES INDUSTRY (90%); WITNESSES (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); NATURAL GAS and ELECTRIC UTILITIES (90%); CONSUMER LAW (78%); ENERGY and UTILITY LAW (78%); WIND ENERGY (78%); BIOMASS (78%); PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS (73%); APPROVALS (72%); PRICE INCREASES (63%); CROSS EXAMINATIONS (77%)  	MCCLATCHY-TRIBUNE INFORMATION SERVICES (63%); ALLIANT ENERGY CORP (58%)  	IOWA UTILITIES BOARD (57%)  	LNT (NYSE) (58%) NYSE:LNT  	NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (58%); SIC4931 ELECTRIC and OTHER SERVICES COMBINED (58%) General  	IOWA, USA (93%); NEW YORK, USA (79%); MIDWEST USA (79%) UNITED STATES (93%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Gazette   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  		20081205-CR-Climate-impact-rates-debated-at-coal-plant-hearing-1205  	CR  												
The Houston Chronicle 	December 5, 2008 Friday   3 STAR EDITION	Driving on sunny side of street;  Swiss teacher builds a solar car, goes around world to set an example 	VANESSA GERA, Associated Press  	A; Pg. 23  	461 words  	POZNAN, POLAND - If a solar-powered car can travel 32,000 miles around the globe without using a drop of oil, perhaps it can be forgiven for not having a cup holder. LiNeBrEaKOr maybe that makes Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer's journey even more remarkable.LiNeBrEaKPalmer rolled into the U.N. climate conference in his solar car Thursday, a man with a mission: to prove that the world can continue its love affair with the car without burning any polluting fossil fuels and still enjoy a smooth ride.LiNeBrEaKWhile about 11,000 delegates sought an ambitious new climate change deal to slash emissions of heat-trapping gases, Palmer was convinced that whatever they agreed upon won't be enough to avert environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaK"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent - and that's what we need for the future."LiNeBrEaKPalmer, a teacher on leave from his job, spent 17 months driving his own creation - a fully solar-powered car built with the help of Swiss scientists - through 38 countries. The two-seater travels up to 55 mph and covers 185 miles on a fully charged battery.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has traveled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," Palmer said, adding that he lost only two days to breakdowns.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the aluminum-and-fiberglass car is still a prototype, and it feels like one.LiNeBrEaKDesigned to be light and efficient, the vehicle is powered by solar cells that it hauls on a trailer.LiNeBrEaKIt has plastic windows, three wheels instead of four and - ironically - no climate control.LiNeBrEaKDesigned like a race car, it can hold two people comfortably and has a radio. It meets all safety standards in Switzerland and has headlights, brakes, blinkers and other standard safety features.LiNeBrEaKBefore his world trip, Palmer, 36, used it for a year to commute to the school in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he taught.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he tried to avoid what he called "dinosaur technology," his steering wheel was from a Renault, his windshield wipers from a Fiat and his wheels were from a Smart car, the Daimler AG two-seater that is ubiquitous in many European cities.LiNeBrEaKHe has given rides to approximately 1,000 people so far, including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg; U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; and on Thursday, U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer.LiNeBrEaKTHINKING AHEADLiNeBrEaKDelegates at the U.N. climate conference in Poznan are seeking a new treaty that would replace the Kyoto Protocol.LiNeBrEaKKyoto expires in 2012 and has required that 37 countries slash emissions of heat-trapping gases by an average 5 percent from 1990 levels.LiNeBrEaKThe goal is for the new treaty to be finalized at the next U.N. climate meeting in December 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Japan Times (Tokyo)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Shonen Knife "Super Group"  	Daniel Robson, Japan Times, Tokyo  	ENTERTAINMENT NEWS  	348 words  	Dec. 5--I have a very old friend who's always hated Osaka rock ambassadresses Shonen Knife. He thinks they're not a serious band -- but he's missing the point. When the world around us is gray and dark, and the news talks of terrorists and financial depression, what we need are songs about slugs, deer biscuits and time warps. LiNeBrEaK"Super Group" is the Knife's 712th album (or thereabouts), and as always it toys with a number of different styles and exudes a playful, irony-free glee. "Slug" tells of a meeting between the band's only remaining original member, Naoko Yamano, and a slimy kitchen invader, over a jangly guitar backing. The evil Sabbath-esque guitar lick on "Muddy Bubbles Hell" is offset by over-the-top lyrics about lava. And "Deer Biscuits" is a rare Knife country song.LiNeBrEaKIn the 27 years since Knife's inception, Yamano's endearingly shaky guitar skills and English-language ability have barely improved. I for one hope they never do. What's most important is that Shonen Knife have imagination and innocence in spades: While the straight-ahead Ramonesy punk edge they embraced in the early 1990s may have become their stock in trade, they never cease to try new things. Why, in a strange twist they even tackle the serious issue of global warming making it harder to do your work, but in such a charming way that the "W" word doesn't really have a chance to stick. Indeed, the next song then suggests ditching work altogether for a guitar workout.LiNeBrEaKIn short: My friend's an idiot. Shonen Knife are one of the most important bands in history, even if the world at large doesn't know it, and this summery record is exactly what we need at the start of a long, cold winter.

Jordan Times (Amman)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	24 local businesses commit to 10 universally accepted principles  	Hana Namrouqa, Jordan Times, Amman  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	636 words  	Dec. 5--AMMAN -- Twenty-four local businesses are now officially registered and committed to the UN Global Compact (UNGC), which promotes 10 universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption.LiNeBrEaKThe UN Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are considered primary agents driving globalisation and can help ensure that markets, commerce, technology and finance advance in ways that benefit economies and societies everywhere, according to the UNGC website. LiNeBrEaKJordan endorsed the UNGC last year becoming one of the first Arab countries to embrace the initiative.LiNeBrEaKIn a ceremony on Wednesday marking the first anniversary of the UNGC launch in Jordan, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in the Kingdom Luc Stevens said only six signatories were registered in October 2007.LiNeBrEaK"Since then, we have witnessed rapid growth and I am happy to announce that there are now 24 Jordanian businesses that are officially registered and committed to the UNGC," he added.LiNeBrEaKMore than 4,700 corporate participants and stakeholders from over 130 countries are members of the initiative, making it the largest corporate citizenship and sustainability initiative in the world, Stevens noted.LiNeBrEaK"The commitment of members to embrace the 10 principles of the Global Compact... makes these businesses important partners to the government of Jordan," he said.LiNeBrEaKHighlighting the importance of committing to the UNGC principles, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Suhair Al-Ali said businesses have adapted to the Global Compact "often finding practical approaches to engage in corporate social responsibility."LiNeBrEaK"Companies are not only engaging in projects and donating resources on the ground, they are also developing practical tools to advance shared concerns and pressing for needed policy changes," added the minister, who was deputising for Her Majesty Queen Rania at the event.LiNeBrEaKCiting examples of steps undertaken by local UNGC members, Suleiman Metouk, managing director of the Global Compact Network in Jordan, said these include "recycling and energy saving practices, reducing water consumption in the paper mill industry and investing in local schools".LiNeBrEaK"Issues such as climate change, human rights, social inequity and corruption are not going to disappear. If anything, the financial crisis around the world has highlighted the need for transparency, efficiency, accountability and responsibility," he noted.LiNeBrEaKTHE TEN PRINCIPLESLiNeBrEaKHuman RightsLiNeBrEaK1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; andLiNeBrEaK2. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.LiNeBrEaKLabour StandardsLiNeBrEaK3.

Knight Ridder Washington Bureau  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Could electric cars charge up struggling automakers?  	By Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	1020 words  	WASHINGTON _ Now that automakers are all busy gearing up to make electric vehicles, consumers should be getting a choice of roomy, speedy, gasoline-free models that charge up at a standard 110-volt socket.LiNeBrEaKSo when will those cars roll out of factories so plentifully that prices drop to what ordinary people can afford?LiNeBrEaKThat was the question at the Electric Drive Transportation Association conference and exhibition in Washington this week, and on Capitol Hill as well, as the Big Three automakers made a pitch for aid. The recession, the credit crunch and the dominance of oil-driven transportation will make it difficult. LiNeBrEaKHowever, automakers see the future _ more gas price spikes, diminishing oil resources, the need to cut carbon dioxide to prevent climate catastrophe. They also see an incoming president, Barack Obama, who as a senator co-sponsored a plan to give tax credits for electric vehicles and now calls for 1 million plug-in, hybrid, made-in-America cars that get up to 150 miles per gallon.LiNeBrEaKAs part of their pitch to Congress, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors promised to push ahead with electric vehicles, even though they're money-losers now. This week, Ford for the first time announced details of what it has in the works for electric-drive vehicles, including a battery-electric van slated commercial fleet use in 2010 and a battery-electric sedan in 2011.LiNeBrEaKJapan is going electric, too. Mitsubishi, for example, plans to launch its small iMiEV electric car next summer and test it in California, Europe and in New Zealand. Nissan plans a Real Car with a 100-mile range that it promises will meet all highway safety tests and offer all the hot gizmos such as GPS and heated seats.LiNeBrEaK"They're all tagging up on the need for greater electrification of transportation," said Brian Wynne, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association. Noting that the Detroit car executives showed up in Washington in hybrids this time, he said: "What it tells me is they get it, they want to transition over."LiNeBrEaKHowever, some of the problems in getting to mass scale and profitability on electric vehicles go beyond automakers' control. The unknown future price of gasoline makes it impossible for would-be buyers to calculate cost savings. Parts suppliers are struggling in a difficult economy. Batteries are still the biggest technological challenge, and the main area where electric vehicles need government help, Wynne said.LiNeBrEaK"We've proven the concept. We've had a lot of product announcements. The question now is: How do we get the volume up fast?" Wynne said. "And the faster we can get to volume and start greening that fleet, the quicker we get to benefits that are captured _ oil displacement, reduction of greenhouse gases and enhanced economic well-being _ stop flowing money overseas, for example, and start investing in jobs here."LiNeBrEaKWhat's really caught on in Washington is the high cost of oil dependency, Wynne said.LiNeBrEaK"It is unacceptable by virtually anyone's estimation for this country to be 97 or 98 percent dependent on oil for the movement of people and goods in this country," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. is sitting on what Wynne calls a "national security asset." During off-peak times, he said, the electric grid could fuel more than 70 percent of the light-duty vehicles on the roads today.LiNeBrEaKAdd the future potential of renewable energy and "smart" grid elements _ like electronic identification that would know whom to bill for electricity no matter where the car was charged _ and electric cars will become cleaner and more convenient.LiNeBrEaKSome of the utilities that are members of the Electric Drive Transportation Association spoke at the conference about how that future is getting closer.LiNeBrEaKMichigan's DTE Energy will be building a lot of wind energy to meet a new state renewable portfolio standard. The utility is testing how electric vehicle batteries could store energy so that the system could use it when needed.LiNeBrEaKPGandE in California also wants to see more electric vehicles run on wind power, said Jill Egbert, who manages its clean transportation section. With "smart charging," the utility could provide incentives to owners to charge their cars at off-peak times.LiNeBrEaKWhat's more, the utility could make arrangements with customers so that when there's a need for power, it could automatically stop their car battery recharging for a time _ without harm to the battery _ and resume it later so that the car would still be ready in the morning. That way, the utility could avoid building more power plants, Egbert said.LiNeBrEaKPGandE also is looking for a lot more wind power, especially because wind is strong for generating power at night, when most vehicles would charge.LiNeBrEaKNissan's plans call for a four-hour charge and a 100-mile range. Other versions of electric vehicles have other ranges on a single charge. Some need a 12-hour charge. High-volt chargers would cut the time to about half an hour.LiNeBrEaKBetter Place, a California-based firm seeking to curb America's dependency on oil, wants to get around the problem of limited range by building lots of stations where car owners would drive in and swap out drained batteries for freshly charged ones.LiNeBrEaKHow people will adapt the use of electric cars to match up with preferences and lifestyles, however, remains to be seen.LiNeBrEaKMark Perry, Nissan's director of product planning, said it might turn out that people use electric vehicles for in-town driving and commutes, and rent something for vacations or weekend trips.LiNeBrEaKWhy own a car with a long range that's rarely needed? Perry asked. "This doesn't make sense anymore."

Lexington Herald-Leader (Kentucky)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	the meter's running70%24%With costs rising, groups urge conservation427%6th  	Andy Mead, The Lexington Herald-Leader, Ky.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	1030 words  	Dec. 5--We've got to change our megawatt-wasting ways.LiNeBrEaKKentucky's energy-efficiency problem, experts say, is that low electrical rates have lulled us into lackadaisical light-switch-flipping.LiNeBrEaKThe average man, woman and child in Kentucky uses 70 percent more electricity than the average American, according to numbers compiled by Robert Ukeily, a Berea attorney who represents environmental groups.LiNeBrEaKThe average Kentucky home uses 24 percent more electricity than the national average. The average Kentucky industrial customer uses 427 percent more -- a testament to the state's history of using local electrical rates to draw aluminum smelters and other energy-hungry industries. LiNeBrEaKSeveral environmental groups -- the Sierra Club, Kentucky Energy Foundation and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth -- invited efficiency guru Glen Cannon to Kentucky this week to meet with executives at East Kentucky Power Cooperative, which is adding to its J.K. Smith Station in Clark County.LiNeBrEaKThe groups argue that East Kentucky Power could avoid the expense and the environmental toll of more coal-fired electricity by aggressively stressing customer-driven efficiency.LiNeBrEaKCompany officials listened to Cannon and later said that although they agree that efficiency is important, they still need the new unit.LiNeBrEaKBut the visit underscores Kentucky's efficiency problem, which also got a lot of attention last month when Gov. Steve Beshear released what he called the state's first comprehensive energy plan.LiNeBrEaKKentucky's electrical rates are low because more than 95 percent of our power is generated by burning coal, which is cheap and plentiful because it comes out of the ground here.LiNeBrEaKWith the cost of power so low, spending money to increase energy efficiency hasn't made economic sense for individual customers.LiNeBrEaKThat is going to change.LiNeBrEaKAs government moves to curb global climate change by constraining the amount of carbon being released into the air -- either through a carbon tax or a program that allows carbon credits to be traded -- the electricity bills arriving in Kentucky mailboxes will increase.LiNeBrEaKAnd that will beget energy efficiency.LiNeBrEaK"As costs go up ... we'll find that more programs become cost-effective," said John H. Davies, acting director of the state Division of Energy Efficiency and Conservation.LiNeBrEaKIn 2006, coal-fired plants in Kentucky put 93 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the environment. That earned the state a ranking of No. 7 in per capita carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKWhen the Brookings Institute conducted a first-of-its-kind study of the per capita carbon footprints of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas earlier this year, Lexington's combination of coal-fired energy, sprawl and lack of attention to efficiency tagged it at No. 100 -- the worst of them all. Louisville was No. 96.LiNeBrEaKBeshear's plan says renewable energy and biofuels will play a role in the future, but it envisions a Kentucky in 2025 in which coal still is the major source of energy.LiNeBrEaKThe plans's first strategy for the future is improving the energy efficiency of the state's homes, buildings and transportation fleet.LiNeBrEaKIf that happens, the plan says, we will still need more energy in 2025, but will need 18 percent less than if we did nothing.LiNeBrEaKThe plan lays out steps for a process to obtain energy efficiency, but few details.LiNeBrEaK"The plan did not go into specific programs because they would have to be evaluated on their cost-effectiveness," Davies said.LiNeBrEaKThe plan envisions an education program to let Kentuckians know the advantages of buying energy-efficient appliances and insulating houses so it takes less energy to heat and cool them.LiNeBrEaKIt also calls for energy efficient resources standards -- a way to measure the effectiveness of efforts to increase efficiency.LiNeBrEaKSeventeen states already have such standards. In Kentucky, they would be used by the state Public Service Commission to require utilities to work with customers to increase efficiency.LiNeBrEaKCannon, the efficiency expert brought in by the environmental groups, said most utilities in Kentucky and elsewhere aren't paying enough attention to what he calls "both sides of the meter." Customers, not just utilities, need to be encouraged to be more efficient, he said.LiNeBrEaKDavies said, however, that utilities in Kentucky have become much more interested in energy efficiency for their customers in the last year or so.LiNeBrEaKThere are some programs already in place, but almost all are voluntary, said Andrew Melnykovych, a spokesman for the PSC.LiNeBrEaKThe most common, offered by Kentucky Utilities and others, are switches attached to air conditions or water heaters. When demand for electricity is high, a remote pager communicates with the switch, slightly altering the way the appliance runs, so that less electricity is is used.LiNeBrEaKIn Louisville, a "smart metering" pilot program puts meters in homes so that people can see just how much electricity they are using.LiNeBrEaK"The idea is that if people have real-time feedback on how much they're using," they'll say 'I'll go turn off a light,'" Melnykovych said.LiNeBrEaKA smaller program allows people to pay lower rates when electrical demand is low, and higher rates when it is high.LiNeBrEaKOn a hot afternoon in July, when air conditioners are running everywhere, a homeowner might decide to turn off some other appliances or put off running the dishwasher.LiNeBrEaKWhat Melnykovych called the "coolest" program is a small number of General Electric employees who have a new generation of energy-efficient appliances -- a refrigerator, water heater or dishwasher -- that talk to the smart meter.LiNeBrEaKIf electrical demand is high on a hot summer day, for example, the meter will let the fridge know that now is not the best time to go into that energy-eating defrost mode.LiNeBrEaKReach Andy Mead at (859) 231-3319 or 1-800-950-6397, Ext. 3319.

Merced Sun-Star (California)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Stimulus, keep it green  	Merced Sun-Star, Calif.  	COMMENTARY  	630 words  	Dec. 5--Whenever California builds freeway lanes, flood-control levees or other major construction projects, the public gets a chance to review the plans and suggest changes to minimize the environmental impact.LiNeBrEaKSuch input has paid off. It has resulted in replanted forests to compensate for trees lost when a levee is rebuilt or widened. Outside pressure has also prompted Caltrans to build storm water basins to prevent highway runoff from damaging creeks or polluting beaches.LiNeBrEaKIn an effort to speed up projects financed by state bond money, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is now proposing to streamline these environmental reviews. LiNeBrEaKAgencies such as Caltrans would have to obtain environmental permits for highway or transit projects, but opportunities for the public or regulators to shape the final product would be severely truncated.LiNeBrEaKIt's easy to understand why the governor wants to fast-track the process.LiNeBrEaKPresident-elect Barack Obama has asked states to identify billions of dollars in public works projects that could be started in the next 120 days.LiNeBrEaKSince California voters have approved more than $50 billion in infrastructure spending in recent years, the state is in a prime position to leverage federal assistance for projects that could create thousands of jobs.LiNeBrEaKIt's also easy to understand why the governor fears that unrestrained application of the California Environmental Quality Act could derail this opportunity. CEQA has a long history of litigious abuse by various interest groups, including unions that want to extract favorable labor terms for certain projects.LiNeBrEaKIt is also fair to say that, when combined with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, CEQA can add years to the time it takes to build even the most beneficial project, such as a transit line or sewage treatment plant.LiNeBrEaKThat said, the governor and lawmakers need to be extremely careful with plans to truncate certain environmental reviews, particularly for new highway lanes.LiNeBrEaKMany of these highway projects were on the books before the governor signed Assembly Bill 32, a state law that requires reductions in greenhouse gases. Some -- such as the Kings-Tulare State Road 196 Expressway -- will likely spur sprawl out toward valuable farmlands, adding to the carbon footprint of the Valley.LiNeBrEaKClearly, the governor and lawmakers need to engage in a balancing act when considering stimulus proposals. Priority should go to projects that don't compromise the state's environmental goals and serve essential immediate needs, such as public safety.LiNeBrEaKTo find this balance, both sides will have to give a little bit.LiNeBrEaKDemocrats and environmental groups will have to drop their insistence that CEQA can't be touched or that state agencies can't contract with "design-build" firms to speed up public works.LiNeBrEaKThe governor and Republicans will have to concede to environmental reviews for highway widenings that might conflict with the state's climate policies.LiNeBrEaKSomewhere in the middle could be a mix of projects that could include new hospitals, revamped levees, road rehabilitation, transit lines, school buildings and infrastructure for affordable housing.LiNeBrEaKTo find this middle ground, lawmakers of both parties need to come out of their corners, find an immediate solution to the state's fiscal crisis and come up with a stimulus package that stimulates green public works.

Mobile Register (Alabama) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   01 EDITION	Solar car completes    trip around world  	VANESSA GERA, Associated Press Writer  	A; Pg. 11  	342 words  	Solar car completesLiNeBrEaKtrip around worldLiNeBrEaKBy VANESSA GERALiNeBrEaKAssociated Press WriterLiNeBrEaKSwiss adventurer shows off vehicleLiNeBrEaKat U.N. conferenceLiNeBrEaKPOZNAN, Poland - If a solar-powered car can drive 32,000 miles around the globe without using a drop of oil, perhaps it can be forgiven for not having a coffee cup holder. LiNeBrEaKOr maybe that makes Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer's journey even more remarkable.LiNeBrEaKPalmer rolled into the United Nations climate conference in his solar car Thursday, a man with a mission: To prove that the world can continue its love affair with the car without burning any polluting fossil fuels and still enjoy a smooth ride.LiNeBrEaKWhile some 11,000 delegates sought an ambitious new climate change deal to slash emissions of heat-LiNeBrEaKtrapping gases, Palmer was convinced that whatever they agreed upon won't be enough to avert environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaK"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent - and that's what we need for the future."LiNeBrEaKPalmer, a teacher on leave from his job, spent 17 months driving his own creation - a fully solar-powered car built with the help of Swiss scientists - through 38 countries. The two-seater travels up to 55 mph and covers 185 miles on a fully charged battery.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has traveled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," he said, adding that he lost only two days to breakdowns.LiNeBrEaKDesigned like a race car, it can hold two people comfortably and has a radio. It meets all safety standards in Switzerland, and has headlights, brakes, blinkers and other standard safety features. Before his world trip, Palmer, 36, used it for a year to commute to the school in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he taught.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he tried to avoid what he called "dinosaur technology," his steering wheel was from a Renault, his windshield wipers were from a Fiat, and his wheels were from a Smart car, the Daimler AG two-seater that is common in European cities.

The New York Times 	December 5, 2008 Friday   Late Edition - Final	A Moving Target  	By KATE GALBRAITH and MATTHEW L. WALD  	Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; THE ENERGY CHALLENGE; Pg. 1  	1459 words  	In hopes of slowing global warming and creating ''green jobs,'' Congress and the incoming administration may soon impose a mandate that the nation get 10 or 15 percent of its electricity from renewable sources within a few years.LiNeBrEaK  Yet the experience of states that have adopted similar goals suggests that passing that requirement could be a lot easier than achieving it. The record so far is decidedly mixed: some states appear to be on track to meet energy targets, but others have fallen behind on the aggressive goals they set several years ago.LiNeBrEaK  The state goals have contributed to rapid growth of wind turbines and solar power stations in some areas, notably the West, but that growth has come on a minuscule base. Nationwide, the hard numbers provide a sobering counterpoint to the green-energy enthusiasm sweeping Washington. LiNeBrEaK  Al Gore is running advertisements claiming the nation could switch entirely to renewable power within a decade. But most experts do not see how. Even with the fast growth of recent years, less than 3 percent of the nation's electricity is coming from renewable sources, excepting dams. LiNeBrEaK  ''I think we are really overselling how quick, how easy and how complete the transition can be,'' said George Sterzinger, executive director of the Renewable Energy Policy Project, a Washington advocacy group.LiNeBrEaK  More than half the states have adopted formal green-energy goals. In many states the policies, known as renewable portfolio standards, are too new to be evaluated. But so far the number of successes and failures is ''sort of a 50-50 kind of affair,'' said Ryan Wiser, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and co-author of a recent report on the targets.LiNeBrEaK  Connecticut and Massachusetts have made their utilities pay for missing targets, and utilities in Arizona and Nevada are lagging. California and New York appear almost certain to miss deadlines that are looming in the next few years. LiNeBrEaK  A few states have met their goals, or even exceeded them. One big success has been Texas, which has capitalized on a wind power boom and already exceeded its 2015 goal. The state gets 4. 5 percent of its electricity from the turbines. New Mexico's big utilities are at 6 percent renewable power, within striking distance of the state's 10 percent goal by 2011. LiNeBrEaK  The structure and aggressiveness of the targets varies widely among states -- some  have been able to meet their goals because they set relatively modest ones in the first place. LiNeBrEaK  For instance, Maine set a goal of 30 percent renewable power by 2000 -- an impressive-sounding target that was essentially meaningless because the state was already getting close to half its electricity from sources that counted against the goal, including dams. (A more recent law requires development of new renewables in Maine.)LiNeBrEaK  In those states that set aggressive goals and have had trouble meeting them, a big hurdle has been building power lines that could transmit the electricity, Mr. Wiser said. Another has been the utilities' inability to secure enough long-term contracts to buy renewable power.LiNeBrEaK  While the country has no shortage of entrepreneurs hoping to build wind turbines and solar arrays, they have been slowed by problems like finding suitable sites, overcoming local political opposition and securing financing. In a few cases, including some in upstate New York, allegations have been made that the developers bribed officials to win approval of their projects.LiNeBrEaK  Many energy experts embrace renewable power standards as a policy mechanism to promote green energy, but with a nationwide standard starting to seem likely once Barack  Obama and the new Congress take power, these experts are ratcheting down expectations of what can be achieved in the near term.LiNeBrEaK  In fact, as utilities seek to meet growing electricity demand, they still turn most often to fossil fuels, rather than the sun or wind.LiNeBrEaK  In New England, the trend is to build more plants that run on natural gas and oil, not wind, said Gordon van Welie, chief executive of the entity that operates New England's power grid.LiNeBrEaK  Similarly in California, John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology in Sacramento, noted that since 2002, when state legislators passed a renewables requirement, the state has installed 16 times as much capacity from natural gas plants than from renewable energy. LiNeBrEaK  Indeed, California is the prime example of a state reaching high and falling short on renewable-power goals. Big utilities there are supposed to get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010, and most are expected to miss that deadline.LiNeBrEaK  San Diego Gas and Electric gets a mere 6 percent of electricity from renewable sources, and the state's other big utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison -- are at 14 and 15. 7 percent, which includes some dams. (The Edison number is a 2007 figure; the other two are more recent.)LiNeBrEaK  Fines for missing the targets can run to $25 million a year, but because of fine print in the regulations, the San Diego utility and Pacific Gas and Electric said they did not expect to incur fines; a representative for Southern California Edison said he was not sure.LiNeBrEaK  The utilities cited a catalog of reasons for falling short. These include stop-and-start federal tax incentives for renewable power, problems finding reliable suppliers among the many young and fragile start-ups in the industry, and difficulty getting transmission lines built and obtaining permits to build solar stations and wind farms.LiNeBrEaK  ''Not every part of the country is equally blessed in terms of having locations for renewables,'' said Debra L. Reed, president and chief executive of San Diego Gas and Electric, which is having trouble getting new transmission lines built to an area with a lot of sunshine.LiNeBrEaK  Moreover, for utilities, the effective goals keep changing. As customers' electricity use rises, so does the amount of renewable-derived electricity the utilities must produce to meet their targets. ''When you're judged based on customer demand, you're always chasing a moving target,'' said Stuart R. Hemphill, vice president of Southern California Edison, which serves a fast-growing population.LiNeBrEaK  New York is another case study. The state gets 19 percent of its electricity from decades-old hydroelectric plants, well above the national average. It wants to add another 5 percentage points with other renewables by 2013, but transmission is a barrier, and the state has not secured nearly enough renewable electricity to meet its goal.LiNeBrEaK  Even in states that are making good progress toward their targets -- like Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin, according to Mr. Wiser -- efforts could be undermined by the still-unfolding credit crisis. The squeeze is falling especially hard on renewable energy projects, because nearly all the expenses for such plants are upfront capital costs financed by debt, with little in ''pay as you go'' costs like fuel.LiNeBrEaK  Small solar start-ups are being hit hard, but bigger companies face challenges, too. The billionaire Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens wants to build a huge wind project in the panhandle of Texas, but even he has been hampered by difficulty borrowing money.LiNeBrEaK  The only mechanism the states have to force utilities into line is to fine them for not meeting the targets, but such costs would ultimately be passed on to electricity customers or company shareholders, neither of whom would look favorably on politicians who imposed such a burden in tough times. LiNeBrEaK  That may explain why most of the penalties issued to date have been modest. In 2006, the payments totaled around $18 million for Massachusetts and $5. 6 million for Connecticut, and virtually nothing in any other state, according to Mr. Wiser's report. LiNeBrEaK  Despite the difficulties, the power quotas have proved politically popular -- so some states are trying to raise their targets. California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is undeterred by the state's difficulty meeting its present target; he signed an executive order recently raising California's target to 33 percent of power from renewables by 2030. Minnesota and Massachusetts have recently raised their quotas.LiNeBrEaK  Experts said that without far more attention to the practical barriers, including the lack of lines to carry power, those new goals will be as difficult to meet as the old ones.LiNeBrEaK  A national standard, if the government decided to impose one, would put an even greater premium on new power lines, because more electricity would need to be moved from parts of the country with abundant wind and sunshine to the great cities where power is consumed.LiNeBrEaK  Mr. Wiser said, ''It comes down in a lot of ways to transmission, ultimately.''

Andrews, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, climbs the tower periodically to make sure the narrow tubes running from the tower to analyzers nearby are properly taking continuous samples of carbon dioxide, methane and a cocktail of other greenhouse gases. LiNeBrEaKThe elevator grumbled to a halt about five minutes later at an 820-foot perch, where the tower's slender shadow stretched into a neighboring sunflower field in the early morning sunlight. "We're able to detect the whole mix of emissions here --what comes from automobile traffic, from industry, from residential development and from agriculture," Andrews said.LiNeBrEaKShe is one of many carbon sleuths, scientists who track and analyze where greenhouse gases come from and where they go over time. Think of it like personal finances. To plan for a sound financial future, it helps to create a budget and keep track of how one is spending money. Similarly, atmospheric scientists need to develop a "budget" for greenhouse gases.LiNeBrEaKA 50-year processLiNeBrEaKBut the atmosphere delivers no monthly statement on greenhouse gas dynamics, so scientists have to tease out the information from disparate and often contradictory sources. The key task is measuring the sources, or emissions, of these planet-warming gases, and the "sinks" --forests, cropland and oceans --that absorb carbon. This budget can then inform intelligent climate-control policy, whether it be managing one forest or shaping national emissions regulations.LiNeBrEaKThe quest to track carbon began 50 years ago, when an atmospheric scientist, David Keeling, cranked up an analyzer and started running the world's first carbon dioxide-measuring observatory, at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Now, thanks to an expanding combination of atmospheric and land-based measuring techniques, scientists can quantify more precisely the sources and sinks of COLiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_0 = "LOOKUP"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_1 = "2"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_2 = ".LiNeBrEaKThe stakes are much higher now than they were 50 years ago. Globally, carbon sinks are being outpaced by rising emissions. Atmospheric instruments like the NOAA-financed network of eight tall towers offer climate scientists a window into processes that control greenhouse gas emissions and sinks.LiNeBrEaKBut uncertainty remains high --often as high as estimates themselves. For instance, researchers think about half of the CO"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_0 = "LOOKUP"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_1 = "2"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_2 = "emitted into the atmosphere gets absorbed by oceans and land, but they do not know precisely where the gases come from and where they end up. This knowledge gap has serious policy implications."LiNeBrEaKNew tools come on lineLiNeBrEaKA vexing challenge is that surface inventory assessments --based on measuring forests, agricultural fields and smokestack emissions, for instance --generally do not agree with atmospheric measurements.LiNeBrEaK"We've got to close the carbon budget to know precisely what's going where," said Kevin Gurney, an assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Purdue University in Indiana.LiNeBrEaKToward that goal, last April, Gurney started the Vulcan Project. Named after the Roman god of fire, Vulcan is a massive database and a graphic map that shows hourly changes of COLiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_0 = "LOOKUP"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_1 = "2"LiNeBrEaKUNMAPPED FIELD subs_2 = "emissions from the burning of fossil fuels in North America by every source, including vehicles, power plants and factories.LiNeBrEaKAnother carbon budget-mapping tool for atmospheric scientists is called CarbonTracker, a data-analysis system begun last year by Pieter Tans, a senior scientist at NOAA's Earth Systems Research Laboratory and his colleagues at NOAA.

The Oregonian (Portland, Oregon) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   Sunrise Edition	Obama's economic jolt to include billions for green jobs  	JOHN M. BRODER, New York Times News Service  	Wire News  	452 words  	SUMMARY: Energy efficiency   | Officials say the plan is likely to feature tax breaks or subsidiesLiNeBrEaKObama's economic jolt to include billions for green jobsLiNeBrEaKJOHN M. BRODER LiNeBrEaKWASHINGTON --President-elect Barack Obama and leaders in Congress are fashioning a plan to pour billions of dollars into a jobs program to jolt the economy and lay the groundwork for a more energy-efficient economy.LiNeBrEaKThe details and cost of the so-called green jobs program are unclear, but a senior Obama aide, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a work in progress, said it would probably include the weatherizing of hundreds of thousands of homes, the installation of so-called smart meters to monitor and reduce home energy use, and billions of dollars in grants to state and local governments for mass transit and infrastructure projects.LiNeBrEaKThe green component of the much larger stimulus plan would cost at least $15 billion a year, and perhaps considerably more, depending on how the projects were defined, aides working on the package said.LiNeBrEaKDuring the campaign, Obama supported a measure to address global warming by capping carbon emissions while allowing emitters to buy and trade pollution permits. He said he would devote $150 billion of the revenue from the sale of those permits over 10 years to energy efficiency and alternative energy projects to wean the nation from fuels that are the main cause of the heating of the atmosphere.LiNeBrEaKBut the Obama adviser who discussed the green energy project said the new president would not await passage of a global warming bill before embarking on the new energy and infrastructure spending. House and Senate supporters of a climate bill said they would continue working on legislative language but did not expect quick action on a cap-and-trade law because of the economic emergency.LiNeBrEaKThat means the green jobs program would not be financed with pollution credits bought by power generators and other carbon emitters, but instead would be added to the budget deficit.LiNeBrEaKCongressional officials working with the Obama administration said the stimulus program was also likely to involve tax breaks or direct government subsidies for a variety of clean energy projects, including solar arrays, wind farms, advanced biofuels and technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants.LiNeBrEaKThe plan could face resistance from fiscal hawks. In 2004, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., almost single-handedly blocked a $100 billion energy package, saying that the billions of dollars in subsidies for ethanol and other alternative fuels were little more than a special-interest boondoggle. The bill was revived a year later at half the cost, and much of the money in it has not been spent.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Bayer pushes energy efficiency  	Rick Stouffer, The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	623 words  	Dec. 5--A national energy program quickly implemented could eliminate the need for most new power plants through the year 2030, the leader of the Natural Resources Defense Council said Thursday.LiNeBrEaKAnd Rick Duke goes farther, adding that 80 percent of the potential energy savings is construction-related -- information that's sweet music to local companies like Bayer Corp.'s MaterialScience unit.LiNeBrEaK"If we are able to unlock efficiency in this country, it will pay for what we need to spend to solve climate problems," said Duke, addressing about 85 people from local companies at a Pittsburgh Technology Council briefing sponsored by Bayer MaterialScience at the Westin Convention Center Hotel, Downtown. LiNeBrEaKDuke's job with the environmental group is to work with corporate and government leaders on adopting clean-energy technologies and practices and convincing them that doing so can positively impact the bottom line.LiNeBrEaK"Bayer MaterialScience has products and technologies that really can lead to energy savings, (dealing with) cars, commercial buildings and housing," said Robert Kumpf, chief administrative officer.LiNeBrEaKAmong the products that Bayer MaterialScience offers to reduce energy usage are foam insulations, lighting solutions and lightweight materials used in most vehicles produced in the United States today, he said.LiNeBrEaKKumpf said Bayer MaterialScience has developed what's called "total lifestyle analysis," which tells a customer how long payback takes when using its polyurethane insulating foams. "It's on the order of months, compared to years," he said.LiNeBrEaKDuke said the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama must put into place next year a so-called "cap-and-trade" program concerning carbon emissions, so that the system is in place by 2012.LiNeBrEaKA cap-and-trade program sets a limit, or cap, on emissions. A source of carbon emissions, like a power plant or steel mill, can design its own strategy to reduce emissions, such as selling or purchasing allowances permitted under the program, installing pollution controls, or implementing efficiency measures. Each source must match allowances to its actual emissions to be in compliance.LiNeBrEaKEven with a cap-and-trade system in place in the United States and the European Union, an audience member questioned Duke on how growing economies such as China, India and Brazil can be brought into compliance.LiNeBrEaKDuke said a strategy is needed to bring the rest of the world into emissions compliance, but the United States "must show leadership in implementing a cap-and-trade program."LiNeBrEaKBut not everyone is in lock-step with those views. Patrick Michaels, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington suggests that global warming alarmists check their thermometers.LiNeBrEaK"According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's research, between the mid-1970s and the late 1990s, the change in temperature was 0. 17 degrees Centigrade per decade, or 1. 7 degrees Centigrade per century," Michaels said. "I don't understand what's the hurry."LiNeBrEaKAddressing carbon cap-and-trading, Michaels said legislation President-elect Obama is in favor of would reduce emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050. "The only way to reduce emissions by 80 percent is to make fossil fuels so expensive no one could afford it."

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (Pennsylvania)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: The International Environmental Kangaroo Court: Courting chaos  	The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  	COMMENTARY  	320 words  	Dec. 5--Environmental extremists are scheming to create a kangaroo court for the judicial branch of their One World Government nightmare.LiNeBrEaKUsing the dubious threat of man-made global warming as an excuse, Stephen Hockman, a deputy High Court judge in Britain, is proposing a green version of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. It would be, in his mind, the supreme legal authority on issues regarding the environment, reports The Telegraph of London. LiNeBrEaKThe U.S. Supreme Court would need a new name.LiNeBrEaKGreens with grievances from around the world would be camped out on the steps of The Hague's courthouse to bring charges against once-sovereign nations (and international companies) that supposedly:LiNeBrEaK--violate international agreements on greenhouse gas emissionsLiNeBrEaK--don't protect endangered speciesLiNeBrEaK--degrade the natural environmentLiNeBrEaK--or don't lead to a healthful environment.LiNeBrEaKThere also would be an international convention to discuss individual "rights to a healthy environment" (whatever that means). And a higher judicial body for persons or nongovernmental organizations to protest against environmental "injustice."LiNeBrEaKThe court would be run by retired judges, climate change experts and public figures -- like Al Gore.LiNeBrEaKImagine Chief Justice Ozone Al passing judgment on the hot air produced by the U.N.

A-2  	230 words  	POZNAN, Poland -- If a solar-powered car can drive 32,000 miles around the globe without using a drop of oil, perhaps it can be forgiven for not having a coffee cup holder. LiNeBrEaKOr maybe that makes Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer's journey even more remarkable.LiNeBrEaKMr. Palmer yesterday rolled into the U.N. climate conference in his solar car, a man with a mission: To prove that the world can continue its love affair with the car without burning any polluting fossil fuels and still enjoy a smooth ride.LiNeBrEaKWhile some 11,000 delegates sought an ambitious new climate change deal to slash emissions of heat-trapping gases, Mr. Palmer was convinced that whatever they agreed upon won't be enough to avert environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaK"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Mr. Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent -- and that's what we need for the future."LiNeBrEaKMr. Palmer, a teacher on leave from his job, spent 17 months driving his own creation -- a fully solar-powered car built with the help of Swiss scientists -- through 38 countries. The two-seater travels up to 55 mph and covers 185 miles on a fully charged battery.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has traveled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," he said, adding that he lost only two days to breakdowns.

Providence Journal-Bulletin (Rhode Island) 	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Hasbro s Goldner named  CEO of Year   		BUSINESS; Pg. 3  	1346 words  	Brian Goldner, chief executive officer at Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc., has been named 2008 MarketWatch CEO of the Year. The financial news outlet said Goldner, building Hasbro s business with such products as Transformers tied to the hit movie, has  radically altered perceptions of the 85-year-old toymaker   as well as its self-image. And he s been at it for less than a year.  Goldner, 45, was selected over four other finalists: Jamie Dimon, of J.P. Morgan; Bill Johnson, of Heinz; Gary Kelly, of Southwest Airlines; and Bobby Kotick, of Activision. CEOs of publicly traded U.S. companies were nominated by the editorial staff of MarketWatch and senior editors narrowed the group to five, who were evaluated in four main areas: stock price; performance for customers; treatment of employees; and corporate-governance initiatives.LiNeBrEaKElectricity grid operator funding challengedLiNeBrEaKConnecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is challenging a request by ISO-New England Inc., the region s nonprofit electricity grid operator, for nearly $100 million in salaries, executive compensation, lobbying and other costs. Blumenthal called the amount excessive and unjustified. He filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking for hearings to contest its budget request for next year. Blumenthal says ISO leaders are already among the highest-compensated grid-operator executives in the nation and accused them of imposing anticompetitive market rules. The organization is based in Holyoke, Mass., and oversees the region s wholesale electricity market.LiNeBrEaKToray Industries gets UN s Humanitarian AwardLiNeBrEaKNorth Kingstown-based Toray Industries Inc., has been awarded the United Nations Association of New York s 2008 Humanitarian Award for the company s efforts to address the impact of global climate change. The award was presented at a dinner in late October at the United Nations, and Sadayuki Sakakibara, president and chief executive officer, accepted for the company, whose material and technology advancements help save energy and resources. The Humanitarian Award was also presented to Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the United Nations, and Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, president of Iceland. Toray produces environment-friendly technologies, including reverse-osmosis membranes used to create clean water, and carbon-fiber composites used for building lighter aircraft that use less fuel and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.LiNeBrEaKKopin Corp. wins military contractLiNeBrEaKTaunton, Mass.-based Kopin Corp. has announced that the Navy, Marine Corps and Army have jointly awarded a three-year, $3. 1-million program to the company for the development of the world s highest-resolution microdisplays for use in future vision systems, including integrated day-night weapon sights and solid-state image intensifiers.  Kopin has a solid history in the development of microdisplays for the U.S. Army s night-vision systems and is a major display supplier for thermal weapon sights and advanced night-vision goggles,  the Army said in a statement. The company produces lightweight, power-efficient, ultra-small liquid crystal displays and heterojunction bipolar transistors for a range of consumer and military applications including digital cameras, personal video eyewear, camcorders, thermal weapon sights and night-vision systems.LiNeBrEaKSimulia ushers in new softwareLiNeBrEaKSimulia, the Providence-based unit of Dassault Syst&egrave;mes, of Paris, has announced the availability of software for simulating the crushing of composite materials. The computer system enables engineers to accelerate the design and evaluation of energy-absorbing composite components and assemblies. Based on technology from United Kingdom-based Engenuity Ltd., the new product provides the ability to study the crushing behavior of composite structures in automobiles, helicopters, aircraft, trains and other transport vehicles to protect occupants and cargo from shock or injury during severe impact. Simulia, with research and development centers in Providence and Suresnes, France, provides sales, services and support through a global network of offices and distributors.LiNeBrEaKNavy research submarine to be deactivatedLiNeBrEaKThe Navy s only research submarine is coming to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, where it will be deactivated after nearly 40 years in service. Shipyard spokesman Gary Hildreth says NR-1, a 150-foot nuclear-powered exploration sub that was launched in 1969, will arrive at the Kittery shipyard sometime this month. Over the years, the vessel has been used to search for artifacts and wrecks and to map the ocean floor. Following the space shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986, the sub helped search for and recover parts of the spacecraft. After the sub is deactivated, it will be transported to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Washington state.LiNeBrEaKHomeowners seeking to shed oil contractsLiNeBrEaKConnecticut officials say hundreds of homeowners are asking for help to get out of costly fuel oil contracts they signed last summer. They locked in prices at a time when crude oil reached up to $147 per barrel and appeared to continue to be rising. Since then, however, prices have dropped by more than half. The state Department of Consumer Protection says it has received 700 complaints so far from consumers. That s in addition to several hundred filed with Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. The homeowners say being forced to honor the higher prices equates to price gouging but Blumenthal and state fuel oil dealers say the contracts are solid.LiNeBrEaKCourt to hear Rastafarian civil suitLiNeBrEaKA Massachusetts Rastafarian man who refused to shave off his beard or cut his hair to comply with Jiffy Lube s employee grooming policy can take his religious discrimination case to trial, the state s highest court has ruled. The Supreme Judicial Court reversed a decision by a Superior Court judge who had dismissed Bobby T. Brown s lawsuit against a franchisee before a trial. Brown worked as a technician at a Hadley Jiffy Lube business owned by F.L. Roberts and Co. Inc. In 2002, after Jiffy Lube put a new grooming policy in place requiring employees who worked with customers to be clean-shaven, Brown told management that his religion does not permit him to shave or cut his hair. Managers then said Brown could work only in lower bays where he did not have contact with customers. Brown filed a discrimination lawsuit in state court in 2006. A Superior Court judge agreed with the company that it had the right to control its public image and found that it would be an undue hardship on the company to grant Brown an exemption from the grooming policy. But the SJC disagreed, saying Jiffy Lube had not proven that no other accommodation was possible for Brown without imposing an undue hardship on the company.LiNeBrEaKBlackwave hires chief technology officerLiNeBrEaKActon, Mass.-based Blackwave Inc., a provider of Internet video storage and delivery systems, has announced that Michael Kilian has joined the company as chief technology officer and will lead its technology strategy and product innovation efforts. Prior to joining Blackwave, he spent the previous 11 years at EMC, during which he led the acquisition, integration and growth of its Centera division as its CTO. During his tenure, Centera defined a new storage category and generated well over $1 billion in cumulative revenue.LiNeBrEaKPowder Ridge ski area to be bought by townLiNeBrEaKThe Middlefield, Conn., Board of Selectmen has voted to buy the bankrupt Powder Ridge ski area. Town officials say they hope to find a partner to revive the ski area. The vote Tuesday night was unanimous to buy all 246 acres of the site from Middlefield Holdings LLC for $2. 25 million. The town will also lease back to Middlefield Holdings, for a nominal $1 per year, the 113 acres that comprise the ski area itself. The lease will run no longer than four years. The town had been outbid for Powder Ridge by Middlefield Holdings in a public foreclosure auction in June. Powder Ridge originally opened in 1960, but closed down its skiing operation two years ago.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   Metro Edition	KAINE BACKS CLIMATE EFFORTS  	By Michael Sluss mike.sluss@roanoke.com (804) 697-1585  	VIRGINIA; Pg. B1  	624 words  	Gov. Tim Kaine on Thursday embraced a new, far-reaching target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and said he will seek additional funding for some environmental initiatives despite Virginia's severe budget shortfall.LiNeBrEaKKaine told his Commission on Climate Change that he will support the panel's recommendation to pursue a more aggressive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions than his administration had originally proposed. The panel recommended that Virginia reduce emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKKaine last year advanced a long-range energy plan that called for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2025, but didn't go beyond that. He praised the panel for setting a further-reaching target. LiNeBrEaK"If we're going to be serious about this climate change issue, we have to go farther," Kaine said in brief remarks to the commission, which worked to put the finishing touches on its report Thursday.LiNeBrEaKKaine said he will wait to receive the 40-member commission's report before deciding how to act on its recommendations. But he signaled he will push a series of environmental and energy-related initiatives during his final year in office, which he called "Renew Virginia Year."LiNeBrEaKAmong other things, Kaine said his administration will continue efforts to improve Chesapeake Bay water quality, increase the amount of land dedicated to open space and evaluate incentives for energy efficiency and conservation.LiNeBrEaKKaine said the state's budget shortfall, which could approach $3 billion, would not keep him from proposing targeted spending for certain environmental programs. The governor will submit a budget plan to lawmakers Dec. 17.LiNeBrEaK"This budget is going to be a tough one," Kaine told the commission. "There are going to be more cuts than adds, but we are adding in a couple of key priorities, and we will add to do some things that will be consistent with your recommendations."LiNeBrEaKThe commission includes state and local government officials, environmental advocates, energy and utility representatives and business leaders.LiNeBrEaKIts report contains more than 100 recommendations in areas such as increasing energy conservation and efficiency, improving transportation efficiency, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, and accelerating research and development of alternative fuels and carbon sequestration technology. It calls for a 19 percent reduction in electricity consumption by 2025.LiNeBrEaKThe report also recommends steps by state and local governments to implement practices such as requiring new buildings to meet "green building" efficiency standards.LiNeBrEaKBlacksburg Mayor Ron Rordam, a member of the panel, said local governments also could follow recommendations to improve land use planning and public transit programs.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental advocates welcomed the commission's support of stronger emissions reduction goals, but faulted the panel for not endorsing specific renewable energy production targets.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately, in the absence of a mandatory standard for renewable energy production, it will remain difficult for Virginia to reach the greenhouse gas emission reductions the commission recognizes are needed," said J.R. Tolbert, field organizer for the advocacy group Environment Virginia.LiNeBrEaKSome business representatives on the panel pointed to other shortcomings, saying the report lacks an adequate assessment of the cost and benefits of its recommendations. Dan Carson, vice president of Appalachian Power Co., noted that the company just implemented a rate increase "driven by environmental investment in our power plants."LiNeBrEaKBut Carson said the panel's recommendations "will be more fully vetted when they get to the governor's office and the legislature."LiNeBrEaKOn the Net: www.deq.virginia.gov/info/climatechange.html	EMISSIONS (91%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); ENVIRONMENTAL LAW (90%); ENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS (90%); BUDGET (89%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (89%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (89%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (89%); CLIMATOLOGY (89%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (89%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (79%); LEGISLATORS (79%); GOVERNORS (79%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (78%); ALTERNATIVE FUEL PROGRAMS (77%); LAND USE PLANNING (76%); ENERGY and UTILITY POLICY (75%); ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION and DISTRIBUTION (75%); GREEN BUILDING (73%); CONSUMPTION (71%); RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT (60%)  					RICHMOND, VA, USA (79%) VIRGINIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 6, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Photo Gov.

The Roanoke Times (Virginia) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   New River Edition	BLACKSBURG PURSUES AGGRESSIVE EMISSIONS REDUCTION PLAN  	By Tonia Moxley tonia.moxley@roanoke.com 381-1676  	CURRENT; Pg. NRV4  	442 words  	Town council is expected to vote Tuesday on a resolution to approve one of the most aggressive greenhouse gas emissions targets to be set by any government agency in the United States. LiNeBrEaK"We adopt this and we have something very big to be proud of," Public Works Director Kelly Mattingly told the council this week.LiNeBrEaK"We're being aggressive. And I'll say more aggressive than the state of Virginia," Mayor Ron Rordam said.LiNeBrEaKVirginia has set a target of reducing the commonwealth's greenhouse gas production to 2000 levels by 2025. But more than 500 local governments across the country have signed the U.S. Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement, a commitment to reduce their emissions to 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.LiNeBrEaKNext week, the Blacksburg council is expected to approve resolution 12-B-08, which commits the town to a significantly more aggressive reduction target of 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.LiNeBrEaKSince signing the U.S. Mayor's agreement two years ago, Blacksburg officials have enthusiastically pursued sustainability milestones.LiNeBrEaKThe town is buying hybrid vehicles for the government fleet, installing more energy-efficient lighting in buildings and street lights and revising zoning and stormwater management regulations to encourage low-impact development.LiNeBrEaKThe town is also incorporating LEED and other low-impact building technologies into construction projects, such as the town hall annex planned for the old Doc Roberts Tire Co. site on South Main Street.LiNeBrEaKSoon after signing the agreement, Rordam assembled a group of residents, developers, business leaders, town staff and Virginia Tech officials and formed the Mayor's Task Force for Climate Protection and Sustainability.LiNeBrEaKSince then, task force member and Tech urban planning professor John Randolph and his students have compiled a comprehensive greenhouse emissions inventory for the town.LiNeBrEaKThe task force is working on reduction strategies and a public education campaign to get businesses and residents involved.LiNeBrEaKIf the council approves the proposed emissions target on Tuesday, the task force will begin work on concrete strategies to reduce government and residents' emissions. A measurement scheme will also be finalized to log the town's overall progress, Mattingly said.LiNeBrEaKWhile the emissions inventory showed that local government operations account for only a fraction of overall emissions, Rordam has emphasized that officials must lead by example on sustainability projects.LiNeBrEaKThat leadership can then point the way for residents who want to participate, but may not know where to begin, the mayor said.LiNeBrEaKTo comment on the proposed resolution, send e-mail to town.council@blacksburg.gov	EMISSIONS (92%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (91%); CITY GOVERNMENT (91%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); MAYORS (90%); REGIONAL and LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); CONSTRUCTION (90%); CITIES (90%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (90%); APPROVALS (90%); OIL and GAS INDUSTRY (78%); ZONING (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (78%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (78%); CITY LIFE (74%); HYBRID VEHICLES (73%); LAND USE PLANNING (72%); GREEN BUILDING (72%); TIRES (66%); COLLEGE and UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (63%); AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (52%); WATER and WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT (51%)  					VIRGINIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 6, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Roanoke Times All Rights Reserved  		MICHAEL MCMAHON (57%)  			BLACKSBURG   											
The San Diego Union-Tribune 	December 5, 2008 Friday 	A CAN-DO PLAN FOR SOLAR;  San Diego proposal eases upfront costs 	Mike Lee, STAFF WRITER  	NEWS; Pg. A-1  	922 words  	San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders will today roll out one of the most aggressive plans in the nation to help homeowners and small businesses buy solar power systems.LiNeBrEaKThe program, authorized in July by a new state law, would allow residents to pay for solar panels through their property tax bills over 20 years. The privately financed loans would carry a fixed interest rate and could be transferred when a property is sold, eliminating a common fear that homeowners have about paying for a system they no longer own.LiNeBrEaK"I don't see any barriers. It's the perfect solution," said Irene Stillings, executive director of the nonprofit California Center for Sustainable Energy in San Diego, which coordinates financial incentives for solar installations. LiNeBrEaK"What this does is give an immediate positive cash flow to the homeowners because they are going to be able to see these incredibly lower utility bills," she said.LiNeBrEaKGenerally, federal and state tax benefits for solar power will apply to properties enrolled in the city's financing program, Stillings said.LiNeBrEaKStarting Jan. 1, the federal government will dramatically raise its incentives: It will provide a 30 percent tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations and cancel the existing $2,000 tax-credit cap for residential projects.LiNeBrEaKSolar experts said San Diego's approach could dramatically increase solar installations because the upfront cost is the biggest hurdle for most individuals considering alternative energy sources. Solar panels commonly cost about $25,000 for a single-family residence.LiNeBrEaKSan Diego officials expect to start with a few hundred homeowners by fall 2009 and later expand to thousands of houses and businesses.LiNeBrEaKBerkeley and Palm Desert have similar programs, but San Diego would be the largest city by far to take advantage of the solar law, AB 811. Advocates of solar power hope San Diego's initiative will start a national trend.LiNeBrEaK"If you guys pull this off, you would have trumped the cities who stand as the most progressive on green issues, like Santa Monica and Davis. That is a very smart move," said Vincent Battaglia, co-owner of Renova Energy Corp., a solar installation company in Palm Desert.LiNeBrEaKThe San Diego City Council has to approve Sanders' proposal, which the mayor intends to bring up for a vote by February. Energy experts said the council is likely to approve the program because its participants will pay all costs, including the city's administrative expenses, through their loans.LiNeBrEaKSanders said informal conversations with council members suggest the plan will pass. The program offers the potential for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming, and the mayor emphasized the possibility of creating jobs in the fast-growing solar industry.LiNeBrEaK"San Diego is a perfect site for this. We have the sun. We also have a community that is very attuned to green issues," Sanders said.LiNeBrEaKAt the nonprofit group Environment California in Sacramento, Bernadette Del Chiaro said local governments must play a major role if California is to meet its long-term goal of putting solar panels on 1 million rooftops.LiNeBrEaKShe wasn't sure why more cities haven't taken advantage of the solar legislation, but she suspects most civic leaders are focused on fiscal crises and haven't made solar power a priority in recent months.LiNeBrEaK"Having a large city like San Diego unveil something like this could help get the ball rolling," Del Chiaro said.LiNeBrEaKWhile San Diego's program lacks many details, Sanders has outlined its framework.LiNeBrEaKThe city would request bids from financial institutions willing to put up money for the solar loans. The winning bid would determine the program's interest rate -- which is about 7 percent in Palm Desert -- and its size.LiNeBrEaKSan Diego officials said they have been approached by two financing companies interested in participating. They said it's a sign of the fiscal markets welcoming what they describe as low-risk loans.LiNeBrEaKWith a financial backer in place, the city would accept applications from people who want to install preapproved solar devices on their homes, and eventually, businesses. As the program matures, it could be expanded to include energy-efficient devices, including those that conserve water.LiNeBrEaKParticipants would agree to be annexed into a special assessment district as the legal mechanism for adding the solar-loan repayment to their property tax bills. Over the two-decade span of their loan, the average cost would amount to about $150 a month.LiNeBrEaK"When homeowners and companies install solar, they are basically paying the upfront cost for 20 to 30 years of energy use. Our home and business finances are really not set up to do that," said Monique Hanis, spokeswoman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group in Washington, D.C.LiNeBrEaK"By offering these financing options, ... (San Diego) is putting solar power in the same paradigm as your current utility bills, where you are basically paying a little bit each month," Hanis said. "This is a great recipe for opening the doors for way more installations."LiNeBrEaKIn the event of a tax default or foreclosure, city officials said, normal rules for tax liabilities would apply.LiNeBrEaK"There is a low-risk component to this. When you have a tax lien on a property, you get paid before the mortgage. The government always gets its money," said Rachel Laing, a spokeswoman for Sanders.LiNeBrEaKOnline: To read the California law authorized in July that enables cities and private lenders to create financing programs for solar power, go to uniontrib.com/more/solarlaw.

The Salt Lake Tribune 	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Farmers angry at EPA call for fine on flatulent cows, hogs  	The Associated Press  	NEWS  	538 words  	Posted: 10: 46 AM- MONTGOMERY, Ala. - For farmers, this stinks: Belching and gaseous cows and hogs could start costing them money if a federal proposal to charge fees for air-polluting animals becomes law. LiNeBrEaK    Farmers so far are turning their noses up at the notion, which is one of several put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases emitted by belching and flatulence amounts to air pollution.LiNeBrEaK    "This is one of the most ridiculous things the federal government has tried to do," said Alabama Agriculture Commissioner Ron Sparks, an outspoken opponent of the proposal.LiNeBrEaK    It would require farms or ranches with more than 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle or 200 hogs to pay an annual fee of about $175 for each dairy cow, $87. 50 per head of beef cattle and $20 for each hog.LiNeBrEaK    The executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation, Ken Hamilton, estimated the fee would cost owners of a modest-sized cattle ranch $30,000 to $40,000 a year. He said he has talked to a number of livestock owners about the proposals, and "all have said if the fees were carried out, it would bankrupt them."LiNeBrEaK    Sparks said Wednesday he's worried the fee could be extended to chickens and other farm animals and cause more meat to be imported.LiNeBrEaK    "We'll let other countries put food on our tables like they are putting gas in our cars. Other countries don't have the health standards we have," Sparks said.LiNeBrEaK    EPA spokesman Nick Butterfield said the fee was proposed for farms with livestock operations that emit more than 100 tons of carbon emissions in a year and fall under federal Clean Air Act provisions.LiNeBrEaK    Butterfield said the EPA has not taken a position on any of the proposals. But farmers from across the country have expressed outrage over the idea, both on Internet sites and in opinions sent to EPA during a public comment period that ended last week.LiNeBrEaK    "It's something that really has a very big potential adverse impact for the livestock industry," said Rick Krause, the senior director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation.LiNeBrEaK    The fee would cover the cost of a permit for the livestock operations. While farmers say it would drive them out of business, an organization supporting the proposal hopes it forces the farms and ranches to switch to healthier crops.LiNeBrEaK    "It makes perfect sense if you are looking for ways to cut down on meat consumption and recoup environmental losses," said Bruce Friedrich, a spokesman in Washington for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.LiNeBrEaK    "We certainly support making factory farms pay their fair share," he said.LiNeBrEaK    U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt, a Republican from Haleyville in northwest Alabama, said he has spoken with EPA officials and doesn't believe the cow tax is a serious proposal that will ever be adopted by the agency.LiNeBrEaK    "Who comes up with this kind of stuff?" said Perry Mobley, director of the Alabama Farmers Federation's beef division. "It seems there is an ulterior motive, to destroy livestock farms. This would certainly put them out of business."LiNeBrEaK    Butterfield said the EPA is reviewing the public comments and didn't have a timetable for the next steps.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER 	December 05, 2008 Friday 	CONTINUITY WE CAN BELIEVE IN  	AMY GOODMAN SYNDICATED COLUMNIST  	EDITORIAL; Pg. B4  	788 words  	President-elect Barack Obama introduced his principal national security Cabinet selections to the world Monday and left no doubt that he intends to start his administration on a war footing. Perhaps the least well known among them is retired Marine Gen. James Jones, Obama's pick for national security adviser. The position is crucial - think of the power Henry Kissinger wielded in Richard Nixon's White House. A look into who James Jones is sheds a little light on the Obama campaign's promise of "Change We Can Believe In."LiNeBrEaKJones is the former supreme allied commander of NATO. He is president and chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for 21st Century Energy. The institute has been criticized by environmental groups for, among other things, calling for the immediate expansion of domestic oil and gas production and issuing reports that challenged the use of the Clean Air Act to combat global warming. LiNeBrEaKRecently retired from the military, Jones has parlayed his 40-year military career into several corporate directorships. Among them is Cross Match Technologies, which makes biometric identification equipment. More germane to Jones' forthcoming role in Obama's inner circle, though, might be Jones' seat as a director of The Boeing Co., a weapons manufacturer, and as a director of Chevron, an oil giant.LiNeBrEaKChevron already has sent one of its directors to the White House: Condoleezza Rice. As a member of that California-based oil giant's board, she actually had a Chevron oil tanker named after her: the Condoleezza Rice. The tanker's name was changed, after some embarrassment, when Rice joined the Bush administration as national security adviser. So now Chevron has a new person at the highest level of the executive branch. With Robert Gates also keeping his job as secretary of defense, maybe Obama should change his slogan to "Continuity We Can Believe In."LiNeBrEaKBut what of a Chevron director high up in the West Wing? Obama's attacks on John McCain during the campaign included a daily refrain about the massive profits of ExxonMobil, as if that was the only oil company out there. Chevron, too, has posted mammoth profits. Chevron also was a defendant in a federal court case in San Francisco related to the slaying, 10 years ago, of two unarmed, peaceful activists in the oil-rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria. On May 28, 1998, three Chevron helicopters ferried Nigerian military and police to the remote section of the Delta known as Ilajeland, where protesters had occupied a Chevron offshore drilling platform to protest Chevron's role in the destruction of the local environment. The troops opened fired on the protesters. Two were killed; others were injured. (Rice was in charge of the Chevron board's public-policy committee when it fought off shareholder resolutions demanding that Chevron improve its human rights and environmental record in Nigeria.)LiNeBrEaKOne of those shot was Larry Bowoto, who, along with the family members of those killed, filed suit in California against Chevron for its role in the attack. Just after Jones was named the national security adviser Monday, a jury acquitted Chevron. Bowoto told me: "I was disappointed in the judgment by the jury. I believe personally the struggle continues. I believe the attorney representing us will not stay put. He will take the initiative in going to the court of appeals." I met Bowoto in 1998, just months after he was shot. He showed me his bullet wounds when I interviewed him in the Niger Delta. I also met Omoyele Sowore, who has since come to the U.S. and started the news Web site SaharaReporters.com.LiNeBrEaKSowore has followed the case closely. Though disappointed, he said: "We have achieved one major victory: Chevron's underbelly was exposed in this town. ... Also there is Nigeria: Protesters won't give up ... this will not discourage anybody who wants to make sure Chevron gives up violence as a way of doing business. American citizens are increasingly protective of their economy. ... Chevron played into fears of ... the jurors, saying these are people (the Nigerian protesters) who made oil prices go through the roof. This was a pyrrhic victory for Chevron. If I was in their shoes, I wouldn't be popping champagne."LiNeBrEaKNigerians know well the power of the military-industrial complex in their own country. While Obama was swept into office promising change, his choice of Marine Gen.

South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	FPL power plant protesters convicted of seven misdemeanor counts: Defense claimed actions necessary because new energy plant a threat  	Jerome Burdi, Sun Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	492 words  	Dec. 5--Defense attorneys tried to convince a jury that seven people broke the law out of necessity, to defend the public against environmental havoc and corporate carelessness. LiNeBrEaKIn the end, a jury decided a crime was just a crime.LiNeBrEaKOn Thursday, seven defendants were convicted of misdemeanor charges of unlawful assembly, trespassing and resisting arrest without violence. The defendants on Feb. 18 illegally protested the construction of a Florida Power and Light Co. power plant in western Palm Beach County.LiNeBrEaKConvicted were Peter Tsolkas, 27; Lynne Purvis, 29; Marc Silverstein, 22; Russell McSpadden, 30; Richard Halsted, 24; Brandon Block, 23; and Noah Wilson, 20. They are members of the groups Everglades Earth First! and the Palm Beach County Environmental Coalition. Their attorneys, assistant public defenders Erich Taylor and Charles Fountain II, argued that the group, who were among about 100 others, acted out of necessity to save the environment.LiNeBrEaKWitnesses testified that the plant would use as much water as 50,000 homes and pollute the habitat of the wetland area, therefore feeding the global warming crisis.LiNeBrEaKTaylor argued the issue went beyond the misdemeanor statutes violated because the defendants believed they were acting to prevent imminent danger.LiNeBrEaKThey had no choice, he said, after being ignored repeatedly through letter writing to lawmakers, public hearings and protests in the "free speech zone" authorities assigned to them near Southern Boulevard.LiNeBrEaKPalm Beach Aggregates sold property to FPL for the plant north of Southern Boulevard near 20-Mile Bend. FPL touts the natural gas-powered West County Energy Center, which is still under construction, as one of the cleanest in the nation.LiNeBrEaK"My clients knew there would be consequences," Taylor said. "They were willing to put their bodies on the line in order to protect the environment."LiNeBrEaKProsecutors Danielle Croke and Laura Burkhart argued that environmental issues were not on trial, but that the way the group made its statement was illegal.LiNeBrEaK"They wanted to cause a major disruption that day," Croke said. "That's how they got the media coverage, and that's how they got their message out."LiNeBrEaKThe protesters are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 2. Punishment could range from fines to jail time because of prior criminal records, Croke said.LiNeBrEaKEleven other protesters have been convicted on some of the same counts in three other trials. Two other protesters are still waiting to face their charges.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Exhibit reveals green roots of a pioneering scientist George Washington Carver  	By Calvin Wilson ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH  	METRO; Pg. C4  	662 words  	Any schoolchild can tell you who George Washington Carver was: The guy who found countless uses for the humble peanut. But an exhibition at the Missouri History Museum reveals that the African-American scientist was not just innovative but also gifted with foresight.LiNeBrEaKCarver, who was born in Diamond, Mo., promoted "green" values long before the future of the planet became a subject for debate. And "George Washington Carver" - which opened last week and includes artifacts, interactive displays and a re-creation of a wagon that served as Carver's mobile classroom - is part of a trend in which museums are addressing green themes. LiNeBrEaK"Carver was talking about 'green technology,' so to speak, a hundred years ago, and I think that's something that surprises people," said Hilary Hansen, project manager for the Field Museum in Chicago, which created the traveling exhibition.LiNeBrEaK"This idea of 'simplify, simplify, reuse, recycle' - these are virtues that he was extolling," she said. "Only now are people really taking it seriously."LiNeBrEaK"Climate Change," an exhibition on global warming at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, comes to the St. Louis Science Center in 2011. Other coming environment-related attractions at the center include the exhibition "Ends of the Earth: From Polar Bears to Penguins" in May and a two-day event in April focusing on green living. And as part of its 75th anniversary, Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry built, and is currently exhibiting, a functioning three-story "green" home.LiNeBrEaKCarver is believed to have been born in 1864, a year before slavery was abolished. He revolutionized agriculture in the South by proposing that alternative crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, be planted instead of cotton, which depleted the soil.LiNeBrEaK"He took his laboratory on the road, and he met with several thousand farmers per week and talked with them about better farming techniques," said Robert Archibald, president of the Missouri Historical Society. "He was particularly concerned with African-American farmers in the South."LiNeBrEaKThe exhibition maintains a balance between biographical information and material that highlights Carver's scientific achievements and humanitarian efforts. Hansen noted that the Field Museum has done "a series of exhibitions on scientists - talking about their work within the context of their personal lives, and their passion and their drive. We did one on Charles Darwin, one on Albert Einstein, and one on (Sigmund) Freud."LiNeBrEaKCarver, who died in 1943, was "the first American scientist that we featured. We knew that he would have a lot of appeal. And it was even better when we had all of these marvelous things, these artifacts, to present as part of the story," Hansen said. In putting together the exhibition, the Field Museum collaborated with Tuskegee University - which was known as Tuskegee Institute when Carver taught and conducted research there - and the National Park Service. Among the more personal items included in "George Washington Carver" are an Underwood typewriter, a guitar and a washboard.LiNeBrEaKThe exhibition's itinerary includes stops at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, the African American Museum in Dallas and the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.LiNeBrEaKArchibald called Carver "one of the real pioneers of developing better plants through selective breeding of plants, as opposed to genetic manipulation. And he understood, clearly, organic farming as a way of increasing production."LiNeBrEaK"Imagine where we would be now if we had listened to Carver a hundred years ago," said Hansen of the Field Museum. "It would be a totally different planet that we live on."LiNeBrEaK'George Washington Carver'LiNeBrEaKWhen: Through March 1; museum hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday to Monday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. TuesdayLiNeBrEaKWhere: Missouri History Museum, Lindell and DeBaliviere in Forest ParkLiNeBrEaKHow much: $10; $8 for students and older adults; $6 for ages 6 to 12; free on TuesdayLiNeBrEaKMore info: 314-746-4599	MUSEUMS and GALLERIES (90%); HISTORY (90%); EXHIBITIONS (90%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (89%); PEANUT FARMING (78%); PROFILES and BIOGRAPHIES (77%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (76%); CLIMATE CHANGE (74%); GLOBAL WARMING (71%); ANNIVERSARIES (50%) {DOC SEPARATOR}  		AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (55%); CHICAGO BEARS (54%)  			CHICAGO, IL, USA (87%); SAINT LOUIS, MO, USA (58%) MISSOURI, USA (90%); ILLINOIS, USA (87%); NEW YORK, USA (79%); EARTH (79%) UNITED STATES (90%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  	PHOTO - George Washington Carver tends to a yucca plant.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri) 	December 5, 2008 Friday   THIRD EDITION	Solar-powered car circles globe to prove a point Teacher wants world to know you can enjoy a smooth ride without burning fossil fuels.  	By Vanessa Gera THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  	NEWS; Pg. A8  	551 words  	POZNAN, Poland - If a solar-powered car can drive 32,000 miles around the globe without using a drop of oil, perhaps it can be forgiven for not having a cup holder.LiNeBrEaKOr maybe that makes Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer's journey even more remarkable.LiNeBrEaKPalmer rolled into the U.N. climate conference in his solar car Thursday, a man with a mission: To prove that the world can continue its love affair with the car without burning any polluting fossil fuels and still enjoy a smooth ride. LiNeBrEaKWhile some 11,000 delegates sought an ambitious new climate change deal to slash emissions of heat-trapping gases, Palmer was convinced that whatever they agreed upon wouldn't be enough to avert environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaK"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent - and that's what we need for the future."LiNeBrEaKPalmer, a teacher on leave from his job, spent 17 months driving his creation - a fully solar-powered car built with the help of Swiss scientists - through 38 countries. The two-seater travels up to 55 mph and covers 185 miles on a fully charged battery.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has traveled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," he said, adding that he lost only two days to breakdowns.LiNeBrEaKTo make his point, he took an Associated Press reporter for a ride Thursday.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the aluminum and fiberglass car is still a prototype, and it feels like one. The car, designed to be light and efficient, runs on an electric engine powered by solar cells that the car hauls on a trailer. It has plastic windows, three wheels instead of four and ironically, no climate control.LiNeBrEaKDesigned like a race car, it can hold two people comfortably and has a radio. It meets all safety standards in Switzerland and has headlights, brakes, blinkers and other standard safety features. Before his world trip, Palmer, 36, used it for a year to commute to the school in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he taught.LiNeBrEaKAlthough he tried to avoid what he called "dinosaur technology," his steering wheel was from a Renault, his windshield wipers from a Fiat and his wheels were from a Smart car, the Daimler AG two-seater that is ubiquitous in many European cities.LiNeBrEaKHe has given a ride to approximately 1,000 people so far, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and on Thursday, U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer.LiNeBrEaKDelegates in Poznan are seeking a new climate treaty that would replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012 and has required that 37 countries slash emissions of heat-trapping gases by an average 5 percent from 1990 levels.LiNeBrEaKAfter a summer in which fuel prices rose uncontrollably, many automakers - from the U.S. to Japan - are investing in research with the aim of producing alternatively powered cars using electricity, biofuel and even hydrogen. Environmental advocates hope the efforts continue even though oil prices have dropped substantially. Palmer says there's no reason car companies couldn't make a much better version of his solar-powered car if they set their minds to it.LiNeBrEaK"These new technologies are ready," he said. "It's ecological, it's economical, it is absolutely reliable. We can stop global warning."

The State (Columbia, South Carolina)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	SCEandG: Loan guarantees not vital: Utility says reactors could be built without federal incentives  	Chuck Crumbo, The State, Columbia, S.C.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	744 words  	Dec. 5--SCEandG could build two new reactors at its Jenkinsville nuclear plant without a loan guarantee from the federal government, a utility executive said Thursday.LiNeBrEaK"The loan guarantees are not necessary for us to go forward," said chief financial officer Jimmy Addison during the state Public Service Commission hearing on the utility's application to expand the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station.LiNeBrEaKIn April, Congress authorized $18. 5 billion in loan guarantees be set aside to encourage construction of nuclear plants. Nuclear power is part of the country's energy plan to reduce greenhouse gases that cause global warming and lessen the need to import foreign oil. LiNeBrEaKSo far, the Department of Energy, which is handling the program, hasn't announced what kind of strings would be attached to the guarantees.LiNeBrEaKAddison said the federal government hasn't provided enough details about the program for SCEandG to decide whether it would be a good deal.LiNeBrEaK"We really don't know what the ground rules are," he said.LiNeBrEaKBut SCEandG, which is partnering with state-owned Santee Cooper on the $9. 8 billion nuclear project, might still take advantage of the loan guarantees, Addison added.LiNeBrEaK"If they are available on reasonable terms, with reasonable administrative requirements, and if they provide a significant benefit to customers and the company," Addison said.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG and Santee Cooper plan to build two 1,117-megawatt reactor units at the Summer nuclear plant along the Broad River, 26 miles northwest of Columbia, in rural Fairfield County. SCEandG and Santee Cooper operate a 966-megawatt reactor unit, which began commercial service in 1984, at the location.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG's share of the nuclear project is 55 percent or about $5. 4 billion.LiNeBrEaKThe current economic crisis and the financial health of SCEandG, the principal subsidiary of Columbia-based SCANA Corp., consumed much of the day's hearing.LiNeBrEaKEarlier, Nancy Brockway, an expert witness for Friends of the Earth, told commissioners she didn't think the timing was right for the utility to borrow billions to build the reactors.LiNeBrEaK"The current financial crisis alone raises serious doubts about the company's ability to secure financing for the project," said Brockway, a utility consumer advocate from Boston.LiNeBrEaKBut Addison tried to knock down those concerns. The financial turmoil has not hindered SCEandG from attracting investors, he said.LiNeBrEaKFor example, in September, the utility proposed to borrow $250 million in 10-year first mortgage bonds at a 6. 75 percent interest rate to fund its operations and increase cash reserves, Addison said.LiNeBrEaKThe response was so favorable that the company decided to go ahead and increase the offer to $300 million and managed to lower the interest rate to 6. 5 percent, Addison said.LiNeBrEaKSCEandG also was able to draw on a $400 million line of credit from a consortium of banks led by Bank of America, Addison said.LiNeBrEaKIf anything, Addison said, the financial crisis is a plus for well-managed operations. "Investors are fleeing to quality," he said.LiNeBrEaKIn uncertain times, investors put their money in companies with "stable and predictable businesses" with "strong balance sheets," Addison explained.LiNeBrEaKAnother benefit the utility has in attracting investors is a state law that allows SCEandG to seek a rate hike to cover interest on the construction loans, utility executives said.LiNeBrEaKAs part of its application for the reactors, SCEandG has proposed a phased, 37 percent increase in electric rates over the life of the project.LiNeBrEaKAddison emphasized the rate increase pays only the interest on the loans.LiNeBrEaK"Interest is all that customers are being required to pay for," Addison said.LiNeBrEaKBeing able to cover interest payments with a rate hike will save about $1 billion on the project, Addison said.LiNeBrEaKDelaying the project until the economy picks up could hurt the state's ability to recover quickly from the recession, Addison said.LiNeBrEaK"If people are going to have jobs, we need to have the energy," he said.LiNeBrEaKThe state hearings are expected to extend until next week. The commission faces a late February deadline to issue a ruling.LiNeBrEaKReach Crumbo at (803) 771-8503.

The Times Union (Albany, New York)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	EDITORIAL: Warning: No ice  	Albany Times Union, N.Y.  	COMMENTARY  	426 words  	Dec. 5--One thought above all on the state's decision not to open the Empire State Plaza skating rink this winter. It could be a lot worse. In fact, it most likely will. LiNeBrEaKNo one will be out of a job because the rink is closed, let's remember. There's other work for the Zamboni driver to do at the state Department of General Services. No one will be forced to go without. This isn't taking food off the table. It shouldn't add to anyone's anxiety about higher taxes, a reduction in more essential state services or about the dismal state of the economy.LiNeBrEaKYou could even go so far as to say that a state government that still has a deficit of $1. 5 billion for this fiscal year and is expected to be $12. 5 billion in the red come April would be irresponsible to be spending $150,000 to keep a tiny ice rink up and running. Not as scandalous as, say, spending $21,000 on rugs for the governor's mansion, but eliminating what the bureaucrats call non-critical agency spending is supposed to mean something.LiNeBrEaKNew Yorkers would best get used to such cost-cutting measures. Come summer, OGS plans to cut back on other amenities, which could include some of the free concerts that draw rather large crowds to the plaza. Other agencies are acting similarly, which is why some state parks, including Schodack Island State Park, aren't open as much as they used to be.LiNeBrEaKNow, as for the 10,000 or so people who used the skating rink in a given winter, there still might be reason to hope. Corporate underwriters already were paying part of the cost of operating the rink. Maybe those companies could pick up the whole bill -- assuming, that is, they're not under pressure to cut back themselves.LiNeBrEaKThose who enjoy ice skating might look to a rainy day fund of sorts. That is, weather cold enough for all the ponds and lakes in and near Albany to freeze. No frills, and non-critical state spending are ample reason for skating the old-fashioned way.LiNeBrEaKIf only global warming can be conquered before New York can resolve its fiscal crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe Issue:LiNeBrEaKThe Empire State Plaza skating rink is a casualty of New York's fiscal crisis.LiNeBrEaKThe Stakes:LiNeBrEaKThe state has little choice.

Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Virginia)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	Kaine favors stronger efforts to address climate change  	Scott Harper, The Virginian-Pilot, Norfolk, Va.  	STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS  	768 words  	Dec. 5--RICHMOND -- Gov. Timothy M. Kaine on Thursday told his Commission on Climate Change that he welcomes its recommendation for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that are deeper than what he originally proposed as part of Virginia's plans to combat global warming.LiNeBrEaKSpeaking to the 30-member commission as it debated the details of its final report, due next week, Kaine said he intends to carry out as many of the panel's recommendations "as we reasonably can." LiNeBrEaKThe governor did not offer a specific agenda but said he would adopt measures against global warming through the state budget process, in legislation to be introduced next year, and through executive orders.LiNeBrEaKKaine, a Democrat entering his final year in office, said 2009 will see a focus on energy and environmental issues through various initiatives that he collectively called "Renew Virginia."LiNeBrEaKDespite a $2. 5 billion deficit that could go higher, the governor said he intends to increase funding for environmental programs next year. He expressed hope that the administration of President-elect Barack Obama, as part of national stimulus package, will provide federal money for infrastructure projects in Virginia such as new rail lines and more public transit.LiNeBrEaKIn addition to creating jobs and minimizing traffic congestion, Kaine said, the projects also would reduce air pollution and emissions of carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming.LiNeBrEaKThe Governor's Commission on Climate Change, after meeting for nearly a year, is recommending that Virginia cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.LiNeBrEaKWhen Kaine formed the panel last year, he asked members to find ways to reduce those emissions by 30 percent by 2025.LiNeBrEaK"Going further makes a lot of sense," Kaine said Thursday.LiNeBrEaKEnvironmental groups praised the commission's bolder recommendation for emission cuts but took umbrage that it did not endorse mandatory requirements that utilities produce electricity with a certain percentage of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind and geothermal.LiNeBrEaKThe commission, instead, is suggesting the state offer incentives for utilities to generate 15 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025. It would be a voluntary target, without penalties for missing the mark.LiNeBrEaK"Unfortunately, in the absence of a mandatory standard for renewable energy production, it will remain difficult for Virginia to reach the greenhouse gas emission reductions the commission recognizes are needed," said J.R. Tolbert, field organizer for Environment Virginia, an advocacy group.LiNeBrEaKAmong its more than 100 recommendations, the commission also is urging the state to mandate energy efficiencies and conservation so Virginians use 19 percent less electricity in 2025, compared with 2006.LiNeBrEaKThe panel -- consisting of scientists, government officials, politicians, engineers, industry executives, utility leaders and environmentalists -- expresses support for developing more nuclear power in Virginia.LiNeBrEaKIt also embraces greener building codes in all counties, cities and towns, and suggests that, in phases, all new commercial offices be required to be constructed with green architecture and energy savings.LiNeBrEaKKaine has been criticized by environmental groups for backing a large, new coal-fired power plant in Southwest Virginia -- a project sponsored by Dominion Virginia Power and expected to emit tons of carbon emissions.LiNeBrEaKHe faced more questions about the plant Thursday.LiNeBrEaK"Coal is going to be part of the equation," Kaine told reporters. His approach, he said, is to invest in clean-coal technology and shut down older, dirtier coal-fired plants.LiNeBrEaKWith the Wise County plant in Southwest Virginia, Dominion is proposing strict limits on mercury and other pollutants and has agreed to switch an older plant in the mountainous region to natural gas, Kaine said.LiNeBrEaKThe climate commission had tried to pass a policy statement that no new coal-fired power plants should be built in Virginia until technology exists to capture carbon emissions. That technology, called carbon sequestration, is at least 12 years away.LiNeBrEaKThe policy was defeated by one vote.LiNeBrEaKScott Harper, (757) 446-2340, scott.harper@pilotonline.com	GOVERNORS (90%); GLOBAL WARMING (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); RENEWABLE ENERGY (89%); ENERGY and ENVIRONMENT (89%); ENVIRONMENT and NATURAL RESOURCES (89%); WIND POWER PLANTS (85%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL and WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS (78%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (77%); ENERGY EFFICIENCY and CONSERVATION (77%); ENVIRONMENTALISM (77%); AIR POLLUTION (77%); LEGISLATION (76%); WIND ENERGY (73%); ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS (73%); AIR QUALITY (72%); URBAN RAIL SYSTEMS (71%); CIVIL ENGINEERING (71%); BUDGET (69%); JOB CREATION (69%); INFRASTRUCTURE (68%); NUCLEAR ENERGY (68%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (67%); CITY LIFE (66%); US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009 (74%)  			NYSE:D  	General  	RICHMOND, VA, USA (92%) VIRGINIA, USA (94%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 Virginian-Pilot   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	TIM KAINE (94%); BARACK OBAMA (55%)  	20081205-VP-Kaine-favors-stronger-efforts-to-address-climate-change-1205  	VP

The Virginian-Pilot(Norfolk, VA.) 	December 5, 2008 Friday    The Virginian-Pilot Edition	Solar car cruises 32,000 miles  	VANESSA GERA  	FRONT; Pg. A13  	364 words  	By Vanessa GeraLiNeBrEaKThe Associated PressLiNeBrEaKPOZNAN, PolandLiNeBrEaKIf a solar-powered car can drive 32,000 miles around the globe without using a drop of oil, perhaps it can be forgiven for not having a cup holder. LiNeBrEaKOr maybe that makes Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer's journey even more remarkable.LiNeBrEaKPalmer rolled into the U.N. climate conference in his solar car Thursday, a man with a mission: to prove that the world can continue its love affair with the car without burning any polluting fossil fuels and still enjoy a smooth ride.LiNeBrEaKWhile about 11,000 delegates sought a climate change deal to slash emissions of heat-trapping gases, Palmer was certain that whatever they agreed on won't be enough to avert environmental disaster.LiNeBrEaK"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20 percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100 percent - and that's what we need for the future."LiNeBrEaKPalmer, a teacher on leave from his job, spent 17 months driving his own creation - a fully solar-powered car built with the help of Swiss scientists - through 38 countries. The two-seater travels up to 55 mph and covers 185 miles on a fully charged battery.LiNeBrEaK"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has traveled all the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," he said, adding that he lost only two days to breakdowns.LiNeBrEaKTo make his point, he took a reporter for a ride Thursday.LiNeBrEaKPalmer lifted a light plastic flap that acts as a door before climbing in. He then flipped a switch to activate the electric engine and set off as the motor hummed softly, much more quietly than a traditional car.LiNeBrEaKFor now, the aluminum and fiberglass car is still a prototype, and it feels like one. Designed to be light and efficient, it is powered by solar cells that it hauls on a trailer. It has plastic windows, three wheels instead of four and no climate control.LiNeBrEaKDesigned like a race car, it holds two people and has a radio. It meets safety standards and has headlights, brakes, blinkers and other standard features. Before his world trip, Palmer, 36, used it for a year to commute to his school in Lucerne, Switzerland.LiNeBrEaKOn the Net:LiNeBrEaKhttp://www.solartaxi.com/	AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY (93%); SOLAR ENERGY (91%); CLIMATOLOGY (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); MOTOR VEHICLES (78%); CLIMATE CHANGE (76%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (76%); AIR QUALITY REGULATION (74%)  		UNITED NATIONS (83%)  			LUZERN, SWITZERLAND (57%) POLAND (88%); SWITZERLAND (57%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  	Alik Keplicz | The Associated Press The U.N.'s Yvo de Boer, left, arrives in a solar taxi Thursday at the Climate Change Conference in Poznan, Poland.

The Washington Post 	December 5, 2008 Friday   Every Edition	The Story Behind the Work  		WEEKEND; Pg. WE20  	197 words  	It's tempting to read a cautionary statement about global warming into Lynn Davis's gorgeous photos of icebergs. And maybe there is one, despite the artist's claims that she's interested in a formal, Buddhist-inspired aesthetic of "emptiness" more than anything. LiNeBrEaKIt's harder to take Edward Burtynsky's claims of message ambiguity seriously. His pictures, according to the show's wall text, "search for a dialogue between attraction and repulsion, seduction and fear." And yet there are subtle signals that the artist doesn't feel entirely neutral about the industrial forces that are often at the heart of his landscapes.LiNeBrEaKTake a look at "Rock of Ages No. 7 (Active Granite Section, Wells-Lamson Quarry, Barre, Vermont)." Sure, we're all torn between our love of granite kitchen countertops and our distaste for despoiling Earth. But could Burtynsky's vertiginous composition -- which places a tiny blue object almost dead center in the middle of the quarry -- be his way of editorializing about man's disregard for our precious natural resources?LiNeBrEaKTake a closer look. That's right. That tiny blue box at the center of the picture is a Port-o-Let brand portable toilet.LiNeBrEaK -- Michael O'Sullivan 	GLACIERS and ICEBERGS (78%); ARTISTS and PERFORMERS (77%); GLOBAL WARMING (73%); RELIGION (57%)  					VERMONT, USA (68%) UNITED STATES (68%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  	IMAGE; By Edward Burtynsky; "Rock of Ages No. 7," above, by Edward Burtynsky, reveals a portable toilet amid granite cliffs in a Vermont quarry.

The Washington Post 	December 5, 2008 Friday   Suburban Edition	Environmental Groups Bash 'Clean Coal' in New Campaign  	Steven Mufson; Washington Post Staff Writer  	FINANCIAL; Pg. D02  	603 words  	The phrase "clean coal" was repeated  by virtually every major presidential candidate this year. Now the battle over what it means is heating up.LiNeBrEaKA group of environmental organizations concerned about global warming, including one backed by former vice president Al Gore, is launching an advertising campaign this week to counter the coal industry's efforts to promote what it calls "clean coal."LiNeBrEaKThe groups will spend millions of dollars on television, newspaper and outdoor ads, the first of which shows a factory door in the middle of a barren landscape and the slogan: "In reality, there is no such thing as 'clean coal.' " The ads say that "there isn't a single commercial coal power plant in America today that captures its global warming pollution." LiNeBrEaKThe campaign is a response to a  $15 million-plus ad campaign that began earlier this year by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry-backed group that has tried to spruce up coal's image.LiNeBrEaKA 30-second television version of the environmental groups' ad will air this weekend on news talk shows. It was shot in the desert of California by Crispin Porter + Bogusky, which is best known for its work as the creator of the 'truth' anti-tobacco campaign, and with companies including Microsoft, Burger King, Volkswagen and Domino's Pizza. The ad shows a man saying, "Let's take a look at a state of the art clean coal facility." He walks through a door leading to a patch of land that is vacant as far as the eye can see. "Amazing," he says, as he looks around. "The machinery is kind of loud," he yells sarcastically into the breeze, "but that's the sound of clean coal technology."LiNeBrEaK"Basically we're saying you've heard a lot about clean coal, let's take a closer look," said Dagny Scott, a vice president  at the ad firm.LiNeBrEaKBut Joe Lucas, vice president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, says that technology has helped coal plants meet environmental standards for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and that it will ultimately help reduce carbon dioxide emissions too. "To use the words of a new resident of Washington, 'Yes we can' invest in the technologies to make us capable of storing and capturing carbon from coal plants," Lucas said.LiNeBrEaKThe ad battle is part of a fight over the future of coal plants, which has been thrown into doubt by Supreme Court and Environmental Protection Agency rulings about carbon dioxide being subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists say that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to retrofit plants with carbon capture equipment once they're built. But coal industry advocates hold out hope.LiNeBrEaKGore, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize for his climate change efforts, and other organizations -- including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and National Wildlife Federation -- are backing the ad campaign to try to  influence public debate on the eve of the new administration. "Coal is not clean. It is one of the leading sources of global warming pollution and the technology does not exist today to make it clean on a widespread scale," Gore said in an interview.LiNeBrEaK"We cannot base the strategy for human survival on the illusions of the industry that coal is already clean. It is not," he added. "What they want to do is build hundreds, if not thousands, of new coal plants on a vague promise that they might be able to retrofit those plants with a technology that does not exist."LiNeBrEaKLucas responded, "If we agree that we are going to need carbon capture, because coal is going to be an important part of our future, then this is what we should be talking about."

The Wichita Eagle (Kansas)  	December 5, 2008 Friday 	KLA members focusing on climate change  	Rick Plumlee, The Wichita Eagle, Kan.  	BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS  	664 words  	Dec. 5--While the debate rages over whether humans affect climate change, it was clearly a hot topic Thursday in the opening session of the Kansas Livestock Association's annual convention.LiNeBrEaKDennis Avery, an agriculture economist who regularly has testified before Congress, weighed in with bushels of statistics and told an audience of about 450 at the Hyatt Regency Wichita, "There is no evidence of man-made causes of global warming."LiNeBrEaKSara Harper, who served on Sen. Sam Brownback's staff and is now a partner in the Clark Group, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that deals heavily with climate change policy, said she didn't claim to be a scientific expert on the subject. LiNeBrEaKBut she said regardless of the viewpoint, it was important for those in the ag industry to be involved with the political discussions.LiNeBrEaK"If you're not at the table," Harper said, "you are on the menu."LiNeBrEaKClimate change and greenhouse gases are significant issues for agriculture because congressional legislation could be forthcoming that would significantly affect agriculture economically.LiNeBrEaK"To just say, 'No, it's not an issue,' buys some time," Harper said.LiNeBrEaKBut she said it won't buy nearly as much time with the Obama administration or with the way the new congressional leadership is lining up.LiNeBrEaKRep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is now chairman of the House's Energy and Commerce Committee, and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., moves into chairwoman for the Senate's Environment and Public Works committee.LiNeBrEaK"That's not good for agriculture," said Harper, a Kansas State University graduate who grew up in Beloit and is the granddaughter of two farming families. "Waxman will take the economy-be-damned approach."LiNeBrEaKBut she told the farmers and ranchers that engaging in the process is "your only choice."LiNeBrEaK"Otherwise," she added, "you leave it in the hands of those who don't care about ag or rural America."LiNeBrEaKAvery told the audience that hearings conducted by Waxman and Boxer are "purely rigged."LiNeBrEaKAfter addressing the KLA members, Avery said he didn't object to going to the table to discuss climate change.LiNeBrEaK"I'm just saying the public relation cards are stacked against you in the political process," said Avery, who is director of the Center for Global Food Issues at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think-tank. "In that room with Barbara Boxer, I never saw a group of more eager regulators."LiNeBrEaKOne legislative possibility is the taxation on amounts of greenhouse gases. A 2006 United Nations report said livestock is responsible for 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in carbon dioxide.LiNeBrEaKBut Avery said there is no global warming, so the issue is a "pointless discussion."LiNeBrEaKHe said the earth warmed from 1850 to 1940, well in advance of the first substantial greenhouse gas emissions attributed to the human population.LiNeBrEaKUsing the Celsius scale, Avery said the earth warmed 0. 5 of 1 degree over that 90-year period. He said the earth warmed 0. 2 from 1940 to 1998, then there was no trend from 1998-2007 and dropped 0. 5 to 0. 6 of a degree from 2007 to the present.LiNeBrEaK"You can't hide temperatures," he said. "There are big snow packs in the United States, and the ski resorts are opening a month early in Europe.LiNeBrEaK"What will be the mood in the Congress three years from now, if the temperatures continue their downward course?"LiNeBrEaKHarper said, "If Mr. Avery is right, he has a lot of convincing to do. It's not the majority view in Washington or in corporate America.LiNeBrEaK"But if he is right, what does it hurt if you get involved in the process?"LiNeBrEaKReach Rick Plumlee at 316-268-6660 or rplumlee@wichitaeagle.com	CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); CONFERENCES and CONVENTIONS (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (89%); EMISSIONS (89%); FARMERS and RANCHERS (89%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); POLITICS (77%); TESTIMONY (77%); FAMILY FARMS (74%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (73%); TAXES and TAXATION (69%); INFRASTRUCTURE (52%)  		KANSAS LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATION (84%)  		General  	KANSAS, USA (94%); CALIFORNIA, USA (92%); DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA (79%) UNITED STATES (94%)  	December 5, 2008  	ENGLISH  			Newspaper  	2008 The Wichita Eagle   	Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News  	BARBARA BOXER (82%); HENRY WAXMAN (68%); SAMUEL BROWNBACK (57%); MICHAEL MCMAHON (56%); BARACK OBAMA (55%)  	20081205-WI-KLA-members-focusing-on-climate-change-1205  	WI
